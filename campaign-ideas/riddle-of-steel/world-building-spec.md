**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the party succumbs to Doom's hypnotic voice THEN they become his thralls
*   IF they answer the Riddle of Steel with "the sword" THEN they rely on weapons alone and may fail
*   IF they answer with "the hand" THEN they understand physical strength matters but it's incomplete
*   IF they answer with "the will" or "the spirit" THEN they grasp that purpose and choice give true strength
*   IF they kill Doom's lieutenants THEN the cult weakens but becomes more desperate
*   IF they free the princess from hypnosis THEN the king becomes a powerful ally
*   IF they kill Doom THEN his cult collapses, but they must face what they've become
*   IF they pursue revenge to the exclusion of humanity THEN they become monsters themselves
