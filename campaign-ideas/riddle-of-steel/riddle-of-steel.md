**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party's village was destroyed by a cult led by the sorcerer Thulsa Doom, their families killed, and they were enslaved in brutal conditions that forged them into weapons. Years later, freed and trained as warriors, they embark on a quest for vengeance against Doom and his snake cult. Along the way they must answer the Riddle of Steel—is true strength found in the sword, the hand that wields it, the will behind the hand, or something else entirely? Their journey will take them from slavery to freedom, from weakness to power, and ultimately force them to choose between revenge and wisdom.

## What "Hard" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Brutal Combat:** Fights are deadly, realistic, and unforgiving. Wounds have lasting consequences.
*   **Psychological Trauma:** The party starts damaged by slavery and loss. These scars affect them.
*   **Powerful Enemies:** Thulsa Doom commands armies, dark magic, and a fanatical cult. Direct assault is suicide.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Revenge may not bring peace. The party must grapple with what they become.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–14 sessions)

A three-act revenge tragedy structure following the path from slavery to vengeance to understanding.

*   **Act I — From Slavery to Freedom (Sessions 1–4):** The party escapes or is freed from brutal slavery. They're trained as gladiators and warriors, gaining strength. They learn Thulsa Doom now leads a snake cult with a princess as his thrall, and they swear revenge.
*   **Act II — The Path of Blood (Sessions 5–10):** They hunt Doom's cult across kingdoms, battling his lieutenants, infiltrating his temples, and discovering his dark sorcery's source. They become legendary warriors but risk losing their humanity.
*   **Act III — The Tower of Serpents (Sessions 11–14):** They assault Doom's mountain stronghold, face his hypnotic power and snake sorcery, rescue the princess, and confront the sorcerer. In the end, they must answer the Riddle of Steel—what gives us strength to endure and triumph?

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 1 — "The Raid"
*   The party's peaceful village is raided by Thulsa Doom's raiders.
*   Families are killed. Children (including the PCs) are enslaved.
*   **Escalation:** Branded and chained, they're sold to brutal masters.

### Session 2 — "The Wheel of Pain"
*   Years of slavery pushing a grinding wheel (or mining, or labor) forge them into iron.
*   They become strong but hollow, machines of survival.

### Session 3 — "The Pit"
*   Trained as gladiators, they fight in brutal pit matches.
*   They learn combat, survival, and the taste of victory and blood.
*   **Escalation:** They earn their freedom through skill and violence. But freedom means nothing without purpose.

### Session 4 — "The Quest Begins"
*   They learn Thulsa Doom leads a powerful snake cult. A king seeks heroes to rescue his daughter, hypnotized by Doom.
*   The party takes the contract—not for gold, but revenge.
*   **Escalation:** They receive intelligence: Doom's cult is vast, with temples, armies, and dark magic.

### Session 5 — "The Snake Temple"

### Session 6 — "The Witch"

*   She reveals Doom transforms into a giant snake and feeds on souls.
*   **Escalation:** The witch warns: "He will test your will. If you waver, he will own you."

### Session 7 — "Doom's Lieutenants"
*   They hunt Doom's key enforcers—warrior priests, assassins, and sorcerers.
*   Each victory brings them closer but also corrupts them with vengeance's darkness.
*   **Escalation:** The cult strikes back. Allies are killed. It becomes personal.

### Session 8 — "The Princess"
*   They learn the king's daughter is not imprisoned—she's willingly with Doom, hypnotized into believing he's a god.
*   Rescuing her will require breaking his mental hold.
*   **Escalation:** To reach her, they must assault the Tower of Serpents.

### Session 9 — "The Riddle of Steel"
*   Their mentor (or a wise NPC) poses the Riddle: "What is the strength of steel compared to the hand that wields it?"
*   The party reflects on whether their strength comes from weapons, their bodies, their will, or something else.
*   **Escalation:** They realize Doom's power is hypnotic faith—his followers' belief makes him strong.

### Session 10 — "The Ascent"
*   They assault the Tower of Serpents—climbing, fighting through cultists and traps.
*   The architecture is serpentine, twisted, filled with snake imagery.
*   **Escalation:** Doom knows they're coming. He waits, confident in his power.

### Session 11 — "The Hypnotic Power"
*   They confront Doom. He doesn't fight—he speaks, his voice dripping with hypnotic power.
*   He attempts to break their wills, make them his servants, convince them revenge is empty.
*   **Escalation:** Party members must resist or fall under his thrall.

### Session 12 — "The Serpent Form"
*   When words fail, Doom transforms into a massive serpent.
*   The battle is brutal—sorcery, giant snake, cultist reinforcements.
*   **Escalation:** The princess begs them to stop harming her "god." They must break his hold on her.

### Session 13 — "Beheading the Snake"
*   Through strength, will, and answering the Riddle of Steel (their bond, their humanity, their choice to endure), they overcome.
*   Doom is beheaded. His cult collapses without their "god."
*   **Escalation:** But killing him doesn't bring back the dead. Was it worth it?

### Session 14 (Optional Extended Campaign) — "What Is Best in Life?"
*   With Doom dead, the party must choose their path: become conquerors, seek peace, continue as mercenaries, or find new purpose.
*   They've answered the Riddle—now they live with the answer.

## Central Conflict

Revenge versus wisdom. The party seeks vengeance for destroyed childhoods and murdered families. Doom represents evil—a predator who destroys innocence and enslaves minds. But the quest for revenge risks making them monsters too. The Riddle of Steel asks: what makes us strong? Is it weapons, physical might, will to endure, or something else (companionship, purpose, choosing humanity over vengeance)? The answer defines their victory's meaning.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Riddle of Steel**
*   Throughout the campaign, NPCs ask variations of this question. The party's answer (through actions and words) shapes the ending.

### 2. **Brutal Combat**
*   Combat is high-damage, tactical, deadly. Healing is slow. Permanent injuries are possible.

### 3. **Hypnotic Resistance**
*   Doom's voice requires Wisdom saves. Failure means obeying his commands or doubting purpose.

### 4. **Slavery Scars**
*   Characters have lasting psychological and physical scars from slavery, affecting roleplay and some mechanics.

### 5. **Reputation System**
*   As they kill cult members and gain fame, their reputation grows—opening doors but also attracting enemies.

### 6. **The Dark Side**
*   Track how brutally the party pursues revenge. Excessive cruelty has consequences for their humanity.

### 7. **"What Is Best in Life?"**
*   A recurring question. Different answers (crushing enemies, freedom, companionship, peace) reflect character growth.
