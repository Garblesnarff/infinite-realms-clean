# The Waking Reverie - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Reality mixed with fantasy—medieval knights on smartphones, dragons in parking lots, castles made of office buildings. Hayao Miyazaki meets Terry Gilliam meets everyday life.

**Color Palette:**
- **Reality**: Normal, slightly desaturated
- **Daydreams**: Oversaturated, vivid, almost too bright
- **Mixed Zones**: Color bleeding, fantasy hues invading mundane spaces
- **Fantasy Core**: Every color at maximum intensity
- **Grounded Areas**: Aggressively grey and brown

## Art Direction
- **Manifested Daydreams**: Slightly translucent at first, solidifying
- **The Bleeding**: Visual static where reality/fantasy meet
- **Imaginary Friends**: Too perfect, slightly off-putting in realism
- **Ideal Selves**: Heroic lighting, dramatic poses, suspiciously flawless
- **The City**: Impossible juxtapositions—wizard tower next to 7-Eleven

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Whimsical meets ominous—childlike wonder with underlying wrongness
**Manifestation Theme:** Reality "tearing" sound, fantasy instruments bleeding in
**Tyrant Theme:** Too beautiful, seductive, like perfect film score
**Grounded Theme:** Mundane sounds amplified—typing, footsteps, traffic
**Voice Direction:**
- **Dreaming Tyrant**: Warm, welcoming, sounds like your favorite character
- **First Dreamer**: Speaks like narrating their own story
- **Imaginary**: Childlike but slightly unsettling
- **Commander Realist**: Flat affect, no emotional inflection

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Manifestation**: Daydream becoming solid, awe and terror
- **The Bleeding City**: Panoramic shot of impossible overlap
- **Meeting Ideal Self**: Mirror confrontation
- **Fantasy Core**: Everything perfect, therefore wrong
- **The Choice**: Visual split between grey reality and colorful fantasy
