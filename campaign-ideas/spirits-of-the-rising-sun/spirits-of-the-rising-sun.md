The balance between kami (divine spirits) and yokai (supernatural creatures) is collapsing as Amaterasu, goddess of the sun, has withdrawn to her celestial cave, plunging Japan into spiritual twilight where yokai run rampant and the underworld Yomi bleeds into the mortal realm. The party, descendants of legendary onmyoji and shrine maidens, must journey across mythical Japan encountering yokai, appeasing angry kami, and investigating why Amaterasu has hidden herself away. They'll discover that Susanoo's ancient rebellion has new followers seeking to overthrow the heavenly order, and must restore harmony between heaven, earth, and the spirit world before eternal darkness falls.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act journey through Japanese mythology restoring cosmic balance.

*   **Act I — The Stolen Sun (Sessions 1–4):** Amaterasu withdraws into her cave, causing spiritual imbalance. Yokai multiply and cause chaos.

*   **Act II — The Yokai Realm (Sessions 5–8):** They journey through hidden Japan—the realm where yokai dwell—seeking allies and information. They learn that followers of Susanoo are deliberately sowing chaos to weaken Amaterasu's authority and prepare for a new divine rebellion.

## Central Conflict

Divine authority versus spiritual freedom. Amaterasu's withdrawal represents rigid order—necessary for stability but limiting for growth. Susanoo's rebellion represents freedom—necessary for change but risking chaos. The party must restore balance where kami, yokai, and humans coexist with mutual respect rather than hierarchical dominance. They determine whether the divine order continues unchanged, transforms to allow more freedom, or finds middle ground where all three realms maintain harmony through cooperation rather than submission.
