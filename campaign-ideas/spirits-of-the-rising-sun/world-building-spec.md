*   **Content:** When Amaterasu withdraws to her celestial cave plunging Japan into spiritual twilight, the party—descendants of onmyoji and shrine maidens gifted with spiritual sight—must investigate why the sun goddess has hidden herself while navigating yokai politics, appeasing angry kami, and stopping followers of Susanoo from using the chaos to overthrow the heavenly order and unleash Yomi's dead upon the mortal realm.

*   **The Yokai Market** - Neutral ground where spirits trade without mortal interference

*   **The Floating Bridge of Heaven** - Pathway between mortal realm and Takamagahara
*   Each location represents different aspects of Shinto mythology and spirit-human relationships

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Amaterasu remains hidden THEN spiritual twilight strengthens yokai and weakens kami authority
*   IF Yomi's gates stay open THEN the dead flood the mortal world causing mass corruption
*   IF kami are not properly venerated THEN they become angry and withdraw blessings
*   IF yokai are killed without understanding THEN innocent spirits are destroyed and balance suffers
*   IF the party shows proper respect THEN yokai and kami offer aid and information
*   IF Susanoo's faction wins THEN divine authority collapses but spiritual freedom increases
*   IF pure order is maintained THEN stability is preserved but growth and change are stifled
*   IF the sacred dance is performed THEN Amaterasu can be lured from her cave
*   IF purification rituals are performed correctly THEN corrupted kami and spirits can be restored
*   IF divine conspirators are exposed THEN Takamagahara faces civil conflict
*   IF humans, yokai, and kami cooperate THEN unprecedented balance becomes possible
*   IF honor and duty are maintained THEN reputation with all factions improves
*   IF taboos are broken (eating in Yomi, disrespecting sacred spaces) THEN supernatural curses follow
*   IF legendary artifacts are gathered THEN divine-level power becomes accessible
*   IF balance is restored THEN the party may be chosen as permanent mediators between realms
