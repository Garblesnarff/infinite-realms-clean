# Creative Brief: Spirits of the Rising Sun

## Art Style: Japanese Mythology meets Edo Period Aesthetics

Blend of historical feudal Japan with Shinto mythology and yokai folklore—ukiyo-e art influences, torii gates, paper lanterns, and impossible spirit realms. The aesthetic celebrates Japanese artistic traditions while rendering kami and yokai with supernatural beauty and strangeness.

### Core Principles:
*   **Historical Foundation:** Authentic feudal Japanese culture, architecture, and spiritual practices
*   **Supernatural Layering:** Spirits and yokai exist alongside humans in liminal spaces
*   **Artistic Symbolism:** Use ukiyo-e and traditional Japanese art motifs meaningfully
*   **Harmony and Balance:** Visual representation of wa (harmony) between realms

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Mortal Japan uses natural colors—wood browns, paper whites, indigo blues, rice greens, cherry blossom pinks. Takamagahara (heaven) uses radiant golds, celestial blues, and divine whites suggesting solar glory. Yomi uses grays, blacks, and deep purples suggesting death and sorrow. The spirit realm uses saturated, slightly unnatural colors—fox-spirit orange, oni red, tengu black, kappa green. Sacred spaces glow with spiritual blue-white light. Night scenes use moonlight silver and lantern gold.

**Character Design:** Mortals wear period-accurate clothing—kimono, hakama, samurai armor, shrine maiden garb. Kami are divine and radiant—Amaterasu in solar robes, Susanoo in storm-tossed garments, Tsukuyomi in lunar silver. Yokai follow traditional designs—kitsune as foxes with multiple tails, tengu with crow features and mountain monk clothing, oni with horns and clubs, yuki-onna in white kimono with frost patterns. The party gradually acquires spiritual markings, blessed items, and yokai-touched features.

**Environments:** Villages show thatched roofs, torii gates, stone gardens, and rice paddies. Shrines use vermilion paint and sacred architecture. Takamagahara is impossible divine beauty—floating islands, golden palaces, celestial gardens. Yomi is oppressive underground darkness with rotting vegetation and wandering spirits. The spirit realm overlaps mortal Japan—same locations but stranger, with yokai visible and natural laws bent. Mountains are sacred spaces where realms overlap.

**Composition:** Use ukiyo-e-influenced framing—flat color blocks, strong outlines, asymmetric composition. Frame spirits and kami with traditional artistic conventions. Use torii gates and doorways as threshold imagery. Divine beings use radial composition suggesting spiritual power. Combat references samurai tradition and kabuki theater—dramatic poses frozen in action. Use seasonal imagery symbolically—cherry blossoms for transience, snow for death and purity, autumn leaves for change.

## Voice

Elegant narrator channeling Japanese oral tradition—formal, respectful of spirits and duty, aware of transience and mono no aware (sadness of things). Uses honorifics and proper forms of address. Speaks with understanding that harmony between realms requires respect and balance, that yokai are neither purely good nor evil, and that duty often conflicts with desire. Role: A storyteller recounting legends where mortals and spirits coexisted, knowing that maintaining harmony requires constant effort and that honor matters more than victory.

## Music Style

Traditional Japanese instrumentation meets orchestral arrangements—shakuhachi flute, koto, shamisen, taiko drums, biwa combined with modern epic scoring. Divine themes use bright, ascending melodies with ethereal vocals suggesting heaven. Yokai music uses playful or eerie traditional instruments depending on spirit type. Combat uses aggressive taiko drumming referencing martial tradition. Yomi uses sparse, sorrowful instrumentation suggesting death and loss. Spiritual moments use shakuhachi flute and koto creating contemplative atmosphere. The sacred dance uses festival music—flutes, drums, and bells in celebration. Overall tone is mystical and balanced—spirits coexisting with humans, duty balanced with compassion, order harmonized with freedom.
