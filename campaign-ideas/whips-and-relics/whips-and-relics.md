## Central Conflict

Knowledge versus power. The party believes artifacts belong in museums where they can be studied and appreciated by all. The Thule Society seeks to weaponize ancient magic for conquest. Personal greed from rival archaeologists adds complications. The party must decide if some knowledge is too dangerous to preserve, or if understanding history is always worth the risk.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Archaeological Knowledge**
*   Intelligence (History) and Wisdom (Insight) checks to decipher traps, read ancient languages, and identify artifact properties.

### 2. **Death Trap Navigation**
*   Complex skill challenges involving Investigation, Perception, Acrobatics, and clever problem-solving. Success minimizes damage; failure triggers cascading hazards.

### 3. **Whip Combat**
*   Whips can disarm, trip, swing from chandeliers, grab ledges. Special maneuvers available to those proficient.

### 4. **Chase Sequences**
*   Structured action sequences using vehicles, animals, or foot pursuit with environmental hazards and creative solutions.

### 5. **Artifact Power**
*   Recovered artifacts grant temporary powers but come with terrible curses or attract dangerous attention.

### 6. **Museum Reputation**
*   Returning artifacts to the university increases funding, resources, and academic prestige. Losing them to rivals decreases support.

### 7. **"It Belongs in a Museum"**
*   When a character invokes this phrase while protecting an artifact for the greater good, they gain inspiration and temporary heroism.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Pulp adventure with clear heroes and villains. Action-packed with moments of archaeological wonder. Death traps are dangerous but escapable with wit and daring. Nazis (or fascist fantasy equivalent) are unambiguously evil and never given sympathetic portrayals. Romance subplots add complications. The supernatural is real but rare and terrifying when encountered. Fedoras and leather jackets strongly encouraged.
