### **World-Building Specification Brief: Whips and Relics**

**1. Core Concept:**
Archaeologist-adventurers race against a fascist empire's occult division to recover legendary artifacts from ancient civilizations, navigating death traps and moral questions about whether some discoveries are too dangerous to preserve.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the ancient civilizations whose ruins are explored (fantasy equivalents of Egyptian, South American, Biblical)
*   Explain the rise of the Thule Society and their occult research division
*   Describe the academic world and competitive nature of archaeology
*   Write about the legendary artifacts and their true historical/mythological origins
*   Detail the university's museum and its role in preserving heritage
*   Explain why certain artifacts contain genuine supernatural power

**3. Factions:**
*   **The University** (Major) - Academic home base, museum, funding source, bureaucratic obstacles
*   **The Thule Society** (Major) - Fascist occult division, seeks artifacts as weapons, ruthless and efficient
*   **Independent Archaeologists** (Minor) - Rivals, grave robbers, fortune seekers, varying morality
*   **Local Communities** (Minor) - Descendants of ancient civilizations, guardians of sacred sites
*   **Black Market Collectors** (Minor) - Wealthy buyers of stolen antiquities
*   **Religious Orders** (Minor) - Protect certain sacred artifacts from secular hands

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Professor Marcus Ravenwood, Colonel Klaus Von Schrader, Elsa Richter, Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, Belloq

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party triggers temple trap without preparation THEN cascading death trap sequence begins
*   IF Thule Society obtains artifact first THEN they begin weaponization rituals
*   IF party opens ark/uses artifact unworthily THEN divine wrath destroys the unfaithful
*   IF artifacts returned to museum THEN university increases funding and support
*   IF rival archaeologist is shown mercy THEN they may become reluctant ally later
*   IF Professor Ravenwood is captured THEN forced to translate ancient texts for villains
