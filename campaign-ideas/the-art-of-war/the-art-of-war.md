# The Art of War
*Master the thirteen chapters—supreme excellence is subduing enemies without fighting*

## Campaign Overview

Sun Tzu (544-496 BCE), legendary Chinese military strategist and author of the most influential military treatise ever written, serves the Kingdom of Wu during the Spring and Autumn Period. This campaign follows his rise from wandering philosopher to supreme general, implementing revolutionary strategic principles, fighting brilliant campaigns, and codifying timeless wisdom into thirteen chapters that will be studied for 2,500+ years.

The party serves as Sun Tzu's staff officers, implementing his unconventional strategies, gathering intelligence, conducting psychological operations, and demonstrating that victory comes from planning, positioning, and knowledge—not mere courage or numbers. This is campaign of intellect over force, where proper preparation makes battle unnecessary, and the highest skill is taking enemy's territory intact.

## Core Themes
- **Knowledge is Victory**: Know enemy, know self, never defeated
- **Deception and Intelligence**: All warfare is based on deception
- **Strategic Positioning**: Win before fighting begins
- **Economic Warfare**: Logistics decide wars
- **Adaptability**: Water shapes to vessel; strategy shapes to situation
- **Enlightened Leadership**: Treat soldiers as beloved children

## Key NPCs

**Sun Tzu (Sun Wu)**: Philosopher-general. Calm, calculating, values knowledge over courage. Ruthless when necessary (concubine execution), merciful when strategic. Legacy > glory.

**King Helü of Wu**: Ambitious, willing to learn, employs Sun Tzu despite unconventional methods. Dies in battle.

**Fu Chai (Helü's son)**: Impetuous, emotional, rejects Sun Tzu's counsel. Pride leads to kingdom's destruction.

**King Goujian of Yue**: Defeated enemy who endures humiliation, rebuilds, eventually destroys Wu. Patient, strategic—Sun Tzu's mirror.

**Wu Zixu**: Senior Wu general, initially skeptical of Sun Tzu, becomes student. Loyal to point of suicide.

**Spies**: Network of agents (local, inside, double, expendable, living)—Sun Tzu's real army.

## Major Locations

**Wu Capital (Suzhou)**: Sun Tzu's base, court politics
**Chu Capital (Ying)**: Captured through indirect approach
**Yue Territory**: Southern kingdom, eventual Wu's destroyer
**Battlefields**: Boju (major victory), others demonstrate principles
**Academy**: Where Sun Tzu teaches, writes

## Unique Mechanics

### The Art of War Principles
- **Know Enemy/Self**: Intelligence gathering unlocks strategic options
- **Deception**: Feints, false intelligence, psychological operations
- **Terrain Mastery**: High ground, water, distances affect tactics
- **Economic Warfare**: Supply lines, costs, speed vs. attrition
- **Indirect Approach**: Avoid enemy strength, attack weakness
- **Leadership**: Troop morale depends on treatment

### Intelligence System
- **Five Spies**: Different types for different information
- **Information**: More valuable than troops
- **Double Agents**: Turn enemy spies

### Winning Without Battle
- **Psychological Victories**: Enemy surrenders before fighting
- **Diplomatic Isolation**: Remove allies
- **Economic Strangulation**: Cut supplies
- **Strategic Positioning**: Occupy key ground

### The 13 Chapters
- Each chapter = Principle learned through campaign
- Player choices determine chapter content
- Final text reflects campaign experience

## Victory Conditions

**Historical Legacy**: Write influential *Art of War*, teachings survive millennia
**Strategic Perfection**: Win all campaigns with minimal casualties
**Kingdom Secured**: Prevent Wu's eventual fall to Yue
**Student Success**: Disciples spread teachings effectively

## Defeat Conditions

**Death in Battle**: Violates own principles (supreme general doesn't risk self)

**Rejected Strategy**: King ignores advice, Sun Tzu becomes irrelevant

---

**Note**: Historical Sun Tzu's existence debated (might be composite figure), but *Art of War* is real and enormously influential. Campaign explores strategic thinking, where victory comes from preparation and knowledge, not just fighting. Perfect for players who enjoy tactics, espionage, and intellectual challenge over hack-and-slash.
