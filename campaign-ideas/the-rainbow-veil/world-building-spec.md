# World-Building Specification: The Rainbow Veil

## The Prismatic Veil - Mechanics

### How the Veil Works
- Waterfall's massive mist creates perpetual rainbow
- Each color band is consciousness of one Keeper
- Seven together form barrier between mortal realm and Spirit Lands
- Water flow = power source; less water = weaker Veil
- At full flow: Perfect separation, safe border crossings at designated points
- At reduced flow: Uncontrolled phasing, tears in reality

### The Seven Keepers - Complete Profiles

**Red (Passion)**: Fire elemental bound to water, embodies vitality and fury. Trial requires feeling deeply without losing control—walk through memory of greatest rage without attacking vision-enemies. Gift: Channel passion into power without being consumed.

**Orange (Joy)**: Light spirit who creates beauty from chaos. Trial: Find something to celebrate in darkest moment—party shown vision of loved ones dying, must find reason for joy anyway. Gift: Happiness independent of circumstances.

**Yellow (Wisdom)**: Solar aspect, illuminates truth. Trial: "What is light?"—riddle with no answer, must accept wisdom sometimes means knowing what you can't know. Gift: See truth through deception.

**Green (Balance)**: Nature spirit embodying equilibrium. Trial: Mediate war between two spirit factions (both have valid grievances). Must find compromise satisfying both. Gift: Sense imbalance, restore harmony.

**Blue (Sorrow)**: Water's sadness, every tear ever shed. Trial: Experience the Veil's sorrow—feel loss of every being that died crossing. Must grieve without breaking. Gift: Strength through acknowledged pain.

**Indigo (Mystery)**: Twilight being, exists between known and unknown. Trial: Enter darkness with no light, no map, no certainty. Trust intuition. Gift: Navigate uncertainty with confidence.

**Violet (Spirit)**: Pure consciousness barely tethered to physical. Believes separation causes suffering. Trial: "Why maintain the barrier?"—must convince Violet, or accept their argument. Gift: Transcendence or merger (depending on resolution).

## The Phasing Village - Detailed State

**Current Condition**:
- Exists 50% in mortal realm, 50% in Spirit Lands
- Buildings flicker between solid stone and ethereal crystal
- Inhabitants age erratically (some aging faster, some slower, some not at all)
- Can interact with both realms but fully belong to neither
- Food from mortal realm tastes like ash; spirit food provides no nutrition
- Slowly being pulled entirely into Spirit Lands (40-day window)

**Inhabitants' Divisions**:
- **Return Faction** (60%): Want rescue, return to normal life
- **Stay Faction** (30%): Prefer spirit existence, find mortal life dull now
- **Undecided** (10%): Torn, will follow majority

**The Ethics**:
- Forcing rescue violates autonomy
- Allowing choice means some stay trapped
- Children involved—do parents decide for them?
- Party must navigate moral complexity

## Political Situation

**The Dam**:
- **Serves**: 3 towns (pop. 50,000), 20,000 acres farmland
- **Alternatives**: Expensive, require time (canal system, aqueducts, rainmaking rituals)
- **Operators**: Not evil, genuinely providing service
- **Compromise options**: Seasonal flow adjustment, partial removal, magical augmentation

**Tribal Authority**:
- 12 tribes consider waterfall sacred
- Shaman Council makes decisions
- Some shamans willing to compromise, others demand full restoration
- Internal politics mirror Keepers' conflict

## Spirit Lands - Geography

Mirror of physical world but heightened:
- Colors more vivid
- Emotions tangible (anger appears as red mist, joy as golden light)
- Geography symbolic (path to truth is literally straight, path of lies winds)
- Dangerous: Spirits unbound by mortal mortality, battles can be existential
- Tempting: Everything more meaningful, more alive
- Time fluid: Minutes might be hours, or reverse

## Magic System

**Spectrum Magic** (Available after trials):

**1st Level: Color Burst**
- Cast light in specific color, emotional effect based on color
- Red: Inspires courage
- Blue: Induces calm
- Etc.

**3rd Level: Rainbow Bridge**
- Create solid light bridge, any color
- Properties vary (Red = fire damage to cross, Blue = healing, Green = balance/stability)

**5th Level: Prism Body**
- Turn invisible to specific color-viewers
- Or become that color (elemental infusion)

**7th Level: Spectrum Walk**
- Step through rainbow into Spirit Lands
- Safe passage for duration

**9th Level: Unity Prism**
- Combine all seven colors into white light
- Can restore Veil, seal tears, manifest/banish spirits
- Requires all seven attunements

## Resolution Outcomes

**Restored Veil**: Perfect separation maintained, phasing village rescued, water flow restored (dam modified), Keepers unified. Long-term: Status quo preserved, safe border crossings continue.

**Managed Merger**: Controlled mixing, designated thin places, some beings become hybrid. Long-term: New era of cooperation, requires constant management, cultural exchange between realms.

**New Guardians**: Mortals take over Keeper roles, permanent responsibility. Long-term: More accessible, but burden falls on individuals who age while duty doesn't.
