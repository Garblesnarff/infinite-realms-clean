# Shadow Bureau Protocols - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Procedural Realism

**Office Thriller Aesthetic** - Fluorescent lights, cubicles, computer screens, file folders. Unglamorous reality of intelligence analysis. Think Homeland, Jack Ryan series—grounded, procedural, detailed.

## Color Palettes
- **The Bullpen**: Office beige, fluorescent white, neutral tones
- **Briefing Room**: Professional blues, projection screen glow
- **Surveillance Center**: Multiple monitors, blue-green tech lighting
- **Target Locations**: Warmer colors when viewing from distance, intimate yet remote

## Music
**Tense Minimalism** - Subtle electronic pulses, building tension through restraint. No action movie bombast. String tension for deadline pressure. Silence for intense analysis moments.

**Analysis Theme**: Rhythmic typing, paper shuffling, ambient office sounds as music.

## Voice Direction
- **Jack Ryan**: Earnest, analytical, Jimmy Stewart everyman quality
- **James Greer**: Experienced mentor, sardonic wisdom, John Krasinski warmth
- **Cathy Mueller**: Grounding normal, doctor's compassion, relationship anchor
- **Suleiman**: Intelligent, articulate, tragic villain who could have been hero

## Cinematic Moments
- **The Connection**: Moment dots connect, recognition of pattern, breakthrough
- **The Briefing**: Presenting findings to decision-makers, persuasion under pressure
- **The Map Wall**: Pins, strings, photographs—visual representation of investigation
- **Real-Time Support**: Analysts watching operation live, providing guidance
- **The Mistake**: Wrong intel costs lives, weight of responsibility
- **The Political Obstacle**: Bureaucracy blocking truth, frustration of system
- **The Debrief**: Aftermath of operation, accounting for decisions

## Presentation Style
**Document Heavy** - Show actual files, financial records, surveillance footage. Make analysis tangible. Use visual aids: maps, timelines, photographs. Information as compelling as action.
