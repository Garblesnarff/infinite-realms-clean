# Shadow Bureau Protocols - World-Building Specification

## Intelligence Community Structure

**CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)**: Foreign intelligence, covert operations, analysis. Players work here. Headquarters in Langley. Bureaucratic, political, sometimes effective.

**FBI**: Domestic counterintelligence and law enforcement. Jurisdictional tension with CIA. Cooperation required but difficult.

**Military Intelligence**: Defense-focused, tactical emphasis. Different priorities than CIA.

**Senate Intelligence Committee**: Political oversight, sometimes obstacle, sometimes ally.

## The Suleiman Network

**Leader**: Mousa bin Suleiman, former doctor turned terrorist after family killed by Western military action. Brilliant, patient, driven by genuine grief and ideology.

**Organization**: Small, professional cell. Disciplined. Avoid traditional patterns making detection difficult.

**Plan**: Sophisticated terrorist attack targeting civilians. Timeline compressed by player investigation.

**Motivation**: Revenge and ideology mixed. Sympathetic background, unforgivable methods.

**Hanin (Wife)**: Trapped by husband's choices, knows details, wants out, enormous risk to help.

## Analysis Tradecraft

**Financial Analysis**: Follow money, shell companies, transaction patterns. Tedious but revealing.

**Signals Intelligence**: Communications intercepts, pattern recognition, encryption breaking.

**Human Intelligence**: Interviews, asset cultivation, defector handling. Psychology heavy.

**Imagery Intelligence**: Satellite photos, drone surveillance, photo analysis.

**All-Source Analysis**: Combining everything to see complete picture. Collaboration essential.

## Institutional Politics

**Credit Competition**: Agencies compete for "wins" and budget justifications. Intelligence sharing imperfect.

**Political Pressure**: Senators want specific outcomes, pressure analysts to conform intelligence to policy preferences.

**Media Leaks**: Classified information appearing in press, mole hunting, trust issues.

**Career Concerns**: Analysts balancing truth-telling with career survival.

**Resource Limitations**: Not enough analysts, too much data, prioritization difficult.

## Operations Support

**Pre-Operation**: Analysts create intelligence package for field team. Target location, security, patterns, threats, opportunities.

**Real-Time**: Monitor operation remotely. Provide updates, guidance, adapt to changing situation.

**Post-Operation**: Debrief, lessons learned, intelligence validation, consequence assessment.

**Pressure**: Field operatives' lives depend on intelligence quality. Analysts feel weight directly.

## The Weight of the Desk

**Success**: Right analysis prevents attacks, saves lives. Satisfaction of intellectual victory.

**Failure**: Wrong analysis costs lives. Permanent guilt. Not abstract—know names and faces.

**Burnout**: High stakes, long hours, emotional toll. Relationships suffer. Health declines.

**Moral Injury**: Sometimes right intelligence leads to morally questionable operations. Complicity questions.

**Isolation**: Can't discuss work with family/friends. Classified life is separate life.

## Campaign Structure

**Investigation Phase**: 60% of sessions. Analysis, briefings, collaborative problem-solving.

**Political Phase**: 25% of sessions. Navigating bureaucracy, persuading decision-makers.

**Operation Phase**: 15% of sessions. Supporting field operations, real-time analysis.

**No Combat**: Players rarely if ever in physical danger. Conflict is intellectual and political.

## Resolution Paths

**Success**: Stop attack through timely accurate intelligence. Lives saved. System works.

**Partial Success**: Stop attack but casualties occur. Intelligence imperfect. Mixed victory.

**Political Victory**: Right analysis but politicians ignore it. Failure despite being right.

**Personal Cost**: Success professionally but relationships destroyed, health ruined. Pyrrhic victory.

**The Next Case**: Win or lose, another case file opens. Work continues. Threats don't stop.

This supports analytical intelligence campaign focused on intellectual challenges, collaboration, moral weight of decisions made from desk, and realistic portrayal of intelligence community work.
