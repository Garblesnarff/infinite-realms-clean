*A Fantasy Resistance / Memory and Identity / Cultural Erasure campaign — Long Campaign (15+ sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Name We Cannot Speak
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Fantasy Resistance / Memory Magic / Cultural Genocide / Renaissance Italy Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **13**
**Tone (keywords):** memory-as-resistance, cultural-erasure, tragic-beauty, renaissance-fantasy, revenge-and-redemption, names-have-power
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the Palm, a peninsula of warring provinces (fantasy Renaissance Italy), two sorcerer-tyrants—Brandin of Ygrath and Alberico of Barbadior—have conquered and divided the land between them. Brandin, in grief and vengeance for his son killed in battle, cast a spell erasing the name "Tigana" from the world—those born after the conquest cannot hear or speak it, and the province itself is being forgotten from history and memory. The players are survivors of Tigana and their allies, forming a desperate resistance to kill Brandin and restore their name before the last generation who remembers dies and Tigana is erased forever. They must navigate complex loyalties (Brandin is both their destroyer and possibly their only hope against Alberico), learn that memory and identity are forms of magic more powerful than sorcery, and decide whether vengeance or wisdom will guide their path to freedom.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — The Name We Remember (Sessions 1–5):** Players from Tigana (or who learn about it from elders) discover they live in a province whose name has been magically erased. Young people literally cannot hear "Tigana" spoken—it sounds as empty air. The older generation carries the name as a burden and secret, teaching children in whispers. Players join Alessan bar Valentin, prince of Tigana in hiding, who has spent years building a network to assassinate Brandin. They navigate occupied territories, witness cultural oppression, and learn the complex politics: Brandin rules the western Palm through charisma and competent governance, Alberico rules the east through brutal tyranny. Players must gather allies, learn which conquered provinces will aid them (many won't—they have their own griefs), and discover the Brandin's vulnerability: his grief for his lost son.

*   **Act II — The Web of Sorcerers (Sessions 6–11):** The players learn magic in this world is rare and dangerous. The two tyrants are among the only true sorcerers, nearly god-like in power. But magic has costs: Brandin's spell of erasure is slowly killing him—sustaining it drains his life. The players can exploit this, but must navigate deadly complications: Brandin's lover Dianora is secretly from Tigana, planted to assassinate him but has genuinely fallen in love with him. The resistance fractures over strategy: quick assassination (leaving Alberico to conquer all) or complex manipulation to turn the tyrants against each other. Personal storylines interweave: a musician whose art carries forbidden memory, a noble seeking revenge that will destroy him, a sculptor preserving Tigana's name in hidden art. They discover the Ember Night ritual—an ancient celebration that, if performed correctly, could weaken Brandin's magic.

*   **Act III — The Price of Memory (Sessions 12–15+):** All plots converge at the Festival of Vines, where both tyrants attend. The players must execute their plan: weaken Brandin through ritual and strike, or manipulate him into destroying Alberico. But they discover terrible truths: Brandin genuinely loves Dianora and has considered lifting the spell for her sake; killing him will free Tigana's name but doom the western Palm to Alberico's brutal rule; some Tiganese have made peace with erasure and don't want the violence resistance requires. The players face impossible choices: Kill Brandin and restore Tigana's name (righteous but costly), spare him and negotiate a different future (betraying their purpose but potentially wiser), or engineer the tyrants' mutual destruction (freeing the Palm but at massive cost). The campaign ends with players understanding that memory is both their greatest weapon and their greatest burden—that sometimes remembering means carrying pain forever, but forgetting means losing who you are.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Spell of Erasure**
*   Characters born after Brandin's spell literally cannot perceive "Tigana" when spoken or written.
*   Mechanically: Certain knowledge is blocked until the character undergoes a ritual to "unlock" the name.
*   Elder characters who remember carry the name as both burden and power—they are the living memory.

### 2. **Memory as Magic**
*   Preserving Tigana's memory through art, music, stories grants subtle magical effects.
*   Performing traditional Tiganese songs, creating sculptures, telling old stories can weaken Brandin's spell or inspire resistance.
*   The more people remember, the weaker the erasure becomes.

### 3. **Complex Loyalty**
*   Players track relationships with multiple factions: Tiganese resistance, other conquered provinces, Brandin's court, Alberico's forces.
*   NPCs have complex motivations—many conquered people prefer competent Brandin to brutal Alberico.
*   Destroying one tyrant empowers the other. Simple solutions don't exist.

### 4. **Cultural Resistance**
*   Players engage in cultural preservation as resistance: teaching forbidden history, performing banned rituals, preserving art.
*   These actions build Resistance points that enable final confrontation.
*   Cultural resistance is as important as military action.

### 5. **The Ember Night Ritual**
*   Ancient Tiganese celebration that, if performed with enough participants, creates magical resonance.
*   Players must gather materials, recruit participants, and execute ritual while avoiding detection.
*   Success weakens Brandin's magic, creating window for final strike.

## Central Conflict

Is identity defined by name, or by those who remember? Can you hate your oppressor while understanding their humanity? The campaign explores cultural genocide, the power of memory, and whether vengeance or reconciliation offers the path to freedom. Brandin is simultaneously the monster who erased Tigana and a grieving father whose pain drove him to atrocity. Killing him is justice but creates new problems. The deepest magic isn't sorcery—it's the human capacity to remember and to choose what that memory demands of us.
