# Creative Brief: The Name We Cannot Speak

Art Style: Renaissance Italian Fantasy with Melancholic Beauty. Rich cultural aesthetics, art and music as resistance, the beauty of what's being lost. Inspired by Italian Renaissance art and Guy Gavriel Kay's lyrical prose.

**Color Palette:** Renaissance Italy colors—warm ochres, deep wines, Mediterranean blues, the gold of memory, the empty white where "Tigana" should be.

**Character Design:** Renaissance Italian clothing (doublets, flowing dresses, merchant finery), musicians with lutes and viols, artists with hidden meanings in their work, resistance fighters hiding in plain sight as entertainers and nobles.

**Backgrounds:** Italian city-states with piazzas and palaces, mountain sanctuaries where memory is preserved, the Festival of Vines with its celebration and danger, Brandin's elegant court where a conquered woman rules as beloved concubine.

**Mood:** Melancholic beauty, memory as both weapon and wound, the tragedy of conflicted loyalties, Renaissance culture being slowly erased, resistance through art and memory.

Voice: A lyrical, slightly melancholic voice that treasures beauty while acknowledging pain, like a poet preserving what's being lost. Pacing is measured, giving weight to cultural moments and memories. Emotion conveys longing for what was, determination to preserve it, and understanding that some wounds can't fully heal. Role: The keeper of names that must not be forgotten.
