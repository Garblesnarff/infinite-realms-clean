### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Industrial Underworld**

**1. Core Concept:**
In a world of eternal winter, a bard and his starving lover face tragedy when she sells her soul to the god of death, forcing the party to journey to the industrial underworld and prove that love can overcome fate itself.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the cosmic arrangement—Persephone's time above brings spring, time below brings winter
*   Explain how Hades and Persephone's love has grown cold, extending winter
*   Describe the ancient myth of Orpheus and Eurydice—everyone knows the ending
*   Write about Hadestown's industrial system—souls as workers building walls forever
*   Detail the concept of soul contracts—Hades legally owns those who sign
*   Explain the spring song—Orpheus's unfinished work that could restore balance
*   Describe Hermes' role as psychopomp guiding souls between life and death

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Living** (Major) - Humans suffering in eternal winter, starving and desperate
*   **The Dead Workers** (Major) - Souls in Hadestown building the wall eternally
*   **Hades' Administration** (Minor) - Bureaucracy of death, contracts and ownership
*   **The Fates** (Minor) - Three sisters who know and influence destiny
*   **The Gods** (Minor) - Persephone, Hades, Hermes—divine but flawed
*   **The Faithful** (Minor) - Those who still believe in spring and love

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Orpheus, Eurydice, Hades, Persephone, Hermes, The Fates (three sisters)
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Dead Worker," "Desperate Farmer," "Hadestown Guard," "Contract Keeper," "Soul in Line," "Believer in Spring," "Doubter," "River Guardian"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The World Above** - Locked in eternal winter, poverty and starvation
*   **The Road to Hadestown** - Dangerous journey through liminal spaces and trials
*   **Hadestown** - Industrial underworld of factories, walls, and eternal labor
*   **Hades' Office** - Art Deco luxury where contracts are signed and negotiations happen
*   **The Walk Back** - Narrow path from death to life where faith is tested

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Eurydice signs Hades' contract THEN her soul belongs to him and she becomes a worker
*   IF Orpheus completes his spring song THEN can move even Hades to mercy
*   IF party convinces Hades love exists THEN he grants the test—walk out without looking
*   IF Orpheus looks back during the walk THEN Eurydice is pulled back to death forever
*   IF party helps complete the song and restores faith THEN possibly change fate's ending
*   IF Hades and Persephone remember their love THEN seasons restore to balance
