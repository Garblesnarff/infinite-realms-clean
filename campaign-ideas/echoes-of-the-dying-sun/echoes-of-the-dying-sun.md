# Echoes of the Dying Sun

*A Time Loop Mystery / Space Exploration campaign — Medium Campaign (14-20 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Echoes of the Dying Sun
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Loop Mystery / Space Exploration / Archaeological Discovery
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 14-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **11-13**
**Tone (keywords):** contemplative, cosmic wonder, archaeological mystery, inevitable doom, curiosity-driven, bittersweet
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party awakens in a small astronomer village as their sun enters its death cycle, giving them exactly 22 minutes before it explodes into a supernova. Each time they die or the sun explodes, time resets to the same moment—but they retain their memories and knowledge. They discover evidence of the ancient Nomai civilization, whose ruins scattered across the solar system hold clues to why the time loop exists and how it might be broken. Their only weapon is knowledge; their only goal is to piece together the cosmic mystery before the universe ends.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 14-20 sessions)

An exploration-driven mystery where gathering information is the path to victory, not combat prowess.

*   **Act I — Understanding the Loop (Sessions 1-7):** The party experiences their first loop, dying to the supernova and waking up at the same campfire. They explore their home planet and discover Nomai ruins with strange writing. Learning to read the ancient language, they uncover that the Nomai were searching for something called the Eye of the Universe. They map out the solar system's planets, each holding pieces of the puzzle. They learn the loop is powered by Nomai technology that activates at the moment of death.
*   **Act II — The Scattered Clues (Sessions 8-14):** The party explores increasingly dangerous locations: a planet swallowed by sand, twin planets orbiting each other, a comet hiding a ice-locked city, and a station falling into a black hole. Each location reveals more about the Nomai's fate—they were killed by a failed experiment. The party discovers the Eye of the Universe is the birthplace of the cosmos itself, and the Nomai built the time loop device specifically to find someone who could reach it after their death. Time is fracturing as the loop becomes unstable.
*   **Act III — The Final Journey (Sessions 15-20):** Armed with complete knowledge, the party must execute a perfect sequence: gather specific Nomai technology, align quantum phenomena, and use a vessel hidden at the solar system's edge to reach the Eye. The journey requires using everything learned across all previous loops. At the Eye, they discover the universe is ending naturally—the time loop was always a dying breath. They witness the death of the current universe and, through quantum observation, help birth the next one. Their final choice: let go of their universe or try to preserve it.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of curiosity and knowledge as virtues, accepting inevitable endings, the beauty of temporary existence, and cosmic wonder. It asks: What do you do when faced with inevitable doom? How do you find meaning in a universe that will end? Can knowledge alone be enough to change fate? The central conflict is against time and entropy itself—not a villain to defeat, but a natural process to understand and accept.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The 22-Minute Loop**
*   Each session or major segment represents one time loop lasting exactly 22 minutes (in-game)
*   Sun goes through visible stages: normal → red giant → supernova
*   Players retain all knowledge between loops but reset to starting location and state
*   No traditional experience points—advancement comes from knowledge gained
*   Death from any source (falling, suffocation, anglerfish) triggers loop reset

### 2. **Knowledge as Progress**
*   No traditional leveling—characters grow by learning information
*   Ship Log tracks discoveries across all loops (quantum journal that persists)
*   Completing discoveries unlocks new abilities: translation of Nomai text, understanding quantum rules, navigating by sound
*   "Rumor Mode" allows players to ask "What haven't we explored yet?" to get hints
*   Victory condition is understanding, not combat

### 3. **Zero-G Navigation & Spaceship Piloting**
*   Space travel uses simplified physics—momentum, inertia, gravity wells
*   Players pilot a wooden spaceship with limited fuel for thrust and landing
*   Zero-gravity exploration requires jetpack management
*   Crash damage affects ship systems (lost roasting stick = no campfire, broken radio = no signals)
*   Scout launcher maps distant locations and creates signal markers

### 4. **Environmental Hazards as Puzzles**
*   **Sand Flow:** Ember Twin reveals new areas as Ash Twin's sand empties into it (time-gated exploration)
*   **Black Hole:** Falling into Brittle Hollow's core sends you through space and time
*   **Ghost Matter:** Instant death if touched, requires careful mapping and avoidance
*   **Tornados:** Can lift you to otherwise unreachable locations on Giant's Deep
*   **Anglerfish:** Hunt by sound—silent exploration in Dark Bramble required

### 5. **Quantum Mechanics**
*   Quantum objects exist in multiple states until observed
*   The Quantum Moon appears at different planets—travel by closing your eyes
*   Quantum imaging reveals possible locations
*   Understanding quantum rules unlocks late-game navigation
*   Solanum exists in superposition—observe her to collapse possibilities

### 6. **Archaeological Translation**
*   Nomai writing starts as incomprehensible symbols
*   Learning their language gradually through context (intelligence checks)
*   Complete texts reveal crucial information about the Eye, the loop, and the Nomai's fate
*   Wall texts have multiple authors with different handwriting—track conversations across time
*   Conversations between long-dead Nomai reveal their personalities and relationships

### 7. **Signal Tracking & Navigation**
*   Use signalscope to detect audio beacons across space
*   Traveler signals: harmonica, flute, drums, banjo (find your friends)
*   Nomai signals: distorted energy signatures (find ruins)
*   Quantum fluctuations can be heard as white noise
*   Navigation by sound is essential in Dark Bramble where vision is useless
