### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Echoes of the Dying Sun**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party is trapped in a 22-minute time loop as their sun dies, resetting each time they die or the supernova occurs. They retain memories and knowledge across loops. By exploring a solar system filled with the ruins of the ancient Nomai civilization, they must piece together why the loop exists and discover the Eye of the Universe—the source of all quantum phenomena and the key to breaking the cycle before the universe itself ends.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Nomai civilization—their culture of curiosity, their three-clan structure, their search for the Eye.
    *   Write the history of the Nomai's arrival in this solar system after escaping a supernova.
    *   Describe the Sun Station project—their failed attempt to trigger a supernova to power the time loop.
    *   Explain the Interloper's arrival and the ghost matter explosion that killed all Nomai instantly.
    *   Detail the Eye of the Universe—birthplace of the universe, source of quantum phenomena, and the signal that called the Nomai.
    *   Describe how the time loop was designed to activate only when someone was conscious to receive the signal.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Travelers** (Major): Small group of four-eyed explorers from Timber Hearth, curious about space and the Nomai.
    *   **The Nomai** (Historical): Ancient three-eyed civilization now extinct, left behind ruins and messages across the system.
    *   **The Hearthians** (Minor): Stay-at-home species content with their village life, supportive of travelers.
    *   **Quantum Entities** (Mysterious): Objects and beings existing in superposition, including Solanum.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Gabbro (fellow looper), Solanum (quantum Nomai), Chert (panicking astronomer), Riebeck (fearful archaeologist), Esker (homesick hermit).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Village Elder" (wise leader), "Nomai Memory" (ghostly projections at Eye), "Museum Curator" (keeper of Nomai knowledge), "Observatory Staff" (fellow students).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Timber Hearth:** Home village with museum, observatory, mines with Nomai ruins, geyser fields.
*   **Giant's Deep:** Ocean world with quantum island, orbital probe tracking module, massive tornados.
*   **Brittle Hollow:** Hollow planet with Nomai hanging city, black hole core, fractured surface.
*   **Ash Twin Project:** Hidden beneath sand, contains the memory core that creates the loop.
*   **Dark Bramble:** Dimension-warping seed with anglerfish, holds the crashed Vessel at its core.
*   **Quantum Moon:** Exists at six locations simultaneously, houses the sixth location and Solanum.
*   **The Eye of the Universe:** Outside normal space, accessed only via coordinates and the Vessel.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** The party dies by any means → **THEN:** Time resets to the awakening moment, all knowledge retained.
*   **IF:** 22 minutes elapse → **THEN:** Sun goes supernova, everything dies, time resets.
*   **IF:** The party learns Nomai language → **THEN:** All ruins become readable, revealing the full story.
*   **IF:** The party finds all coordinates → **THEN:** The Vessel can be programmed to reach the Eye.
*   **IF:** The party reaches the Eye → **THEN:** They participate in the universe's death and rebirth, ending the loop.
*   **IF:** Time loop quantum fluctuations increase → **THEN:** Reality becomes unstable, loop nears its natural end.

**7. Environmental Storytelling**
*   Nomai ruins tell stories through wall conversations—multiple authors discussing plans.
*   Each planet's environmental state reflects its place in the 22-minute cycle (sand levels, black hole growth, tornado patterns).
*   Skeletons and crashed ships reveal where Nomai were when ghost matter killed them.
*   Quantum phenomena provide environmental puzzles and metaphysical mysteries.
*   The museum on Timber Hearth updates with party's discoveries, showing knowledge progression.

**8. The Loop Psychology**
*   Time loop creates unique storytelling: players know the ending (death) but play to learn why.
*   No fear of death—death is a tool for experimentation and discovery.
*   Emphasis on "what do I do with limited time?" rather than "how do I get stronger?"
*   Bittersweet themes: knowing everyone will die but cherishing each conversation anyway.
