## Flavor-Binding Magic System

### Basic Principles

- Flavors correspond to magic schools
- Cooking technique affects spell strength
- Consumption activates magic
- Duration based on digestion

### Flavor-School Correspondences

- **Salty**: Protection, preservation, warding
- **Sour**: Transformation, change, transmutation
- **Bitter**: Knowledge, wisdom, divination
- **Umami**: Enhancement, amplification, balance
- **Spicy**: Energy, damage, evocation

### Forbidden Techniques
- Soul Binding: Trap consciousness in food
- Life Extraction: Steal vitality through consumption
- Will Domination: Mind control via flavor
- Death Cooking: Food that permanently drains life
- Temporal Taste: Aging/de-aging through meals

### Corruption Signs
- Stage 1: Enhanced taste sensitivity, minor power boost
- Stage 2: Physical changes (eye color, aura, cravings)
- Stage 3: Personality changes, loss of empathy
- Stage 4: Monstrous transformation, insatiable hunger
- Stage 5: Complete loss of humanity

## The Immortality Research

### Historical Background
- Headmaster Goldwhisk discovered technique 150 years ago
- Initially used sparingly, just extending life naturally
- Grew addicted to living, couldn't accept death
- Escalated to harvesting student essence
- Founding Feast ritual created to hide mass harvesting

### The Process
- Young talented chef-mages have strongest essence
- Must be willing participant (hence the school)
- Ritual during feast extracts life while feeding guests
- Victims believe they're just exhausted from celebrations
- Goldwhisk consumes specially prepared meals from the ritual
- Each feast extends his life 10-20 years

### Side Effects
- Victims rarely survive more than a year after graduation
- Early graduates showed pattern of mysterious deaths
- Some became corrupted themselves from partial exposure
- Families told it was "magical exhaustion" from studies
- Underground complex holds failed experiments

### The Cover-Up
- Fake graduation records for those who died
- Bribed officials and families
- Discredited investigators
- Professor Umeboshi got too close, was imprisoned
- Dean Sourwood discovered truth but was blackmailed
