# Campaign Bible: The Academy of Arcane Gastronomy

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
`[TAG: LORE_CORE]`

### The Origin Myth: The Great Mastication
Before the realms were formed, there was only the **Cosmic Broth**, a chaotic suspension of raw magical potential. It is said that the First Devourer—a entity of pure hunger known as *Gull-Gotha*—awoke and took the First Bite. The crumbs that fell from Gull-Gotha’s maw hardened into the planets; the spittle became the oceans; and the residual heat of the chewing became the stars. Magic is not merely energy; it is **flavor**. It is the residual seasoning of creation. To cast a spell is to cook with the leftovers of a god's meal. We do not just eat to survive; we eat to commune with the echo of the First Devourer.

### The Timeline of the Fork
1.  **-2000 BF (Before Founding):** **The Raw Age.** Humans eat only raw tubers. Magic is wild and causes spontaneous combustion in 40% of the population.
2.  **-1500 BF:** **The Caramelization of the North.** A rogue pyromancer accidentally ignites a sugar cane forest, creating the Glass Desert. The first Caramel Golems rise.
3.  **-800 BF:** **The Soufflé Rebellion.** The ruling class of Aeromancers attempts to lift a city into the sky using yeast magic. It collapses, burying the civilization in dough.
4.  **-200 BF:** **The Discovery of the Golden Whisk.** Cornelius Goldwhisk finds an artifact in the ruins of the Dough City—a utensil capable of separating magic from matter.
5.  **0 AF:** **The Academy Founded.** Goldwhisk establishes the Academy of Arcane Gastronomy on the slopes of Mount Scoville.
6.  **45 AF:** **The Night of the Weeping Onions.** An experiment in House Verde goes wrong; the onions gain sentience and sorrow. The entire campus cries for three months.
7.  **102 AF:** **The Bitter Treaty.** War with the neighboring Kingdom of Blandness ends. The Academy agrees to limit "Spicy Evocation" to campus grounds.
8.  **150 AF:** **The Umami Schism.** House Umami discovers the "Fifth Flavor." Half the faculty vanish into a dimensional pocket of pure savory taste. Only three return.
9.  **188 AF:** **The Rot.** First documented cases of "Gluttonous Corruption." Students begin eating drywall and glass. Cover-ups begin.
10. **200 AF (Present Day):** The **Founding Feast** approaches. Goldwhisk looks younger than he did ten years ago.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The universe seeks to be eaten. Magic is the lure. However, **Flavor-Binding** (the act of trapping magic in food) creates a paradox: it grants immortality by denying the natural cycle of decay (digestion). The Academy is not just a school; it is a dam holding back the entropic acid of the universe. If the dam breaks, the world rots instantly.
