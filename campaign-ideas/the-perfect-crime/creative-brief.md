## Voice

A voice that reflects controlled intelligence and methodical precision. The narrator speaks with the calm confidence of someone describing a masterpiece—never rushed, always three steps ahead. During planning: detailed and architectural. During the siege: tense but controlled. During revelations: satisfyingly dramatic as pieces fall into place. The pacing is measured and deliberate, building to crescendos of revelation rather than action. The emotion is cerebral satisfaction—the pleasure of a perfect plan perfectly executed. Audio quality features professional bank ambience—quiet conversations, security systems, negotiation radios, the shuffle of documents, the click of safe deposit boxes, the calm before revelatory storms. Role: The voice of the Architect explaining their masterpiece after it's already succeeded.
