## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the art of the perfect crime—where success looks like failure and every detail serves multiple purposes. The central conflict appears to be a failed heist and hostage situation, but it's actually a carefully orchestrated operation to expose historical crimes and gather evidence against the powerful. Players must navigate negotiations, manage hostages, and maintain the illusion of failure while the real plan executes hidden in plain sight. The campaign asks: What is a perfect crime? How many layers of deception can you build before truth becomes unknowable? And is it still a crime if the real objective is justice? The answer: it's only perfect if no one realizes it happened.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Layered Plan System**
*   The heist has multiple layers of objectives—what crew members believe they're doing versus what's actually happening.
*   Different crew members have different levels of knowledge about the true plan.
*   Reveals occur at dramatic moments, recontextualizing all previous events.

### 2. **Hostage Management**
*   Each hostage has a stress level, connections to the conspiracy, and role in the real plan.
*   Players must keep hostages calm while subtly gathering the evidence they carry or can provide.
*   Strategic hostage releases deliver evidence to law enforcement without anyone realizing it.

### 3. **Negotiation Chess Match**
*   Interactions with the negotiator are a battle of wits where both sides probe for information.
*   The crew leader can plant ideas, create misdirection, and control the narrative.
*   Success means law enforcement believes one story while the truth unfolds differently.

### 4. **The Misdirection Tracker**
*   Shows what different factions believe is happening versus what's actually happening.
*   Tracks which deceptions are successful and which are at risk of exposure.
*   Creates tension around maintaining illusions while achieving real objectives.
