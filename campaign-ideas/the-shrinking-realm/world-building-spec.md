### The Hidden Escape Route

**Raze's Discovery:**

- Void Keepers don't know it exists

**The Process:**
1. Obtain three Anchor fragments (from destroying Anchors)
2. Bring to Rift Gardens basement
3. Perform ritual during final storm phase
4. Portal opens briefly (30 seconds)
5. All nearby contestants can escape
6. Realm destabilizes afterward

**The Cost:**
- One person must stay behind to hold portal
- That person consumed by realm collapse
- Ultimate sacrifice for others' freedom
- Makes them eternal hero
- Or players find another way
