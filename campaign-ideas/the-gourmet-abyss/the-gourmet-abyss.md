# The Gourmet Abyss
## "Delicious in Dungeon - Every Monster is a Meal"

### Campaign Overview

The Gourmet Abyss is a massive, ever-descending dungeon that appeared mysteriously fifty years ago. While most adventurers seek treasure and glory, the party are dungeon chefs - specialized adventurers who hunt monsters for their meat, discovering that properly prepared dungeon creatures grant incredible magical effects. What starts as a cooking expedition becomes a race to reach the bottom floor where the legendary Feast of Ages awaits. But the deeper they go, the more they realize the dungeon is alive, evolving, and possibly digesting them.

Each floor has unique ecosystem and cuisine culture. Floor 1 might have giant rats and slimes (beginner food), but Floor 50 has reality-warping aberrations that taste like impossible flavors. The party must balance survival, combat, and cooking to sustain themselves in the depths where supply lines don't reach. They'll meet other dungeon delving parties, rival chef teams, and discover communities that have lived in the dungeon for generations, surviving entirely on monster cuisine.

This campaign combines dungeon crawling with Iron Chef, survival with culinary creativity. Every combat encounter is also an ingredient gathering mission. The mystery deepens: Why does properly cooked monster meat grant powers? What is the Feast of Ages? And what happens to those who eat from every floor all the way down?
