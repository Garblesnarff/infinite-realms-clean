### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Event Horizon Station**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The *Event Horizon*, an experimental vessel equipped with a reality-folding Gravity Drive, disappeared seven years ago and has mysteriously returned. The party investigates and discovers the Drive didn't fold space—it tore open a gateway to a hell dimension where physical laws don't apply and suffering is eternal. The ship has been there, become corrupted, and brought something back. Now the party faces personalized nightmares as the ship itself becomes a living hell, gravity fails, and reality breaks down. They must destroy the Drive and escape before the ship folds back to hell, taking them with it forever.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Gravity Drive's theory: designed to fold space for instant travel, but actually creates dimensional rifts.
    *   Chronicle the *Event Horizon's* first voyage: the Drive activated, the ship vanished for seven years, the crew's descent into madness.
    *   Explain the hell dimension: a place of pure chaos and suffering where physics break down and torment is eternal, possibly a prison for damned souls or an Outer Plane of evil.
    *   Describe how the ship became corrupted: exposure to the hell dimension infected it, making the vessel itself a living extension of that place.
    *   Detail past victims: the original crew's fate—madness, violence, self-mutilation, absorption into the ship's structure.
    *   Explain why the ship returned: it's a predator luring new victims, or the hell dimension is using it as a gateway to the material plane.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Rescue Team (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Initially: investigate and rescue. Then: survive and escape. Finally: destroy the Drive or escape at any cost.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by a captain or senior officer; otherwise equals.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Salvage the ship and determine what happened.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each character carries guilt or fear that the hell dimension will exploit.
        *   **Assets:** Their ship (until they board the *Event Horizon*), standard gear, determination.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied initially; tested by madness and personal hells; may turn on each other.
    *   **The Event Horizon (The Ship)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Return to hell dimension, bring victims, spread corruption.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The Ship as entity; the Drive as its heart; manifestations as immune system; corrupted souls as prisoners.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. It appears as a derelict.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Lure investigators aboard, drive them mad, prevent escape, fold back to hell.
        *   **Assets:** Control over shipboard systems, gravity manipulation, reality distortion, personalized psychological torture.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to all living; serves the hell dimension; torments souls.
    *   **The Hell Dimension** (Major - Cosmic)
        *   **Goals:** Expand influence, consume souls, breach into material reality.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Unknown. Possibly ruled by archdevils, demon lords, or an unknowable cosmic evil.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use the *Event Horizon* as a gateway; harvest souls; corrupt reality.
        *   **Assets:** Infinite torment, reality manipulation within its domain, psychological warfare, immortal patience.
        *   **Relationships:** Uses the ship as tool; indifferent to mortal suffering except as sustenance.
    *   **The Damned Crew** (Minor - Deceased/Corrupted)
        *   **Goals:** Were trying to survive or escape; now are part of the ship's corruption.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Dr. Weir who understood and embraced the truth.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. All dead or absorbed.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some souls may try to warn newcomers; others have become tormentors.
        *   **Assets:** Knowledge of what happened; ability to manifest as ghosts; Dr. Weir as physical survivor (barely).
        *   **Relationships:** Most are victims; some became agents of the ship; one (Weir) serves willingly.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Dr. William Weir:** The Drive's creator, now insane and mutilated, serves the ship.
    *   **Captain Miller (if NPC):** Leader of rescue mission, haunted by abandoning crew in past, experiences this as personal hell.
    *   **The Original Captain:** Ghost/manifestation of the *Event Horizon's* former captain, warning or threatening.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Personal Manifestation" (dead loved one, childhood fear, personified guilt—custom per character)
    *   "Corrupted Crew Member" (body fused with ship, still screaming)
    *   "Hell Entity" (demon-like being from the dimension beyond)
    *   "The Ship's Voice" (uses dead crew voices, taunts and threatens)
    *   "Madness Vision" (hallucination that seems real, attacks or accuses)

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A character spends extended time near the Gravity Drive or experiences multiple manifestations.
    *   **THEN:** Increase Madness. Generate escalating effects: first paranoia, then hallucinations, then violent urges. At high Madness, they may attack allies or attempt to stop the Drive's destruction.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to leave the ship before dealing with the Drive.
    *   **THEN:** The ship prevents departure: airlocks malfunction, corridors loop back, their own ship's systems fail. Generate the horror of being trapped.
    *   **IF:** A character experiences a personal manifestation (guilt/fear made real).
    *   **THEN:** Create a custom encounter based on their backstory. This is both combat and psychological. Defeating it requires confronting the truth, not just violence.
    *   **IF:** The party reaches the Drive and attempts destruction.
    *   **THEN:** The ship fights back: gravity fails, manifestations attack, Dr. Weir intervenes, reality breaks down. Generate a climactic gauntlet. Success destroys the Drive but may damage the ship fatally.
    *   **IF:** The Drive is destroyed.
    *   **THEN:** The ship begins dying/exploding. Generate an escape sequence with collapsing corridors, explosive decompression, and a narrow window to reach the escape pods.
    *   **IF:** The Drive successfully folds the ship back to the hell dimension.
    *   **THEN:** The party is trapped in hell. Generate a final desperate session where escape is nearly impossible—they're in the actual hell dimension where the ship belongs. Only extraordinary action or sacrifice can create a momentary rift to escape.
    *   **IF:** A character fully succumbs to madness.
    *   **THEN:** They become NPC-controlled, either attacking the party or trying to prevent the Drive's destruction. The player can roleplay their final moments before control is lost to madness.
