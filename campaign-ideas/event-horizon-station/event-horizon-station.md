---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Event Horizon Station
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Sci-Fantasy Horror / Hell Dimension / Cosmic Terror / Survival
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **11**
**Tone (keywords):** hell dimension, madness, gravity drive, cosmic horror, guilt manifestation, sci-fi terror
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is sent to investigate the *Event Horizon*, a experimental magical vessel that disappeared seven years ago and has mysteriously returned. When they board, they find the crew dead in horrific ways and the ship's Gravity Drive—which was supposed to fold space—actually tore open a gateway to a hell dimension. The ship has been there, and it brought something back. Now the party experiences personalized nightmares as the ship itself becomes alive, the boundary between reality and hell blurs, and they must destroy the Drive and escape before they're trapped in eternal torment.

## What "Extreme" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Personalized Hell:** Each character experiences visions from their darkest fears and guilts made real.
*   **Hostile Environment:** The ship itself is corrupted. Gravity shifts, corridors rearrange, reality breaks down.
*   **Madness:** Characters gain madness points from visions and encounters. High madness leads to violence and self-harm.
*   **The Drive:** The Gravity Drive is conscious and malevolent, actively working to keep them aboard and send them to hell.
*   **No Safe Space:** Nowhere on the ship is safe. Rest is interrupted by nightmares and manifestations.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A descent from investigation to hell itself across three acts.

*   **Act I — Investigation (Sessions 1–2):** The party boards the abandoned vessel and explores, finding evidence of mass madness and death. They discover the Gravity Drive activated, creating a portal to another dimension—a hell-space where physical laws don't apply and torment is eternal. The ship has been infected.
*   **Act II — Manifestations (Sessions 3–5):** The party experiences personalized hell visions—facing their greatest fears and guilts made manifest. The ship's corridors shift, gravity becomes unreliable, and they encounter entities from the hell dimension. They must reach the Drive to shut it down while fighting their own minds.
*   **Act III — Point of No Return (Sessions 6–8):** The ship begins folding back to the hell dimension, taking the party with it. They must choose: destroy the Drive (stranding themselves in hell but preventing it from reaching civilization), escape before the ship completes the fold (but the Drive may activate again), or embrace the madness and join the ship's damned crew forever.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Distress Call"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Atmospheric Dread
*   **Key Events:** The party's ship intercepts the *Event Horizon's* emergency beacon. They board. The ship is a gothic horror in space—vaulted corridors, strange architecture. They find the crew dead, bodies mutilated in impossible ways.
*   **Escalation:** They find the ship's log: the Gravity Drive activated, the crew saw something, and then madness and murder.

### Session 2 — "The Drive"
*   **Focus:** Discovery / Cosmic Horror
*   **Key Events:** The party finds the Gravity Drive—a massive spherical device crackling with energy. Around it, reality is distorted. They glimpse through it: a hell dimension of suffering and impossible geometry.
*   **Escalation:** The Drive activates briefly, pulling them toward it. They experience a flash of hell—screaming, fire, faces in the walls.

### Session 3 — "Where We're Going"
*   **Focus:** Psychological Horror / Personal Nightmares
*   **Key Events:** Each character experiences personalized visions—dead loved ones accusing them, past failures made manifest, their worst fears given form. These aren't illusions; the hell dimension is making them real.
*   **Escalation:** One character attacks another, seeing them as a manifestation of their trauma. The party realizes they're not safe from each other.

### Session 4 — "Libera Te Tutemet Ex Inferis"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Madness
*   **Key Events:** The party finds a surviving crew member—Dr. Weir, the Drive's creator—but he's been driven completely mad and has mutilated himself. He explains: "Liberate yourself from hell" but it's too late. The ship IS hell now.
*   **Escalation:** Weir attacks or begs them to stay. The ship's gravity fails. Corridors rearrange. Up becomes down.

### Session 5 — "The Crew's Fate"
*   **Focus:** Body Horror / Discovery
*   **Key Events:** The party finds recordings showing the crew's descent: first visions, then accusations, then violence. The final survivors were pulled into the walls, absorbed into the ship. The ship is alive with tortured souls.
*   **Escalation:** The ship begins speaking, using the voices of the damned crew, threatening and pleading.

### Session 6 — "The Fold Begins"
*   **Focus:** Action / Time Pressure
*   **Key Events:** The Gravity Drive powers up for a full activation. The ship will fold back to the hell dimension in hours, taking them with it. They must reach the Drive, fight through manifestations, and destroy it.
*   **Escalation:** Reality breaks down completely. Corridors become non-Euclidean. Gravity reverses. Hell bleeds through fully.

### Session 7 — "Heart of Darkness"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Boss Fight
*   **Key Events:** At the Drive, they face their final manifestations—ultimate representations of their guilts and fears. Dr. Weir, fully transformed, guards it. The Drive itself fights back, pulling them toward hell.
*   **Escalation:** Destroying the Drive may strand them. Escaping means the Drive might restart. Choosing requires sacrifice.

### Session 8 — "Eternal or Escape"
*   **Focus:** Resolution / Multiple Endings
*   **Endings:**
    *   **Destruction:** They destroy the Drive, but the explosion damages their escape route. They're stranded as the ship dies around them.
    *   **Escape:** They flee before full activation, but the Drive is intact. Someone else will find the ship and reactivate it.
    *   **Damnation:** They fail or choose to stay. The ship folds to hell, and they become part of its crew, tortured forever.
    *   **Sacrifice:** One stays behind to ensure destruction while others escape, consigning themselves to hell to save everyone else.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Bridge:** Ship command, evidence of final desperate messages.
2.  **Medical Bay:** Bodies displaying impossible injuries, evidence of self-mutilation.
3.  **The Gravity Drive Chamber:** Spherical room with the Drive at center, reality distortion strongest here.
4.  **Engineering:** Where the Drive can be accessed and destroyed.
5.  **The Corridors:** Gothic, vaulted, increasingly non-Euclidean as hell bleeds through.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between escape and responsibility. The ship wants them to stay and join the damned. The easy choice is to flee, but that leaves the Drive intact to claim more victims. The hard choice is to stay and ensure its destruction, likely at the cost of their own lives or souls. It's also an internal conflict—confronting personal guilt and fear that the hell dimension exploits.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Madness System**
*   Characters gain Madness points from visions, encounters, and spending time near the Drive.
*   At thresholds, they experience effects: paranoia, hallucinations, violent urges, catatonia.

### 2. **Personal Hell Visions**
*   Each character's backstory determines their personal manifestations.
*   The DM creates custom encounters based on each character's guilt and fear.

### 3. **Gravity Shifts**
*   Gravity becomes unreliable. Combat and movement near the Drive or during manifestations may have reversed or absent gravity.

### 4. **Reality Breakdown**
*   As sessions progress, the ship's layout becomes non-Euclidean. Corridors loop, distances change, dimensions fold.

### 5. **The Drive's Pull**
*   The Drive actively tries to pull characters toward it (literally and metaphorically). Resisting requires saving throws.
*   Destroying it is difficult and requires exposing oneself to its full influence.
