# Rimward Runners
**Freedom's Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose**

## Campaign Overview

Rimward Runners follows a crew of independent traders, smugglers, and drifters aboard the freight ship *Serenity's Edge*, making their living on the fringes of civilized space. The Outer Rim is a lawless frontier where three powers vie for control: the Core Systems Authority (bureaucratic government), the Red Sun Consortium (corporate syndicate), and local warlords. The crew takes whatever jobs pay—legal or otherwise—trying to stay free, fed, and flying.

What starts as episodic adventures (cargo runs, smuggling jobs, passenger transport) gradually reveals a deeper conspiracy. The party discovers they're carrying something everyone wants: a young passenger with a dangerous secret. As hunters close in from all sides, the crew must decide between profit and principles, between abandoning the girl to save themselves or protecting her and becoming fugitives hunted across the Rim.

This is a campaign about found family, moral compromises, and the struggle to remain independent in a universe that demands conformity. It's about outlaws with hearts of gold, impossible escapes, and the realization that sometimes doing the right thing costs everything—but you do it anyway because it's the only thing that makes you feel human.

## Core Themes

- **Freedom vs. Security**: Independence has costs; so does submission
- **Found Family**: Strangers becoming home for each other
- **Moral Flexibility**: Survival requires compromise, but where's the line?
- **Us Against the Verse**: Small crew vs. overwhelming forces
- **Home is People, Not Place**: The ship and crew become family
- **Western in Space**: Frontier justice, honor codes, quick-draw showdowns

## Session Breakdown (28 Sessions)

### Act I: Just Trying to Get By (Sessions 1-7)

**Session 1: The Crew Assembles**
Party members join the *Serenity's Edge* crew for various reasons (debt, running from law, need work). Captain Mal Cutter hires them for milk run: cargo from Persephone to Whitefall. Simple. Except cargo is illegal. First taste of Rim life.

**Session 2: Deal Gone Wrong**
Cargo delivery to Whitefall warlord Patience goes sideways. She accuses them of shortchanging her (they didn't). Tense standoff. Party must talk or shoot their way out. Escape with payment and lives (barely). Patience becomes recurring problem.

**Session 3-4: The Passenger**
Taking on passengers to make ends meet. Among them: young woman River and her protective brother Simon. They're secretive, clearly running. Shortly after boarding, Authority checkpoints increase. The siblings are wanted. Decision: turn them in (reward) or harbor them (danger).

**Session 5: Bushwhacked**
Derelict ship found adrift. Investigating, they find massacred crew and lone survivor driven mad. He encountered "Reavers"—savage pirates who rape, murder, and cannibalize. Horror setup. Survivor attacks, must be subdued. Core Systems Authority arrives, inspects ship, suspicious of crew.

**Session 6-7: Shindig and Duel**
High-society job on aristocratic world Persephone. Party attends fancy ball as part of con. Social roleplay. Someone insults crew member, challenged to duel. Old West showdown with swords/guns. Win or lose, leave making enemies in high places.

### Act II: The Secret Revealed (Sessions 8-15)

**Session 8-9: River's Truth**
Simon reveals River's past: She was child prodigy recruited by Core Systems Academy. They experimented on her brain, unlocked psychic abilities, drive her unstable. Simon rescued her. Now government wants her back. Crew debates: Too dangerous to keep, but can't abandon her.

**Session 10-11: The Train Job**
Desperate for money, crew takes job robbing Alliance medical transport train. Heist excitement. Then discover medicine is for plague-stricken poor community. Moral dilemma: Keep payment or return medicine? Choosing latter makes powerful enemy (crime boss Niska).

**Session 12-13: Niska's Revenge**
Crime boss Niska captures crew members for failing train job. Torture and ransom. Rest of crew must raise money and plan rescue. Emotional tension as tortured members interrogated. Daring rescue from Niska's space station. Escalates enemy threat.

**Session 14-15: Safe Haven Lost**
Crew visits frontier settlement where Captain Mal fought in losing war against Alliance. Warm welcome, helping community. Alliance raids settlement looking for River. Firefight. The crew's presence brought danger. Settlement damaged. Guilt and consequences of harboring fugitive.

### Act III: Hunted (Sessions 16-22)

**Session 16-17: The Operative**
Red Sun Consortium sends The Operative—elite assassin tasked with recovering River. Cold, philosophical killer who believes he does evil so others can be pure. Starts systematically eliminating crew's safe havens and contacts. Everywhere they go, corpses left behind.

**Session 18-19: Revelation**
River's psychic episodes reveal conspiracy: Red Sun Consortium creating psy-ops agents, but River saw something worse—a secret about the Reavers. Her fragmented mind has information that could topple Consortium. That's why they want her dead or captured.

**Session 20: The Message**
Decoding River's visions, they discover message hidden in her mind: coordinates to research facility. Crew debates going (walking into trap) vs. running (hunted forever). Decision to investigate. High-stakes infiltration.

**Session 21-22: Miranda**
Arrive at coordinates: terraformed world Miranda, supposedly thriving colony. Instead, find dead world—billions of corpses. Exploring, find recorded message: Consortium tested behavioral pacification agent (Pax) in atmosphere. 99.9% of population stopped functioning, laid down and died. 0.1% had opposite reaction—became Reavers. The monsters plaguing the Rim were created by those who promised to protect.

### Act IV: No More Running (Sessions 23-28)

**Session 23-24: Get the Word Out**
Crew has proof of Miranda and Pax program. Must broadcast it before Operative kills them. Plan: Hijack main communications relay. Multiple factions converge: Authority forces, Red Sun fleet, The Operative, local warlords. Everyone wants River or the information.

**Session 25: Broadcast Battle**
Epic space and ground combat. Crew fights through defenses while River and technical expert upload broadcast. Allies arrive (people crew helped throughout campaign). Cost is high—ships destroyed, friends die. But message gets out.

**Session 26-27: Confrontation with the Operative**
Final showdown with The Operative. He's seen the broadcast, knows truth about Reavers. Philosophical debate and combat. He realizes he's been serving monsters. Offers to let them go. But Red Sun fleet still coming. The Operative helps them escape, then disappears.

**Session 28: A New Day**
Aftermath. Miranda truth goes public. Red Sun Consortium collapses, Authority scrambles to distance itself, outer rim settlements celebrate exposure. Crew are heroes but also criminals. Can't go home, but they have each other. Final scene: Taking new job, heading into black. Freedom earned.

## Major Locations

**Serenity's Edge** (Firefly-class Transport Ship)
Aging cargo vessel, cramped but functional. Cargo bay, crew quarters, engine room, two shuttles. More home than ship to crew.

**Persephone** (Border World)
Half civilized, half frontier. High-society in city centers, mudders (farmers) in badlands. Dueling social scenes, great for cons and hiring.

**Whitefall** (Frontier Moon)
Barely terraformed, warlord-controlled. Patience's territory. Dangerous but independent. Rough towns, harder people.

**The Maidenhead** (High-Class Space Station)
Where Inara conducts business. Luxurious, cultured, stark contrast to crew's life. Connections to power brokers.

**Ariel** (Core System World)
High-tech medical facility where Simon briefly returns to save River. Clean, wealthy, oppressive. Shows what crew rejected.

**Haven** (Shepherd Book's Settlement)
Peaceful frontier community where Book retires. Becomes target of Operative. Destruction motivates crew.

**Miranda** (Dead World)
Failed terraforming cover story. Actually successful colony killed by Pax experiments. Billions of corpses, evidence of genocide.

**The Relay** (Communications Hub)
Massive station broadcasting across systems. Heavily defended. Crew's final battle location to broadcast Miranda truth.

**Niska's Skyplex** (Space Station)
Criminal enterprise and torture facility. Industrial, menacing. Site of crew's rescue mission.

**Training House** (Memory Location)
Where River was held and experimented on. Sterile, clinical, horrifying. Seen in flashbacks and nightmares.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Shepherd Book's Past**
The preacher is former Operative. His "redemption" is why he understands pursuit tactics. Has contacts in dark places.

**Twist 2: The Reavers' Origin**
Not natural evolution but government experiment gone wrong. Miranda Pax program created them. Makes them tragic as well as terrifying.

**Twist 3: Inara's Illness**
Why she left core worlds. Terminal condition. Chose to spend remaining time free rather than comfortable.

**Twist 4: Jayne's Betrayal (Optional)**
Enormous bounty tempts Jayne to sell out River. Caught before succeeding. Crew votes whether to space him. Character defining choice.

**Twist 5: The Operative's Redemption**
Villain realizes he serves evil. Doesn't become good, but stops hunting them. Ambiguous ending for antagonist.

**Twist 6: Alliance Connection**
Someone in crew has Alliance connection they didn't disclose. Complicates trust. Reveal during interrogation.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Broadcast Miranda truth, survive, expose conspiracy
**Moral Victory**: Keep crew together and alive, don't compromise core values
**Pyrrhic Victory**: Expose truth but lose crew members, ship destroyed
**Total Defeat**: Captured, River taken, truth suppressed, crew disbanded
**Bittersweet Victory**: Win but permanent fugitive status, can never go home
