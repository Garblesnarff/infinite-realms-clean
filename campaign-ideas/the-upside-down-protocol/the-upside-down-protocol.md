## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–18 sessions)

A three-act supernatural mystery about childhood bravery, government cover-ups, and the horrors that lurk in parallel dimensions.

*   **Act I — The Vanishing (Sessions 1–6):** Young Willam goes missing after escaping from the Hawkridge National Laboratory. His friends—a group of kids who play tabletop games and use message-sending cantrips—begin investigating. They encounter Eleven, a girl with powerful psychic abilities who escaped the same lab. Together, they discover the Upside Down and the monstrous Demogorgon that hunts between dimensions.
*   **Act II — The Gate (Sessions 7–12):** The laboratory's experiments have torn a rift between the Material Plane and the Upside Down. The Demogorgon is only the first threat. As the kids grow in power and confidence, they must close the Gate while evading government agents who will kill to protect their secrets. Meanwhile, Willam survives in the Upside Down, leaving cryptic messages through magical communications.
*   **Act III — The Mind Flayer (Sessions 13–18):** Closing the Gate wasn't enough—the Mind Flayer, a massive psychic entity from the Upside Down, has possessed Willam and is using him to open new gates and spread its influence. The players must save their friend, battle an army of mind-controlled townsfolk, and destroy the Mind Flayer before it consumes both dimensions.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of friendship, childhood bravery in the face of incomprehensible horror, and the consequences of unchecked experimentation. The central question: "Can children who are dismissed and underestimated save the world when adults have failed?" Players must balance being kids with being heroes, maintaining their bonds while facing trauma and terror. The campaign celebrates found family and the courage to fight for those you love, even against impossible odds.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Kid Heroes** (Age and Innocence)
*   Players are children (ages 10-14), which has mechanical implications:
    *   They have lower physical stats but high Charisma and unique abilities tied to friendship.
    *   Adults often dismiss or don't believe them, requiring creative problem-solving.
    *   They can use childhood skills: squeeze through small spaces, go unnoticed in adult conversations, and have access to kid-specific networks (other children, secret hideouts).

### 2. **The Friend Bond** (Inspiration System)
*   When players work together and support each other emotionally, they gain Friend Tokens.
*   Friend Tokens can be spent to:
    *   Grant advantage to an ally
    *   Take damage for a friend
    *   Automatically succeed on a save against fear
    *   Manifest a shared moment of courage (brief buff to the whole party)

### 3. **Psychic Awakening**
*   As players spend time near the Upside Down and Eleven, some develop minor psychic abilities:
    *   Telekinesis (minor object manipulation)
    *   Telepathy (sense emotions or send simple thoughts)
    *   Clairvoyance (visions of the Upside Down)
*   These powers grow stronger but come with risks—using them attracts the Mind Flayer's attention.

### 4. **The Upside Down** (Parallel Dimension)
*   The Upside Down is a mirror of the Material Plane. Players can use their knowledge of Hawkridge to navigate it.
*   Everything in the Upside Down is cold, decayed, and filled with floating spores (Constitution saves or become poisoned).
*   Creatures from the Upside Down are vulnerable to fire and radiant damage.
*   Communication between dimensions is possible through magic, lights, and psychic connections.

### 5. **Investigation and Clues**
*   Players must piece together clues like a mystery: strange sounds, flickering lights, magical residue, government documents.
*   Adults rarely believe them, so they must gather hard evidence or solve problems themselves.
