# The Golden Colosseum - World-Building Specification

## The Eternal Empire

**Society:** Hierarchical (Emperor, Senate, Citizens, Freed, Slaves). Gladiators occupy strange position: slaves but celebrated. Victory can earn freedom. Most remain property.

**The Games:** Religious significance, honor the gods. Political tool, keep masses content. Economic driver, massive betting. Cultural cornerstone, defines empire.

**Gladiator Types:**
- **Secutor:** Heavily armored, sword and shield
- **Retiarius:** Net and trident, light armor, agile
- **Murmillo:** Gladius and large shield, fish-crested helmet
- **Thraex:** Curved sword, small shield, aggressive
- **Dimachaerus:** Dual wielding, unarmored, flashy
- **Sagittarius:** Archer, rare, crowd favorite
- **Bestiarius:** Beast fighter, specialized

**Match Types:**
- **Munera:** One-on-one duels, most common
- **Proelio:** Team battles, coordinated tactics
- **Venatio:** Beast hunts, dangerous creatures
- **Naumachiae:** Naval battles, flooded arena
- **Equestria:** Mounted combat, chariot racing
- **Execution:** Criminal punishment (players avoid this)

**The Ludus System:** Schools train gladiators. Lanista owns and manages. Different schools rivalry. Spartans vs. Gauls vs. Thracians. Training brutal but effective. Bonds form between fighters.

**Crowd Psychology:** Fickle but follows patterns. Love underdogs and comebacks. Hate cowards. Respect honor. Bloodthirsty but appreciate skill. Political manipulation possible.

**Political Intrigue:** Senators sponsor gladiators. Use them for assassinations. Bet enormous sums. Corruption and fixing. Succession plots. Games as proxy wars.

**Religion and Honor:** Gods watch the games. Death in arena is honorable. Cowardice is disgrace. Proper rites for fallen. Gladiators have own gods/traditions.

**Path to Freedom:** Win enough matches. Earn wooden sword (rudis). Become lanista or citizen. Or die trying. Most never see freedom. Retirement rare.
