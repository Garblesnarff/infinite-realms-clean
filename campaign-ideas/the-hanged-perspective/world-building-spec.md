# The Hanged Perspective - World-Building Specification

## The World Tree's Nature

The great tree connects all realms, hanging from cosmic branch itself. From normal perspective, it's rooted in ground. From inverted view while hanging, it dangles from above. Both are true.

## How Hanging Works

When suspended upside-down willingly, blood flow changes, perspective inverts, mind opens to truths invisible from upright position. Not metaphor—literal different view reveals different reality. The world contains layers visible only from specific angles.

## The Corruption

Someone poisoning the tree to force enlightenment. But enlightenment can't be forced. Mandatory wisdom becomes madness. The Hanging Master, terrified that people won't voluntarily seek truth, is creating the very problem he fears.

## Enlightenment vs. Madness

Voluntary hanging + patience = enlightenment
Forced hanging + resistance = madness
The difference is consent and surrender

## The Inverted Village

Some who achieved enlightenment never came down. Built lives upside-down. Literally walk on ceilings, see world permanently reversed. Most enlightened beings in realm. Also most alien to normal perspective.

## The Paradox Philosophy

All wisdom in this realm is paradoxical:
- Surrender to gain control
- Die to live
- Fall to rise
- Lose to win
- Give up to receive

## Time While Hanging

Flows strangely. Minutes feel like hours, hours like minutes. Patience required. Rushing guarantees failure. The lesson: Wisdom comes when ready, not when demanded.

## The Tree's Secret

From upside-down view, the "roots" are actually branches reaching upward. The tree hangs from something beyond sight. Implications: Maybe all of reality is inverted from true perspective. Everything we think is foundational is actually suspended.

## Mysteries

- What if the Hanging Master is right and forced enlightenment is necessary?
- Can you return to normal view after seeing inverted truth?
- Is permanent hanging ascension or escape?
- What is the tree hanging from?
