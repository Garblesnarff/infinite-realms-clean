# The Hanged Perspective - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
- Entire world rendered upside-down for hanged characters
- World Tree: Massive, ancient, with hanging figures like fruit
- Inverted architecture when seen from hanging position
- Hanged Prophet: Serene despite position, halo of enlightenment around head
- Rope marks transforming into wisdom symbols
- Everything has two views: right-side-up (mundane) and upside-down (true)

## Music and Sound
- Suspended, floating musical tones
- Creaking rope and tree sounds as rhythm
- Inverted harmonies—familiar songs played backwards reveal new melodies
- Silence used for moments of letting go
- Enlightenment: Crystal clear tones of understanding

## Voice Acting
- **Hanged Prophet**: Calm acceptance, speaks slowly, deep wisdom, "From here, I see what you cannot while standing"
- **Hanging Master**: Forceful despite philosophy, fear underlying control, "You MUST see the truth"
- **Inverted One**: Speaks in reversals, opposites, confusing but profound
- **Mad Hanged**: Broken speech, wisdom and madness mixed

## Taglines
- "Surrender to See"
- "The World Makes Sense Upside-Down"
- "Let Go to Hold On"
