# Creative Brief: The Heroes' Registration Act

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Superhero Realism (Marvel Cinematic-inspired)

Inspired by the grounded, dramatic aesthetic of modern superhero films like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's *Captain America: Civil War*. This style aims to capture the moral complexity, urban grittiness, and emotional weight of heroes in conflict, where costumes are practical, damage is real, and every fight carries consequences.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Realism and Consequences:** Show battle damage, weathering on armor, and the emotional toll on characters' faces.
*   **Urban and Grounded Settings:** Focus on city environments, government buildings, and realistic battle locations rather than fantastical realms.
*   **Dramatic Tension:** Highlight the conflict between heroes through composition, with characters facing each other across dividing lines, broken shields, or shattered friendships.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, political, divided, dramatic, morally ambiguous, tense, grounded, heroic tragedy.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of broken trust and ideological warfare. The atmosphere should be heavy with consequence, where every confrontation feels personal and painful. The world feels real and lived-in, with visible scars from the conflict.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed, with an emphasis on practical armor and clothing. Lines are clean for architectural elements but can be rough and sketchy for action scenes to convey motion and violence.
*   **Forms:** Hero costumes should blend medieval fantasy armor with practical, functional design—reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate armor with heraldic symbols. Architecture is urban fantasy: stone buildings, government halls, city streets.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, cinematic digital painting in a gritty superhero realism style. Focus on the practical, battle-worn armor of Captain Valor, showing dents and scratches from recent combat."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted and desaturated, with pops of iconic hero colors (red, blue, silver) that stand out against gray urban backgrounds. Use shadow and contrast to create dramatic lighting.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often overcast or twilight lighting, with dramatic shadows and highlights that emphasize moral ambiguity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of muted grays and blues for the urban environment, with Captain Valor's iconic red and gold armor standing out in dramatic contrast, lit by harsh overhead lights."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters wear practical fantasy-superhero armor that shows signs of use and wear. Faces show emotion—determination, grief, anger, doubt.
*   **Heroes:** Each hero has distinctive visual elements (Valor's shield, Sentinel's mechanical gauntlets), but all look like they've been through war. Capes are torn, armor is dented, faces are scarred.
*   **Expression:** Characters often look conflicted, determined, or grief-stricken. Eye contact between opposing heroes conveys the personal nature of the conflict.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Ironclad Sentinel, wearing battle-damaged mechanical armor with exposed gears and cracked plating. His face is set in grim determination, with visible exhaustion in his eyes."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Urban fantasy settings: cobblestone streets, government buildings with grand architecture, damaged city squares, underground hideouts. Everything looks realistic and functional.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often shows the aftermath of conflict—broken windows, scorch marks, damaged buildings. Crowds of civilians watching or fleeing. Government banners promoting the Registration Act.
*   **Details:** Protest signs, wanted posters of unregistered heroes, propaganda art, memorial sites for tragedy victims, registration checkpoints.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the damaged city of Millhaven, with a memorial wall covered in names and flowers in the foreground. Heroes in armor walk past, heads down, while citizens watch with mixed expressions of fear and anger."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and moody lighting. Often uses strong directional light sources that create deep shadows, emphasizing the moral grayness of the situation.
*   **Shadows:** Heavy, realistic shadows that can obscure faces or create dramatic silhouettes. Light vs. shadow often represents the ideological divide.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reinforces the emotional tone—harsh spotlight interrogations, dramatic sunset confrontations, dark underground meetings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh, dramatic lighting from above, casting long shadows across the floor between Captain Valor and the Ironclad Sentinel as they face each other in confrontation."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses divided compositions—characters on opposite sides of the frame, separated by physical or symbolic barriers. Also uses close-ups on faces to show emotional conflict.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (streets, corridors) to create depth. Frame heroes in opposition. Use shattered objects (broken shields, cracked emblems) as symbolic elements. Over-the-shoulder shots of heroes facing each other.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition showing Captain Valor on the left side and the Ironclad Sentinel on the right, separated by a vertical line of light. Both are in battle stances, their weapons raised, with a crowd of heroes behind each of them."

## Voice

A commanding, authoritative voice with the gravitas of a war documentary narrator. The tone is measured and serious, with an undercurrent of tragedy and regret. The voice carries the weight of difficult choices and broken friendships, speaking with the authority of someone who has witnessed idealism clash with reality. There's a subtle weariness, as if recounting a conflict that should never have happened. Role: A veteran hero turned historian, documenting a civil war that tore the realm apart.
