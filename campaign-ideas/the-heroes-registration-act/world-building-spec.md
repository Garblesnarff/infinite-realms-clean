### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Heroes' Registration Act**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** After a catastrophic incident where heroes battling a supervillain cause massive civilian casualties in the city of Millhaven, the kingdom passes the Heroes' Registration Act, requiring all powered individuals to register with the Crown and submit to government oversight. The realm's greatest champions are divided: Captain Valor and his allies believe registration is necessary accountability, while the Ironclad Sentinel and his followers see it as tyranny that will lead to abuse. The players must choose a side—or forge their own path—as friendships shatter, alliances crumble, and hero fights hero in a conflict that threatens to tear the realm apart.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Millhaven Incident: what exactly happened, who was involved, and how the public reacted.
    *   Write the history of heroes in this realm, from their first appearance to their current status.
    *   Describe the Heroes' Registration Act in full legal detail, including its provisions and enforcement mechanisms.
    *   Explain the political structure of the Crown and how the Act was passed.
