**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** daemons as souls, parallel worlds, theological conspiracy, Dust mystery, coming of age, church oppression, free will
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In a world where every person's soul manifests as an external animal companion (daemon), the party discovers rifts between parallel worlds and a conspiracy by the Magisterium (authoritarian church) to suppress knowledge of Dust—mysterious particles linked to consciousness and sin. They journey through multiple realities using the alethiometer (truth-telling compass), encounter armored bears, witches, and dimension-traveling scientists, while unraveling a plot to sever children from their daemons to prevent "original sin." The campaign explores free will, consciousness, authority versus freedom, and the nature of the soul.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Daemon Companions**
*   Every player has a daemon (animal form of their soul, opposite gender, telepathic bond).
*   **Settles at Puberty:** Children's daemons shapeshift; adults' are fixed (reflecting personality).
*   **Distance Limit:** Being separated from daemon causes agonizing pain. Severing is trauma.

### 2. **The Alethiometer**
*   Truth-telling compass with symbolic needles that answer questions when read correctly.
*   **Mechanics:** Intelligence checks to interpret symbols. Provides cryptic but truthful answers.

### 3. **Dust Particles**
*   Mysterious elementary particles attracted to consciousness, especially after puberty.
*   **Mechanical Effect:** The Magisterium sees Dust as original sin; scientists see it as consciousness itself.

### 4. **Intercision (Severing)**
*   Magisterium's process to separate children from daemons, preventing Dust attraction (robbing free will).
*   **Consequences:** Severed children become hollow, obedient, soulless.

### 5. **Spectres**
*   Soul-eating entities in Cittàgazze, invisible to children, deadly to adults.
*   **Mechanics:** Adults must avoid them or lose their daemons/souls.

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Authority Overthrown:** The party helps Asriel destroy the Authority, freeing humanity from theological tyranny.
*   **Magisterium Reformed:** The party exposes intercision, forcing church reform without total war.
*   **Republic of Heaven:** The party builds a new society based on knowledge, not faith.
*   **Tragic Sacrifice:** The party prevents apocalypse but loses members (daemon-severing, dimension-trapping).
