**Law:** Decided at Thing, disputes settled by compensation or holmgang (duel).

## Ragnarok Prophecy (Völuspá)

**Signs:**
1. Fimbulwinter: three years without summer
2. Brother kills brother
3. Wolves swallow sun and moon
4. Stars fall from sky
5. Mountains collapse
6. All bonds break

**The Battle:**

- Surtr burns world with fire
- Earth sinks into sea

**After:**
- Earth rises anew from water
- Balder returns from death
- Two humans (Lif and Lifthrasir) survive in tree

- Cycle begins again?

## The Einherjar

**Selection:** Valkyries choose who dies nobly in battle. Half go to Odin's Valhalla, half to Freya's Folkvangr.

**Valhalla Life:**
- Fight all day (training for Ragnarok)
- Wounds heal at nightfall
- Feast on boar Sæhrímnir (killed and reborn daily)
- Drink mead from Heidrun (goat whose udders flow mead)
- Prepare for Ragnarok

**At Ragnarok:** 800 einherjar march from each of Valhalla's 540 doors to fight beside gods. All die.

## Legendary Weapons and Treasures

**Mjolnir:** Thor's hammer, returns when thrown, kills giants

**Skíðblaðnir:** Foldable ship that always has fair wind

## Runes and Magic

**Runes:** Odin sacrificed himself on Yggdrasil for nine days to gain rune-knowledge. 24 runes, each with meaning and power.

**Galdr:** Spoken/sung rune magic
**Seidr:** Shamanic magic, trance states, prophecy. Practiced by Freya, taught to Odin. Considered unmanly for men (but powerful).

**Rune Uses:**
- Divination
- Protection
- Curses
- Healing
- Battle magic

## Blood-Feud Mechanics

**How It Works:**
1. Family member killed
2. Honor demands vengeance or wergild (blood-price)
3. If vengeance chosen, kill equivalent member of enemy family
4. Enemy family must now seek vengeance
5. Cycle continues generations

**Ending Feuds:**
- Full wergild payment accepted
- Marriage between families (peace-weaver)
- Thing declares feud settled
- Total destruction of one family

**Outlawry:** Worst punishment. No legal protection, can be killed by anyone, must leave community.

## Giants (Jötnar)

**Not All Evil:** Some marry gods, some are wise (Mimir). Represent chaos and old power, not pure evil.

**Types:**
- **Frost Giants:** Jotunheim dwellers
- **Fire Giants:** Muspelheim dwellers, led by Surtr
- **Mountain Giants:** Stone and earth

**Role:** Chaos balanced against gods' order. Neither can exist without the other.

## Wyrd (Fate)

**Philosophy:** Everything is predetermined. The Norns weave every thread. Even gods know their fates (Odin knows he'll die at Ragnarok).

**Free Will:** Exists within fate—how you face destiny defines you, but outcome is fixed.

**Heroism:** Knowing you're doomed and fighting anyway. Courage in face of inevitable death.

## Supernatural Creatures

**Draugr:** Undead warriors, guard barrows, super-strong, cannot be killed normally
**Trolls:** Stone beings, turn to stone in sunlight
**Elves:** Beautiful, magical, capricious
**Dwarves:** Master smiths, live underground, made legendary weapons
**Landvættir:** Land spirits, must be respected
**Valkyries:** Odin's warrior-women, choose the slain

## Viking Life Details

**Longhouses:** Central hearth, bench along walls for sleeping/sitting
**Longships:** Shallow draft for rivers, 16-30 meters, dragon prows
**Raids:** Summer activity, winter at home farming
**Food:** Fish, meat (boar, cattle), bread, dairy, beer, mead
**Clothing:** Wool, linen, furs. Men: tunic and trousers. Women: long dress with apron.

## Historical Context

**Viking Age:** ~793-1066 CE
**Raids:** England, Ireland, France, Constantinople, even North America
**Settlement:** Iceland, Greenland, Normandy
**Religion:** Gradually Christianized (creates tension in campaign)
**Society:** Egalitarian by medieval standards, women had property rights

## The Philosophical Core

**Question:** If fate is fixed and Ragnarok is coming, why fight?

**Answer:** Because how you face doom defines you. Glory outlives death. Better to die standing than live kneeling. The fight itself has meaning even if outcome is predetermined.

**Paradox:** Gods know they'll die at Ragnarok. They fight anyway. This is the highest heroism—doomed courage.

The campaign asks: **How do you live when you know you'll die? What makes life meaningful when fate is fixed?**

Norse answer: Glory, loyalty, courage, going down fighting. The manner of your death matters more than avoiding it. Die well, be remembered, live forever in song.
