# Angel Descent: Creative Brief

## Art Style: Psychological Surrealism

**Evangelion Units:** Biomechanical, unsettling organic-tech fusion, restrained like beasts, too-human faces

**Angels:** Geometrically impossible, beautiful and horrifying, defy physics, each unique

**NERV Aesthetic:** Brutalist architecture, cold fluorescents, antiseptic, deliberately dehumanizing

**Psychological Breaks:** Reality distortion, impossible perspectives, symbolic imagery

## Color Palettes

**Primary:** Sterile White (#F0F0F0), Blood Red (#B22222), Purple Eva (#800080), Clinical Green (#2AAA8A)

**Angels:** Pure White light, rainbow refractions, incomprehensible colors

**Mental Break:** Desaturated reality, red/black nightmare imagery, symbolic

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme:** "Cruel Angel's Thesis" style—upbeat melody contrasting dark lyrics, J-pop with apocalypse

**Angel Battles:** Choir vocals, religious hymns distorted, reality tearing sounds

**Psychological Horror:** Silence punctuated by breathing, whispers of contamination

**Berserk Mode:** Feral roaring, bones breaking, wet organic sounds

## Voice Direction

**Commander Gendo:** Cold, emotionless, soft-spoken menace, manipulative father

**Misato:** Forced cheerfulness over depression, drinks heavily, maternal but broken

**Rei:** Monotone, emotionless, gradually developing feeling, disturbing when she smiles

**Asuka:** Loud, aggressive German-accented English, cracks showing in facade

**Kaworu:** Gentle, unsettlingly kind, alien despite human appearance

## Cinematic Moments

**First Activation:** Eva's eyes lighting up, biomechanical awakening, pilots screaming in neural pain

**Angel Geometry:** Impossible shapes unfolding, physics breaking, incomprehensible horror

**Berserk Sequence:** Eva tearing apart Angel with bare hands, blood everywhere, pilot trapped watching

**Instrumentality:** Everyone dissolving into orange fluid, boundaries between people vanishing, abstract horror

**Kaworu's Death:** Party forced to kill kindest person they've met, his acceptance making it worse
