# Angel Descent
**Tagline:** *You can (not) save the world*

## Campaign Overview

Fifteen years ago, the Second Impact destroyed Antarctica and killed three billion people. The official story: a meteor strike. The truth: humanity's first encounter with an Angel—an incomprehensible being from beyond our understanding. Now, the Angels have returned, attacking the fortress city of Neo-Tokyo-3 with increasing frequency. Each Angel is unique, reality-defying, and immune to conventional weapons.

Humanity's last hope: the Evangelions. Giant biomechanical entities that might be technology, might be living beings, might be something else entirely. Only certain teenagers can pilot them—those who meet specific psychological and genetic criteria. The players are among the chosen few, recruited by the secretive organization NERV to pilot Evangelions and defend humanity from extinction.

But nothing is what it seems. The Evangelions are powered by human souls. The Angels might not be enemies. NERV's commander has an agenda beyond survival. The players' parents are mysteriously absent or dead. And each battle brings the pilots closer to psychological breakdown as they synchronize with their Evangelions at deeper and more damaging levels.

The campaign explores trauma, parental abandonment, the weaponization of children, and the question of whether saving humanity is worth losing your own humanity. It culminates in revelations about the true nature of Angels, Evangelions, and humanity's desperate plan to trigger controlled extinction.

## Core Themes

- **Psychological Horror:** Mental collapse, identity loss, trauma
- **Parental Failure:** Adults using children as weapons and shields
- **Existential Dread:** What does it mean to be human?
- **Isolation vs. Connection:** The AT Field as metaphor for emotional walls
- **Religious Symbolism:** Angels, Evas, apocalypse reimagined
- **Coming of Age Through Trauma:** Childhood stolen by war
- **The Burden of Destiny:** Chosen ones with no choice

## Session Breakdown

### Arc 1: You Are (Not) Alone (Sessions 1-10)
Sessions 1-3: Party recruited as Eva pilots. First synchronization tests. Meeting NERV staff. First Angel attack—baptism by fire. City-scale destruction, civilian casualties. Players barely survive.

Sessions 4-6: Training and school life. Balancing normal teenage experiences with apocalyptic responsibility. Second Angel attacks with reality-warping abilities. One pilot's sync ratio plummets from trauma. Introduction to the mystery: what ARE the Evas?

Sessions 7-10: Third Angel penetrates deep into NERV headquarters. Party must fight in confined spaces. Discovery: Evas have their own will. When a pilot loses consciousness, Eva goes berserk and brutal. The violence is horrifying. Seeds of doubt about what they're piloting.

### Arc 2: Descent Into Madness (Sessions 11-20)
Sessions 11-13: Fourth Angel is a child. Appears harmless. NERV orders its destruction anyway. Moral crisis. Some pilots refuse; others obey. Consequences either way. Investigation reveals Angels might be victims too.

Sessions 14-16: Synchronization experiments push pilots deeper. They begin experiencing Eva memories—ancient, alien, terrible. Mental contamination starts. Personality changes. One pilot absorbed into their Eva, lost inside.

Sessions 17-20: Mass production Eva units introduced. Pilots discover NERV has been cloning them, creating backup pilots. Their replaceability is literal. Meeting their own corpses. Existential horror. Commander's plan involves Human Instrumentality—merging all consciousness into one.

### Arc 3: The End of Evangelion (Sessions 21-30)
Sessions 21-25: Rebellion against NERV. Pilots refuse to be used. Military coup attempts to seize Evas. Angels reveal they're trying to prevent Human Instrumentality. Party must choose: defend the organization using them, or ally with incomprehensible beings.

Sessions 26-30: Final Angel is one of the pilots—they are transforming. The boundary between human and Angel is breaking down. Instrumentality begins. Reality dissolves. Each player trapped in their own psychological hell, confronting their trauma, given choice: remain individual and suffer, or merge and lose self. Campaign ends with their decision determining humanity's fate.

**NERV Headquarters:** Underground pyramid, descending levels represent descent into truth and madness. Bottom level: Terminal Dogma where secrets are kept.

**The School:** Normal life facade. Pilots attend classes between apocalypses. Represents lost childhood.

**Terminal Dogma:** Deepest level. Contains Lilith—progenitor of humanity. Also contains truth about Second Impact.

**The Sea of Dirac:** Dimensional space inside an Angel. Infinite darkness. Psychological horror zone.

## Unique Mechanics

### Synchronization Ratio
- Roll percentile die to determine sync each session
- 0-30%: Cannot pilot. 30-60%: Functional but disadvantage. 60-80%: Standard. 80-100%: Advantage but risk. 100%+: Overwhelming power, losing self

### AT Field (Absolute Terror Field)
- Both Evas and Angels possess AT Fields
- Represents ego/boundary between self and other
- Defensive barrier requiring Will saves to penetrate
- Neutralizing requires confronting personal trauma
- Metaphor: Letting down emotional walls to hurt someone

### Mental Contamination
- Track psychological damage separately from physical
- Each battle causes trauma—failed Wisdom saves accumulate
- Contamination effects: flashbacks, personality shifts, hallucinations
- At threshold: pilot absorbed into Eva or rejects piloting

### Berserk Mode
- If pilot loses consciousness, Eva acts independently
- Hyper-violent, overwhelming power
- Attacks anything including allies and civilians
- Pilot experiences it but cannot control
- Trauma from watching self commit atrocities

### Instrumentality Mechanics
- Late campaign: reality begins dissolving
- Players experience others' memories and pain
- Choice to maintain AT Field (remain individual) or lower it (merge)
- Consequences: Individual = suffering but free; Merged = peace but extinction of self

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1:** Evas contain human souls—specifically the pilots' mothers

**Twist 2:** Second Impact was caused by humans trying to become gods

**Twist 3:** Angels are trying to save humanity from itself

**Twist 4:** Commander plans to merge with god-entity to reunite with dead wife, apocalypse is side effect

**Twist 5:** Rei is clone of Commander's wife, disposable, 23 backup bodies exist

**Twist 6:** One player is actually an Angel sleeper agent, doesn't know it yet

**Twist 7:** The "souls" in Evas are suffering eternally, pilots cause their mothers pain

**Twist 8:** Final Angel is sympathetic, killing them dooms humanity to Instrumentality

**Twist 9:** Players' genetic compatibility is because they're designer babies, engineered for this

**Twist 10:** Instrumentality already happened before, this is a cycle

## Victory Conditions

**True Ending:** Reject both NERV and Angels, find third option, preserve individuality while ending cycle

**Bittersweet:** Stop Instrumentality but most pilots die or permanently damaged

**Tragic:** Instrumentality succeeds, humanity becomes one consciousness, individuals cease to exist

**Pyrrhic:** Angels defeated but at cost of pilots' humanity, they become the monsters

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Instrumentality:** All humans merged, game ends in abstract philosophical epilogue

**Angel Victory:** Humanity exterminated, Angels inherit Earth

**Mutual Destruction:** Both sides annihilate each other

**Loss of Self:** All pilots absorbed into Evas, become vegetative
