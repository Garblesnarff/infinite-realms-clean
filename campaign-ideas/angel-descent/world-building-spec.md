# Angel Descent: World-Building Specification

## NERV Organization

**Structure:**
- Commander (absolute authority)
- Vice Commander (political liaison)
- Operations Director (tactical command)
- Chief Scientist (research and development)
- Pilots (child soldiers, age 14-15)

**Facilities:**
- Eva Cages (massive biomechanical restraint systems)
- Test Labs (horrific experiments on Angel/Eva tissue)
- Pilot Living Quarters (sterile, monitored constantly)
- Central Dogma (command center)
- Terminal Dogma (forbidden lowest level)

**Funding:** United Nations but really controlled by SEELE (shadow government)

## The Angels - Complete List

**First Angel - Adam:** Progenitor, caused Second Impact, crucified in Terminal Dogma

**Second Angel - Lilith:** Humanity's progenitor, secretly held by NERV, merged with creates god

**Third through Seventeenth Angels:** Various attacks, each with unique ability:
- Sachiel: Regeneration, beam weapons
- Shamshel: Energy whips, learns combat
- Ramiel: Geometric, sniper beam, drills toward NERV
- Gaghiel: Aquatic, swallows Eva
- Israfel: Splits into two, synchronized attacks
- Sandalphon: Embryonic, awakens in volcano
- Matarael: Corrosive acid
- Sahaquiel: Orbital bombardment
- Ireul: Microscopic, hacks computers
- Leliel: Shadow entity, pocket dimension
- Bardiel: Possesses Eva
- Zeruel: Most powerful, penetrates deep into NERV
- Arael: Mental attack, psychological invasion
- Armisael: Infects pilot, merges with Eva
- Tabris: Kaworu, human-form Angel

**Angel Nature:** Beings trying to reach Lilith/Adam to trigger Third Impact (evolution/extinction event)

## Evangelion Details

**What They Are:** Cloned from Adam/Lilith, biomechanical organisms with armor restraints

**Soul Bonding:** Contain human souls (mothers of pilots), which enables synchronization

**Unit-00 (Rei's):** Prototype, unstable, no soul initially, mysterious

**Unit-01 (Party's):** Contains Commander's wife's soul, most powerful, goes berserk

**Unit-02 (Asuka's):** Production model, red, designed for combat

**Mass Production Units:** Soul-less, grotesque, final battle nightmares

**Limitations:**
- Power cable limits (5 minutes internal battery)
- Synchronization requirements
- Pilot mental state affects performance
- Can reject pilots who lose compatibility

## The Truth About Second Impact

**Official Story:** Meteor strike Antarctica, 3 billion dead

**Reality:**
- NERV's predecessor organization found Adam
- Attempted to merge with it
- Triggered cataclysmic explosion
- Melted ice caps, shifted Earth's axis
- Created Angels' awakening conditions

**Cover-Up:** Governments maintain meteor lie to prevent panic about human culpability

## SEELE (Secret Organization)

**Composition:** Shadow council of old men, control governments

**Goal:** Trigger Human Instrumentality Project—merge all humans into single consciousness

**Philosophy:** Individual suffering will end if all become one, evolution beyond flesh

**Methods:** Manipulate NERV, orchestrate Angel attacks to advance toward Third Impact

**Dead Sea Scrolls:** Ancient documents predicting Angel attacks, their prophecy guides SEELE

## Human Instrumentality Project

**Concept:** All human souls merge, AT Fields dissolve, everyone becomes primordial soup of consciousness

**Benefits:** No loneliness, pain, conflict, or death—perfect unity

**Cost:** Death of individuality, extinction of human species as we know it

**Process:** Requires Adam, Lilith, and Evangelion to merge, causing Third Impact

**Commander's Personal Goal:** Not about humanity—he wants to reunite with dead wife in merged consciousness

## Psychological Profiles

**Why These Pilots:**
- Genetic compatibility with Evas (mothers' souls)
- Specific psychological damage makes them controllable
- Desperate need for approval makes them obedient
- Age 14: maximum synchronization potential

**Training:** Deliberate trauma to increase desperation, dependency, willingness to sacrifice

**Expendability:** Clones can replace them, they know this eventually

## Daily Life Dynamics

**School:** Normal classes, hiding true purpose, classmates unaware

**NERV Living:** Sterile apartments, surveillance, isolation from peers

**Relationships:** Forbidden to form deep bonds (lowers combat effectiveness), happens anyway

**Media:** Pilots are celebrities/scapegoats depending on last battle outcome

## Timeline of Events

**15 Years Ago:** Second Impact
**14 Years Ago:** NERV founded
**10 Years Ago:** Eva development begins
**5 Years Ago:** Pilot candidates identified
**1 Year Ago:** First successful Eva activation
**Campaign Start:** Third Angel attack, recruits activated

## Technology Level

**2030s Setting:** Near-future, advanced but recognizable

**Unique Tech:**
- Eva biotechnology (incomprehensible even to creators)
- AT Field manipulation
- Dimensional physics (Angels break reality)

**Everything Else:** Slightly advanced modern Earth

## Religious Symbolism

**Christian Imagery:** Angels named from Judeo-Christian hierarchy, crosses, spears, apocalypse

**Kabbalah:** Tree of Life diagrams, SEELE uses mystical knowledge

**Gnosticism:** Merge with divine, escape material suffering

**Note:** Symbolism used thematically, not literally religious

This world-building creates a campaign where giant robot battles are backdrop to psychological horror, where saving the world requires children to lose their childhoods, and where victory might mean choosing suffering over peace.
