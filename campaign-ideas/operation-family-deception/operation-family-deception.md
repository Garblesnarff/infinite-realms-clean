# Operation Family Deception
## *"For the Mission... And For Us"*

### Campaign Overview

In a world where spy agencies adopt war orphans and train them as agents, the players are a fabricated family of elite spies with a shared cover: they're the Forgers, a normal family living in the city of Berlint. "Father" Twilight is the realm's greatest spy. "Mother" Thorn is a legendary assassin. "Daughter" Anya is a telepath trying to act normal. And "Dog" Bond is a precognitive hound. None of them know each other's secrets (well, except Anya, who knows everyone's secrets but is enjoying having a family too much to tell).

They must maintain their cover while completing dangerous missions, keeping supernatural abilities hidden, and accidentally forming genuine family bonds. It's a heartwarming comedy about found family wrapped in a spy thriller, where the greatest mission becomes protecting this precious, weird, illegally-formed family they've created.

### Campaign Tone

This is Spy x Family directly—wholesome found family comedy wrapped in spy thriller. Balance genuine danger with heartwarming moments and comedy. Make the family's genuine love and growth the heart of the campaign while maintaining real stakes.

Emphasize the comedy of competent killers being incompetent at normal life. Anya's internal commentary on everyone's secrets is constant source of humor and dramatic irony. Bond's elaborate future visions that humans completely misinterpret are slapstick gold.

But beneath comedy, this is about healing through family. Twilight is traumatized orphan who lost faith in people. Yor is weapon learning to be person. Anya just wants to not be experiment, just be loved daughter. They need each other even if mission brought them together.

The campaign should feel warm and funny even during dangerous moments. Combat is stylish and exaggerated (Yor's superhuman assassin skills, Twilight's perfect spy techniques). Magic exists but is subtle (Anya's telepathy, Bond's precognition).

Most importantly: make players love this weird little family. Make them want to protect it. Because the real mission was never Operation Strix—it was Operation Family all along.

Welcome home, Forgers. For the mission... and for real.
