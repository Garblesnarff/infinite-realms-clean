*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the Shattered Sphere solar system, humanity has fractured into three factions: the wealthy Inner Worlders, the militant Martian Coalition, and the exploited Belt miners. The players, a crew of resourceful Belters, discover the Protean Essence—a reality-warping substance from an ancient alien civilization—buried in a remote asteroid. As all three factions race to control this cosmic power, the players must navigate deadly politics, space combat, and horrifying transformations to determine humanity's future among the stars.

    *   Write the history of the Belt's exploitation by Inner World corporations and the birth of the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA).
    *   Describe the Martian Terraforming Project and how it shaped Mars' militant, collectivist culture.
