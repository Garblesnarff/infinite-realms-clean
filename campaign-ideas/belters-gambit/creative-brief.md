# Creative Brief: Belters' Gambit

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Space Realism with Biopunk Horror (The Expanse meets Dead Space)

Inspired by the hard sci-fi aesthetics of *The Expanse* TV series and the body-horror elements of *Dead Space*, this style blends realistic, lived-in space environments with unsettling organic corruption from the Protean Essence. It aims to capture the blue-collar struggle of Belt miners, the political grandeur of faction capitals, and the cosmic horror of ancient alien technology.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Functional Design:** Everything from spacesuits to stations should look practical, worn, and repaired. No sleek, pristine futures—only working-class grit.
*   **Contrast Wealth and Poverty:** Inner World opulence vs. Belt squalor should be stark and visible in every detail.
*   **Organic Horror:** The Protean Essence corrupts through crystalline, biomechanical transformations that merge flesh, metal, and something utterly alien.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, realistic, blue-collar, factional, space opera, biopunk horror, political intrigue, survival, cosmic dread.
*   **Feeling:** The cold loneliness of space punctuated by the warmth of cramped crew quarters. The tension of factional politics. The creeping horror of transformation and alien intelligence.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Hard-edged realism for technology and environments, with organic, flowing lines for Protean corruption. Everything has weight and function.
*   **Textures:** Worn metal, scratched plastic, recycled materials for Belt stations. Polished surfaces and luxury materials for Inner Worlds. Crystalline, pulsing biomatter for Protean elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in hard sci-fi realism style. A Belt mining station corridor with patched walls, exposed wiring, and warning signs in multiple languages. Lighting from flickering fluorescent panels."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Belt Stations:** Desaturated industrial colors—grays, browns, rust orange, with harsh white lighting and deep shadows.
*   **Inner Worlds:** Rich, saturated colors—deep blues, golds, emerald greens, with soft, ambient lighting suggesting luxury.
*   **Mars:** Military reds, steel grays, sand browns, with harsh overhead lighting.
*   **Protean Essence:** Iridescent blues and purples, crystalline whites, sickly bioluminescent greens, with an unsettling glow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of industrial grays and rust orange, with harsh fluorescent white lighting casting sharp shadows. In the background, a pulsing, iridescent blue glow from crystalline growths suggests corruption."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Belters:** Lean, wiry builds from low gravity, wearing patched jumpsuits and cobbled-together EVA suits. Faces show hard lives—scars, tattoos marking station affiliations.
*   **Inner Worlders:** Well-fed, fashionable, wearing tailored suits or elegant dresses. Augmented with subtle, expensive cybernetics.
*   **Martians:** Military bearing, fit and disciplined, in sleek combat armor with Coalition insignia.
*   **Protean-Transformed:** Bodies fused with crystalline growths, limbs elongated or merged, faces partially crystallized but retaining horrifying humanity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Belt miner in their 40s, lean and muscular from low-gravity work, wearing a patched orange jumpsuit with station ID patches. Short hair, weathered face with prominent cheekbones, cybernetic eye replacement (cheap model). Holding a mining laser tool."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Belt Stations:** Rotating drums and asteroids carved into habitats. Cramped, industrial, with visible life support systems. Graffiti and improvised repairs everywhere.
*   **Inner Worlds:** Massive, elegant stations with gardens under domed atriums, zero-gravity lounges, and sweeping views of gas giants or moons.
*   **Mars:** Underground complexes with red-lit corridors, military efficiency, and massive hangar bays carved into Martian rock.
*   **The Derelict:** Impossible geometry, organic architecture that pulses with light, corridors that shift between metallic and fleshy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of Ceres' Hope station interior—a cramped rotating drum habitat with industrial metal walls, exposed pipes, and recycled air vents. Miners in jumpsuits walk past graffiti reading 'Belt Strong.' Harsh overhead lighting creates deep shadows."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Space:** Absolute black backgrounds with harsh, unfiltered starlight. Lighting from ship engines, station lights, or distant suns creates extreme contrast.
*   **Stations:** Artificial lighting—fluorescent, LED, or warm incandescent depending on location. Inner Worlds use soft, ambient lighting; Belt uses harsh, functional lights.
*   **Protean Corruption:** Self-illuminating bioluminescence in eerie colors, casting organic shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by harsh fluorescent white light from above, casting deep shadows in the cramped corridor. In the corner, a faint, pulsing blue-purple glow from Protean crystal growths illuminates twisted biomechanical forms."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic wide shots for space battles and station exteriors. Claustrophobic close-ups for horror moments and cramped interiors. Dutch angles during tension or combat.
*   **Techniques:** Use the vastness of space to emphasize isolation. Frame characters against windows showing the void. Use depth of field to focus on Protean corruption in otherwise normal scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic composition showing a Belt mining ship in the foreground, small against the massive, rotating drum of Tycho Station in the middle distance. The black void of space and distant stars fill the background. The ship's running lights create small points of warm light against the cold metal."

## Voice

A gravelly, middle-aged voice with a Belter accent—a blend of multiple Earth languages with unique cadence, clipped consonants, and musical vowel shifts (think Caribbean mixed with South African). The pacing is quick and efficient, reflecting a life lived in cramped quarters where air is money. The emotion carries working-class defiance, weary pragmatism, and underlying anger at exploitation. Audio quality is clean but with a slight radio distortion, as if transmitted through ship comms. Role: A veteran Belt miner, OPA operative, or ship captain who's seen too much but keeps fighting for the Belt's freedom.
