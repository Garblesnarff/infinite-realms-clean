## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
`[TAG: LORE_CORE]`

### Origin Myth: The Luminescent dawn
History broke eighty years ago with the birth of the "Luminescent Child" in Qing Qing City, a baby who radiated literal light. This wasn't a mutation; it was a metaphysical breach. Scientists call it the **"Paranormal Singularity,"** but the streets call it **The Awakening**. It wasn't just biology evolving; the collective unconscious of humanity began imposing its will on physics. Desires, fears, and eccentricities manifested as **Quirks**. The laws of thermodynamics shattered. Society collapsed into the "Age of Chaos" until the Vigilantes—and later, Professional Heroes—restored order, creating a superhuman society held together by a single pillar: The Symbol of Peace.

### Timeline of the Superhuman Era
1.  **The glowing Baby Incident (Year 0):** The first Quirk manifests. Chaos ensues as 20% of the population develops powers within a decade.
2.  **The collapse of Governments (Year 15):** Traditional militaries fail against telekinetic warlords. The "Meta Liberation Army" attempts a coup in Japan.
3.  **The Vigilante Edict (Year 22):** Civilians using powers to stop criminals are branded vigilantes. The first "Hero Licenses" are drafted in Rhode Island.
4.  **The Day of Black Rain (Year 30):** *[Rare Event]* A villain with a sadness-amplifying quirk cried for 48 hours, causing a rainstorm that induced temporary clinical depression across the hemisphere.
5.  **Rise of All For One (Year 40):** The criminal underworld unites under a single shadow ruler who can steal powers.
6.  **The Nana Shimura Sacrifice (Year 55):** The 7th holder of One For All falls; All Might inherits the torch and flees to America for training.
7.  **The Bronze Age of Heroes (Year 60):** The "Sidekick Union" strikes for better health insurance, leading to the standardized Agency System.
8.  **The Great Sky-Fall (Year 65):** *[Rare Event]* A child's gravity quirk malfunctioned, suspending a frantic herd of dairy cows 5,000 feet over the city for a week. They had to be rescued by helicopter.
9.  **All Might’s Debut (Year 70):** A video of All Might saving 100 people in 10 minutes goes viral. The crime rate in Japan drops by 6% overnight.
10. **The Sludge Incident (Current Year):** A middle school student (the protagonist generation) is attacked by a villain, marking the start of the current narrative arc.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is not just Good vs. Evil; it is **Order vs. Entropy**. Quirks are inherently chaotic; they are reality-breaking glitches. Hero Society attempts to impose rigid structure (Rules, Licenses, Rankings) on this chaos. The Villains represent the natural state of Quirks: unbridled, destructive, and free. The clash is inevitable because Quirks *want* to be used, and suppression leads to the "Quirk Doomsday Theory"—the idea that powers will eventually become too strong for humans to control.

*   **Rule of Cool:** Players can spend "Plus Ultra Points" to ignore physics if the description is cool enough (e.g., punching air to create wind pressure).
*   **Quirk Overuse:** If a player rolls a Natural 1 on a Quirk check, they suffer "Quirk Burnout."
    *   *Effect:* Disadvantage on all rolls for 1d4 rounds, or take 1 level of Exhaustion.

### Plus Ultra Points
A pool of 3-5 points per session.
*   **Spend 1:** Reroll a failed check.

*   **Spend 3:** "Go Beyond" (Take an extra Action, but take 1 level of exhaustion).

### Reputation System
*   **Hero Rank:** Starts at F. Goes to S.
*   **Collateral Damage:** Destroying buildings lowers rank. Saving civilians raises it.
