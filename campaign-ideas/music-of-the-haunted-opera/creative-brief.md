# Creative Brief: Music of the Haunted Opera

## Art Style: Gothic Romance (Victorian Theatrical Horror)

Inspired by Phantom of the Opera's opulent Gothic aesthetic—candlelit catacombs, gilded theater boxes, masked mystery, beauty and horror intertwined.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Rich jewel tones of the opera house—crimson velvet, gold gilding, deep purple shadows. Contrasted with the candlelit amber and darkness of the catacombs. The phantom's lair has black water reflecting candlelight like stars. Christine wears white, the phantom black and mask white.

**Character Design:** Late 19th century Victorian elegance—elaborate opera costumes, period dress with bustle skirts and waistcoats, the phantom's iconic white half-mask and cape, Christine's flowing white gowns, ballet dancers in period costume. The phantom's disfigurement is tragic and horrifying when revealed.

**Environments:** The grand opera house—ornate boxes, massive chandeliers, red velvet curtains, backstage chaos of ropes and scenery. Below: dank stone catacombs with underground lakes, the phantom's beautiful lair decorated with candles, mirrors, and a magnificent pipe organ. Every space is theatrical and dramatic.

**Action:** Chandelier falling in slow dramatic motion, the phantom appearing and vanishing through secret panels, boat rides across underground lakes, sword fights on catwalks above the stage, dramatic unmasking, Christine torn between two men.

## Voice

A voice of haunting beauty and underlying menace—cultured, theatrical, capable of shifting from whispered seduction to thunderous rage. European accent, speaks in metaphor and musical terminology. Can be the phantom's hypnotic voice luring through walls, or Madame Giry's knowing warnings, or Christine's conflicted emotions. The voice of the opera itself—grand, passionate, dramatic.

## Music Style

Sweeping romantic orchestral music with dark Gothic undertones—think Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom score. "The Music of the Night" as seductive and hypnotic melody, full organ and orchestra building to overwhelming beauty. "All I Ask of You" for pure romantic sweetness. Title song with electric guitar and rock opera power. Sudden dramatic stings for scares. The phantom's compositions should sound genius—complex, beautiful, and slightly unsettling. Music that makes you understand why Christine is drawn to him despite the horror.
