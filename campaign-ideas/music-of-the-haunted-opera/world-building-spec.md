### **World-Building Specification Brief: Music of the Haunted Opera**

**1. Core Concept:**
A mysterious phantom haunts the Grand Opera House, obsessed with a rising star soprano, using supernatural music and secret passages to control the theater while party investigates his tragic past and decides between justice and mercy.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the opera house's architecture—grand public spaces hiding labyrinthine backstage
*   Explain the catacombs beneath—why they exist, what's down there besides the phantom
*   Describe the phantom's tragic origin—disfigured from birth, exhibited as circus freak, found refuge underground
*   Write about opera culture of the era—performers, patrons, social hierarchy
*   Detail how the phantom learned music and architecture despite his isolation
*   Explain the supernatural elements—is his music truly magical or just hypnotic
*   Describe the tribute system—Box Five, salary demands, artistic control

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Performers** (Major) - Singers, dancers, musicians—superstitious and competitive
*   **The Technical Crew** (Minor) - Stagehands who know the backstage secrets and fear the phantom
*   **The Management** (Major) - Concerned with profit, skeptical of ghosts until deaths occur
*   **The Patrons** (Minor) - Wealthy opera-goers, including Raoul's family
*   **The Ballet Rats** (Minor) - Young dancers who spread ghost stories, Meg Giry among them
*   **The Phantom's Network** (Minor) - Madame Giry and others who help him from sympathy or fear

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Erik the Phantom, Christine Daaé, Raoul de Chagny, Madame Giry, Carlotta Giudicelli, The Opera Managers
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Ballet Dancer," "Stagehand," "Conductor," "Costume Designer," "Patron," "Persian (Phantom's old friend)," "Rival Performer," "Security"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Opera House Stage** - Grand performances and public displays of phantom's power
*   **The Backstage Labyrinth** - Secret passages, catwalks, hiding places throughout
*   **Box Five** - The phantom's seat, always left empty, his presence felt there
*   **The Catacombs** - Ancient underground tunnels beneath the city and opera
*   **The Phantom's Lair** - Beautiful prison on underground lake, his sanctuary

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party threatens Christine THEN phantom retaliates with deadly "accidents"
*   IF party shows appreciation for phantom's art THEN he may communicate or spare them
*   IF Carlotta continues as prima donna THEN phantom sabotages her performances
*   IF party explores catacombs THEN discover phantom's tragic history
*   IF party attacks phantom directly THEN he collapses sections of opera house endangering innocents
*   IF party shows phantom mercy when they have power over him THEN he may choose redemption over revenge
