# Creative Brief: Dice of Dominion

## Art Style
War room aesthetic—massive world map with colored territory pieces, troop counters, and strategic markers. Each continent has distinct visual identity matching real-world geography but stylized. Armies represented by infantry (single soldiers), cavalry (horses), and artillery (cannons). Dice shown as massive cosmic cubes rolling across battlefields, determining fate. 1950s military propaganda poster aesthetic.

## Color Palette
Six faction colors (matching Risk): Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Black, Purple. Each controls different continents. Neutral territories are white/gray. Dice are ivory with black pips. Maps use muted earth tones with bold faction color overlays. Battle scenes show armies clashing in faction colors.

## Music
Military marches, orchestral war themes. Each continent has cultural musical motifs (Asia: taiko drums and erhu, Europe: classical orchestra, Africa: tribal percussion, Americas: indigenous and colonial blend, Australia: didgeridoo undertones). Dice rolling is rhythmic percussion element. Fortification music is tense strategic planning. Card turn-in has triumphant fanfare.

## Voice Direction

**Game Master**: Omniscient narrator voice, speaks in game terminology, announces phases ("Deploy Reinforcements," "Conduct Attacks," "Fortify Position")

**Continental Leaders**: Each has accent matching their region—Australian, Asian, European, African, American. All speak in military strategy terminology.

**Dice Prophet**: Nervous, mathematical, speaks in probabilities ("73% chance of victory, 27% defeat, expected casualties: 4.2 armies")

## Cinematic Moments

**Massive Dice Battle**: Hundreds of dice rolling simultaneously across battlefield. Each die determines one army's fate. Close-ups on individual dice—slow motion as they tumble, land on specific numbers. Armies vanish as their dice lose.

**Continental Conquest**: Final territory of continent captured. Map highlights entire continent in faction color. Bonus armies appear from thin air. Power surge visual.

**Betrayal**: Allied armies suddenly turn hostile mid-battle. Color change from friendly green to enemy red. Coordinated assault from former friends.

**Total Domination**: Last enemy territory falls. World map transforms to single color. Game Master announces victory. Reality begins to fracture from completing the eternal game.
