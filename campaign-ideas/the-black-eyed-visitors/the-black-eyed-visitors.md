*An Urban Horror Mystery campaign — Short Campaign (6-10 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Black-Eyed Visitors
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Horror / Mystery / Supernatural Invasion / Changeling Theory
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6-10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **8–10**
**Tone (keywords):** knocking at night, empty black eyes, children, invitation, psychic unease, replacement
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Strange children are appearing at doors across the city late at night, asking to be let inside with flat, emotionless voices. Those who look into their eyes see only solid black—no whites, no iris, no humanity. People who invite them in are found the next day changed—emotionless shells with their memories and personalities slowly fading. The players must investigate what these Black-Eyed Children are, why they need to be invited in, and stop them before more victims are claimed and the city is overrun by these emotionless doppelgangers.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6-10 sessions)

A creeping invasion of inhuman entities disguised as children.

*   **Act I — Let Us In (Sessions 1–3):** The players investigate reports of strange children appearing at night requesting entry. Victims who let them in are found in vegetative states. The players encounter the children directly and resist the psychic compulsion to obey.
*   **Act II — The Changed Ones (Sessions 4–6):** Victims begin "recovering" but are not themselves—they're emotionless copies. The players discover these are changeling replacements, and the real victims are being held somewhere. The Black-Eyed Children multiply.
*   **Act III — The Threshold (Sessions 7–10):** The party discovers the children are agents of an entity trying to cross into our reality. They need to be invited into enough homes to create a "threshold" for their master. The players must find and destroy this threshold before the entity fully manifests.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "A Knock at the Door"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players investigate reports of children appearing at doors late at night.
    *   Witnesses describe the same unsettling details: pale children, solid black eyes, flat voices asking "May we come in?"
    *   Those who refused felt overwhelming psychic pressure to comply. Those who accepted are now catatonic.
**Escalation:** A player character receives a late-night knock. Children with black eyes stand outside their door.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The Empty Ones"
*   **Focus:** Horror / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Victims begin "waking" from their catatonic states, but family members report they're "not right"—emotionless, unknowing of personal details, speaking in slightly wrong syntax.
    *   The players witness a Black-Eyed Child encounter and must resist the psychic compulsion (Wisdom saves).
    *   Investigation reveals victims are changelings—copies. The real people are missing.
**Escalation:** A changed victim attempts to kill their own family member to "make room for more."

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Black-Eyed Children** — *The Hollow Ones*
    *   **Role:** Manifestations or servants of an entity attempting to cross into our reality. They appear as pale children aged 6-12 with completely black eyes.
    *   **Personality:** Emotionless, persistent, and unnervingly polite. They cannot enter without invitation but will wait for hours.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They are vulnerable to certain thresholds and wards. Each invitation granted gives the entity more power to manifest.

2.  **Dr. Evelyn Cross** — *The Psychiatrist*
    *   **Role:** A mental health professional treating the "recovered" victims and noticing disturbing patterns.
    *   **Personality:** Analytical, compassionate, and increasingly disturbed by what she's seeing.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She invited the children in during a moment of weakness and is slowly being replaced. She's fighting to maintain herself long enough to help stop them.

3.  **Father Miguel Santos** — *The Priest*
    *   **Role:** A Catholic priest who recognizes the Black-Eyed Children as demonic entities requiring exorcism.
    *   **Personality:** Faithful, brave, but clearly terrified of what he's facing.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His faith protects him, but he knows his church doesn't have the full answer—this is older than Christianity.

4.  **Amy Chen** — *The Child Who Refused*
    *   **Role:** A 10-year-old who encountered the children and refused them entry. Now they stalk her specifically.
    *   **Personality:** Brave but terrified, intelligent, knows more than adults believe.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She can sense the children's presence before they arrive. They want her specifically because her will is strong—breaking her would grant the entity great power.

## Key Locations

1.  **The City:** Modern urban environment where homes are supposed to be safe—but doors can be knocked on.
2.  **Victim Homes:** Ordinary houses and apartments that have become gateways for the entity.
3.  **The Threshold Site:** A central location where reality is thin—an old building where the first invitation was given.
4.  **The In-Between:** A pocket dimension where real victims are held in stasis while being copied.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of consent, invasion of safe spaces, and the loss of identity. The central conflict is stopping the entity's manifestation while rescuing the real victims before they're permanently replaced.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Invitation Compulsion**
*   When encountering Black-Eyed Children at a threshold (door, window, gate), characters must make **Wisdom saving throws** or feel overwhelming compulsion to invite them in.
*   The save DC increases with:
    *   Time of exposure (they wait patiently)
    *   Emotional vulnerability
    *   Number of children present
    *   Whether you're alone
*   Failure means you invite them in. Success means you resist but feel the psychic pressure.

### 2. **Changeling Detection**
*   Changed victims appear almost normal but can be detected through:
    *   **Insight checks:** Notice lack of appropriate emotional responses
    *   **Investigation checks:** They don't know personal details they should
    *   **Magical detection:** They register as aberrations, not humanoids
    *   Physical signs: Eyes briefly flash completely black when stressed

### 3. **Threshold Power**
*   The DM tracks how many successful invitations the children have received.
*   At certain thresholds (10, 25, 50 invitations), the entity gains power:
    *   More children manifest
    *   They can appear in daylight
    *   They can persist longer without invitations
    *   The final threshold allows the entity to fully cross over

### 4. **Protective Measures**
*   Players can protect against the children through:
    *   **Salt barriers:** Children cannot cross lines of salt
    *   **Iron:** The presence of cold iron causes them discomfort
    *   **Symbols of threshold protection:** Horseshoes, specific wards
    *   **Faith:** Genuine belief in protective symbols can work
    *   **Never being alone:** They're less effective against groups
