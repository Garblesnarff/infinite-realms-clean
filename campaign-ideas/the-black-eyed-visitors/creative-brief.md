# Creative Brief: The Black-Eyed Visitors

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Suburban Uncanny Horror

Inspired by urban legends and threshold horror, blending normal suburban settings with entities that violate the rules of invitation and consent. This style captures the violation of the home as safe space and the uncanny valley of almost-human entities.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize the Almost-Normal:** The children look mostly normal until you see the eyes.
*   **Focus on Threshold Moments:** Doorways, windows, gates—boundaries that should protect but are vulnerable.
*   **Contrast Innocence and Wrongness:** Child-like forms hiding inhuman nature.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Knocking at night, empty black eyes, children, invitation, psychic unease, replacement, changeling, threshold.
*   **Feeling:** The sense that something is asking to be invited into your home, and that letting it in would be a terrible mistake.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Normal suburban colors (warm yellows from porch lights, cozy home interiors) invaded by the unnatural darkness of the children's eyes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a typical suburban home at night, warm yellow light spilling from the porch. Two children stand in the light, looking mostly normal in ordinary clothes. But their eyes are wrong—completely black from edge to edge, like voids. The contrast between the welcoming light and the wrongness of the children creates immediate unease."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Black-Eyed Children:** Appear aged 6-12, wearing ordinary modern children's clothing (jeans, hoodies, dresses). Pale skin, expressionless faces, and most notably—eyes that are completely black with no visible white, iris, or pupil. They speak in flat, emotionless voices.
*   **Changelings:** Victims who have been replaced. They look identical to the original person but have completely flat affect, dead eyes (normal colored but lifeless), and speak in slightly wrong syntax.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two children standing on a doorstep at night. They appear to be normal children aged about 8 and 10, wearing jeans and hoodies. But their faces are expressionless, their skin is too pale, and their eyes are completely black—solid voids with no visible features. They stand unnaturally still. The effect is deeply unsettling—they look like children but are clearly not human."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Ordinary suburban and urban settings—homes, apartment buildings, parking lots—made threatening by the presence of the children.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A suburban street at night seen through a doorway security peephole. Two children with completely black eyes stand patiently on the doorstep, waiting. The fish-eye distortion of the peephole makes them seem even more wrong. Inside, the viewer's hands are braced against the door, refusing to open it despite the overwhelming urge to comply."

## Voice

A hollow, emotionless voice that sounds like a child but completely lacks warmth or inflection. The pacing is slow and deliberate, almost mechanical. The emotion is completely absent—an uncanny valley of human speech. Audio quality is clean but somehow wrong, as if artificially generated. Role: One of the Black-Eyed Children making their polite, terrible request: "Please let us in. We need to come inside."
