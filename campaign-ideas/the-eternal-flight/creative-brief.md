# Creative Brief: The Eternal Flight

## Visual Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Monarch orange (#FF6F00), wing black (#1A1A1A), milkweed green (#7CB342), sky blue (#42A5F5), sunset gold (#FFC107)
- **Visual Style**: Millions of butterflies creating living tapestries, wings as stained glass, mass migration scenes, delicate beauty meeting vast scale
- **Key Imagery**: Trees covered entirely in orange butterflies, mass migration crossing landscapes, single butterfly containing ancient soul, transformation from caterpillar to divine being

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Delicate, fluttering strings representing wings, builds to orchestral swell for mass migration
- **Pilgrim's Voice**: Layered whispers (millions of butterfly sounds creating words), ancient and young simultaneously
- **Migration Music**: Travels through four seasons, each generation has musical motif that passes to next
- **Soundscape**: Wings beating (soft flutter when one, roar when millions), wind through milkweed, gentle forest sounds, transformation sounds (chrysalis cracking)

## Voice Acting
- **Wing-Speaker Mariposa**: Soft, reverent, speaks to butterflies like beloved friends
- **The Eternal Pilgrim**: Countless whispers overlapping, words formed from wing-beats, simultaneously weary and hopeful
- **Sovereign Chitin**: Single clear voice emerging from the many, wise and urgent
- **Deathsinger Kael**: Gentle, compassionate, dangerous conviction, believes he's performing mercy
- **Grandmother Storm**: Wild, chaotic, laughing winds, doesn't understand fragile things
