### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Gears of Deus**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Players are reincarnations trapped in a 10,000-year cycle orchestrated by Deus, a biological god-weapon that crashed on this planet and created humanity as spare parts. The Church of Solaris manipulates all surface wars through religion and Gear technology to accelerate Deus's resurrection. As players uncover their past lives and the conspiracy, they must decide whether to destroy their creator and risk annihilation, or find a way to preserve humanity's independence while freeing the higher-dimensional being trapped within Deus.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Eldridge interstellar transport ship's crash 10,000 years ago and how its biological weapon Deus awakened and absorbed the crew.
    *   Write the creation myth of this world from a Solarian perspective - Deus as creator, the Contact and Antitype as Adam and Eve figures.
    *   Describe the Zeboim civilization 4,000 years ago - an advanced society destroyed as part of the cycle, whose ruins hold technological secrets.
    *   Explain the nature of the Gazel Ministry - ancient rulers who uploaded their consciousnesses to escape death, now serving Deus.
    *   Detail Solaris's founding and its caste system - elite citizens modified genetically, hidden from the surface "Lambs."
    *   Write the history of Shevat, the rebel sky city founded by those who rejected the cycle.
    *   Describe the Contact and Antitype - specific reincarnations who repeat across history in tragic patterns, essential to Deus's plan.
    *   Explain the Wave Existence - a higher-dimensional being accidentally trapped in physical form within Deus, suffering for millennia.
