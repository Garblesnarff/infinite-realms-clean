# Creative Brief: Gears of Deus

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gnostic Mecha Opera (Xenogears-inspired)

Inspired by the dense, philosophical aesthetic of *Xenogears*, blending giant mecha, religious imagery, gnostic symbolism, and psychological horror. This style aims to capture the philosophical, tragic, epic, and apocalyptic tone of "Gears of Deus," where reincarnated warriors confront a conspiracy spanning 10,000 years and must fight against god itself.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Symbolism:** Contrast massive Gears with vulnerable humans. Use heavy religious and gnostic iconography - crosses, wings, eyes, tree of life patterns.
*   **Biomechanical Fusion:** Blend organic and mechanical elements seamlessly. Gears should feel alive, not just machines.
*   **Temporal Layering:** Show how past and present overlap - modern settings with ancient ruins, flashbacks bleeding into the present.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Philosophical, tragic, epic, apocalyptic, biomechanical, gnostic, reincarnation, conspiracy, religious, mecha, existential.
*   **Feeling:** A heavy, contemplative atmosphere dealing with cosmic-scale questions. The mood balances awe-inspiring mecha combat with intimate psychological horror, grand religious imagery with personal trauma, and ancient mysteries with cutting-edge technology.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed anime-inspired designs with complex mechanical and organic elements. Gears have sleek but functional designs with visible musculature or circuitry. Religious architecture features gothic elements mixed with futuristic technology.
*   **Textures:** Smooth metal plating on Gears, organic flesh-like surfaces within Deus, ancient stone ruins, crystalline technology.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed anime illustration of a biomechanical giant warrior - a Gear with sleek white armor plating, visible mechanical joints, wing-like thrusters, and subtle organic elements suggesting living tissue beneath the metal."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, symbolic colors. White and red for religious purity and blood. Gold for divine elements. Deep purples and blacks for Solaris and conspiracy. Earth tones for surface nations. Sickly green-gold for Deus's interior.
*   **Symbolic Use:** Each faction has color identity - protagonists in blues and whites, Solaris in purples and blacks, Deus in organic golds and reds.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered with a palette of deep purple, black, and gold for the Solarian cathedral, with stained glass casting colored light patterns on the floor in cross and wing shapes."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic anime proportions with distinctive outfits reflecting their roles. Combat gear often includes religious or symbolic elements. Characters across different time periods should be recognizable despite different clothing, emphasizing reincarnation.
*   **Expression:** Characters bear the weight of cosmic revelations - haunted eyes, determined expressions, the visual toll of psychological trauma.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A martial artist in anime style with dark hair and intense eyes, wearing a red gi with black trim. Multiple translucent figures of the same person in different time periods stand behind him like ghosts - ancient armor, futuristic soldier, primitive warrior - representing his past lives."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Diverse locations showing technological stratification - primitive surface villages, advanced cities, the impossibly advanced sky city of Solaris, ancient ruins, and the nightmarish biomechanical interior of Deus.
*   **Atmosphere:** Surface world feels grounded and real. Solaris is clinical and oppressive. Ancient ruins hold mystery. Deus's interior defies sanity - flesh walls, organic machinery, symbolic religious architecture merged with living tissue.
*   **Details:** Religious symbols everywhere - crosses, eyes, wings, tree of life diagrams. Ancient text and warnings. Gears standing like sleeping giants.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive underground cathedral with soaring gothic arches, but the pillars are biomechanical - metal ribbing with organic flesh visible between plates. Giant Gears stand in alcoves like religious statues. Stained glass windows depict the Tree of Sephirot in purple and gold."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, theatrical lighting emphasizing the operatic nature. Strong contrasts between light and shadow. Religious settings use stained glass effects and divine rays. Deus's interior has sickly, pulsing bioluminescence.
*   **Special Effects:** Gear energy attacks, psychic manifestations, flashback visual distortions, the Wave Existence appearing as impossible geometry and light.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reflects philosophical themes - characters stepping from shadow into light represents enlightenment, harsh overhead light in Solaris represents oppressive truth, warm natural light on the surface represents humanity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by divine rays of light streaming through circular stained glass windows bearing the symbol of an eye. The light creates cross-shaped shadows on a figure standing in the center, emphasizing religious martyrdom imagery."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Operatic, theatrical compositions emphasizing power dynamics and symbolism. Wide shots show massive scale (Gears towering over humans, sky cities above surface nations). Tight shots show psychological intensity. Use of religious compositional techniques - trinity framing, cross shapes, ascending diagonals.
*   **Techniques:** Layer past and present in the same image through transparency effects. Use height to show hierarchy. Frame important moments like religious art.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dramatic composition showing a small human figure in the foreground looking up at a massive biomechanical god-ship Deus that fills the sky. The ship has a cruciform shape with wing-like protrusions. The human is positioned at the bottom of a triangular composition, dwarfed by the divine scale above."

## Voice

A deep, resonant voice carrying the weight of millennia, like someone who has witnessed all of history's cycles and understands their tragic nature. The pacing is deliberate and philosophical, occasionally building to passionate intensity when discussing free will and rebellion against fate. The emotion is profoundly melancholic yet determined - sorrowful about what has been lost, resolute about what must be done. Audio quality has a slight reverb, as if speaking from within a vast cathedral or the depths of a god-machine. Role: The voice of Cain reflecting on 10,000 years, the Wave Existence, or an omniscient narrator witnessing the cycle's final iteration.
