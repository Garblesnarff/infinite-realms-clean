# Creative Brief: The WCKD Protocol

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Industrial Brutalism (Maze Runner meets Concrete Dystopia)

Blends massive stone maze architecture with post-apocalyptic wasteland survival. Emphasizes the claustrophobic maze walls, biomechanical horror of Grievers, and the desolate Scorch beyond.

### Core Principles:
*   **Massive Scale:** The maze walls dwarf the characters—towering stone corridors create claustrophobia and awe.
*   **Biomechanical Horror:** Grievers combine organic (slug-like bodies) with mechanical (blades, syringes, metallic limbs).
*   **Harsh Contrast:** Safe Glade (green, organized) vs. deadly maze (stone, shadows) vs. Scorch wasteland (burned, desolate).

### Color Palette:
*   **The Glade:** Greens (grass, crops), earth tones (wood buildings), blue sky—false paradise.
*   **The Maze:** Gray stone, deep shadows, dim daylight filtering from above, blood red at night when Grievers emerge.
*   **The Scorch:** Burnt oranges, desert yellows, ash grays, cracked earth, bleached bones.
*   **WCKD Facility:** Clinical whites, sterile blues, harsh fluorescent lighting, glass and steel.

### Character Design:
*   **Gladers:** Ages 13-18, wearing makeshift clothing (cargo pants, torn shirts), dirty and scarred from labor and trials. Lean builds from rationing.
*   **Grievers:** Massive (elephant-sized), slug-like bodies with metallic appendages—saws, needles, claws. Glowing red sensors. Nightmare fusion of organic and machine.
*   **Cranks:** Feral, emaciated, rotting flesh, wild eyes, aggressive movements—victims of the Flare virus.

### Voice:
A tense, breathless young voice (late teens), modern American accent, shifting between hope and despair. Emphasis on urgency, fear, and determination. Role: A Glader narrating their survival.
