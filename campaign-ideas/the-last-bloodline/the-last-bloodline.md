## Central Conflict

The campaign explores gender, power, survival, and what it means to rebuild civilization. It asks whether humanity's worst impulses are tied to gender or are universal, whether control is ever justified for the greater good, and what individuals owe to society versus themselves. Kael represents both hope for restoration and the burden of being reduced to biological function rather than personhood.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Resource Scarcity**

*   The post-apocalyptic world has limited supplies. The party must scavenge, trade, and make hard choices about what to carry.

*   Actions affect standing with multiple factions (Cult, Scientists, Government Remnants, Pirates, etc.), determining which endings are available.

### 3. **Kael's Agency**

*   Kael is an NPC but his opinions matter. The party can't simply make decisions for him without consequences.

### 4. **The Companion System**

*   Miko can be sent on simple scouting missions or create distractions, adding utility and humor.

### 5. **Ethical Dilemmas**

*   Regular scenarios force players to choose between survival and morality, with no clear right answers.

### 6. **The Cure Progress**

*   A track showing Dr. Mann's research progress toward a cure, influenced by party actions and resources gathered.
