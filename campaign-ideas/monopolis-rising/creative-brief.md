# Creative Brief: Monopolis Rising

## Art Style
1930s Art Deco meets dystopian capitalism. Properties as towering buildings—cheap properties are shabby apartments, expensive properties are gilded skyscrapers. The Board Walk is a literal circular boulevard with property buildings on the inside, void on the outside. Color-coded districts (brown, light blue, pink, orange, red, yellow, green, dark blue). Dice shown as massive cosmic cubes rolling through the sky.

## Music
Upbeat jazz underscored by ominous strings. Ragtime piano for property negotiations. Heavy industrial percussion for rent collection. The dice rolling is a constant rhythmic element—tumbling percussion that creates tension. Boardwalk theme is excessive, bombastic orchestral wealth. Free Parking is silent meditation space.

## Voice Direction

**The Banker**: Cold corporate voice, emotionless calculation, speaks in monetary terms, every word is a transaction

**Baron Boardwalk**: Aristocratic British accent, dripping with condescension, laughs at the poor, obsessed with luxury

**Railroad Magnate**: Fast-talking conductor, train whistle vocal affectations, always in a hurry, speaks in schedules and routes

**Free Parking Vagrant**: Zen calm, minimalist speech, long pauses, teaches through questions like a monk

**Jail Warden**: Prison guard authoritarian, harsh and clipped, metal door sounds punctuate speech

## Cinematic Moments

**The Bankruptcy**: Character runs out of money. Their property deeds crumble. Their token avatar begins to fade. Slow-motion fall as they disappear from the Board Walk, plummeting into the Void.

**Landing on Boardwalk**: Dice roll—overhead shot showing them landing on the dark blue space. Camera pulls back showing the massive hotel. Baron Boardwalk appears, hand extended. "Rent is 2,000 Monopolis." Character realizes they only have 300.

**Jail Sentence**: Triple roll occurs third time. Reality freezes. "Go Directly to Jail. Do Not Pass GO. Do Not Collect 200." Character is teleported into gray prison dimension.

**The Revolution**: Masses of bankrupt citizens rise up, burning property deeds. Hotels collapse. The circular Board Walk cracks. Fade to black—either freedom or chaos.
