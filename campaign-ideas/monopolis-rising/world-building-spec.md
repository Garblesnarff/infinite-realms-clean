# World-Building Specification: Monopolis Rising

## Faction Details

### The Property Barons
Ultra-wealthy landlords who own multiple color-sets with hotels. Control the economy through rent extraction. Live in obscene luxury on Boardwalk and Park Place. Actively rig dice to drive people to their properties.

### The Bankrupt Resistance
Former players who lost everything. Operate outside the legal property system. Squat in mortgaged properties, steal from the Bank, and attempt to break the circular Board Walk itself. Led by the Bankrupt Prophet.

### The Railroad Union
Workers who maintain the four railroads. Controlled by the Railroad Magnate but contain revolutionary elements. Can call strikes that halt all transit, paralyzing the economy.

### The Utility Collective
Workers at Electric Company and Water Works. Essential services give them power. Can cut utilities to properties, making them uninhabitable. Debating whether to privatize or socialize their monopoly.

### The Chance Cult
Worshipers of randomness who venerate Chance cards. Believe in pure luck as divine will. Oppose the dice-riggers and seek to restore true randomness to the system.

### The Community Chest Cooperative
Mutual aid society based on Community Chest cards. Share resources communally, help each other pay rent, and believe in collective survival over individual wealth.

### The Free Parking Monks
Ascetics who live in the Free Parking space, owning nothing and paying nothing. Teach that property is illusion and the Board Walk is a spiritual prison.

### The Get Out of Jail Free Cartel
Black market organization that controls the rare Get Out of Jail Free cards. Sell them for exorbitant prices or trade them for political favors. Most powerful non-property faction.

### The Token Avatars
Eight spirits (Top Hat, Thimble, Boot, etc.) representing player tokens. Each grants unique abilities. Factions form around different token philosophies. Top Hat = aristocracy, Boot = working class, etc.

## The Rules as Laws of Physics

### The Dice Determine Fate
Physical law: dice rolls control movement. Attempting to move without rolling causes reality damage. The cosmic dice manifest in the sky and must be obeyed.

### Rent Must Be Paid
Landing on owned property creates a cosmic debt that materializes as chains. Only paying rent breaks the chains. Refusing to pay causes the chains to tighten until you're dragged to Jail.

### Passing GO Grants Life
The 200 Monopolis received from passing GO is not money—it's life force. Without it, citizens slowly fade. The Board Walk loop must be continuously walked to survive.

### Property Ownership is Reality
Holding a property deed means you literally own that section of reality. You can modify it, set rules for it, and extract value from anyone who enters it.

### Bankruptcy is Erasure
When unable to pay debts, you're removed from the game—erased from existence. Unless... the Bankrupt Prophet's discovery is true.

### Hotels Create Domains
A property with a hotel becomes a pocket dimension. The owner has godlike power within their hotel. Boardwalk Hotel is essentially a kingdom.

## The Revelation

The Board Walk is not a game—it's a prison designed by cosmic entities to contain souls who committed some ancient crime. The "game" is eternal punishment disguised as capitalism. The Void beyond the Board Walk isn't death—it's freedom, the actual universe. Stepping off the Board means escaping prison, but also losing the rules that define existence. True freedom is terrifying because you must create your own meaning without the Board Walk's structure.

The party's final choice:
1. Win the game, become the ultimate monopolist, but remain in prison
2. Destroy the game, free everyone into uncertain Void
3. Reform the game, create fair rules, make prison comfortable
4. Escape alone, achieve personal freedom but abandon others

Each ending reflects different philosophies about freedom, security, inequality, and the purpose of existence.
