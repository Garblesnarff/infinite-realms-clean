## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A desperate flight through gang territories toward home and redemption.

*   **Act I — The Summit (Sessions 1-7):** The party attends Cyrus's summit in Van Cortlandt Park where he promises to unite all gangs to outnumber police and rule the city. When Cyrus is shot, the assassin Luther frames the Warriors, and chaos erupts. The party must escape the park through police raids and angry gangs, beginning their journey home. They fight the Turnbull ACs, evade the Orphans, and learn every gang has heard the DJ's broadcast naming them as murderers. No one believes their innocence.
*   **Act II — Through Enemy Territory (Sessions 8-13):** Each session brings new gang encounters as they traverse different territories—the Baseball Furies, the Lizzies, the Punks. Some fights are inevitable, others can be negotiated or evaded. The party gains respect through survival and combat prowess while uncovering clues about who really killed Cyrus. The mysterious Rogues gang seems to be everywhere, watching. The DJ's broadcasts become more ominous, revealing someone wants the Warriors specifically destroyed.
*   **Act III — Warriors Come Out to Play (Sessions 14-20):** The party reaches their home turf of Coney Island but the Rogues arrive in force to finish them. The truth emerges: Luther killed Cyrus out of mindless aggression, and the Rogues used it to eliminate the Warriors as rival top dogs. The climactic beach confrontation determines whether they die in dishonor or survive to clear their names. Dawn breaks over the ocean as they prove the Warriors are the best—"can you dig it?"
