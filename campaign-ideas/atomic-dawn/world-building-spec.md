## Causality Chains and Monster Origins

### The Primordials' True History

**Age of Creation (50,000 years ago):**
- Precursor civilization (not human, not elven, predating both)
- Discovered dimensional boundaries were weakening
- Creatures from beyond reality attempting to breach through
- Precursors created the Primordials as living dimensional seals
- Eight Primordials placed at weak points in reality's fabric
- Each one anchored to fundamental elemental force
- Designed to be eternal, unkillable, self-sustaining

**Age of Balance (50,000 - 100 years ago):**
- Primordials slumbered, performing their function unconsciously
- Mortal civilizations rose and fell
- Some ancient cultures discovered the truth, left warnings
- The Titan Tomb civilization attempted to communicate, succeeded
- Knowledge was lost in subsequent dark ages
- Primordials became myths, legends, religious symbols

**The Great War (70 years ago):**
- Global conflict between magical powers
- Arcane arms race produced increasingly dangerous weapons
- Final battle: Multiple nations deployed doomsday weapons
- Intention: Crack dimensional barriers to access infinite power
- Result: Severely damaged all eight Primordials simultaneously
- Dimensional seals weakened but did not break (barely)
- Massive magical radiation released into world

**The Awakening (30 years ago - Present):**
- Primordials woke from eternal sleep, wounded and confused
- Drawn to sources of magical radiation (trying to consume and neutralize it)
- Emergences appear random but follow pattern of radiation concentration
- Each emergence: Primordial attempting to heal dimensional seal at that location
- Humanity interprets protective action as destruction
- Cycle: Emerge, contain radiation, return to dormancy, repeat

**Current Situation:**
- Radiation Nexus: The worst wound, growing worse
- Primordials: Slowly dying from sustained damage
- Dimensional barriers: Weakening incrementally
- If Primordials die: Seals fail completely
- If Nexus explodes: Chain reaction destroys all seals
- Timeline: Years before point of no return, not decades

### The Radiation Nexus - Causality Chain

**Initial Cause:**
1. Great War escalation reaches critical point
2. Three nations simultaneously deploy dimensional-breach weapons
3. Weapons designed to tear open reality and access infinite power source
4. Detonation point: Current Nexus location

**Immediate Effects:**
2. Dimensional fabric tears open
3. All eight Primordials scream in psychic agony (heard worldwide)
4. Primordials forcibly awaken to contain the breach
5. Primordials channel their essence into sealing the tear
6. Seal holds but is imperfect, leaving wound in reality

**Secondary Effects:**
7. Massive magical radiation released at detonation point
8. Radiation spreads globally, poisoning land and sea
9. Consciousnesses of weapon creators trapped in dimensional wound
10. Their eternal torment feeds instability
11. Crystalline growth begins—physical manifestation of damaged dimensional tissue

**Long-term Consequences:**
12. Crystal grows slowly, like infection spreading
13. Growth draws magical radiation from across the world
14. Primordials drawn to consume radiation and stabilize crystal
15. Humanity sees Primordial emergences as attacks
16. Military responses create more radiation (arcane weapons)
17. More radiation draws more Primordial attention
18. Cycle accelerates

**Current Status:**
19. Crystal has reached critical mass threshold
20. Growing exponentially rather than linearly
21. Primordials making more frequent attempts to contain it
22. Their efforts temporarily stabilize but long-term prognosis is failure
23. Estimated timeline: 2-5 years before catastrophic cascade

**Potential Outcomes:**

*Without Intervention:*
24a. Crystal becomes unstable
25a. Massive magical detonation
26a. All eight dimensional seals shatter
27a. Entities from beyond reality flood through
28a. Total extinction event

*With Primordial Deaths:*
24b. Each Primordial death weakens corresponding seal
25b. Dimensional entities begin emerging at those locations
26b. Survivors face invasion from eight different reality-breaking forces
27b. Civilization collapses fighting multi-front war against incomprehensible enemies

*With Stabilization Protocol:*
24c. Party coordinates Primordials, technology, and ancient rituals
25c. Primordials provide essence, humans provide technical precision
26c. Trapped consciousnesses are freed (merciful end to suffering)
27c. Crystal sealed in stable state, no longer growing
28c. Dimensional barriers reinforced
29c. Primordials return to dormancy, healable over centuries
30c. Humanity learns truth, new age of cooperation

- Arms race continues despite official bans

**Daily Life:**
- Evacuation drills normal as fire drills
- Architecture: Buildings designed to survive or evacuate quickly
- Mental health crisis: PTSD, anxiety, depression widespread
- Education: Primordial ecology taught alongside math
- Entertainment: Need for escapism vs. processing trauma

### The Great War - Deeper Context

**Root Causes:**
- Resource depletion after industrial revolution
- Ideological conflicts between magical traditions
- Nationalism and imperial ambitions
- Arms race creating paranoia
- Failure of diplomacy

**Major Powers:**
- **The Valdmere Hegemony:** Magical purists, believed in human supremacy
- **The Eastern Concordat:** (Same as modern, survived the war)
- **The Southern Coalition:** Resource rich, industrially behind, desperate
- **Northern Free States:** Isolationist, dragged in unwillingly

**The Doomsday Weapons:**
- Designed by multinational team of mages (Dr. Blackwood's grandfather included)
- Theory: Dimensional power is infinite, could end the war
- Reality: Didn't understand what they were breaching
- Three weapons deployed simultaneously (coordination or coincidence unknown)
- Each weapon caused localized catastrophe
- Combined effect: Global dimensional damage

**Aftermath:**
- Estimated 50 million casualties from the war itself
- Another 100 million from subsequent famines, plagues, societal collapse
- Valdmere Hegemony dissolved, blamed for starting the war
- Treaty of Ashes: Banned dimensional research and weapons of mass destruction
- Rebuilding took 30 years
- Then Scoraxis emerged, revealing hidden cost of the war

**Legacy:**
- Veterans dying out, taking direct knowledge with them
- War memorials in every city
- "Never Again" sentiment (undermined by current crisis)
- Secret weapons caches still exist (including dimensional research)
- Some groups believe another war is inevitable
- Truth about doomsday weapons classified until recently

### Primordial Tissue and Its Properties

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Each Primordial's tissue reflects their element
- Scoraxis: Obsidian-like, retains heat indefinitely
- Typhara: Translucent, hydrophobic, bioluminescent
- Bathysos: Incredibly dense, darker than shadow

**Magical Properties:**
- Contains concentrated elemental essence
- Can power arcane devices for years
- Radiates specific type of magic constantly
- Resists conventional damage
- Slowly degrades when separated from source

**Applications:**
- **Energy Source:** Powers Apex mechs and other high-demand systems
- **Material Science:** Creates impossibly strong armor and weapons
- **Medical:** Potential treatments for contamination (experimental)
- **Research:** Studying to understand Primordials

**Harvesting:**
- Only possible from fragments left after emergence
- Direct harvesting would require wounding a Primordial (highly dangerous)
- Black market trade thriving
- Ash Zealots violently oppose tissue collection
- Legal in some nations, banned in others

**Ethics:**
- Is it grave robbing if the creature is alive?
- If Primordials are sentient, is this murder?
- Utilitarian argument: Use to fight them
- Counterargument: Fueling the problem

**Side Effects:**
- Prolonged exposure causes contamination
- Handlers report dreams from Primordial perspective
- Some develop empathic connection to source creature
- Psychological toll similar to radiation sickness
- Pilots of Apex mechs most affected

**The Black Market:**
- Salvage Guilds supply most illegal tissue
- Prices: Small fragment worth a year's wages
- Buyers: Corporations, nations, private collectors, researchers
- Enforcement: Impossible to patrol all disaster zones
- Violence: Turf wars between salvage gangs

This world-building provides layers of depth for extended campaigns, revealing that the surface-level "monster attacks" are a small part of a much larger, more complex reality. The truth about Primordials being protectors creates dramatic irony once revealed, and the various factions represent different philosophical approaches to crisis management.
