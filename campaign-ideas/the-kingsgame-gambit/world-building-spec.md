**The Kingsgame Gambit**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be melancholic, introspective, and heartwarming, handling depression and healing with sensitivity, in the style of March Comes in Like a Lion.
*   **Content:** The players are professional Kingsgame players struggling with depression, isolation, or trauma. When they encounter a warm found family, they begin a journey toward healing while competing in tournaments. The campaign balances strategic competition with quiet moments of connection and emotional growth.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize emotional depth, realistic struggles, and the healing power of human connection.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Kingsgame as both a noble tradition and a pressure-filled profession where young prodigies often burn out.
    *   Write about the Grand Championship, its prestige, and the psychological toll it takes on competitors.
    *   Describe the culture of Kingsgame academies – their harsh discipline and the mental health crisis among young players.
    *   Explain the significance of the Hearthhome tradition – establishments that welcome lost souls and provide care without expectation.
    *   Detail the legend of a champion who won the Grand Championship but lost themselves, retiring to find peace in obscurity.

*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Players (Struggling Champions)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To prove their worth through Kingsgame, to heal from their past, to learn to accept care and connection.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No hierarchy; individuals connected by circumstance and eventually by genuine care.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To compete at the highest levels of Kingsgame and achieve recognition.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each seeks healing from specific trauma – parental abandonment, teacher's cruelty, loss of a loved one, or crushing expectations. They don't initially realize they need human connection more than victory.
        *   **Assets:** Exceptional Kingsgame skills, determination forged from pain, gradually growing support network.
        *   **Relationships:** Initially isolated; slowly becoming part of the Hearthhome family; complex rivalry with other players that may evolve into mutual understanding.
    *   **The Hearthhome Family** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To provide warmth, care, and belonging to those who need it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Akari as the maternal figure, her siblings as supportive family, regular visitors as extended family.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To run their establishment (café, bookshop, community center) and serve the community.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each family member is healing their own wounds by caring for others. They genuinely love the players but must learn to accept care in return.
        *   **Assets:** Unconditional kindness, home cooking, a safe space, wisdom born from experience, persistence in the face of rejection.
        *   **Relationships:** See the players as family regardless of reciprocation; well-known and beloved in the community; concerned about each other's tendency to self-sacrifice.

        *   **Goals:** To maintain the tradition and prestige of professional Kingsgame, to identify and cultivate champions.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Grand Masters at the top, professional players in tiers, academies training young prospects, tournament organizers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To promote Kingsgame as the highest strategic art and sport.

        *   **Assets:** Prestige, funding, established traditions, public interest, talented players.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player's Emotional State drops below 3.

    *   **IF:** A player spends a Connection Token to seek support.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a heartfelt scene of care – a meal, a conversation, simply sitting together. The player's Emotional State improves. Describe the specific act of care and its impact.
