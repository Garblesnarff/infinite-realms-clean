## Central Conflict

Nature versus civilization. The jungle represents freedom, strength, and natural law uncorrupted by society's artifice. Colonial forces represent progress, greed, and cultural destruction. The party must decide what truly makes someone civilized—is it education and manners, or is it nobility of spirit and respect for life? The Jungle Lord embodies this conflict, torn between the human world and the wild that raised him.
