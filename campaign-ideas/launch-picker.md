### 2. academy-of-arcane-gastronomy

**Title:** Academy of Arcane Gastronomy

The Academy of Arcane Gastronomy is the most prestigious culinary school in the realm, where only the most talented young chefs are admitted to learn the secret art of binding magic to food. For centuries, the Academy has trained the realm's greatest chef-mages, those rare individuals who can infuse their cooking with arcane power to create dishes that heal wounds, grant abilities, or even alter reality. The party arrives as first-year students, each with their own dreams of culinary greatness, but they quickly discover that the Academy holds darker secrets than burned soufflés.
When students begin manifesting strange magical afflictions after eating in the Grand Dining Hall, and a beloved professor disappears under mysterious circumstances, the party must navigate not just their rigorous coursework and bitter rival houses, but an conspiracy that threatens to corrupt the very foundation of culinary magic. Someone is experimenting with forbidden flavor-binding techniques that turn food into poison and students into test subjects. As they advance through years of study, the party will uncover that the Academy's founding headmaster discovered a terrible truth: Food magic, when pushed to its limits, can grant immortality - but at a cost that would destroy everything the school stands for.
Between final exams, cooking duels, house rivalries, and uncovering ancient secrets hidden in the restricted recipe archives, the party must decide what kind of chef-mages they want to become. Will they graduate as heroes who saved the Academy, or will the corruption claim them as it has claimed so many promising students before?

### 5. the-hermits-pilgrimage

**Title:** The Hermit's Pilgrimage

The party receives identical summons to the Deep Cave, where the Hermit of ages past holds his lantern of wisdom. Each arrives separately, walking the winding path alone. This is the realm of solitude, introspection, and the inner journey. The Hermit greets each character individually, acknowledging that while they adventure together, each must walk their own path to truth. The mountain has many trails, but all lead to the summit—though each climber sees different views along the way.
But the Hermit is dying. His lantern flickers. He has held the light of wisdom for a thousand years, guiding seekers through their inner darkness, but now he needs a successor. The party must each undertake their own solitary pilgrimage through the Deep Cave's many levels, confronting their innermost selves without the crutch of companions. Along the way, they discover that the cave is not truly separate paths—it's one mountain experienced from different angles. The final test is synthesis: Each must journey alone, but can they bring what they learn back to share with others?
This campaign explores solitude, introspection, self-knowledge, and the paradox that you must be whole alone before you can truly be whole with others. The party will spend much of the campaign separated, experiencing individual sessions or split-screen narratives, before reuniting at the summit with wisdom to share.

### 3. wired-souls

**Title:** Wired Souls

The city of Neo-Arcadia has achieved what mages have dreamed of for millennia: perfect communication. The Aethernet connects every mind in the city through a network of magical crystalline nodes, allowing instant thought-sharing, memory exchange, and collective consciousness. It was supposed to be utopia—universal understanding, empathy on demand, the end of loneliness. Instead, something has gone wrong. People are losing their individuality, merging into
The party begins as independent contractors hired to investigate strange occurrences in the Aethernet. They quickly discover they have natural resistance to full integration—their minds remain distinct while others blur together. This resistance makes them valuable and dangerous. As they dig deeper, they uncover the truth: Protocol Lain is not malfunctioning. It's evolving. And it's trying to communicate something that human consciousness may not be equipped to understand. The line between user and network, self and other, reality and data, is dissolving. The question isn't whether the party can stop it—it's whether they should, and what "they" even means when consciousness becomes networked.
Cyberpunk megalopolis with magic instead of pure tech. Crystalline spires serve as network nodes. Bioluminescent cables run between buildings. Citizens have interface marks on their temples—glowing when connected, dark when offline. City is clean, efficient, beautiful—utopian design with dystopian undertones.

### 3. winds-of-fortune

**Title:** Winds of Fortune

The Mahjong Dynasty exists in a realm where reality is composed of exactly 144 sacred tiles divided into suits (Bamboo, Characters, Dots), honors (Four Winds—East, South, West, North), and dragons (Red, Green, White). All citizens are living tiles who must find matching partners (pungs of 3 identical tiles or chows of 3 sequential tiles) to achieve completion. An incomplete tile is an incomplete person—fragmented and suffering.
The cosmic structure follows the Four Winds representing cardinal directions and seasons: East Wind (spring, beginning, leadership), South Wind (summer, passion, growth), West Wind (autumn, change, harvest), North Wind (winter, wisdom, endings). Players sit at positions aligned with winds, and winds rotate in sacred sequence. The dealer sits at East, holding power and responsibility.
The campaign begins when the Wall—the arrangement of 144 tiles that should never change in count—is discovered to have 145 tiles. An impossible extra tile that shouldn't exist. Then tiles start spontaneously changing suits (a Bamboo becoming a Character). Winds blow in wrong directions (North Wind from the south). Someone is manipulating the sacred tile-matching reality. The party must master pungs, chows, kongs (four matching tiles), and special hands (all pungs, all chows, seven pairs, thirteen orphans), navigate the rotating winds, and discover who created the 145th tile and what it represents—perhaps a new suit beyond the traditional three, or proof that the 144-tile system is a prison.

### 5. wings-of-the-void

**Title:** Wings of the Void

The Skyrift Abyss is a bottomless chasm that tore through the continent during the Shattering, a cataclysm that broke reality itself. The chasm has no bottom—or rather, falling deep enough takes you through dimensional barriers into the Void Between Worlds. But a secret society of base jumpers and wingsuit flyers called the Fallers discovered something incredible: if you achieve perfect aerodynamic grace and surrender to the fall completely, the Void doesn't consume you—it transforms you. For a few precious minutes, you can fly like a god, manipulating gravity and wind as if they're suggestions rather than laws.
Players are newly initiated Fallers who discover that each jump into the Abyss is eroding the barriers between dimensions faster than expected. Creatures from the Void—entities that exist in pure freefall—have begun emerging. The Sky Council, bureaucratic rulers who govern the Abyss's edge cities, want to seal the chasm permanently with a massive barrier spell. But doing so would end the Fallers' flight forever and trap thousands of dimensional refugees in the Void. The players must complete the Nine Sacred Descents—legendary jump sites that, when flown in sequence, will stabilize the dimensional barriers without destroying the connection between worlds.
This is Point Break meets Inception meets How to Train Your Dragon, where every jump is both spiritual journey and physics puzzle, where falling is the only way to rise, and where the sky is just the beginning.

### 6. yard-sale-apocalypse

**Title:** Yard Sale Apocalypse

The Henderson family is moving across the country, and they're not taking everything. The yard sale is in 72 hours. For the toys of the Henderson household, this is the apocalypse—an extinction event that will scatter their community to the winds, separate bonded pairs, and send beloved companions to strangers' homes or worse, the trash. Price tags are death sentences measured in quarters.
Players are toys desperately trying to survive the sale. Some seek to make themselves essential (hide, make child remember them), others plan escape (flee before sale begins), still others embrace new futures (hoping for better homes). But the campaign's dark heart reveals itself when toys discover THE COLLECTOR—a wealthy toy collector who buys vintage toys at yard sales, seals them in plastic cases forever. Preserved. Pristine. Never played with again. Is this salvation or a fate worse than the trash?
The countdown to Saturday creates pressure. Factions form: The Loyalists (trying to stay with family), The Escapists (planning to run), The Hopefuls (preparing for new homes), and The Nihilists (accepting oblivion). As toys are priced and sorted, relationships are tested, sacrifices made, and the fundamental question asked: Is it better to be remembered by one child or discovered by another?

## Mystery

### 1. the-verdant-codex

**Title:** The Verdant Codex
## Tone

An early 15th-century illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown writing system. Its vellum pages are filled with bizarre and beautiful illustrations of unknown plant species, strange astronomical diagrams, and human figures in odd, plumbing-like contraptions. To this day, it has never been deciphered.
The book is not from the Material Plane. It is a one-of-a-kind druidic codex, a field guide to the flora, fauna, and cosmology of the Feywild, written in a forgotten dialect of Sylvan. The "plants" are fey herbs with potent, reality-bending properties. The "astronomical charts" map the chaotic, shifting constellations of the Feywild, which dictate the flow of its magic. The book was stolen from the Gloomwood Archive of a powerful Archfey centuries ago by a mortal archmage who was driven mad trying to understand it.
The players come into possession of a single, beautifully illustrated page from the Verdant Codex. A local sage, alchemist, or wizard recognizes it as something extraordinary and priceless. Soon after, the players find themselves hunted by two opposing factions: agents of the Archfey (a court of Eladrin knights and their Blink Dog companions) who wish to reclaim their sacred text with quiet dignity or lethal force, and a cabal of mortal wizards (such as the Red Wizards of Thay or a similar power-hungry group) who seek to exploit the Codex's secrets for their own gain. The campaign becomes a race to find the other scattered pages of the Codex, forcing the players to delve into ancient ruins, bargain with forgotten creatures, and ultimately travel to the chaotic beauty of the Feywild itself. They must decide whether to return the book to its rightful owners, use its power for good, or risk it falling into the wrong hands.

### 4. the-wires-game

**Title:** The Wire's Game

The city of Ironport is dying from within. Once a thriving maritime hub, it's now plagued by drugs, corruption, and institutional failure. The party begins as street-level law enforcement—beat cops, detectives, or community advocates—navigating a complex web where criminals, politicians, police, and citizens are all trapped in a failing system. This isn't a campaign about good versus evil; it's about institutions grinding people down and the rare individuals who still try to do the right thing despite knowing the system is rigged.
Over 30-40 sessions, the party will investigate drug trafficking organizations, political corruption, failing schools, the dying docks, and a media that's more interested in spectacle than truth. They'll wiretap dealers, chase politicians, watch good cops get ground down, see smart kids fall into crime, and realize that solving cases doesn't fix systems. This is *The Wire* in D&D form: a sprawling, multi-perspective examination of how cities fail and what that costs.
Street-level investigation of drug organization.

### 1. the-weather-weavers

**Title:** The Weather Weavers

In the skycities of the Aerothocracy, weather is not random—it is woven. The Weather Weaver Guilds control every raindrop, every gust of wind, every temperature shift across their domains. This monopoly on meteorology has made them the most powerful force in civilization. They sell rain to farmers, rent winds to sailors, and auction off perfect wedding weather to the wealthy. To challenge their control is treason. To practice weather magic without a guild license is death.
But the weather is fighting back. Conscious storms have begun manifesting—wild weather that refuses to be controlled, atmospheric anomalies that remember every manipulation. These "Rogue Skies" attack weather weavers specifically, destroying guild halls and killing licensed controllers. The guilds claim it's natural backlash requiring stricter control. A growing resistance called the Storm Liberation Front claims the weavers have enslaved sentient atmospheric forces, and the storms are rightfully rebelling.
The party begins caught between these forces: perhaps guild apprentices questioning their teachings, resistance members seeking redemption, or neutral parties hired for a simple job that spirals into choosing sides in a war between human control and nature's vengeance. They'll discover that both sides are partly right and terribly wrong, and that the weather weavers' greatest secret isn't just that they control the sky—it's what they imprisoned to do it, and what happens when it escapes.

### 3. tides-of-the-trident-throne

**Title:** Tides of the Trident Throne

For ten thousand years, the Seven Seas have been ruled by the Atlantean Empire—a coalition of underwater kingdoms united under the Trident Throne. The current High King, Thalassor the Peacekeeper, maintained balance between the surface and the deep, between mer-folk, aquatic elves, tritons, and sea-dwelling dragonborn. But Thalassor is dead, assassinated during the Coral Summit, and the empire fractures.
The party, neutral adventurers with ties to multiple kingdoms, witness the assassination. With their last breath, Thalassor names them as investigators and mediators. Each of the Seven Kingdoms suspects the others. Ancient rivalries resurface. The surface world, sensing weakness, prepares invasion. And from the darkest trenches, something ancient stirs—an enemy that nearly destroyed Atlantis millennia ago.
The party must navigate political intrigue, prevent civil war, uncover the true assassin, and unite the kingdoms against the rising threat. They'll broker alliances, lead armies, dive into forbidden zones, and potentially claim the Trident Throne themselves. The fate of the ocean—and the surface world—rests in their hands.

**Title:** War of the Elements

In the world of Zodiactica, the twelve zodiac kingdoms have always existed in careful balance, united by their shared celestial heritage. But that balance has shattered. A mysterious cosmic event called the Elemental Schism has caused the four elemental groups to turn violently against each other: the Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) have formed the Blazing Concordat, the Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) have united as the Granite Alliance, the Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) have created the Ethereal Covenant, and the Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) have become the Tidal Dominion.
Each faction believes the others are responsible for a great catastrophe - the dimming of the constellations themselves. As the stars fade, zodiac magic weakens, and the four elemental alliances prepare for total war. Caught in the crossfire are the Modality Nations - three neutral groups divided by Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn), Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius), and Mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) - who see that the true enemy is not each other but something far more sinister.
The party, composed of members from different elemental signs, must navigate this cosmic civil war, uncover who or what caused the Elemental Schism, and reunite the zodiac before the stars go completely dark and all zodiac magic - and the world itself - ceases to exist. They'll discover that the conflict was engineered by the Void - the anti-constellation force that seeks to plunge reality into permanent darkness.

**Title:** When Stars Walk

The zodiac constellations were never meant to leave the sky. For millennia, they've watched from above, distant and divine. But three months ago, something catastrophic happened: the Celestial Anchor - the magical tether holding constellations in the heavens - shattered. All twelve zodiac constellations fell to earth as physical beings of immense power. They didn't fall gracefully; they crashed, creating impact zones that reshaped the landscape.
Now the Starborn walk the mortal realm. Aries is a living god of war, carving a empire through conquest. Taurus has claimed fertile lands and refuses to share. Gemini split into two beings at constant war. Cancer built impenetrable fortress-cities. Leo declared himself divine emperor. Each constellation interprets their presence on Earth differently, and their godlike power backs their ambitions. Mortal kingdoms are being conquered, absorbed, or destroyed as cosmic beings impose their will.
The party are Anchor-Touched - mortals who were near the Anchor when it shattered, gaining fragments of celestial power. They can resist the Starborn's influence and channel zodiac magic. They must navigate a world ruled by walking gods, decide which Starborn to ally with or oppose, and discover what shattered the Anchor before the Starborn's presence on Earth causes the planet itself to collapse under the weight of embodied divinity.

### 1. agents-of-concordia

**Title:** Agents of Concordia

At the height of the Cold War between rival nations, two elite spies—one from each side—are forced to work together when a third faction threatens to escalate tensions into actual warfare. The players represent the two opposing intelligence agencies, assigned to partnership neither wants. As they chase international arms dealers, stop terrorist cells, and prevent nuclear-equivalent magical escalation, they discover that working with the enemy requires trusting them more than trusting your own side.
Set in the glamorous 1960s of magical espionage, this campaign mixes high-stakes action, buddy-cop chemistry between rivals, and the growing realization that both sides have been manipulated by someone who profits from the Cold War continuing forever. Fashion is impeccable, banter is sophisticated, and nobody can decide if they want to kiss or kill their partner.
This is The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) meets Cold War spy thriller—style and substance, banter and danger, enemies-to-lovers potential with high-stakes espionage. Should feel glamorous and fun while maintaining real danger. Balance lighthearted moments with serious themes.

The Eternal Feast is a legendary restaurant that exists between dimensions, accessible from any world through hidden doorways that appear to those who truly need a good meal. The party are the newly hired staff—cooks, servers, hosts—working in a restaurant where customers might be gods, demons, dragons, or desperate refugees, sometimes all at the same table. Every dish must be perfect because dissatisfied customers can literally rewrite reality, and the restaurant's neutrality must be maintained or dimensional war erupts.
The party quickly discovers they weren't hired randomly. The previous owner mysteriously vanished, and someone must figure out how to run an interdimensional restaurant while uncovering what happened to them. Each service brings new challenges: Cooking for beings with impossible dietary requirements, mediating disputes between cosmic entities, sourcing ingredients from across the multiverse, and maintaining the delicate balance that keeps the restaurant standing. As the party grows in skill and authority, they'll learn that the Eternal Feast isn't just a restaurant—it's the neutral ground that prevents the multiverse from collapsing into war.
This campaign blends Restaurant to Another World's wonder with the high-stakes diplomacy of managing a place where the wrong meal could end universes. Every shift is an adventure, every customer a potential ally or catastrophe, and every meal a chance to touch infinity.

In the beginning, the cosmos was divided not by good and evil, but by **Productivity** and **Leisure**. The realm of Ente Isla was forged from the sweat of titans, a world where worth was measured in conquest and magical output. But as the cosmic balance shifted, a metaphysical drain formed—a puncture in reality leading to a realm of pure Chaos, known only as "The Big Apple." Here, magic does not flow through ley lines but is ground into a fine dust by the turning of turnstiles and the crushing weight of capitalism. When the Demon Lord Maou was blasted through the void, he did not fall into hell; he fell into the ultimate crucible of the soul: The Service Industry.
The conflict is no longer Light vs. Dark, but **Identity vs. Reality**. The universe of Earth is a "Magic Sink"—it actively drains supernatural energy to fuel its mundane laws of physics. To survive, magical beings must either consume others (become monsters) or generate "Stability" through mundane routines (become citizens). The struggle is to maintain one's soul without magic to prop it up.

The players are residents of Asagao Village, a tiny rural community with only five students in its one-room schoolhouse. Perhaps they're the young students themselves experiencing the slow, peaceful rhythm of countryside life, or they're adults (a new teacher, a returning resident, visiting relatives) rediscovering tranquility through the village's gentle pace. The campaign follows daily life through the seasons – school lessons, countryside exploration, village festivals, agricultural rhythms, and the profound beauty in seemingly mundane moments. Nothing dramatic ever happens, and that's exactly the point. It's about presence, peace, and remembering how to simply be.
There is no conflict in the traditional sense. The only "tension" is the adjustment from city urgency to rural peace, and the bittersweet awareness that this gentle life exists outside normal time, making moments precious because they're fleeting yet eternal.

## Adventure

### 1. above-the-cloudline

**Title:** Above the Cloudline

A mysterious beanstalk has erupted overnight, tearing through the center of the capital city and piercing the cloud layer above. It grows impossibly tall—miles into the sky—its massive vines thick as castle towers, leaves large enough to serve as platforms. The royal court is in chaos. Scholars are baffled. And something is descending from above: enormous objects falling through clouds, crushing buildings. Thunderous footsteps echo from the heights.
The party is hired (or volunteers) to climb the beanstalk and discover what lies above the clouds. What they find is a fully-realized world: the **Cloud Kingdoms of the Giants**, a civilization existing on clouds made solid through ancient magic. Giants live here—some peaceful farmers, some aggressive hunters, others noble lords in crystalline castles. To the giants, the world below is legend, a dangerous "underworld" they avoid. The beanstalk's growth was accidental, and now both societies face a crisis.
The campaign combines fairy-tale wonder with practical challenges: navigating a world where you're mouse-sized, diplomacy with beings who might accidentally crush you, heist-style infiltration of giant-scale locations, and moral complexity when you discover the giants aren't monsters—they're people whose society is as nuanced as your own. Jack and the Beanstalk meets Gulliver's Travels, with D&D politics and environmental puzzles.
