# Cartel Wars
## *"Plata o plomo" - Silver or lead?*

### Campaign Overview

In the tropical kingdoms of the South, magical cocaine has created empires that rival legitimate governments. The party can play as: (1) Law enforcement agents hunting the cartels, or (2) Cartel members building and defending an empire. Either way, this is a sprawling crime saga spanning years, countries, and moral compromises.

The campaign follows the rise and fall of the Medellín Cartel equivalent—led by the charismatic and ruthless Pablo Escobar analogue—and the subsequent Cali Cartel power struggle. If playing law enforcement: Navigate corruption, politics, and impossible odds. If playing criminals: Build an empire, enjoy luxury, and watch it collapse under its own weight.

This is Narcos: Epic in scope, tragic in outcome, morally complex throughout. Nobody's hands stay clean.

### Core Themes

- **Glamour and Horror**: Luxury built on corpses
- **Colonialism and Class**: North vs. South dynamics
- **Family and Business**: Blood ties in blood business

### Unique Mechanics

**Corruption System**
- Everyone has price: "Plata o plomo"
- Bribe or threaten NPCs
- Institutional corruption tracking
- Point of no return: System too corrupt to fix

**Empire Building**
- For cartel PCs: Grow operation
- Territory, routes, production, distribution
- Profit vs. exposure balance
- More success = more heat

**Investigation Web**
- For law enforcement PCs
- Build case, follow money, flip informants
- Bureaucracy and corruption obstacles
- International cooperation challenges

**Moral Degradation**
- Both sides make compromises
- Each choice makes next easier/harder
- Character transformation tracking
- "You either die a hero..."

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**For Law Enforcement:**
Victory: Major cartel leaders caught/killed. But more take their place. System still broken. Personal cost enormous.

**For Cartels:**
Victory: Impossible. Empire building just delays inevitable fall. Best outcome: Escape with wealth and life. Likely: Death or prison.

Either way: The drug war continues. Nobody really wins.

This is Narcos: Epic, tragic, and honest about the cost of the eternal war on drugs.
