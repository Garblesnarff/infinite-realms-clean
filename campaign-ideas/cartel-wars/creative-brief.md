# Cartel Wars - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
Tropical luxury meets brutal violence. Colombian coffee country, urban Medellín, jungle labs. Contrast between beauty and horror. Narcos aesthetic: saturated colors, period-appropriate (fantasy 1980s-90s).

**Colors**: Jungle green, cocaine white, blood red, gold (wealth), military khaki, Caribbean blue

## Music
Latin American music: Cumbia, salsa, narcocorridos. Period-appropriate pop. Tense strings for drama. Opening theme equivalent of "Tuyo" - haunting, Spanish language.

## Voice Direction
**Pablo**: Charming but terrifying, Colombian accent equivalent
**DEA Agents**: American outsiders, increasingly cynical
**Cali Leaders**: Businesslike, cold calculation
**Sicarios**: Young, desperate, violent

## Cinematic Moments
- Pablo's Robin Hood moments
- Palace of Justice siege
- Rooftop chase and death
- "Gentlemen prefer Cali"
- Surveillance and cat-and-mouse games
- Family farewells before violence
