# Creative Brief: The People's Mask

## Art Style: Dystopian Urban Gothic

Inspired by V for Vendetta's blend of fascist aesthetics, Guy Fawkes imagery, and urban rebellion. Dark, oppressive architecture contrasted with moments of beauty and hope.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
- Regime: Grays, blacks, deep reds, cold blues.
- Resistance: Warmer colors hidden in shadows.
- V: Black and white with shocking red accents.

**Character Design:**
- V: Iconic Guy Fawkes mask, flowing black cloak, theatrical presence.
- Citizens: Uniformly gray, oppressed, gradually adding color as resistance grows.
- Regime: Black uniforms, symbols of authority.

**Environments:**
- Oppressive architecture—brutalist buildings, surveillance everywhere.
- Underground resistance spaces warm and filled with contraband culture.
- Streets can transform from gray oppression to colorful uprising.

**Symbolism:** Guy Fawkes masks proliferating, roses as symbols of resistance, government propaganda posters defaced.

## Voice

**V:** Theatrical, eloquent, British accent, quotes literature and philosophy constantly.
**Common People:** Various accents, afraid to speak freely at first, growing bolder.

## Music

*   Classical music (V's preference) contrasted with martial regime anthems.
*   Growing crescendo of revolutionary songs.
*   Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture for finale.
