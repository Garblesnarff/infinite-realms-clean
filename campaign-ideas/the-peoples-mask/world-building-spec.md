### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The People's Mask**

**1. Core Concept**
*   In a kingdom under fascist regime, a masked revolutionary named V begins a campaign to overthrow the government. The party are resistance members navigating moral complexity of violent revolution and deciding whether to support V's apocalyptic plan or find another path.

**2. Lore & History**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail how the regime rose to power—manufactured crisis, fear-mongering, consolidation of power.
    *   Explain Larkhill—detention center where regime experimented on political prisoners, creating V.
    *   Chronicle the suppression—banned art, censored media, constant surveillance, disappeared citizens.
    *   Describe pre-regime era—what freedom looked like, what was lost.

**3. Factions**
*   **The Regime** (Major): Fascist government maintaining control through fear and surveillance.
*   **The Underground Resistance** (Major): Various cells with different philosophies.

**4. NPCs**
*   **Tier 1:** V, Evey, Chancellor Sutler, Inspector Finch, Mr. Creedy.
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** Resistance members, regime enforcers, citizens.

**5. Locations**

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party's actions increase public support for resistance.

*   **IF:** Party supports V's violent methods.
*   **THEN:** Effective at damaging regime but risks alienating moderates.
*   **IF:** Party seeks peaceful reform.
*   **THEN:** Slower progress but less bloodshed; regime may co-opt movement.
*   **IF:** Parliament is destroyed on anniversary.
*   **THEN:** Regime falls but chaos follows—party must help shape what comes next.
*   **IF:** Party exposes regime's crimes without destruction.
*   **THEN:** Potential for reform rather than revolution; less dramatic but perhaps more stable.
