# The Grand Conjunction
**Tagline:** *When all the planets align, reality itself can be rewritten*

## Campaign Overview

Every 500 years, all planets in the celestial system align perfectly in what's called the Grand Conjunction. During this 48-hour window, the veil between possibility and reality becomes thin, and cosmic magic reaches its apex. Zodiac lords, celestial beings, and ambitious mortals can reshape reality itself using the conjunction's power. The last Grand Conjunction created the current world order, but this one threatens to unmake it.

Twelve factions - one for each zodiac sign - have been preparing for centuries, each with a different vision for how reality should be rewritten. The Aries Warband wants eternal conflict. The Taurus Collective seeks frozen perfection. The Gemini Synod desires infinite possibilities. Each faction has gathered Constellation Shards - fragments of cosmic power needed to channel the conjunction. The party, caught in the middle of this cosmic power struggle, must either help one faction win, forge a coalition, or find the legendary Thirteenth Shard that would allow them to write their own reality.

The conjunction countdown has begun: 30 days until alignment. The factions are moving openly now, making bold plays for power. The party discovers they're Conjunction-Touched - born during the last conjunction with the ability to perceive and manipulate reality's underlying code. They're the wild card every faction wants to recruit or eliminate. The campaign is a race against time to gather enough Constellation Shards, build alliances, and prepare for the moment when reality itself becomes malleable.

## Core Themes

- **Power and Responsibility:** What would you do if you could reshape reality?
- **Conflicting Visions:** Multiple valid but incompatible ideals
- **Cosmic Stakes:** The entire nature of reality is at stake
- **Countdown Pressure:** Time is running out
- **Coalition Building:** No single faction can win alone

**The Rewriting Chamber:** Where final reality editing occurs

## Unique Mechanics

### Conjunction Countdown
- 30 days until conjunction
- Reality becomes more malleable each day
- At Day 20: Minor reality edits possible
- At Day 10: Major reality edits possible
- At Day 3: Reality becomes unstable
- At Day 0: Total malleability for 48 hours

### Constellation Shards
- 18 Shards total (12 factions hold 16, 2 are hidden)
- Each Shard grants power to shape one aspect of reality
- Collecting multiple Shards increases influence
- Thirteenth Shard acts as moderating force

### Reality Code Perception
- Party can see underlying structure of reality
- Can make small edits even before conjunction
- Helps navigate faction strongholds
- Key to using Shards effectively

### Coalition Building
- Track relationships with all twelve factions
- Compatible factions easier to ally (Fire signs with each other, etc.)
- Incompatible factions require compromise
- Final coalition determines power balance

### Vision Compatibility
Each faction's vision has strengths and flaws:
- Players must identify which visions have merit
- No perfect answer exists
- Compromise creates the best reality
- Extremism leads to catastrophe

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **One faction is lying about their vision:** Their true goal is preventing all rewrites, keeping current reality.

2. **The conjunction can be delayed:** But doing so requires sacrifice.

3. **Previous conjunctions created current problems:** Each "fix" creates new issues.

4. **The party's Conjunction-Touched nature:** They were engineered by the last conjunction as failsafe.

5. **The Thirteenth Shard is sentient:** It judges who should use it.

6. **Reality rewrite affects the past:** Changing reality changes history retroactively.
