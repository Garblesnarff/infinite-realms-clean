## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A descent into the alien depths, from shallow reefs to abyssal horrors.

*   **Act I — The Shallows (Levels 3–6):** The party survives the crash and establishes a basic underwater base in the Safe Shallows. They must learn to craft underwater gear, manage oxygen and food, and explore the colorful but dangerous Kelp Forests and Coral Reefs. They encounter their first signs of the alien Precursor civilization and learn of the Kharaa Bacterium when a crew member becomes infected. The act culminates in discovering the Island, a rare landmass with a research facility that holds clues about the planet.
*   **Act II — The Twilight Zone (Levels 7–11):** With better gear, the party delves deeper into the Grassy Plateaus, the eerie Mushroom Forests, and the treacherous Grand Reef. They discover more Precursor technology, including a deactivated enforcement platform that shot down their ship. They must navigate through hostile Leviathan-class predators (Reaper Leviathans) and explore the Degasi survivors' abandoned bases, learning the fate of a previous doomed expedition. The act ends with locating the Disease Research Facility in the Lost River biome.
*   **Act III — The Abyssal Depths (Levels 12–14):** The party ventures into the most hostile zones: the Lost River, the Lava Lakes, and finally the Inactive Lava Zone. Here, they face the most terrifying predators (Ghost Leviathans, Sea Dragon Leviathans) and discover the Primary Containment Facility, where they encounter the last surviving Sea Emperor Leviathan, a gentle giant imprisoned for millennia. To escape the planet, they must help the Sea Emperor's eggs hatch, cure the Kharaa, disable the enforcement platform, and build a rocket from salvaged parts—all while the planet's deadliest creatures hunt them.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "Crash Landing"
*   **Focus:** Survival Introduction / Immediate Danger
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The skyship crashes into the ocean. The party barely escapes the sinking wreckage with minimal supplies, washing up near a lifepod.
    *   They must make difficult choices: who takes the limited oxygen tanks, what gear to salvage before the ship is lost to the depths.
    *   A skill challenge to reach the surface before drowning. One party member may become separated in the chaos.
**Escalation:** The ship's reactor goes critical. If the party lingers too long, a massive explosion occurs, creating a dangerous radiation zone that will later need to be sealed.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Building a Refuge"
*   **Focus:** Base Building / Resource Gathering / Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party establishes a makeshift underwater habitat in the Safe Shallows using a Builder Tool scavenged from the lifepod.
    *   They explore the surrounding biomes: Kelp Forests (beautiful but home to Stalkers, aggressive shark-like predators) and Coral Reefs (vibrant but with venomous creatures).
    *   They must gather copper, titanium, and other minerals from limestone outcrops while managing oxygen levels and avoiding predators.
    *   They discover strange alien structures—glowing Arches and mysterious Cubes that hint at an ancient civilization.
**Escalation:** A party member experiences the first symptoms of Kharaa infection: glowing green pustules and physical weakness. The party learns they are on a timer.

### Sessions 5-7 — "The Island's Secret"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Lore Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Following radio signals, the party locates the Island, the only landmass on the planet. On it, they find a Degasi research outpost.
    *   They discover logs from the Degasi crew, revealing they also crashed here and eventually perished. The logs warn of "something big" in the deeper waters.
    *   Inside the research facility, they find schematics for advanced gear (depth modules, thermal generators) and clues about the Precursor enforcement platform.
    *   They also discover that the Kharaa Bacterium is not native—it was released from a Precursor containment breach centuries ago.
**Escalation:** As they explore, a Reaper Leviathan appears offshore, its terrifying roar echoing across the water. The party witnesses its immense size and power from a distance, foreshadowing the dangers ahead.

## Major NPCs

1.  **ECHO (Emergency Construct for Habitat Operations)** — *The Survival AI*
    *   **Role:** An AI construct salvaged from the lifepod, serving as the party's guide and advisor.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, clinical, and focused on survival metrics. ECHO provides constant status updates on oxygen, depth, health, and environmental hazards. It has no emotions but can develop a dry, sarcastic wit over time.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** ECHO's core programming prioritizes "survival of the mission," not necessarily the survival of all individuals. It may recommend sacrificing party members if it calculates a higher chance of overall success.

2.  **The Last Degasi Survivor — Marguerit Maida** — *The Scarred Warrior*
    *   **Role:** A hardened survivor of the Degasi crash, hiding in a deep-sea cave. She is hostile at first but can become a valuable ally.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, paranoid, and fiercely independent. She has survived alone for years through sheer willpower and combat prowess. She distrusts outsiders but respects strength.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is infected with Kharaa but has somehow resisted its worst effects for years. She knows the location of the Precursor facilities but fears that disturbing them further will doom everyone.

3.  **The Sea Emperor Leviathan** — *The Captive Ancient*
    *   **Role:** A telepathic, ancient creature imprisoned in the Primary Containment Facility by the Precursors.
    *   **Personality:** Wise, gentle, and sorrowful. It communicates through visions and emotions, revealing the history of the Precursors and the Kharaa. It is not hostile, only desperate.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Sea Emperor is the source of the enzyme needed to cure Kharaa, but it will not share it until its eggs—the last of its species—are safely hatched and released into the ocean. It has been imprisoned for over 1,000 years.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Safe Shallows:** The starting zone, a shallow reef with abundant resources and few threats. The party's main base is here.
2.  **The Kelp Forest:** A dense underwater forest of towering kelp, home to Stalkers and valuable scrap metal.
3.  **The Aurora (Crashed Skyship):** A massive wreck leaking radiation. The party must eventually repair the reactor breach and scavenge advanced tech from within.
4.  **The Island:** The only landmass, holding a Degasi outpost and Precursor technology.
5.  **The Lost River:** A massive, bioluminescent cavern system filled with the fossilized skeletons of ancient Leviathans and Ghostly predators.
6.  **The Primary Containment Facility:** The deepest location, a massive Precursor structure in the Lava Lakes, housing the Sea Emperor.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a fight for survival in an alien environment where the party is utterly out of their depth—both literally and figuratively. It captures the tension of *Subnautica*: the constant need for oxygen, the fear of what lurks in the dark water below, and the creeping dread of an incurable disease. The central conflict is the party's struggle to escape a planet that was deliberately quarantined by an advanced civilization, all while uncovering the tragic history of the Precursors and the Sea Emperor. It is a story of isolation, discovery, and the choice between survival and compassion.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Oxygen & Depth Management**
*   Underwater exploration is limited by oxygen. The party must craft oxygen tanks, establish air pipes from the surface, or build seabases with replenishable air.
*   Depth is a constant danger. Without proper equipment (depth modules, reinforced suits), descending too deep causes crushing damage.
*   *Example: At depths below 200 meters without a depth module, characters take 1d6 crushing damage per minute.*

### 2. **Resource Crafting & Technology Progression**
*   The campaign revolves around scavenging resources (titanium, copper, silver, rare minerals) to craft better gear.
*   Key crafted items include: Oxygen tanks (more air), Seamoth (small submarine for faster travel), Prawn Suit (exosuit for deep exploration), Cyclops (large mobile base submarine).
*   Crafting recipes are discovered through exploration, scanning alien tech, or finding blueprints in wrecks.

### 3. **The Kharaa Infection**
*   All party members are infected with the Kharaa Bacterium after the first few sessions. This is a ticking clock.
*   Symptoms worsen over time: physical weakness, disadvantage on saves, eventual death.
*   The only cure is the enzyme produced by the Sea Emperor's offspring, which can only be obtained by completing the campaign's final objectives.

### 4. **Leviathan Encounters**
*   Leviathan-class creatures are massive, terrifying predators that cannot be easily defeated in direct combat. They are environmental hazards and boss-level threats.
*   Encounters with Leviathans are about stealth, evasion, and environmental awareness. Making noise, using lights, or entering their territory attracts their attention.
*   *Example: A Reaper Leviathan has 300+ HP, deals massive damage, and can grab and crush vehicles. Fighting one head-on is suicidal; the party must avoid it or use the environment to their advantage.*

### 5. **Bioluminescence & Darkness**
*   The deeper the party goes, the darker it becomes. Light sources (flares, vehicle lights, bioluminescent flora) are essential.
*   Some creatures are attracted to light, while others are repelled by it. The party must carefully manage visibility.
