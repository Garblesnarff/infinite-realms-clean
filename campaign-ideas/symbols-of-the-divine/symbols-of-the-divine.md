## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Puzzle-Heavy:** Success requires decoding symbols, solving riddles, understanding religious iconography.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15–18 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Murder (Sessions 1–3):** The Curator Jacques Saunière is murdered in the Louvre equivalent. His body is positioned as Vitruvian Man, surrounded by symbols. He left cryptic clues visible only with blacklight: numerical sequences, anagrams, symbols. Party (including symbology expert and cryptographer) must decode them while avoiding both church authorities and city watch who suspect them.

*   **Act II — The Secret Society (Sessions 4–7):** Clues lead to discovering Saunière was Grand Master of the Priory of Sion—ancient secret society protecting a dangerous truth. They meet Leigh Teabing (scholar who explains the conspiracy). Learn about the Quest for the Holy Grail—not a cup, but a person: the bloodline of the divine.

*   **Act III — The Chase (Sessions 8–12):** Pursued by Opus Dei equivalent (fanatical religious sect) and their albino monk assassin Silas. Race across famous temples, cathedrals, and holy sites solving puzzles in sacred architecture. Each location reveals more of the conspiracy: sacred feminine suppressed by patriarchal church, divine marriage, hidden descendants.

*   **Act IV — The Keystone (Sessions 13–15):** Discovering the Keystone—a cryptex (magical puzzle box) containing directions to the final secret: where the sacred feminine relics and proof of the divine bloodline are hidden. Betrayal by Teabing (who wants to expose the truth to destroy the church, regardless of cost).

*   **Act V — The Temple (Sessions 16–18):** Final location beneath Rosslyn Chapel equivalent. Discovery of Mary Magdalene's tomb and proof of her role as the divine's wife and mother of the bloodline. Party must decide: expose the truth (destroying the church but bringing truth) or protect the secret (preserving stability but continuing the lie). Climax involves confronting both Teabing and Opus Dei.

## Central Conflict

Truth versus Faith. The party uncovers evidence suggesting the realm's dominant religion was built on deliberate suppression of the sacred feminine, political manipulation, and historical revisionism. The "heresy" is that the divine figure (equivalent to Jesus) was married to Mary Magdalene, had children, and that bloodline continues. The church gained power by making the divine celibate and masculine, erasing feminine divinity.

The central question: Is it right to expose a truth that will shatter millions of believers' faith? Or protect a lie that provides meaning and community? Who gets to decide what truths should be known?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Symbology System**
*   Locations contain hidden symbols in art, architecture, and texts.
*   Investigation checks reveal symbols; Religion/History checks interpret meaning.
*   Symbols form interconnected web—understanding one helps decode others.
*   DM prepares symbol handouts for players to examine.

### 2. **The Cryptex**
*   Magical puzzle box with rotating rings containing letters.
*   Must spell the correct password to open without destroying contents.
*   Contains further clues or the final map.
*   Forcing it open triggers acid that destroys contents (permanent failure).

### 3. **The Chase Mechanics**
*   Skill challenge: alternating between puzzle-solving and evading pursuers.
*   Silas and authorities are always one step behind.
*   Time pressure: must solve clues quickly before being caught.
*   Safe houses provide temporary respite to research.

### 4. **Historical Research**
*   Access to libraries, ancient texts, and forbidden archives.
*   Lore checks reveal historical context for symbols and conspiracy.
*   Teabing's lectures provide exposition but with his biased perspective.

### 5. **The Fibonacci Sequence**
*   Numbers left by Saunière: 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
*   Recognizing it as Fibonacci sequence (out of order) unlocks first clue.
*   Rearranging reveals message: 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21

### 6. **Anagram Puzzles**
*   Saunière left anagrams pointing to locations and concepts.
*   "O, Draconian devil!" = "Oh, lame saint!" = Leonardo da Vinci equivalent
*   Players must solve word puzzles under pressure.

### 7. **Sacred Geometry**
*   Architecture contains coded messages in proportions and alignments.
*   Golden ratio, pentagram patterns, Rose Line (magical ley line).
*   Requires spatial reasoning and mathematical insight.

## The Great Conspiracy (The "Truth")

**Suppressed History:**
*   The divine figure (Jesus equivalent) married Mary Magdalene
*   They had a child (daughter) together
*   After the divine's death, Mary fled with the child to protect the bloodline
*   The early church, seeking patriarchal power, branded Mary as prostitute, erasing her true role
*   The Holy Grail is not a cup—it's the womb of Mary (San Graal = Sang Real = Royal Blood)
*   The bloodline continued through European royal houses
*   The Priory of Sion has protected this secret and the bloodline for millennia
*   Sacred feminine wisdom and goddess worship were systematically suppressed
*   Sophie Neveu is herself a descendant of the bloodline

**The Evidence:**
*   Ancient texts (equivalent to Gnostic Gospels) describing Mary's role
*   Sacred art hiding symbols (Last Supper painting shows Mary beside the divine, not John)
*   Architectural codes in churches and temples
*   Genealogical records maintained by the Priory
*   Mary Magdalene's bones and relics hidden in final vault

---

## Campaign Themes

*   **Hidden Truth in Plain Sight:** Symbols everywhere, unnoticed for centuries.
*   **Suppression of the Feminine:** Patriarchal religion erasing goddess worship.
*   **Faith vs. Evidence:** When proof contradicts belief, which prevails?
*   **Power and Control:** How institutions manipulate history to maintain authority.
*   **The Quest for Knowledge:** Academic pursuit of truth regardless of comfort.
*   **Moral Complexity:** No clear right answer to the final choice.

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign succeeds when:
*   The party solves all the puzzles and reaches the final revelation
*   They survive pursuit by antagonists
*   They make an informed choice about what to do with the truth
*   Sophie discovers her heritage and decides her own path

There's no "wrong" choice at the end—exposing or protecting the secret both have merit.

---

## The Final Choice

**Option A — Expose the Truth:**
*   Reveal evidence publicly, providing proof to the world
*   Consequences: Church power collapses, faith crisis, social upheaval, but truth prevails
*   Teabing's goal, but the party can do it more carefully than his zealotry

**Option B — Protect the Secret:**
*   Preserve the evidence but keep it hidden
*   Consequences: Church remains powerful, lies continue, but stability maintained
*   Follow Saunière's path—the truth is protected but not weaponized

**Option C — Destroy the Evidence:**
*   Burn the proof, end the conspiracy forever
*   Consequences: Truth is lost forever, but conflict ends permanently
*   Most destructive option but brings peace

**Option D — Partial Revelation:**
*   Reveal some truths, protect dangerous elements, reform the church from within
*   Requires delicate political maneuvering

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Research real symbology and art history for authentic puzzles
*   Prepare visual handouts: symbols, paintings, architectural diagrams
*   Create detailed timelines of the conspiracy's "true history"
*   Balance exposition (through Teabing's lectures) with discovery
*   Ensure puzzles have logical solutions players can deduce
*   Study chase scene pacing—alternating tension and problem-solving
*   Session Zero discussion of religious themes and player comfort levels
*   Don't make this about real-world religions—fantasy equivalent
*   Prepare for players to solve puzzles in unexpected ways (reward creativity)
*   Teabing's betrayal should be foreshadowed but not obvious
*   Create Silas as sympathetic villain—he believes he's serving good
*   Research real-world Priory of Sion, Knights Templar, sacred feminine scholarship
*   The "truth" is fictional in your world—present it as historical mystery, not theology

*   Remaining Opus Dei members seeking revenge
