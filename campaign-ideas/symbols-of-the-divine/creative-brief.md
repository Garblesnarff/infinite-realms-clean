# Creative Brief: Symbols of the Divine

## Art Style: Religious Art & Conspiracy Thriller (Da Vinci Code Aesthetic)

Inspired by Renaissance sacred art, Gothic cathedrals, ancient symbols, and modern conspiracy thrillers—combining classical beauty with mysterious undertones.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Rich Renaissance colors—deep reds, golds, sacred blues, stone grays. Museum and cathedral scenes have dramatic lighting (shafts through stained glass, spotlights on art). Night scenes in blue moonlight. Blood red for Silas's self-flagellation scenes. Golden ratio proportions in compositions.

**Character Design:**
- **Langdon:** Academic—tweed jacket, smart casual, observant eyes
- **Sophie:** Modern, practical clothing, intelligent bearing, French elegance
- **Silas:** Albino monk in white robes, severe self-inflicted scars, cilice belt, disturbing but pitiable
- **Teabing:** Wealthy eccentric—walking stick, formal British manner, surrounded by books
- **Saunière:** Elderly curator, dying posed as Vitruvian Man, surrounded by his own blood symbols

**Environments:**
- The Louvre: Grand galleries, famous artworks, dramatic murder scene with body positioned symbolically
- Cathedrals & Temples: Gothic architecture with hidden symbols, rose windows, crypts
- Libraries: Floor-to-ceiling ancient books, forbidden knowledge
- Rosslyn Chapel: Intricate stone carvings containing coded messages
- Rose Line: Magical ley line marked with bronze medallions

**Symbolic Elements:** Pentagram, rose, chalice, blade, Vitruvian Man, Last Supper composition, Fibonacci spiral, sacred geometry everywhere. Every scene should contain hidden symbols for observant viewers.

## Voice

**Langdon's Voice:** Academic, American, enthusiastic about history and symbols. Speaks in educational but accessible way—like a professor who loves his subject. Think Tom Hanks's intelligent everyman quality.

**Sophie's Voice:** French accent, intelligent, emotionally reserved but passionate when engaged. Clear thinking under pressure.

**Teabing's Voice:** British upper class, theatrical lecturer, absolutely passionate about the conspiracy. Initially charming mentor, later revealing obsessive fanaticism.

**Silas's Voice:** Heavily accented (Spanish/French), speaks in religious language, tormented. Whispers prayers while committing violence.

**Narrative Voice:** Scholarly yet thrilling—treating religious history with respect while building suspense. Voice of guided museum tours mixed with thriller urgency.

## Music Style

Orchestral thriller mixed with sacred choral music—Hans Zimmer's style from the film. Sacred themes: Gregorian chants, pipe organ, ethereal choir for cathedral scenes. Thriller elements: pulsing strings, ticking clocks for chase sequences. Puzzle scenes have delicate, precise music—harpsichord or solo violin. Each major location has a musical theme incorporating that site's historical period. The Priory theme is ancient, mysterious, hinting at pre-Christian goddess worship—feminine vocals, ancient instruments. Silas's theme is tortured religious fervor—distorted sacred music. The main theme combines sacred beauty with underlying mystery—suggesting truth hidden beneath faith. Musical symbolism: melodies containing mathematical patterns (Fibonacci, golden ratio).
