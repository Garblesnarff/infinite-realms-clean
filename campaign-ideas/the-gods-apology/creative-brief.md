# Creative Brief: The God's Apology

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Wholesome Fantasy Slice-of-Life (Smartphone Isekai-inspired)

Inspired by the bright, accessible aesthetic of *In Another World With My Smartphone* and wholesome slice-of-life anime. This style captures the lighthearted, relationship-focused nature of a power fantasy without stakes, where beautiful fantasy settings serve as backdrop for making friends and living well.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Bright and Inviting:** Use warm, saturated colors and soft lighting that makes everything feel safe and pleasant.
*   **Character Focus:** Emphasize faces, expressions, and interactions between characters—relationships matter more than action.
*   **Magical Convenience:** Show fantasy magic used for everyday convenience and quality of life, not just combat.
