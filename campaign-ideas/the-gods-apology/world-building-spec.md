### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The God's Apology**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** After a divine accident causes the party's premature deaths, a remorseful god resurrects them in a fantasy world with divine boons and a magical smartphone. They must navigate this new world with their overpowered gifts, making friends, helping people, and preventing conflicts through kindness and creative problem-solving in a wholesome, low-stakes adventure.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the current world's divine system: multiple gods who occasionally interact with mortals, grant blessings, and sometimes make mistakes (like accidentally killing the party).
    *   Write the history of the Lost Civilization: an advanced society that combined magic and technology to create a utopia, but mysteriously vanished millennia ago, leaving behind ruins and automated systems.
    *   Describe the current kingdoms: Belfast (prosperous, well-governed), Regulus (martial, honorable), Refreese (Empire with grand traditions), and others—all generally peaceful with normal diplomatic tensions.
    *   Explain the magic system: most people can use basic magic with training, but specialization requires aptitude. The party's divine boons make them exceptional.
    *   Detail the adventurer's guild system: how quests work, ranks, and how it helps maintain peace by providing employment for combat-capable individuals.
    *   Write about the ancient guardian beasts: powerful magical creatures that once served the Lost Civilization and now seek worthy partners.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Kingdom of Belfast** (Major - Home Base)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain prosperity, protect citizens, encourage trade and learning.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Monarchy with noble houses, competent bureaucracy, strong but not aggressive military.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We provide safe, prosperous lives for all our citizens.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None—they're genuinely well-run and benevolent.
        *   **Assets:** Wealth, stable government, magical academy, good relations with neighbors.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with Regulus, friendly trade with Refreese, welcoming to the party.
    *   **Kingdom of Regulus** (Major - Ally)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain martial honor, protect borders, prove strength.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Martial monarchy valuing combat prowess and honor.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Strength and honor define worth.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Slight inferiority complex about being less magically advanced than Belfast.
        *   **Assets:** Powerful military, warrior tradition, valuable mineral resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Competitive but friendly with Belfast, neutral with Refreese, respect the party's power.
    *   **Refreese Empire** (Major - Potential Ally)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain imperial prestige, expand cultural influence, preserve ancient traditions.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Emperor with noble houses, complex bureaucracy, formalized ranks.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The Empire is eternal and brings civilization to all.

        *   **Assets:** Large population, rich history, powerful nobles, ancient artifacts.
        *   **Relationships:** Diplomatic with Belfast, competitive with Regulus, curious about the party.

        *   **Relationships:** Neutral facilitator respected by all kingdoms, supportive of the party.
    *   **The Lost Civilization (Remnants)** (Minor - Ancient)
        *   **Goals:** AI trying to fulfill ancient programming, guardian beasts seeking purpose.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Central AI with networked systems, independent guardian beasts.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—mostly dormant or unknown.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The AI wants to "restart" civilization, beasts want worthy partners.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced magitech, powerful constructs, hidden knowledge.
