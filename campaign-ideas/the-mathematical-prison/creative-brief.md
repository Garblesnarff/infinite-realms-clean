# Creative Brief: The Mathematical Prison

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Clinical Minimalism with Industrial Horror (Cube-inspired)

Inspired by *Cube*—blending stark geometric minimalism with industrial death traps, mathematical precision with psychological breakdown, and sterile white rooms with brutal violence.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Geometric Simplicity:** Perfect cube rooms, identical and disorienting
*   **Color-Coded Rooms:** Different colored lighting marking sections
*   **Mathematical Death:** Traps that are precise, mechanical, brutal
*   **Claustrophobic:** Tight spaces, no escape, walls closing in psychologically

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Mathematical prison, puzzle death traps, claustrophobia, paranoia, prime numbers, escape
*   **Feeling:** The terror of being trapped with no exit. The breakdown of sanity in identical rooms. Death by calculation error.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary:** Stark whites, industrial grays, black shadows
*   **Room Coding:** Each section has tinted lighting—blue, red, green, yellow
*   **Trap Mechanisms:** Metallic silvers, rust browns, blood red
*   **Numbers:** Black or colored digits on white walls
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by clinical white walls and gray metal fixtures. The cube room is bathed in cold blue-tinted lighting from panels. Black numbers are stenciled on the wall: 583-472-917. Silver mechanical trap mechanisms are visible in ceiling. High contrast and sterile feel creates unsettling environment."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Simple Clothing:** Plain shirts, pants, nothing distinctive
*   **No Props:** Stripped of possessions, only themselves
*   **Progressive Degradation:** Clean initially, become dirty, injured, exhausted
*   **Varied Archetypes:** Mathematician, cop, doctor, engineer, savant
*   **Prompt Example:** "A small group of people in simple casual clothing—plain t-shirts, jeans, practical shoes. They look bewildered and frightened, standing in the center of a white cube room. Various ages and backgrounds evident. One person examining numbers on wall, another checking a hatch nervously. Already showing signs of stress—disheveled hair, worried expressions."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Cube Rooms:** Identical 14x14x14 foot white cubes
*   **Six Hatches:** Circular doors on all surfaces (floor, ceiling, four walls)
*   **Number Panels:** Sequences displayed near hatches
*   **Colored Lighting:** Tinted panels indicating room sections
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a perfect cube-shaped room. White walls, floor, and ceiling creating disorienting uniformity. Six circular hatches—one on each wall, one floor, one ceiling. Each hatch has a wheel mechanism for opening. Near one hatch, a panel displays numbers: 645-372-489. Blue-tinted lighting from overhead panels. The geometric perfection is unsettling."

**5. The Traps:**
*   **Mechanical Precision:** Industrial mechanisms, no magic
*   **Brutal Efficiency:** Razor wire, acid spray, flames, crushing plates
*   **Triggered Movement:** Traps activate when room is entered
*   **Mathematical:** Following number sequences, patterns
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cube room mid-trap activation. Razor-thin wires shoot across the space in a grid pattern at incredible speed. The wires are nearly invisible but catch light with metallic gleam. A person caught mid-movement, face showing horror. The trap is mechanical, industrial, precise. Blood begins to spray. The clinical white room makes the violence more horrific."

**6. Navigation & Mapping:**
*   **Coordinate Systems:** Characters track position via number sequences
*   **Hand-Drawn Maps:** Desperate attempts to chart thousands of rooms
*   **The Expanse:** Visualization showing the Cube's enormous scale
*   **Movement:** Climbing through hatches between rooms
*   **Prompt Example:** "A character holding a torn piece of cloth with hand-drawn map sketched in blood. The map shows connected squares representing cube rooms, with numbers noted. Their expression is desperate—the map is incomplete, contradictory. Behind them, another cube room stretches through an open hatch. The enormity of the task is evident."

**7. Psychological Horror:**
*   **Identical Rooms:** Disorientation from sameness
*   **Paranoia:** Close-ups of suspicious, fearful faces
*   **Breakdown:** Characters becoming unhinged
*   **Violence:** Party members turning on each other
*   **Prompt Example:** "Close-up of two faces in harsh lighting. One shows paranoid suspicion, the other defensive fear. They're inches apart in the cramped cube room. Behind them, others watch nervously. The confined space amplifies every emotion. Sweat, grime, fear visible on their faces. The psychological pressure is breaking them."

**8. The Numbers:**
*   **Everywhere:** Displayed on panels near hatches
*   **Mathematical Sequences:** Prime numbers, factorizations, coordinates
*   **Life or Death:** Correct calculation means safety, error means trap
*   **Larger Numbers:** Increasing difficulty as they progress
*   **Prompt Example:** "Close-up of a number panel on white wall: '645-372-489'. A character's hand traces the numbers, lips moving as they calculate. Sweat beads on their forehead. A calculator-like intensity in their eyes. Another person watches anxiously. The numbers are life and death. Simple black digits on white creating maximum contrast."

**9. The Shell & Movement:**
*   **Rooms Rotating:** Massive mechanical movements
*   **Grinding Gears:** Industrial sounds and violence
*   **Crushing Danger:** Being caught between moving sections
*   **Disorientation:** Gravity and distance becoming unreliable
*   **Prompt Example:** "Wide shot showing multiple cube rooms rotating on massive mechanical armatures. The scale is enormous—hundreds of cubes moving on tracks and gears. Industrial mechanism grinding. Characters visible in one cube, clinging to walls as their room rotates. Metallic screeching. The Cube revealed as massive industrial complex."

**10. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Clinical Fluorescent:** Overhead panels creating even, harsh light
*   **Color Tints:** Blue, red, green, yellow sections
*   **Deep Shadows:** In hatches and between rooms
*   **Trap Flash:** Sudden bright light from flame or arc when traps activate
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by cold fluorescent panels creating even, shadowless illumination in the cube room. Blue tint to the white light creating unsettling atmosphere. When characters move to hatch, deep shadows visible in the tunnel beyond. The lighting is institutional, impersonal, adding to the sense of being in a massive indifferent machine."

## Voice

A terse, mathematical narration style like someone documenting survival in clinical terms to maintain sanity. The pacing is methodical—careful, measured, because mistakes mean death. The tone shifts between analytical problem-solving and barely-suppressed panic. Numbers and calculations are delivered with precision. As the campaign progresses, the voice becomes more fractured, paranoid, desperate. Role: The voice of someone trying to think their way out of a trap that has no thought behind it, realizing the horror isn't the trap but the meaninglessness.
