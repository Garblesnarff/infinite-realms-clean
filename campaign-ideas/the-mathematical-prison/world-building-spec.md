### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Mathematical Prison**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Party awakens trapped in a massive structure of identical cube rooms, some containing mathematical death traps. Using diverse skills and pattern recognition, they must navigate thousands of rooms to find the exit while resources deplete and paranoia builds. The Cube has no purpose, no designer with intent—just bureaucratic accident creating perfect existential horror.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Cube's construction as abandoned government project built by isolated teams.
    *   Write the history of previous victims who left evidence and warnings.
    *   Describe the mathematical patterns governing trap placement and evolution.
    *   Explain the periodic reconfiguration mechanism and movement systems.
    *   Detail Worth's revelation: the Cube was built by specialists who never knew the whole.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Survivors** (Major): Party members with complementary skills, deteriorating trust.
    *   **The Broken** (Minor): Party members who snap mentally, become antagonists.
    *   **Previous Victims** (Minor): Evidence and corpses from those who failed to escape.
    *   **The Builders** (Minor): Government contractors who created the Cube without knowing why.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Leaven (mathematician), Quentin (cop turned violent), Holloway (moral doctor), Worth (nihilist architect), Kazan (savant calculator), Rennes (doomed escape artist).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Fellow Captive" (another victim with useful skill), "The Broken" (mentally snapped survivor turned enemy), "Corpse" (previous victim with clues).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Inner Stable Rooms:** Cube chambers following prime number pattern, stationary.
*   **The Shell:** Outer edge where rooms move on tracks, physics unreliable.
*   **The Bridge:** Central connection point where multiple paths converge.
*   **The Control Room:** Hidden observation area proving someone watched.
*   **The Exit Room:** Final chamber containing the door to freedom.
*   **The Outside:** Empty industrial warehouse where Cube sits abandoned.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Enter room without calculating → **THEN:** Trap activates, instant death or severe injury.
*   **IF:** Resources deplete → **THEN:** Weaker, slower, mistakes more likely, desperation increases.
*   **IF:** Trust collapses → **THEN:** Party members attack each other, sabotage, abandonment.
*   **IF:** Cube reconfigures → **THEN:** Maps invalidated, must recalculate, crushing danger.
*   **IF:** Sacrifice made → **THEN:** Information gained, exit pattern revealed, survivors escape.
*   **IF:** Exit reached → **THEN:** Freedom but no answers, Cube's meaninglessness revealed.
