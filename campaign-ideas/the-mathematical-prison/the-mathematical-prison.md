# The Mathematical Prison

*A Puzzle Survival / Psychological Horror campaign — Medium Campaign (15-20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Mathematical Prison
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Puzzle Survival / Psychological Horror / Existential Trap
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **8-10**
**Tone (keywords):** trapped in cube rooms, mathematical death traps, paranoia, escape puzzle, trust breakdown, prime numbers
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party awakens trapped in interconnected cube-shaped rooms with no memory of how they arrived. Each room is identical—white walls, hatches on all six sides—but some contain horrific death traps triggered by mathematical sequences. They must work together using their diverse skills to identify trap patterns, navigate through thousands of rooms, and find the exit while food, water, and sanity run out. As paranoia builds and secrets emerge about why each was chosen, they must answer: who built the Cube, why are they here, and is escape even possible?

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A claustrophobic descent through mathematical hell toward either escape or madness.

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1-7):** The party awakens in separate cube rooms and finds each other. Initial relief turns to horror as they discover death traps—acid spray, razor wire, flames—activated by unknown triggers. A math student recognizes the pattern: prime numbers mark trap rooms. They begin mapping their location, scavenging for supplies, and slowly navigating outward. Personalities clash under stress, and they discover each has a skill mysteriously relevant to the Cube: mathematics, engineering, medicine, perception. Who chose them and why?
*   **Act II — The Pattern (Sessions 8-13):** As they penetrate deeper, the mathematics becomes more complex. Traps evolve—prime factorizations, Cartesian coordinates, permutations. One party member has a mental breakdown, becoming a danger. They discover evidence of previous victims and realize the Cube is enormous—thousands of rooms. Food and water are nearly gone. Trust fractures as they suspect one might be a plant, designed to sabotage escape. The realization hits: the Cube may have no purpose except to exist.
*   **Act III — The Shell (Sessions 14-20):** They reach the outer shell where rooms move periodically, and physics becomes unreliable. Final math puzzles require perfect calculation—mistakes are instant death. Paranoia peaks as party members turn on each other. Those who've abandoned morality clash with those still clinging to humanity. The final sequence requires sacrifice—someone must trigger a trap to reveal the pattern. The exit appears, but freedom comes with the horrible realization: they were never special, the Cube was never meant for them, and they only escaped because they were lucky.

    *   Party members awaken alone in identical white cube rooms
    *   No memory of how they arrived, wearing simple clothes
    *   Each cube has six hatches (floor, ceiling, four walls) leading to more cubes
    *   They call out, find each other, experience relief at not being alone
**Escalation:** First death trap discovered—person enters room, razor wire shreds them instantly

*   **Key Events:**
    *   They reach outer shell where rooms behave differently
    *   Gravity shifts, distances are wrong, time feels distorted
    *   The final mathematical sequences are brutally complex
    *   One mistake in calculation results in teammate's death
    *   They discover a control room or observation post—the Cube IS watched
**Escalation:** Must solve sequence under time pressure as section of Cube is about to reconfigure

### Sessions 17-19 — "Sacrifice and Madness"
*   **Focus:** Moral Collapse / The Final Sequence
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Final puzzle requires information only obtainable by entering a trap room
    *   Someone must sacrifice themselves to give others the pattern
    *   Party fractures—some refuse sacrifice, others volunteer, some try to force it
    *   Paranoia complete: accusations of being plants, saboteurs, or cowards
    *   The truth emerges: no one planned their selection—bureaucratic accident
**Escalation:** The exit sequence is revealed but requires perfect execution

### Session 20 — "The Exit"
*   **Focus:** Escape / The Meaning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Final room sequence executed—those alive navigating last steps
    *   The exit appears: a simple door leading outside
    *   They emerge into an industrial facility, empty and abandoned
    *   Realization: the Cube was a government project abandoned mid-construction
    *   They were never meant to be inside—wrong place, wrong time
    *   No grand conspiracy, no purpose, just bureaucratic chaos
**Resolution:** Survivors stand in empty warehouse, freedom tainted by horror and knowledge. The Cube exists behind them, still running, waiting for more random victims. They're free, but changed forever. Final question: was the Cube pointless, or was surviving it the point?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of meaningless suffering, paranoia under pressure, the breakdown of civilization when survival is at stake, and whether purpose is necessary for horror. It asks: How do you maintain humanity when stripped of everything? Can random chance be worse than conspiracy? Is survival worth sacrificing morality? The central conflict pits the party's need to escape against the Cube's mathematical indifference, with the deeper conflict being their own paranoia and moral decay fighting their better natures.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Room Navigation System**
*   Each cube has 6-digit coordinates marking its position
*   Hatches lead to adjacent rooms in all directions
*   Must track position carefully to avoid circular navigation
*   Room positions change periodically, invalidating maps
*   Getting lost can be fatal

### 2. **Trap Identification**
*   Rooms marked with number sequences
*   Initially: prime numbers indicate traps
*   Later: prime factorizations, coordinates, permutations
*   Must calculate before entering
*   Math errors result in trap activation and death

### 3. **Resource Depletion**
*   No food or water in the Cube
*   Track hunger, thirst, exhaustion
*   Performance degrades as resources deplete
*   Desperation leads to irrational decisions
*   Eventually, weakness makes trap navigation impossible

### 4. **Paranoia & Trust**
*   Track party trust levels
*   Stress events lower trust
*   Low trust causes betrayal attempts
*   Some members may be "plants" with hidden memories
*   Must balance cooperation with self-preservation

### 5. **Skill Dependency**
*   Each PC has unique skill essential for escape
*   Mathematician: solves trap patterns
*   Engineer: understands mechanisms
*   Doctor: treats injuries
*   Sensor: detects trap warnings
*   Losing members reduces survival chances drastically

### 6. **The Cube Reconfigures**
*   Periodically, rooms rotate and move
*   Creates loud mechanical grinding
*   Can crush anything between moving rooms
*   Invalidates navigation maps
*   Creates time pressure to reach stable sections

### 7. **Sanity Mechanics**
*   Prolonged exposure causes mental breaks
*   Claustrophobia, paranoia, violent outbursts
*   Some players may become antagonists
*   Can attack party, sabotage escape, or shut down mentally
*   Must manage both physical and mental survival
