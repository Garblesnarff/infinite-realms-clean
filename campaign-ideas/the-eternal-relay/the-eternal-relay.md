## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act journey of reunion, rivalry, and perfecting the relay.

*   **Act I — Reunion and Rebuilding (Sessions 1-7):** The protagonist reunites childhood friends who have drifted apart since their elementary relay victory. They reform their swimming team at Iwatobi High, each dealing with personal issues—one quit competitive swimming, another transferred schools, another hides their passion. Through local meets and rekindling old bonds, they remember why they loved swimming together. Their first major meet tests if friendship alone is enough.
*   **Act II — The Rival Appears (Sessions 8-13):** Rin, their childhood friend, returns from Australia as a fierce rival seeking to prove himself superior. He swims for Samezuka Academy with a team built for victory, not friendship. The party faces internal conflict—should they swim to beat Rin or swim for their own reasons? Regional championships force them to confront what swimming means to each of them and whether friendship can survive rivalry.
*   **Act III — The Relay That Binds (Sessions 14-20):** At Nationals, all teams converge for the ultimate competition. The party realizes that swimming for each other makes them faster than swimming alone. The climactic relay race requires perfect synchronization, trust, and each member swimming their personal best. Whether they win or lose, they've discovered that the relay continues beyond any single race—their bonds are eternal.
