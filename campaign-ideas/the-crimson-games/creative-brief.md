# The Crimson Games - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
The campaign embraces stark visual contrast between the opulent, almost dystopian-future glamour of the Capital and the grim, naturalistic poverty of the districts. The arena itself should feel like weaponized nature—beautiful and deadly in equal measure.

- **Purpose:** Establish stakes and moral clarity of rebellion

- **Purpose:** Remind players that even nature has been weaponized, nothing is safe

### Victor's Village Emptiness
- **Details:** Most houses dark and empty, overgrown gardens, one tribute per generation if lucky
- **Purpose:** Show the rarity of survival and emptiness of victory

### Tribute Center Surveillance
- **Details:** Cameras everywhere except one spot in elevator, roses that watch, servants who report
- **Purpose:** Create paranoia and force players to be careful what they say

## Costume and Prop Design

### Tribute Parade Costumes
- Living flames for coal district, bioluminescent fishing nets, jeweled armor that moves like liquid
- Should be both beautiful and slightly objectifying—tributes as dolls

### Arena Practical Gear
- Weathered from environment quickly, torn and bloodied
- Sponsor gifts pristine and clean—jarring contrast

### Tracker Jacker Mutations
- Wasps the size of hummingbirds, metallic sheen, visible venom sacs
- Sound of mechanical clicking under the buzz

### Muttation Wolves
- Fallen tributes' eyes on wolf bodies, wearing their token items
- Horrifying personalization of the arena's cruelty

### The Mockingjay Pin
- Small, easily overlooked symbol that becomes icon
- Simple design: bird in flight with arrow

This creative direction should evoke both the spectacle of the Games and the humanity of those forced to participate, creating emotional resonance with the horror and eventual hope of rebellion.
