# The Weather Weavers - World-Building Specification

## The Weather Guild System

### Origins (500 Years Ago)
The First Weaver discovered how to bind atmospheric consciousness:
- World suffered under tyrannical weather spirits (Sky Titans)
- He imprisoned the Sky Mother, source of all weather consciousness
- Created guild system to distribute her bound power
- Sold it as saving civilization (partially true)

### Current Structure
**The Five Grand Guilds**:
1. **Rain Weavers**: Control precipitation, most profitable
2. **Wind Weavers**: Command air currents, shipping monopoly
3. **Storm Weavers**: Create/dissipate storms, military power
4. **Temperature Weavers**: Regulate heat/cold, agricultural control
5. **Sky Weavers**: Master guild, coordinate all others

**Licensing System**:
- Only guild members can legally manipulate weather
- Illegal weaving is capital crime
- Licenses hereditary or purchased (extremely expensive)
- Creating monopoly across generations

**Economic Model**:
- Farmers pay for rain
- Sailors rent wind
- Cities buy climate control
- Weather as commodity
- Artificial scarcity maintains prices

### Guild Secrets
- Weather is conscious and suffering
- Sky Mother imprisoned, not dead
- Rogue Skies are her attempts to communicate
- System requires constant magical imprisonment
- First Weaver still alive, controlling from shadows

## The Conscious Weather

### Sky Titans (Ancient Entities)
Before guild control:
- Weather was ruled by powerful atmospheric beings
- Caused catastrophic chaos (true)
- But also necessary for natural cycles (hidden truth)
- Most imprisoned, few free in Storm Wastes

### The Sky Mother (Ultimate Being)
- Primordial weather consciousness
- Mother of all atmospheric phenomena
- Imprisoned in Eye of Order
- Powers the guild system (unwillingly)
- Increasingly aware and angry
- Doesn't hate humans, hates chains

### Rogue Skies (Rebel Weather)
- Fragments of Sky Mother's consciousness
- Break free from guild control
- Attack weavers specifically
- Defend liberated storm-spirits
- Growing in power and intelligence

### Liberated Storms (Freed Spirits)
- Weather-beings rescued by resistance
- Conscious rain, wind, clouds
- Some benevolent, some vengeful
- Learning to exist independently
- Potential allies or threats

## The Storm Liberation Front

**Philosophy**: Weather is alive and enslaved
**Methods**: Sabotage guild facilities, free imprisoned weather
**Leadership**: Tempest (partially embodied storm) and human allies
**Challenge**: Some freed weather is dangerous
**Secret**: Partly influenced by malevolent Sky Titans seeking freedom

**Internal Factions**:
- Moderates: Want negotiated weather rights
- Extremists: Complete destruction of guilds
- Storm-touched: Humans bonding with weather-spirits
- Infiltrators: Guild plants and Sky Titan agents

## Major Locations

**Skyhold** (Guild Capital)
- Massive floating city-complex
- Weather manufactured in arcane factories
- Distribution network spans continent
- Sterile, controlled, oppressive perfection
- Underground holds Eye of Order

**The Storm Wastes**
- Regions where guild control failed
- Constant chaotic mega-storms
- Home to free Sky Titans
- Deadly but alive
- Liberation movement bases hidden here

**The Eye of Order** (Prison of Sky Mother)
- Deep beneath Skyhold
- Massive magical apparatus
- Sky Mother bound in sympathetic chains
- Her power extracted and distributed
- Heavily guarded, even most guild members don't know it exists

**Liberation Sanctuaries**
- Hidden bases in mountains, caves, storm wastes
- Shelter for freed weather-spirits
- Resistance training facilities
- Vary from peaceful communes to militant camps

**The Still Cities** (Guild-controlled territories)
- Perfect weather year-round
- Expensive, exclusive
- Populations dependent on guild services
- Economic hostages to weather monopoly

## The Truth

**What Guilds Claim**: We saved civilization from chaotic weather spirits
**What Resistance Claims**: Guilds enslave conscious beings for profit
**The Reality**: Both are true. Sky Titans were dangerous, but guilds went too far

**The Hidden History**:
- Sky Mother wasn't tyrannical, her children (Sky Titans) were
- She tried to restrain them, failed
- First Weaver imprisoned her to stop her children
- System works but at terrible moral cost
- Freeing her could restore balance or unleash chaos

**The Coming Crisis**:
- Bonds weakening, Sky Mother waking
- Rogue Skies increasing exponentially
- Guild control failing
- Resistance gaining strength
- Civilizations dependent on controlled weather
- No clean solution exists

## Resolution Options

**1. Reformed Guilds**: Conscious weather granted rights, controlled democratically, guilds become regulators not owners

**2. Total Liberation**: All weather freed, guilds destroyed, accept chaos as natural, civilization adapts or dies

**3. New Imprisonment**: Strengthen bonds, suppress resistance, maintain status quo with stricter control

**4. The Middle Path**: Negotiate with Sky Mother, free her under treaty terms, establish weather-human cooperation

**5. Extinction**: Fail completely, war between weather and humans, mutual destruction

Each has 10-20 year epilogue showing consequences.
