# Creative Brief: Ghost Who Walks

## Art Style: Comic Strip Adventure (Classic Pulp Comics)

Inspired by Lee Falk's original Phantom comic strips—bold colors, dynamic action, exotic jungle settings, clear moral lines, iconic costume design.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Vibrant jungle greens contrasting with the iconic purple bodysuit. Skull Cave in deep blacks and mysterious purples with treasure gleaming gold. Coastal scenes in tropical blues. Pirate ships in weathered browns. Blood red for Singh Brotherhood marks. Clean, bold color choices typical of classic comics.

**Character Design:** The Phantom in purple bodysuit with skull emblem, eye mask, twin holstered .45s, skull ring prominent. Muscular but not grotesquely so. Devil the wolf is fierce and loyal. Diana is beautiful and capable in period-appropriate adventure wear. Guran and Bandar in respectfully-rendered traditional garb. Pirates theatrical with scars and tattoos.

**Environments:** Dense jungle canopy with mysterious shadows. The Skull Cave—vast cavern with treasure chambers, throne room, chronicles library. Pirate coves with hidden ships. Bangalla palace combining traditional and colonial architecture. Village scenes showing genuine community life.

**Action:** Swinging on vines, gunfights with pirates, wrestling wild beasts, skull ring punching villains, wolf attacks, narrow escapes, palace intrigue, treasure discovery, tribal ceremonies.

## Voice

Confident and unwavering with mythic quality. The voice of legend—someone who speaks knowing 400 years of ancestors support their words. When making declarations, there's absolute conviction. Describes jungle with familiarity and love. Speaks of justice as absolute and attainable. The oath "I swear by the skull of my father" carries weight of centuries. Gentle with innocents, implacable against evil. The voice makes you believe one person can make a difference.

## Music Style

Orchestral adventure with mysterious, almost supernatural overtones suggesting immortality legend. Jungle percussion provides primal rhythm. The Phantom's theme is strong and heroic but has ancient, timeless quality—this is not new hero but continuation of legacy. Skull Cave scenes feature echoing, cavernous acoustics with treasure glints suggested in chimes. Action sequences are bold and straightforward. Diana's theme adds romance and modernity. Singh Brotherhood music is exotic and threatening. Indigenous music is respectfully authentic with spiritual undertones. The score balances pulp adventure with genuine respect for traditions portrayed.
