# Creative Brief: The Trophy Hunter

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Tactical Horror in Nature (Predator meets Dark Fantasy)

Inspired by survival horror and military action films set in hostile natural environments, this aesthetic combines the oppressive beauty of dense jungle with the terror of being hunted by something superior. It's about the contrast between natural beauty and unnatural horror.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Oppressive Nature:** The jungle should feel beautiful but hostile, limiting visibility and creating paranoia.
*   **The Unseen Threat:** Emphasize negative space, shadows, and the sense of being watched.
*   **Primal Horror:** Show the visceral reality of being prey to an apex predator.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Hunted, paranoid, primal, horrifying, tactical-horror, predator-and-prey, survival, oppressive-nature.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of eyes you can't see. The knowledge that you're being stalked by something faster, stronger, and smarter. The jungle's beauty turning hostile.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Natural, organic forms for the jungle contrasted with the angular, alien technology of the Predator. Heavy use of obscuring elements.
*   **Textures:** Dense foliage, dripping water, humid air made visible, rough bark, splattered blood, alien metal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dark fantasy painting of dense jungle foliage creating layers of obscured sight lines. Vines and leaves fill the frame. In the background, barely visible, an angular alien silhouette watches."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Deep, saturated greens and browns of jungle, contrasted with the harsh red of blood and the cold blue-green of alien technology.
*   **Accent Colors:** Red blood, the green glow of alien targeting systems, the orange-red of thermal vision, yellow-green of bioluminescence.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Dappled sunlight filtered through canopy, creating confusion of light and shadow. Night scenes dominated by darkness with minimal light sources.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...illuminated by harsh dappled sunlight filtering through triple-canopy jungle. Deep greens and browns dominate. Fresh blood provides a shocking red contrast. In the shadows, an unnatural blue-green glow suggests watching technology."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Elite soldiers showing progressive damage and adaptation—torn uniforms, mud camouflage, makeshift armor from natural materials.
*   **The Predator:** Massive, biomechanical armor covered in trophies, alien aesthetic combining organic and technological elements. When visible, show its hunting regalia.
*   **Expression:** Exhaustion mixed with hyperalertness, the thousand-yard stare of hunted soldiers, primal fear controlled by training.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elite soldier covered in mud as thermal camouflage, uniform torn and stained with blood and vegetation. They grip a weapon with white-knuckled intensity, eyes scanning the canopy. The jungle clings to them, but they've learned to use it."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Dense, layered jungle with multiple planes of foliage creating visibility problems. Every frame should feel claustrophobic despite being outdoors.
*   **Atmosphere:** Oppressive heat and humidity made visible, the sense of being watched from multiple angles, beauty that's turned hostile.
*   **Details:** Massive trees, hanging vines, exotic flowers, disturbed foliage marking passage, blood trails, skinned bodies hung as warnings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A triple-canopy jungle where sunlight barely reaches the floor. Massive tree trunks create natural columns. Vines hang like curtains. Every shadow could hide death. The beauty of exotic orchids contrasts with a blood trail leading into darkness."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast between harsh dappled sunlight and deep jungle shadows. Use of lens flare and bloom for hot jungle sun. Night scenes nearly pitch black with limited light sources.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, obscuring, creating paranoia. Movement in shadows should be ambiguous—wind or hunter?
*   **Purpose:** Create visual confusion, make viewers search the frame for threats, emphasize the inability to see the enemy clearly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh tropical sun creating extreme dappled light and shadow patterns through the canopy. Lens flare from intense heat. Most of the frame is in deep shadow where movement is barely perceptible—something large shifts in the darkness."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use of negative space to suggest unseen threats. Foreground elements obscuring clear views. The sense of being watched from outside the frame.
*   **Techniques:** Camera positioned as if from the Predator's POV looking down at prey, obscured sight lines, thermal vision color grading for specific scenes, suggestion rather than revelation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition where the party is in the center, backs together, weapons raised. The frame is dominated by enclosing jungle—75% of the image is vegetation creating layers of obscured sight lines. In three different locations, barely visible, alien technology glints. The viewer's eye is drawn to search for the threat."

## Voice

A harsh whisper barely audible over jungle ambience—male or female, breathing controlled to stay quiet. Military precision in speech patterns, clipped words to minimize sound. Pacing is slow, with long pauses listening to the jungle. Emotion is controlled terror—absolute fear kept in check by training and discipline. Audio quality includes oppressive jungle ambience: insects, distant animal calls, dripping water, vegetation rustling, the occasional inhuman clicking sound. Role: A soldier on watch, reporting in whispers, knowing something is out there listening.
