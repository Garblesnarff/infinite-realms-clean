# Districts of Panem

*A Death Game Survival / Political Rebellion campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Districts of Panem
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Death Game Survival / Political Rebellion / Arena Combat
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** brutal, televised, oppressive, survival, rebellion, propaganda, class warfare, sacrifice
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of tributes from different districts, forced to compete in the annual Reaping Games—a brutal arena death match broadcast across the realm for the Capitol's entertainment. Each tribute brings unique survival skills from their district's specialty (mining, agriculture, fishing, etc.). As they navigate deadly traps, engineered monsters, and political sponsorship, they must decide whether to play by the Capitol's rules or become symbols of rebellion that could ignite a revolution across the oppressed districts.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The arena is designed to kill—environmental hazards, manufactured creatures, and forced combat with other tributes create constant mortal danger.
*   **Investigation:** Players must decipher the Gamemakers' patterns, identify safe zones, secure sponsor gifts, and read political undercurrents.
*   **Consequences:** Every death has weight. Survival requires sacrifice. Playing to the cameras affects both survival chances and the growing rebellion outside the arena.

---

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from desperate tributes to symbols of revolution.

*   **Act I — The Reaping (Sessions 1–4):** The party is selected as tributes from their districts, travels to the Capitol, undergoes training and evaluation, and courts sponsors through interviews and displays of skill. They form uneasy alliances before entering the arena.
*   **Act II — The Arena (Sessions 5–9):** The death games begin. The party navigates a massive wilderness arena filled with deadly zones (acid fog, mutant tracker jackers, fire storms). They must decide who to trust, who to kill, and how much to perform for the cameras.
*   **Act III — The Rules Change (Sessions 10–12):** The Gamemakers announce that tributes from the same district can win together, forcing new alliances and betrayals. The party discovers they're being used as propaganda tools—their actions are inspiring rebellion in the districts.
*   **Act IV — The Spark (Sessions 13–15):** The Capitol tries to reassert control by changing the rules again, demanding only one victor. The party's defiance—threatening mutual suicide rather than killing each other—breaks the Games and ignites open revolution. They escape the arena and must choose their role in the coming war.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Reaping Day"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / Oppression
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: It's Reaping Day. Each district gathers as names are drawn from the glass bowls. The party members are selected—some volunteer to save younger siblings, others are chosen by cruel luck.
    *   The Districts: Each party member represents a different district—District 12 (mining/survival), District 4 (fishing/tridents), District 7 (lumber/axes), etc. Their skills reflect their origins.
    *   The Journey: Tributes board luxury trains to the Capitol, their first exposure to wealth and excess while guarded by Peacekeepers.

**Escalation:** The party arrives at the Capitol and sees its grotesque opulence contrasted with their districts' poverty.

### Session 2 — "Training Grounds"

*   **Focus:** Skill Evaluation / Alliance Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Remake: Stylists transform tributes into spectacles with elaborate costumes and makeovers for the opening parade.
    *   Training Center: The party has three days to train—survival skills, combat, camouflage, trap-making. They must decide whether to reveal their strengths or hide them.
    *   The Careers: Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4—trained killers who volunteer for the Games—form a deadly pack and try to recruit the strongest party members.

**Escalation:** The private evaluation session with Gamemakers determines each tribute's score (1-12), affecting sponsor interest.

### Session 3 — "The Interviews"

*   **Focus:** Performance / Propaganda
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Media Training: Stylists and mentors coach tributes on their "angle"—the likable underdog, the ruthless killer, the tragic lover, the innocent child.
    *   The Interview: Each tribute has three minutes on live broadcast to win sponsors. Charisma, deception, and performance matter more than combat skill.
    *   The Strategy: Mentors (previous victors from their districts) provide advice, insider knowledge, and sponsor connections—if the tributes can earn their trust.

**Escalation:** Scores and interviews determine the betting odds. High odds mean more sponsors, but also paint targets on tributes' backs.

### Session 4 — "Into the Arena"

*   **Focus:** Initial Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Launch: Tributes rise on platforms into the arena—a massive wilderness dome with varied biomes. The Cornucopia (a supply-filled structure) sits at the center.
    *   The Bloodbath: Tributes have 60 seconds before they can move. Those who rush the Cornucopia find weapons and supplies but face brutal combat. Those who flee have nothing but their wits.
    *   First Night: The party must find water, shelter, and allies. The sky displays the faces of the dead—often a dozen killed on the first day.

**Escalation:** The arena is vast but finite. The Gamemakers can create hazards to drive tributes together if the action slows.

### Session 5 — "The Forest of Vipers"

*   **Focus:** Environmental Hazards
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Engineered Threats: The party encounters tracker jackers (mutant wasps causing hallucinations and death), poisonous berries, and contaminated water sources.
    *   The Career Pack: The professional killers hunt weaker tributes, using superior equipment from the Cornucopia. The party must hide, flee, or confront them.
    *   Sponsor Gifts: Parachutes descend with supplies—medicine, food, weapons—for tributes who please the audience. Performance matters as much as skill.

**Escalation:** A tracker jacker nest is weaponized, leading to deaths and hallucinations that reveal character secrets.

### Session 6 — "Alliances and Betrayals"

*   **Focus:** Social Strategy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Temporary Truces: Tributes from different districts form alliances for mutual protection, but everyone knows only one can win.
    *   Betrayal Mechanics: The party must decide when alliances are genuine and when they're traps. Trust is a luxury in a death game.
    *   The Fallen: Each night, cannons fire for every death, and faces appear in the sky. The number of remaining tributes dwindles.

**Escalation:** A sponsor gift arrives for the party—but it's shared among them, forcing decisions about distribution and trust.

### Session 7 — "The Gamemakers' Wrath"

*   **Focus:** Manufactured Drama
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Forced Encounters: When tributes hide too well or action slows, Gamemakers create hazards—fire walls, acid fog, carnivorous mutations—to drive them into confrontations.
    *   The Mutts: Genetically engineered monsters (wolf-like beasts with disturbingly human eyes) hunt specific tributes to create dramatic television.
    *   Moral Choices: The party must decide whether to save a wounded tribute (risking themselves) or let them die (maintaining their odds).

**Escalation:** A massive fire storm drives tributes toward the Cornucopia, forcing a climactic confrontation.

### Session 8 — "The Feast"

*   **Focus:** High-Stakes Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Announcement: Gamemakers announce a "feast" at the Cornucopia—backpacks containing what each tribute desperately needs (medicine, weapons, food).
    *   The Trap: The feast is designed to force combat. Tributes must weigh their need against the danger of open conflict.
    *   Casualties: The feast claims multiple lives. The party must use strategy, deception, and timing to survive.

**Escalation:** Only six tributes remain. The endgame approaches, and the Capitol expects blood.

### Session 9 — "The Final Eight"

*   **Focus:** Climactic Battles
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hunting and Hunted: With few tributes left, the arena shrinks (Gamemakers create hazards in outer zones, forcing everyone to the center).
    *   The Career Pack Falls: The professional killers turn on each other or fall to traps, evening the odds.
    *   District Bonds: If multiple party members survive, they must confront the reality that only one can win—or can they?

**Escalation:** The Gamemakers make a shocking announcement to extend the drama.

### Session 10 — "The Rule Change"

*   **Focus:** Political Manipulation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Announcement: Gamemakers declare that two tributes from the *same district* can win together—a rule designed to create drama and romance for viewers.
    *   New Alliances: Tributes who previously fought now seek their district partners. The party's dynamics shift entirely.
    *   The Capitol's Game: The party realizes they're not just fighting for survival—they're performing for politics. The Capitol uses their relationships as propaganda.

**Escalation:** The rule change forces the party to trust each other while questioning the Capitol's motives.

### Session 11 — "Star-Crossed Killers"

*   **Focus:** Performance and Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Playing for Cameras: The party must balance genuine survival with theatrical performance. Displays of affection, loyalty, or tragedy win sponsors.
    *   The Final Tributes: Only the party and one or two other tributes remain. The arena becomes a stage for the Capitol's entertainment.
    *   The Mutts Return: Gamemakers release a final wave of horrific creatures—dead tributes' DNA in monstrous form—to force the finale.

**Escalation:** The party survives the final assault, leaving only themselves as potential victors.

### Session 12 — "The Berries"

*   **Focus:** Defiance / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Second Rule Change: Gamemakers revoke the "two victors" rule. Only one tribute can win. The party must kill each other or die together.
    *   The Defiance: Instead of killing each other, the party threatens mutual suicide using poisonous nightlock berries. The Capitol can have no victor or two—their choice.
    *   The Capitol Blinks: Gamemakers panic and declare both victors rather than have no winner. The party has won—but they've also humiliated President Snow.

**Escalation:** The party exits the arena as victors, but they realize they've made themselves targets of the Capitol's wrath.

### Session 13 — "Victory Tour"

*   **Focus:** Political Consequences
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Aftermath: The party undergoes medical treatment and psychological "reconditioning." They're victors now, living in wealth, but traumatized.
    *   The Tour: Victors must travel to every district, giving speeches written by the Capitol to reinforce obedience and spectacle.
    *   The Spark of Rebellion: In District 11, an old man whistles a three-note tune—a signal of defiance. Peacekeepers execute him. The party realizes their victory inspired hope.

**Escalation:** President Snow visits the party privately, threatening their families if they don't quell the growing rebellion.

### Session 14 — "The Quarter Quell"

*   **Focus:** Escalation / New Arena
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Announcement: Every 25 years, the Hunger Games features a special "Quarter Quell" with unique rules. This year: previous victors are reaped again.
    *   Return to the Arena: The party, now experienced killers, must enter a new, even deadlier arena—a clock-themed dome with rotating hazards.
    *   Rebel Alliance: Other victors secretly work for the rebellion. The party must decide who to trust and whether to escape rather than win.

**Escalation:** The party discovers the arena itself can be sabotaged—destroying the Games could spark total revolution.

### Session 15 — "The Mockingjay Rises"

*   **Focus:** Revolution / Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Arena Destroyed: The party and rebel victors destroy the arena's force field, escaping with help from hidden resistance forces.
    *   The Symbol: The party becomes the face of the rebellion—the Mockingjay, a symbol of defiance against the Capitol.
    *   The Choice: The party must decide their role in the coming war. Are they soldiers, symbols, or simply survivors seeking peace?

## Key Locations

1.  **The Capitol:** A city of grotesque excess, where citizens dye their skin, wear bizarre fashions, and treat the Hunger Games as entertainment.

3.  **The Training Center:** A massive facility where tributes learn combat, survival, and performance before the Games.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is survival versus performance—tributes must kill to live, but their actions are entertainment and propaganda. The party's defiance transforms them from pawns into symbols, sparking a revolution that challenges the Capitol's control. It explores themes of class warfare, media manipulation, sacrifice, and whether hope can survive oppression.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sponsor Points**

*   The party earns Sponsor Points through dramatic actions, displays of skill, emotional performances, and interview charisma.
*   **Spending Sponsor Points:** Players can request sponsor gifts (healing potions, weapons, food, environmental tools) that arrive via parachute.
*   **Cost Scaling:** Gifts cost more as the Games progress and fewer tributes remain. Life-saving medicine might cost 10 points early, 30 points in the finale.

### 2. **Audience Favor**

*   The DM tracks the Capitol audience's favor toward each tribute (rated 1-10).
*   **High Favor:** More sponsor gifts, favorable camera angles (warning of approaching threats), Gamemaker leniency.
*   **Low Favor:** Ignored by sponsors, targeted by Gamemakers with hazards, negative propaganda.
*   **Favor Actions:** Romance, sacrifice, defiance, clever tactics, and tragedy all increase Favor differently.

### 3. **Arena Hazards (Gamemaker Control)**

*   The Gamemakers can activate environmental hazards to force encounters or create drama:
    *   **Fire Storms:** Walls of flame drive tributes toward each other.
    *   **Acid Fog:** Slow-moving clouds that burn skin and blind tributes.
    *   **Tracker Jackers:** Mutant wasps causing hallucinations and paralysis.
    *   **Mutations:** Wolf-like creatures with dead tributes' eyes, targeting specific survivors.

### 4. **The Reaping Lottery**

*   At campaign start, each player rolls to determine their district and associated skills:
    *   District 1 (Luxury): Charisma and persuasion bonuses.
    *   District 4 (Fishing): Proficiency with tridents and swimming.
    *   District 7 (Lumber): Proficiency with axes and climbing.
    *   District 12 (Mining): Survival skills and archery (from hunting).

### 5. **The Three-Finger Salute**

*   A gesture of solidarity and defiance. When one tribute uses it, others can respond, creating a network of rebellion.
*   **Mechanical Effect:** Grants temporary inspiration (advantage on next roll) to allies who share the gesture, but increases Capitol scrutiny.

---

## Themes and Moral Questions

*   **Is survival worth the cost of murder?** The party must kill innocents to live. Can they justify it?
*   **How much of yourself do you perform away?** Tributes must fake emotions, romance, and beliefs for cameras. Where is the line between strategy and losing identity?
*   **Can hope survive oppression?** The Capitol uses spectacle to suppress rebellion. The party's defiance asks whether hope can be a weapon.
*   **What do we owe the innocent?** The party's actions inspire districts to rebel—leading to brutal crackdowns. Are they responsible for those deaths?

---

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Victory Through Defiance:** The party refuses to kill each other, breaks the Games, and becomes symbols of rebellion.
*   **Hollow Victory:** The party plays by the Capitol's rules, wins, but loses their humanity and becomes propaganda tools.
*   **Martyrdom:** The party dies in the arena but inspires revolution through their final acts.
*   **Revolution:** The party escapes and actively leads the districts in overthrowing the Capitol.
