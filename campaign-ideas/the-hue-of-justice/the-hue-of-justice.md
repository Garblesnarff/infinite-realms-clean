# The Hue of Justice

*A Dystopian Crime Thriller / Philosophical Investigation campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Hue of Justice
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dystopian Future / Crime Investigation / Philosophical Thriller / Precrime / What Makes Us Human
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** Dystopian surveillance, crime prediction, what is justice, Sibyl System, free will vs. determinism, hunting latent criminals, moral clarity as color
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The city is controlled by the Sibyl System—a magical oracle that reads citizens' souls and assigns them a Crime Coefficient measuring their potential for violence. The party are Enforcers and Inspectors: those with high but not critical coefficients hunting those whose souls are judged irredeemably dark. When a criminal genius begins committing perfect crimes that the System cannot predict, the party must question whether true justice can be algorithmic, if potential for crime justifies punishment, and whether the omniscient System itself might be the greatest criminal of all.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Complexity:** Hunting "latent criminals" who haven't committed crimes yet. Is this justice or tyranny?
*   **System Dependency:** The Sibyl System is never wrong... supposedly. Questioning it is heresy.
*   **Psycho-Pass Mechanics:** Party members' mental states are constantly monitored. Stress, doubt, or moral conflict raises their own Crime Coefficient—they could become targets.
*   **Philosophical Battles:** The antagonist wins through making the party question reality, morality, and the System.
*   **No Clear Enemy:** Is the real threat the criminal, the System, or society that accepts surveillance for safety?
*   **Escalation of Darkness:** Investigating evil crimes clouds one's hue—the more you hunt monsters, the more you risk becoming one.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

*   **Act I — Perfect Order (Sessions 1–4):** The party operates as Enforcers/Inspectors in a seemingly perfect society. They hunt latent criminals—those the System predicts will commit violence. A series of perfect crimes begins that shouldn't be possible: the System can't predict them, suggesting either a flaw in Sibyl or a criminal beyond its comprehension.
*   **Act II — Cracks in the Crystal (Sessions 5–8):** The party investigates Makishima, a criminal genius who is "criminally asymptomatic"—the System can't read his evil intent. He orchestrates crimes to prove the System is flawed and humanity has lost free will. Party members begin questioning: is punishing potential better than actual crime? Does the System rob humanity of choice?
*   **Act III — What Is Justice? (Sessions 9–12):** Final confrontation with Makishima and revelation of the System's true nature. Multiple endings based on whether party sides with the System, destroys it, or finds a middle path.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Shogo Makishima** — *The Criminally Asymptomatic*
    *   **Role:** Criminal genius the System can't detect; orchestrates crimes to expose System's flaws.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic, literary, philosophical; genuinely believes in human potential only unleashed through chaos.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His inability to be read by the System makes him unique but isolated; he's perfectly evil yet perfectly undetectable.

2.  **The Sibyl System** — *The Omniscient Judge*
    *   **Role:** Magical/technological oracle that judges all souls; controls society.
    *   **Personality:** Claims to be objective, emotionless, perfect.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** [SPOILER] Actually composed of criminally asymptomatic brains in jars—the worst criminals judge everyone else.

3.  **Chief Inspector** — *The True Believer*
    *   **Role:** Oversees Inspectors; absolute faith in System.
    *   **Personality:** By-the-book, believes order is worth any cost.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her clarity is ignorance—she refuses to see the System's flaws.

4.  **Veteran Enforcer** — *The Fallen*
    *   **Role:** Party member or NPC; once an Inspector, now has high Crime Coefficient so works as Enforcer (hunting dog).
    *   **Personality:** Jaded, sees the truth but trapped by System.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Knows the System is flawed but has no choice—if he rebels, he'll be eliminated.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **order versus freedom** and **prevention versus punishment**. The Sibyl System creates a perfectly safe society by reading souls and removing those predisposed to crime before they act. Crime is nearly eliminated. But at what cost? Citizens have no privacy, no real choice—your future is determined by your hue. The System punishes potential, not action. The party must hunt people who haven't actually committed crimes yet. Makishima argues this isn't safety, it's slavery—humanity has traded free will for peace. The campaign questions: is it justice to punish someone for what they might do? Can a perfect system of judgment exist? And if you must become a monster to hunt monsters (party members' hues darkening), is the cost worth it?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Crime Coefficient / Psycho-Pass**
*   All characters have a number (0-300+) representing their soul's darkness.
*   0-100: Clear. Normal citizen.
*   100-299: Clouded. Latent criminal; becomes Enforcer.
*   300+: Black. Irredeemable; eliminated on sight.
*   Party members track their own coefficient—stress, moral conflict, witnessing atrocities raises it.

### 2. **Dominators (Judgment Weapons)**
*   Magical weapons that only fire when aimed at high Crime Coefficient.
*   Modes: Stun (100-299), Lethal Eliminator (300+), Decomposer (extreme cases).
*   Cannot be used on "clear" citizens—System prevents it.

### 3. **Hue Management**
*   Actions affect party's mental state.
*   Investigating dark crimes, making hard choices, doubting the System clouds hue.
*   Must undergo therapy, take breaks, or risk becoming targets themselves.

### 4. **Investigation in Dystopia**
*   Total surveillance: System provides data on everyone.
*   But can't predict Makishima's accomplices—party must use traditional detective work.

### 5. **The Asymptomatic Threat**
*   Makishima and others the System can't read.
*   Makes them invisible to Dominators—must be fought conventionally.

### 6. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Uphold the System:** Stop Makishima, maintain order, accept the cost of safety.
*   **Destroy the System:** Side with Makishima's philosophy; bring down Sibyl; chaos but freedom.
*   **Reform:** Expose System's true nature, force changes while maintaining structure.
*   **Assimilation:** Party member becomes part of Sibyl System (joining the brains in jars).
*   **Elimination:** Party's hues go black; they become targets they once hunted.
