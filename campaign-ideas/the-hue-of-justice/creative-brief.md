# Creative Brief: The Hue of Justice

## Art Style: Sleek Dystopian Future

Clean, high-tech urban environments with oppressive perfection. Smooth surfaces hide dark underbelly. Visual representation of soul's "color" as overlay or aura.

### Core Principles:

*   **Futuristic Cleanliness:** Glass, steel, holographic displays, everyone in uniform.
*   **Color as Morality:** Clear hues (blues, whites) for innocence; clouded/murky for latent criminals; black/red for irredeemable.
*   **Surveillance Aesthetic:** Cameras, scanners, holographic interfaces everywhere.
*   **Contrast:** Sterile future versus visceral crime scenes.

**Visual Elements:** Dominator weapon glowing and transforming. Holographic Crime Coefficient displays. Sterile city streets. Characters with visible "hue" auras. The Sibyl System's core chamber.

**Color Palette:** Clean whites and cool blues for order. Murky grays and browns for clouded hues. Deep blacks and blood reds for criminal darkness. Neon accents for technology.

## Voice

Calm, clinical, gradually becoming disturbed. Like an AI analyzing chaos. Environmental sounds: holographic interfaces beeping, Dominator charging, surveillance drones, the sterile silence of perfect order, then sudden violence breaking the peace.
