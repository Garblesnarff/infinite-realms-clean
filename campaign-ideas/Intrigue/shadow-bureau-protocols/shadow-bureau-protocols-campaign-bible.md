Shadow Bureau Protocols [TAG: CAMPAIGN]

Logline [TAG: LOGLINE]
Agents of a clandestine government agency must hunt down and neutralize supernatural threats, using esoteric protocols and reality-bending technology while battling the existential dread and bureaucratic red tape of their own organization.

Premise [TAG: PREMISE]
The world is not as it seems. Rifts to other dimensions, anomalous artifacts, and paranormal entities constantly threaten the fabric of reality. The Shadow Bureau is the top-secret organization tasked with containing these threats and erasing them from public knowledge. The players are field agents, armed with a blend of advanced science and occult rituals, who are dispatched to "Control Points"—areas where reality has been compromised. They must investigate, contain, and neutralize paranormal phenomena before they spiral out of control, all while navigating the Bureau's labyrinthine bureaucracy and confronting the sanity-shattering horrors they face daily.

Core Conflict [TAG: CORE_CONFLICT]
The core conflict is the constant struggle between the agents of the Shadow Bureau and the unending tide of supernatural incursions. Each mission pits the players against a new, unknown horror that defies the laws of physics. Complicating this is the internal friction within the Bureau itself. The players must contend with rival departments, budget cuts, morally ambiguous directives from the enigmatic Director, and the psychological toll of their work, which can manifest as dangerous paranormal side-effects.

Setting [TAG: SETTING]
The campaign is set in a modern world that appears perfectly normal on the surface. The primary setting is the Bureau's headquarters, known as "The Foundation," a brutalist architectural anomaly that exists outside of normal space-time. Missions take players to mundane locations—a suburban home, a corporate office building, a national park—that have become twisted and hostile Control Points. The atmosphere is a blend of sterile, bureaucratic horror and surreal, cosmic dread, inspired by the SCP Foundation and the TV series *Control*.

Major Factions [TAG: FACTIONS]
[The Shadow Bureau (Control)] [TAG: FACTION]
A clandestine, government-funded organization dedicated to the containment and study of paranormal phenomena. The Bureau is a sprawling, compartmentalized bureaucracy divided into various departments (Research, Containment, Internal Affairs, etc.). Its official goal is to protect humanity, but its methods are often ruthless and inhumane. The Bureau is led by the unseen Director, and its directives are often cryptic and morally questionable.

[The Hiss] [TAG: FACTION]
A hostile, extra-dimensional resonance that corrupts and possesses living organisms, turning them into aggressive, reality-warping entities. The Hiss is not a traditional organization but a spreading psychic infection with a collective, alien consciousness. It seeks to expand its presence in our reality, and it is the most common and dangerous antagonist the players will face in the field.

[The Collective Unconscious] [TAG: FACTION]
A loose network of civilian psychics, occultists, and conspiracy theorists who are aware of the paranormal world. They are a chaotic and unpredictable faction. Some, like the "Oracles of the Web," seek to expose the Bureau's secrets to the world, believing humanity has a right to know. Others may act as informants or allies, providing the players with unsanctioned knowledge and esoteric support that the Bureau's rigid protocols forbid.

Key NPCs [TAG: NPCS]
[The Director] [TAG: NPC]
The unseen and enigmatic head of the Shadow Bureau. The Director communicates only through classified directives and encrypted messages. No one knows the Director's true identity, or if they are even a single person. They are the ultimate authority, and their cryptic orders can be a source of life-saving guidance or a death sentence. The Director's true agenda is the campaign's greatest mystery.

[Dr. Aris Thorne, Head of Research] [TAG: NPC]
A brilliant but morally compromised scientist who oversees the Bureau's Research and Development department. Dr. Thorne is obsessed with understanding and weaponizing the paranormal phenomena the agents encounter. He views agents as disposable test subjects and is constantly pushing for them to take greater risks to gather data, offering powerful but unstable prototype technologies as incentives.

[Janitor Ahti] [TAG: NPC]
The seemingly ordinary janitor of The Foundation. Ahti speaks in a cryptic, metaphorical language and possesses a disconcerting level of knowledge about the Bureau's deepest secrets and the nature of reality. He appears in unexpected places, offering strange advice and occasionally providing the players with objects of power that defy explanation. It is unclear what he is, but he appears to be a powerful, benevolent, and ancient entity.

Potential Quests [TAG: QUESTS]
[The Mail Room Anomaly] [TAG: QUEST]
A low-level paranormal entity has taken root in the Bureau's own mail room, causing letters to deliver themselves to the past and future, creating a chaotic temporal feedback loop. The players must navigate the bureaucratic nightmare of getting the proper authorization to enter the mail room and contain the entity before its temporal distortions cause a catastrophic paradox within The Foundation itself.

[Altered World Event: The Quarry] [TAG: QUEST]
A limestone quarry in rural Minnesota has become a Control Point. The laws of physics have broken down; gravity shifts unpredictably, and the quarry's excavation equipment has come to life, animated by a malevolent intelligence. The players must venture into this hostile, shifting landscape to find the source of the disturbance—an "Object of Power"—and perform the containment ritual to bring it back to The Foundation.

[The Psychic Intruder] [TAG: QUEST]
A powerful psychic from the Collective Unconscious has infiltrated The Foundation's astral plane, the psychic space that connects the minds of all Bureau employees. The intruder is attempting to steal classified information and is causing agents to experience shared, violent nightmares. The players must enter the astral plane themselves, hunt down the psychic intruder in a landscape made of pure thought, and expel them before they can compromise the entire Bureau.

Unique Mechanics/Elements [TAG: MECHANICS]
The campaign uses a "Sanity & Corruption" system. "Sanity" is a mental health track that can be damaged by witnessing paranormal horrors or using certain powerful abilities. Low Sanity can lead to temporary madness or permanent psychological trauma. "Corruption" represents the influence of hostile paranormal forces. Using certain artifacts or being exposed to specific entities can increase Corruption, which may grant powerful but dangerous abilities at the cost of the agent's humanity. High Corruption can lead to the agent becoming a paranormal threat themselves.

Tone and Mood [TAG: TONE]
The tone is one of cosmic horror mixed with the mundane absurdity of office bureaucracy. It's a blend of the existential dread of Lovecraftian horror with the dry, satirical humor of a workplace comedy. The mood is tense, surreal, and often deeply unsettling, creating a unique "New Weird" atmosphere.

Themes [TAG: THEMES]
The campaign explores themes of knowledge at a price, the nature of reality, and the struggle for sanity in a world that makes no sense. It questions the morality of containment and secrecy, asking if protecting humanity is worth sacrificing one's own. A central theme is the conflict between order and chaos, both on a cosmic scale and within the human mind.
