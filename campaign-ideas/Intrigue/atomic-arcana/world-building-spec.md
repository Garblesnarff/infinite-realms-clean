# Atomic Arcana - World-Building Specification

## Berlin November 1989

**Historical Context**: Wall about to fall, Cold War ending, intelligence community scrambling. Everyone positioning for new world order. Old rules breaking down, new ones not established.

**East Berlin**: Stasi surveillance state, informants everywhere, grey conformity hiding individual suffering. Checkpoints, paranoia, decay.

**West Berlin**: Democratic showcase hiding corruption, organized crime, Western intelligence operations. Neon surface over dark underbelly.

**The Wall**: Physical and magical barrier. Crossing is dangerous, symbolic, charged with meaning. Will fall during campaign (November 9, 1989).

## MI6 Berlin Station

**Structure**: Station Chief (Percival, compromised), field officers, intelligence analysts, support staff. Officially embassy attachés.

**Mission**: Monitor East Germany, run agents, gather intelligence, counterintelligence against KGB/Stasi.

**Compromise**: Percival has "gone native"—been in Berlin so long he's lost original loyalty. Playing all sides for survival and profit.

**Culture**: Cynical, burned-out, pragmatic. Clean hands in London, dirty work in field.

## The List

**Contents**: Names of every double agent on both sides. Spyglass (Stasi officer) has memorized it. Multiple parties want it:
- **MI6**: Protect their agents, expose Soviet ones
- **KGB**: Opposite motivation
- **Percival**: Sell to highest bidder, eliminate evidence of his treachery
- **CIA**: Leverage over both sides

**Significance**: Whoever controls list controls intelligence community. Exposures, blackmail, assassinations. World-changing intelligence.

## Key Characters Detail

**Lorraine Broughton**: MI6's best field agent, sent to retrieve list. Combat specialist, survivor, damaged by profession. Unreliable narrator (concealing own agenda). Bisexual, forms real connection with Delphine. Trying to expose Percival while completing mission.

**David Percival**: Has been in Berlin 15+ years. Initially MI6, now serving self. Charming, ruthless, adaptable. Knows every player, every angle. Willing to kill anyone including allies. The villain.

**Delphine Lasalle**: Young French intelligence officer, inexperienced. Represents what spies lose—innocence, genuine emotion, hope. Romance with Lorraine is real. Death is brutal and senseless. Her loss matters.

**Spyglass**: Stasi bureaucrat who memorized the list. Wants asylum for family. Just clerk caught in machinery. Not brave, just desperate. Probably dies despite best efforts. Represents human cost.

## Combat Realism

**No Plot Armor**: Enemies are competent. Fights are exhausting. Multiple opponents is disaster. Retreat is valid tactic.

**Injury System**: Track specific wounds. Broken ribs make breathing painful. Concussion causes confusion. Cuts bleed and need attention. Recovery is slow.

**Improvised Weapons**: Corkscrews, hot pots, furniture, whatever's available. Nothing glamorous, just survival.

**Exhaustion**: Multiple fights accumulate. Performance degrades. Rest is precious, rarely available.

**Death is Real**: NPCs and potentially PCs can die. No resurrection. Stakes are permanent.

## The Truth (Spoilers)

**Unreliable Narrative**: Entire campaign is Lorraine's debrief. She's concealing her true mission from interrogators.

**Real Mission**: Lorraine sent to eliminate Percival and recover list, not just retrieve it. She's playing everyone, even player expectations.

**The Twist**: Every flashback is Lorraine's version. Some events happened differently. Final revelation shows truth.

**Percival's Fate**: Lorraine kills him, stages it as KGB operation. Mission complete, truth buried.

**The List**: Lorraine delivers it or destroys it (player choice), but her real mission was cleaning house.

## Aftermath

**Lorraine**: Survives physically, damaged psychologically. Returns to field because it's all she knows. Can't have normal life.

**Berlin**: Wall falls, city reunites, Cold War ends. Intelligence community adapts. Those who died stay dead.

**Players**: If survived, changed forever. Understand cost of espionage. Decision: continue in field or get out while can.

This supports gritty realistic spy campaign about survival, moral compromise, and brutal cost of intelligence work in dying era of Cold War.
