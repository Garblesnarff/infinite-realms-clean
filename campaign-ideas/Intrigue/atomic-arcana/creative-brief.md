# Atomic Arcana - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Gritty Neon Brutalism

**Berlin 1989 Realism** - Cold, hard, unforgiving. Neon lights reflecting in rain puddles. Concrete and graffiti. Every bruise visible, every wound matters. Charlize Theron's stairwell fight aesthetic.

## Color Palettes
- **East Berlin**: Soviet grey, propaganda red, concrete despair
- **West Berlin**: Neon pinks, club purples, capitalist brightness
- **Violence**: Stark realistic blood, harsh fluorescent lighting
- **The Wall**: Graffiti colors against grey concrete, symbol of division

## Music
**80s New Wave meets Orchestral Tension** - Synth-heavy soundtrack with classical elements. "Der Kommissar," "99 Luftballons," period-appropriate music. Silence during brutal fights (hear every punch, every breath).

**Action Music**: Driving electronic beats, no triumphant horns. Music reflects exhaustion and desperation, not heroism.

## Voice Direction
- **Lorraine**: British accent, professional cool hiding damage, noir narration
- **Percival**: Gone-native accent shift, charming sociopath
- **Delphine**: French genuine warmth, innocence in cynical world
- **Spyglass**: Terrified German bureaucrat, not hero material
- **Interrogator**: Cold professional, extracting truth

## Cinematic Moments
- **The Stairwell Fight**: Extended single-take brutal combat, exhausting, improvisational, survival not victory
- **The Ice Bath**: Interrogation horror, vulnerability, physical trauma
- **Delphine's Death**: Sudden, brutal, no heroic moment
- **The Wall Falls**: Historic moment amid personal chaos
- **The Debrief**: Entire final session as interrogation, unreliable narrator
- **The Truth Revealed**: Flashbacks showing what really happened
- **Every Cigarette**: Moments between violence, humanity checking in

## Combat Philosophy
**Brutal Realism** - No flips, no tricks. Improvised weapons, environmental hazards, exhaustion mechanics. Winning hurts. Losing might be death. Recovery takes sessions. Scars remain.

Describe every impact, every grunt of pain, every desperate struggle for breath. Make players feel the toll.
