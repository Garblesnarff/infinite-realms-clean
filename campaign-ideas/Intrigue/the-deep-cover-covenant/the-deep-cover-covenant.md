# The Deep Cover Covenant
## *"We Have a Job to Do"*

### Campaign Overview

The players are deep-cover operatives from opposing nations, living seemingly normal lives while secretly conducting espionage. One player is a Western spy posing as a merchant; their spouse is an Eastern spy posing as a scholar. Their children don't know. Their neighbors don't know. For years, they've maintained the perfect cover while sending intelligence to their respective handlers. But when both are ordered to manipulate or eliminate each other, they must decide: continue the lie, expose the truth, or forge something real from the fiction.

This is a campaign about double lives, genuine feelings growing from false foundations, and the question of whether anything built on lies can become authentic. Every session balances mundane domesticity with deadly espionage, creating constant tension between the life they've built and the loyalty they owe to nations they rarely see. The Cold War is fought in bedroom conversations and kitchen arguments, where every word carries double meaning.

### Core Themes

- **Dual Identity**: Living two lives simultaneously, which is real?
- **Loyalty vs. Love**: Duty to nation vs. feelings for "spouse"
- **The Children**: Innocent lives built on foundation of lies

- **The Toll of Lies**: Constant deception erodes the self
- **Impossible Choice**: When orders conflict with developed bonds

### Campaign Tone

This is The Americans directly—Cold War espionage through lens of marriage and family. The juxtaposition of mundane domesticity with deadly spy work creates constant dramatic tension. Dinner table conversations and bedroom intimacy carry weight of international stakes.

Balance normal family moments with shocking violence and moral compromise. Let players feel the exhaustion of maintaining dual lives. Make the children real and vulnerable—their safety and innocence matter more than any geopolitical goal. Emphasize the slow realization that performed emotions have become genuine.

Combat is rare and brutal when it happens. Most tension comes from close calls, difficult conversations, and impossible choices. The horror isn't gunfights; it's ordering your spouse to seduce an asset, or explaining to your daughter why you've lied her entire life.

This campaign is for players who want moral complexity, relationship drama, and the slow-burn tension of double lives. It's about identity, loyalty, love, and whether anything real can grow from something fake. Also about fighting for family even when that family was built on lies—because sometimes the lie becomes more true than truth.

Welcome to deep cover. Try to remember who you really are. If you ever knew.
