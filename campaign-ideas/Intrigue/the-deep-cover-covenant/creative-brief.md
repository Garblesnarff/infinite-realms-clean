# The Deep Cover Covenant - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Domestic Cold War Drama

**Suburban Normalcy Hiding Danger** - 1980s American suburbia aesthetic with dark undertones. Warm family moments contrasted with cold spy reality. Perfectly normal surface, deadly beneath.

## Color Palettes
- **Family Home**: Warm domesticity, yellows and browns, comfort
- **Spy Work**: Desaturated, harsh, cold reality
- **Flashbacks**: Nostalgic warmth fading to harsh present
- **Violence**: Stark brutality interrupting domestic scenes

## Music
**Emotional 80s Score** - Period music mixed with emotional orchestration. Use silence and ambient sound (dinner conversation, children playing) as counterpoint to tension.

**Themes**:
- **Family Theme**: Warm, genuine, strings and piano
- **Spy Theme**: Electronic tension, cold war paranoia
- **Integration**: Themes blend as lives blend

## Voice Direction
- **Philip/Loid**: Accented English, controlled emotion, methodical
- **Elizabeth/Yor**: American professional, warmth hiding steel
- **Paige**: Teenage discovery, hurt and processing
- **Henry**: Younger innocence, hasn't learned truth yet
- **Handlers**: Cold authority, manipulative concern
- **Stan**: Genuine friendly neighbor, FBI professional

## Cinematic Moments
- **The Ordinary Morning**: Breakfast scene with undercurrent of lies
- **The Mission**: Sudden shift from domestic to deadly
- **Near Miss**: Almost exposed in public, maintaining cover desperately
- **The Marriage Bed**: Intimacy complicated by secrets
- **Children Sleeping**: Parents watching, weighing what they've done
- **The Revelation**: Truth comes out, family fractures
- **Fight Together**: Parents as perfect combat team protecting kids
- **The Choice**: Choose family or nation, can't have both
- **Garage Fight**: Brutal combat in domestic space, jarring contrast

## Emotional Tone

**Constant Duality**: Every scene has surface (normal family) and depth (espionage reality). Make both feel real. The lies become truth; the truth was always lies.

**The Children**: Their innocence and ignorance is protective and tragic. Every family moment genuine despite foundation of deception.

**Marriage Complexity**: Started transactional, became real without anyone noticing when. Sexual and emotional intimacy despite professional origin.
