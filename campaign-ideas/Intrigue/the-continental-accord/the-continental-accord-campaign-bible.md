The Continental Accord [TAG: CAMPAIGN]

Logline [TAG: LOGLINE]
In a glamorous, high-stakes world of international espionage, a team of elite spies from rival agencies must enforce a fragile peace treaty, navigating deadly conspiracies and their own conflicting loyalties at a luxury hotel that serves as a neutral ground for the world's superpowers.

Premise [TAG: PREMISE]
Following a devastating global conflict, the world's intelligence agencies have signed "The Continental Accord," a treaty establishing a single, neutral territory for diplomacy and covert negotiations: The Hotel Obsidian. This opulent, art deco skyscraper is a world unto itself, with its own laws and a formidable private security force. The players are "Concierges," elite agents from different, often hostile, nations, forced to work together as a team to uphold the Accord. They must investigate treaty violations, thwart assassination plots, and neutralize rogue agents, all within the gilded cage of the hotel where every guest is a spy and every room could hide a secret.

Core Conflict [TAG: CORE_CONFLICT]
The core conflict is the players' struggle to maintain the fragile peace of the Continental Accord against the constant machinations of spies, criminals, and rogue states who seek to exploit it. They are caught between their duty to the Accord and their loyalty to their home agencies, who often give them secret, conflicting objectives. The team must learn to trust each other while knowing that any one of them could be a double agent, all while battling a shadowy organization that wants to shatter the peace and plunge the world back into open war.

Setting [TAG: SETTING]
The entire campaign is set within the confines of The Hotel Obsidian, a luxurious and labyrinthine art deco skyscraper located on a small, sovereign island. The hotel is a vertical city, featuring everything from Michelin-star restaurants and grand ballrooms to secret underground bunkers and black-market auction houses. The atmosphere is one of sophisticated glamour and deadly paranoia, a world of tailored suits, poisoned cocktails, and whispered secrets. It's a blend of the style of *James Bond*, the world-building of *John Wick*, and the contained tension of a locked-room mystery.

Major Factions [TAG: FACTIONS]
[The Obsidian Management] [TAG: FACTION]
The enigmatic and ruthlessly efficient organization that runs The Hotel Obsidian. Led by "The Manager," their sole objective is to enforce the rules of the Accord and maintain the hotel's neutrality, a task they carry out with their own army of highly trained and impeccably dressed security. They are the ultimate authority within the hotel's walls, and they will not hesitate to "evict" anyone who threatens its stability, including the players.

[The Ghost Syndicate] [TAG: FACTION]
A shadowy cabal of arms dealers, rogue intelligence agents, and war profiteers who thrived during the last global conflict. The Continental Accord is bad for their business, and they are dedicated to sabotaging it from the shadows. They operate through proxies and cutouts, orchestrating assassinations, bombings, and information leaks designed to push the world's powers back towards open conflict. Their leader is a mysterious figure known only as "Le Spectre."

[The Home Agencies (CIA, MI6, MSS, etc.)] [TAG: FACTION]
While publicly committed to the Accord, the intelligence agencies of the world's superpowers are constantly engaged in a cold war of espionage within the hotel. Each agency has its own agenda and frequently gives its player representative secret, off-the-books missions that directly contradict the spirit, if not the letter, of the Accord. They are a source of support, equipment, and conflicting objectives for the players.

Key NPCs [TAG: NPCS]
[The Manager] [TAG: NPC]
The impeccably dressed, unnervingly calm, and utterly ruthless ruler of The Hotel Obsidian. The Manager's past is a mystery, but their authority is absolute. They are the players' boss, judge, and potential executioner. They are a stickler for the rules and view the world with a cynical detachment, but they possess a deep, almost fanatical commitment to the hotel and the peace it represents.

[Isabelle "The Ghost" Vautour] [TAG: NPC]
A legendary freelance assassin and information broker who is a permanent resident of the hotel. Isabelle is a woman of expensive tastes and fluid loyalties. She might be hired by the Ghost Syndicate to carry out a hit, or she might sell crucial information to the players if the price is right. She is a dangerous rival, a potential asset, and a constant source of temptation and intrigue.

[Dimitri Volkov, Russian SVR Station Chief] [TAG: NPC]
A charismatic and cunning old-school spymaster who represents the players' most direct rival within the hotel. Dimitri is always probing for weaknesses, trying to turn the players against each other, and running his own operations under their noses. He can be a charming conversationalist one moment and a deadly adversary the next, representing the constant threat of the "Great Game" of espionage.

Potential Quests [TAG: QUESTS]
[The Defector's Gambit] [TAG: QUEST]
A high-ranking scientist from a rogue nation checks into the hotel, offering to defect and trade a revolutionary new weapons technology for asylum. The players must verify his claims, protect him from assassins sent by his home country, and negotiate the terms of his defection with the major powers, all while ensuring the technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

[Murder on the Orient Express Floor] [TAG: QUEST]
A diplomat is found murdered in his locked, soundproof suite on one of the hotel's most secure floors. The death threatens to collapse a major peace negotiation. The Obsidian Management gives the players 24 hours to solve the murder before they take their own, more permanent, measures. The players must investigate the crime scene, interrogate a suite of powerful and deceptive suspects, and uncover the killer before time runs out.

[The Black-Tie Blackout] [TAG: QUEST]
During the hotel's annual New Year's Eve Masquerade Ball, the Ghost Syndicate triggers a complete security blackout, cutting the hotel off from the outside world. They plan to use the chaos to assassinate a visiting head of state. The players must navigate the panicked, mask-wearing crowds, restore the hotel's security systems, and identify and neutralize the assassins before they can strike, all without revealing the crisis to the hotel's thousands of oblivious guests.

Unique Mechanics/Elements [TAG: MECHANICS]
The campaign uses a "Trust & Allegiance" system. Each player has a "Trust" score with their fellow players and an "Allegiance" score with their home agency. Actions that prioritize the team and the Accord will raise their Trust score, unlocking team-based abilities. Following secret orders from their home agency will raise their Allegiance score, granting them access to special equipment or intelligence but lowering their Trust with the team. This creates a constant mechanical tension between cooperation and betrayal.

Tone and Mood [TAG: TONE]
The tone is a sophisticated, high-stakes spy thriller. It's glamorous, tense, and action-packed, with a focus on clever problem-solving, social intrigue, and sudden bursts of violence. The mood is one of cool professionalism and constant paranoia, where every character has a hidden agenda and the luxurious setting only serves to highlight the deadly seriousness of the game being played.

Themes [TAG: THEMES]
The campaign explores themes of peace and conflict, loyalty and betrayal, and the idea of a neutral ground in a world of opposing ideologies. It questions whether old enemies can ever truly work together and examines the personal cost of a life built on deception. A central theme is the tension between the individual agent's conscience and their duty to their country, their team, and the cause of peace.
