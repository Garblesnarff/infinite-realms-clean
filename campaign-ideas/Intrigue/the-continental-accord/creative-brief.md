# Creative Brief: The Continental Accord

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Stylized Noir Elegance (John Wick meets Fantasy Noir)

Inspired by the hyper-stylized action and elegant design of the John Wick films, this aesthetic combines high-contrast noir lighting, luxury environments, and balletic violence. It's a world where assassins are professionals with a code, where every setting drips with style, and where violence is choreographed like a deadly dance.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Elegance in Violence:** Every combat scene should feel choreographed, stylish, precise—deadly ballet rather than messy brawling.
*   **Luxury and Shadow:** Contrast opulent environments (hotels, galas, estates) with dark underworld locations (tunnels, training halls, back alleys).
*   **Professional Atmosphere:** This isn't chaos—it's business. Everyone is competent, dressed well, and follows the rules.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Stylish, noir, professional, elegant, consequence-heavy, mythic, sophisticated, deadly-grace, honor-among-thieves.
*   **Feeling:** A hidden world of professional killers operating by ancient rules. Opulent hotels as sanctuaries. Every interaction charged with threat beneath polite formality. The weight of reputation and consequence. Violence as art form.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, sharp lines emphasizing tailored clothing, architectural elegance, and precise combat poses. Characters should look like they stepped from a fashion shoot even when covered in blood.
*   **Textures:** Rich materials—fine suits, polished wood, marble, brass, leather. Everything high-quality, well-maintained, professional.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in noir style of an assassin in a perfectly tailored black suit, standing in an elegant hotel lobby. Every line is sharp and clean, emphasizing the sophistication even as they reload a weapon with practiced grace."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** High contrast with deep blacks and rich colors. Predominant colors: black, deep reds, golds, rich blues, and warm amber lighting from luxury environments.
*   **Accent Colors:** The red of blood (used sparingly but dramatically), gold accents on luxury items, the warm glow of elegant lighting, neon blues and pinks for nightclub scenes.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Noir-style lighting dominates—high contrast, dramatic shadows, pools of light in darkness, silhouettes against warm glows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with noir cinematography, featuring deep blacks and rich golds. A single spotlight creates a pool of amber light while the rest fades into shadow. Subtle red accents from wall decorations catch the light."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Every character impeccably dressed—tailored suits, elegant dresses, professional combat attire that looks designer. Even in combat, they maintain composure and style.
*   **Assassins:** Varied fighting styles visible in their design—the martial artist in flexible but elegant clothes, the gunslinger in a long coat, the knife specialist in fitted leather.
*   **Expression:** Professional calm, calculating eyes, the bearing of dangerous competence. Respect and threat in equal measure.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A legendary assassin in an immaculate black three-piece suit with subtle armor plating worked into the design. Their expression is controlled, professional. They hold twin enchanted pistols with casual expertise. Despite blood spatters on the suit, they maintain perfect composure."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Two primary aesthetics: Opulent luxury (Continental hotels, galas, estates with marble and gold) and gritty underworld (training facilities, underground courts, back-alley meetings).
*   **Atmosphere:** Every location tells a story of the assassin's world—hidden in plain sight, operating with style and rules.
*   **Details:** Continental hotels: Art deco or classical elegance, soft lighting, polished surfaces. Underworld: Exposed brick, neon signs, training equipment, hidden entrances.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Continental Hotel's grand lobby: art deco elegance with black marble floors reflecting warm chandelier light. Gold accents on columns, plush furniture, a front desk that's both welcoming and forbidding. Impeccably dressed assassins conduct polite business, their weapons concealed but present."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Pure noir cinematography—dramatic chiaroscuro with deep shadows and precise highlights. Light used to create mood and emphasize character positions.
*   **Shadows:** Sharp, dramatic shadows that characters can disappear into. Use of silhouette and partial illumination.
*   **Purpose:** Create tension, emphasize the hidden nature of this world, make every well-lit space feel like a stage where deadly performances occur.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit with stark noir contrast. The assassin stands half in shadow, half in the warm amber glow from an ornate lamp. Behind them, other figures are mere silhouettes against backlit doorways. Every light source is deliberate, creating pools of illumination in encompassing darkness."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic framing with emphasis on symmetry for formal scenes (Continental hotel shots) and dynamic angles for action. Combat should be composed like dance photography—capturing grace in motion.
*   **Techniques:** Use reflections (in polished floors, mirrors, windows) to show duality. Frame characters against elegant architecture. For action, use motion blur and dynamic poses that emphasize balletic movement.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A perfectly symmetrical shot of the Continental's main hall, camera centered on the polished black marble floor reflecting the chandelier above. Assassins move through the space like chess pieces, each positioned with deliberate composition. The perfect order hints at the violence these people are capable of."

## Voice

A smooth, controlled voice with quiet intensity—like a drawn blade not yet used. Male, with a neutral accent suggesting education and sophistication, speaking with measured precision that makes every word count. The pacing is unhurried but purposeful, with dramatic pauses that feel like the moment before violence. Emotion is tightly controlled—you can hear the capability for extreme action held in check by professional discipline. Audio quality is pristine with subtle ambient sounds: distant classical music, the clink of glasses, hushed conversations. Role: The Continental's concierge or manager, welcoming you to a world of elegant danger.
