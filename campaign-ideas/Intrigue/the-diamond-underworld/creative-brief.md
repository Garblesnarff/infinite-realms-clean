### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Chaotic, darkly comic, interconnected, violent, absurd, gritty, energetic.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of barely controlled chaos where everyone is one bad decision from disaster. The atmosphere should evoke darkly comic violence, the absurdity of criminal incompetence mixed with dangerous professionalism, and the energy of interconnected schemes. The world feels dangerous but also ridiculous.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Energetic, slightly exaggerated lines emphasizing action, violence, and comic absurdity. Gritty textures for the criminal underworld.
*   **Forms:** Boxing rings with blood and betting slips, gritty pawnshops stuffed with stolen goods, gangster lairs, diamonds catching light among chaos.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic illustration in the style of Snatch, showing a chaotic criminal scene with overlapping elements: a boxing match, a diamond exchange, gangsters arguing, all interconnected in a frenetic composition."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Gritty urban colors—browns, grays, blacks—punctuated by the brilliant sparkle of the diamond and splashes of blood red.
*   **Luminosity:** Harsh lighting from bare bulbs and boxing ring lights; the diamond catches every light source; shadows hide dangerous characters.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a gritty color palette of urban browns and grays, with the diamond's brilliant sparkle as a focal point, accented by blood red and the harsh lighting of underground criminal spaces."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Distinctive criminal archetypes: boxing promoters in cheap suits, brutal gangsters, nervous pawnbrokers, hardened boxers, incompetent thieves.
*   **Comic Elements:** Exaggerated but believable character design—distinctive looks, memorable scars, clothing that shows their role in the criminal ecosystem.
*   **Expression:** Faces show stress, violence, dark humor, the desperate energy of criminals scrambling for advantage.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A lineup of interconnected criminals: a fast-talking promoter in a loud suit, a terrifying gangster with pig-farming apron, a nervous pawnbroker clutching goods, a bare-knuckle boxer with bloodied fists, each distinctive and memorable."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Gritty criminal spaces: underground boxing rings with blood on canvas, cluttered pawnshops, pig farms where enemies disappear, diamond districts where legal and illegal intersect.
*   **Atmosphere:** Grimy, dangerous, energetic. Every location feels lived-in by criminals and potentially explosive.
*   **Details:** Criminal world-building: betting slips, stolen goods, boxing equipment, weapons hidden in plain sight, the diamond visible in unexpected contexts.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An underground boxing ring during a chaotic match, blood on the canvas, crowd betting and shouting, gangsters watching from the shadows, the diamond visible in someone's pocket, gritty lighting emphasizing dangerous energy."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, dramatic lighting from bare bulbs, boxing ring spots, and street lights. Deep shadows hiding threats. The diamond catches every light brilliantly.
*   **Shadows:** Heavy and gritty, used both for dramatic effect and to suggest hidden dangers lurking in criminal spaces.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates zones of violence and absurdity, highlights the diamond as a beacon of greed, and emphasizes the gritty reality of criminal life.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...harshly lit by bare bulbs and boxing ring lights creating stark shadows, with the diamond catching light brilliantly amid grimy criminal surroundings, blood gleaming wetly, faces half-shadowed and dangerous."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Energetic, overlapping compositions showing interconnected schemes; split-screen showing simultaneous criminal activities; chaotic action scenes with multiple elements.
*   **Techniques:** Fast cuts between connected scenes, overhead shots showing the web of connections, circular compositions as schemes return to starting points.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A complex multi-panel composition showing interconnected criminal schemes: top left shows the diamond theft, top right shows a boxing match, bottom shows a pawnshop exchange, with visual lines connecting all elements and characters appearing in multiple panels."

## Voice

A voice that captures the darkly comic energy of fast-talking criminals and violent absurdity. The narrator speaks with the rapid-fire delivery of a con artist telling war stories—colorful language, memorable descriptions, dark humor mixed with genuine danger. During action: frenetic and energetic. During violence: unflinching but still finding dark humor. During reveals: satisfying emphasis on how everything connects. The pacing is fast and energetic with occasional pauses for darkly comic observations or philosophical asides about crime. The emotion is amused cynicism—the voice of someone who has seen it all and finds the absurdity hilarious even when it's brutal. Audio quality features criminal underworld ambience—boxing bells, crowd noise, weapons, distinctive accents, pigs snuffling (ominously), the clink of the diamond changing hands. Role: The voice of a criminal storyteller recounting the chaos with dark humor and energy.
