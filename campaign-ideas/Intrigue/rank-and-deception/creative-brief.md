# Creative Brief: Rank and Deception

## Art Style
Military espionage aesthetic. Pieces wear uniforms with rank insignia hidden until combat. Red vs Blue color scheme (two armies). 10x10 grid battlefield with grid lines visible. Fog of war effect—enemy pieces appear as silhouettes until revealed. Napoleonic-era military uniforms mixed with modern spy thriller elements.

## Color Palette
**Red Army**: Crimson #DC143C, burgundy, scarlet uniforms
**Blue Army**: Navy #000080, royal blue, azure uniforms
**Battlefield**: Olive drab #6B8E23, military green, tan
**Lake**: Dark water #2F4F4F, impassable blue-gray
**Bombs**: Black #000000 with orange #FF8C00 warning symbols
**Flag**: Gold #FFD700, sacred and gleaming
**Rankless**: White static #FFFFFF, glitching effects

## Music
Military drums, marching rhythms, espionage tension strings. Scout movements have rapid, light percussion. Marshal appears with heavy brass fanfare. Spy has noir jazz sneaking music. Bomb has ticking clock sounds. Flag has sacred orchestral theme. Rank reveal has dramatic sting.

## Voice Direction

**Marshals**: Commanding, authoritative military leaders, no doubt in voice

**Spies**: Whispered, subtle, every word calculated for manipulation

**Scouts**: Quick, nervous, rapid information delivery like radio chatter

**Miners**: Methodical, careful, speak in terms of risk assessment

**Rankless**: Glitching voices, multiple overlapping tones, unstable audio

## Cinematic Moments

**Rank Reveal**: Two pieces meet. Camera close-up on both faces. Dramatic pause. Simultaneously, rank insignia appears on both uniforms. Numbers glow. Higher rank wins—lower rank shatters and dissolves.

**Spy Assassinates Marshal**: The mighty Marshal (rank 10) confronts weak Spy (rank 1). Marshal laughs. Ranks reveal. Spy's special rule activates—dagger through Marshal's heart. Shock on Marshal's face as they die to the "weakest" piece.

**Bomb Detonation**: Character steps on hidden Bomb square. Massive explosion. Character obliterated. Crater remains where they stood.

**Flag Capture**: Character removes enemy Flag from its hiding place. Reality shimmers. Victory announced. But then—reality glitches. Is this real victory or illusion?
