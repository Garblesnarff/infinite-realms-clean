# Rank and Deception: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
"Rank" is not a hierarchy of command. It is a metaphysical "narrative construct," a living story of authority, obedience, and betrayal that has existed for centuries. Each "rank" is not earned, but is "written" into a soldier's life, their career becoming a chapter in the military's ongoing saga. "Deception" is not a tactic; it is the military's core function, its very reason for being. It is a constant, internal struggle for narrative control, where each officer tries to "re-write" the story to their own advantage, often at the expense of others. The "deception" is not just against the enemy, but against each other, and ultimately, against themselves, as they lose their true identities to the military's narrative. The military's "General" is not a person, but the original, foundational lie, a narrative seed that has grown into a monstrous, all-consuming story.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Order (Ancient History):** A powerful, ambitious individual gives a single, foundational order to gain power. This order, repeated and built upon, becomes the narrative seed of the military.
2.  **The Birth of Rank (c. -500 years):** The narrative seed achieves sentience, becoming "Rank." Its first "members" are the descendants of the original commander, whose lives are subtly shaped by the military's narrative.
3.  **The Age of Deception (c. -400 to -100 years):** Rank grows, its narrative consuming more and more lives. It becomes a powerful, shadowy organization, manipulating kingdoms and empires from behind the scenes.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day the Medals Wept (c. -100 years):** For 24 hours, all military medals begin to weep tears of blood, turning the streets into red rivers and causing many soldiers to question their loyalty.
5.  **The Great Mutiny (c. -50 years):** A powerful military member tries to "re-write" the military's narrative, leading to a brutal internal conflict. The "Un-Ranked" are born from this schism.
6.  **The Rise of the General (c. -20 years):** The original, foundational lie, now fully sentient, becomes the "General," the living embodiment of the military's narrative.
7.  **Operation Deception (Present Day):** The military initiates its most ambitious narrative yet: a global deception designed to re-write the history of an entire war. The players are caught in the middle of this operation.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Lie (1 week ago):** A single, powerful lie told by a military member echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original lie.
9.  **The Narrative Collapse (Present Day):** The military's narrative is becoming too complex, too contradictory. It is on the verge of collapsing, threatening to unravel the very fabric of reality.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Parade (1 day ago):** The entire world begins to manifest as a parade. People's lives become floats, their actions choreographed movements. The horror of narrative control becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against a parasitic narrative. The military is not just a powerful organization; it is a living story that consumes its members. The players are caught in this narrative, either as unwilling protagonists or as desperate attempts to "edit" the story. The horror comes from the realization that their lives are not their own, but are merely plot points in a larger, more sinister narrative. The goal is not to "win" against the military, which is impossible, but to "escape" its narrative, to write their own story, or, perhaps, to find a way to "re-write" the military's narrative into something benevolent. The ultimate horror is the realization that you are just a soldier in someone else's war.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The General's Baton
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A polished, black baton that hums with a faint, psychic energy. It is the symbol of the General's authority.
**Mechanics:** The baton cannot be moved by any physical means. A military unit within a 1-mile radius of it is considered "commanded." All orders given within this radius are magically obeyed, and all military operations are immune to natural decay. Once per year, the unit's leader can perform the "Rite of Command," allowing them to ask the Baton a single question about military strategy, tactics, or logistics, which it will answer by implanting a "blueprint" directly into their mind.

### 2. The Blank Page's Eraser
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, white eraser that seems to absorb all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this eraser to "un-write" a single, non-magical word from existence. If used on a creature, the creature must make a CHA save or have a single, minor memory erased. **Curse:** The eraser slowly consumes the wielder's own memories. Each day the eraser is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own memory. At 5 failures, the wielder's memory is completely erased, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 3. The Red Pen of Narrative Control
**Type:** Legendary Pen
**Description:** A simple, red pen that seems to hum with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this pen to subtly "edit" the military's narrative. They can change minor details of the past or present, alter a character's personality, or introduce a new plot point. **Curse:** The pen slowly consumes the wielder's own identity. Each day the pen is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wielder's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Red Pen.

### 4. The MacGuffin of Ultimate Power
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A strange, glowing, and intricately-carved object. It hums with a faint, alluring energy.
**Mechanics:** The MacGuffin is a pure plot device. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. But everyone *thinks* it's incredibly important, and will try to steal it from you. Its presence subtly manipulates the military's narrative, creating new plot points and driving the story forward.

### 5. The Deus Ex Machina's Watch
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pocket watch that seems to run backwards. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this watch to subtly manipulate time. They can rewind time by a few seconds, or fast-forward it by a few seconds. Once per day, the watch can be used to perform a "Deus Ex Machina" intervention, resolving an impossible situation, but at a cost. **Curse:** The watch slowly consumes the wielder's own sense of time. Each day the watch is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose their sense of time for 1 hour.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Code
In this world, the story dictates reality. Plot points are physical forces.
*   **Narrative Control:** Powerful military members can subtly manipulate reality by "re-writing" the narrative. A minor edit to a document might change a historical event. A well-placed rumor might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*   **Plot Armor:** Protagonists have "plot armor." They are impossibly lucky, surviving certain death because the story demands it. This manifests as a pool of "Story Points" that can be spent to avoid damage, succeed on impossible checks, or introduce a convenient plot twist.
*   **Deus Ex Machina:** When the narrative reaches an impossible impasse, a "Deus Ex Machina" will appear, resolving the situation in a sudden, unexpected, and often absurd way. This is not always benevolent.

### Subsystems: Narrative Score and Identity Score
*   **Narrative Score:** Each player has a "Narrative Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they perform actions that are "story-worthy" (heroic deeds, dramatic betrayals, witty banter). High Narrative makes them more susceptible to the military's narrative control, but also grants them more "plot armor."
*   **Identity Score:** Each player has an "Identity Score" (from 0 to 10). This score decreases when they lie, pretend to be someone they're not, or keep secrets. Low Identity makes them more susceptible to the military's narrative manipulation, as they lose their sense of self. Restoring trust and being honest can increase their Identity Score.
