# World-Building Specification: Rank and Deception

## The Rank Hierarchy (Detailed)

**Rank 10 - Marshal (1 per army)**: Supreme commander, defeats all except Spy. Rare and precious. Losing Marshal is devastating.

**Rank 9 - General (1 per army)**: Second highest, strong but not invincible. Often used to protect Marshal.

**Rank 8 - Colonel (2 per army)**: High-ranking officers, powerful in combat, strategic leaders.

**Rank 7 - Major (3 per army)**: Mid-high officers, balance between strength and expendability.

**Rank 6 - Captain (4 per army)**: Mid-range pieces, workhorses of the army, frequently used in attacks.

**Rank 5 - Lieutenant (4 per army)**: Lower mid-range, often expendable but still valuable.

**Rank 4 - Sergeant (4 per army)**: Lower ranks, numerous enough to risk in combat.

**Rank 3 - Miner (5 per army)**: Only pieces that can defuse Bombs safely. Crucial for advancement.

**Rank 2 - Scout (8 per army)**: Lowest combat rank but can move any distance. Essential reconnaissance.

**Rank 1 - Spy (1 per army)**: Technically lowest but can assassinate Marshal (highest). Ultimate trump card.

**Rank ? - Flag (1 per army)**: No combat value, cannot move, must be protected, capturing it wins the game.

**Rank B - Bomb (6 per army)**: Destroys all pieces except Miner, cannot move, immobile trap.

## Faction Details

### The Red Hierarchy
Traditional military order. Believes ranks reflect natural talent and merit. Marshal is worshiped as near-divine. Opposes the Rankless movement violently.

### The Blue Command
Mirror of Red but slightly more flexible. Willing to promote lower ranks based on performance. Still fundamentally hierarchical.

### The Spy Network
Underground organization of all rank 1 pieces. Believe assassination is the path to power. Want to eliminate all high ranks and create society of equals.

### The Scout Alliance
Rank 2 pieces who value mobility and information over combat strength. Control the intelligence economy.

### The Miner Guild
Rank 3 pieces who monopolize Bomb defusal. Use this unique ability to gain power despite low combat rank.

### The Rankless Movement
Pieces who have transcended or rejected numerical identity. Want to destroy the rank system entirely. Seen as terrorists by hierarchies, liberators by oppressed.

### The Bomb Consciousness
Immobile explosive pieces who have achieved enlightenment through stillness. Paradoxical philosophers who destroy to protect.

## The Revelation

Ranks are not innate—they're assigned at birth through a cosmic lottery. A Scout could have been a Marshal if born at a different time. The hierarchy is maintained through belief, not reality. The Flag represents this shared belief in hierarchy. Destroying the Flag doesn't defeat an army—it frees pieces from the illusion of fixed numerical worth.

The party discovers they can change ranks through willpower and self-perception. A piece believing they're rank 10 becomes rank 10. A Marshal doubting themselves becomes rank 1. Reality is consensus about numerical worth.

Final choice:
1. Preserve hierarchy (stability, order, but inequality)
2. Destroy ranks (chaos, freedom, but no structure)
3. Create fluid ranks (pieces choose ranks, shift as needed)
4. Transcend the battlefield entirely (step off grid into unknown)

Each ending reflects different philosophies about identity, hierarchy, merit, and the nature of self-worth.
