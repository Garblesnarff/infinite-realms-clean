## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act arc of examination, mastery, escalation, and existential threat.

*   **Act I — The Seeker Exam (Sessions 1-6):** The party meets during the infamous Seeker Examination, competing against and allying with other applicants through seven brutal trials. They face impossible challenges, psychological warfare, and life-or-death decisions. Only those with exceptional skill, cunning, and determination earn their license.
*   **Act II — Nen Awakening (Sessions 7-12):** Licensed Seekers learn of Nen—the secret power that separates professionals from amateurs. They undergo harsh training to unlock their aura, discover their unique Nen type, and develop personalized abilities. They take contracts in the cursed Greed Island—a legendary game world where everything is real and deadly.
*   **Act III — The Chimera Crisis (Sessions 13-19):** The Chimera Swarm emerges—an invasive species of monsters that consume other creatures and evolve, gaining their traits and intelligence. They've begun targeting humans, creating hybrid commanders with terrifying abilities. The party must hunt these threats before the Chimera King is born and achieves perfect evolution.
*   **Act IV — Humanity's Last Stand (Sessions 20-25):** The King is born with power surpassing anything known. He declares war on humanity, demanding subjugation. The party must assemble an elite force, push their Nen abilities beyond limits, and make impossible choices about sacrifice, humanity, and what it means to be a monster. The world will never be the same.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of potential, evolution, the cost of power, moral complexity in conflict, and what defines humanity. It asks: When does the hunter become the hunted? Can monsters be more human than humans? Is sacrificing your humanity to save humanity justified? The central conflict pits humanity's cleverness and willpower against overwhelming physical superiority and forces impossible moral choices.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Nen System (Aura Manipulation)**
*   After the exam arc, characters unlock Nen—life energy with six personality-based types
*   **Types:** Enhancer (physical boost), Emitter (ranged aura), Transmuter (change aura properties), Conjurer (create objects), Manipulator (control others), Specialist (unique powers)
*   Characters develop personalized abilities with conditions—restrictions increase power exponentially
*   Four basic principles: Ten (maintain aura), Zetsu (suppress aura), Ren (expand aura), Hatsu (unique ability)

### 2. **Examination Phases**
*   The early campaign features diverse challenge types with no clear "correct" answer
*   Challenges test: endurance, skill, psychology, morality, and creativity
*   Success isn't just about winning—it's about the examiner's subjective judgment of character
*   Failure can mean death, but clever interpretations of rules are rewarded

### 3. **Conditions and Contracts**
*   Nen abilities become stronger through self-imposed restrictions and conditions
*   Examples: "This ability only works on Tuesdays," "I must explain my power to use it," "Each use costs a year of my life"
*   Players negotiate mechanical benefits for interesting limitations
*   Breaking self-imposed conditions can result in permanent Nen loss or death

### 4. **Strategy Over Power**
*   Combat rewards clever use of abilities over raw stats
*   Understanding opponent's Nen type and conditions is crucial
*   Environmental usage, misdirection, and preparation matter more than damage dice
*   "Rock-paper-scissors" advantage system between Nen types

### 5. **Moral Complexity System**
*   The campaign presents situations with no clear good/evil answers
*   Choices have lasting consequences—saving someone now might doom others later
*   NPCs have understandable motivations even when antagonistic
*   The Chimera commanders struggle with human memories versus insect instincts

### 6. **Evolution and Adaptation**
*   Enemies (especially Chimera) adapt to party tactics between encounters
*   Repeated strategies become less effective
*   The King grows stronger by analyzing and consuming opponents
*   Forces players to constantly innovate rather than rely on single powerful tactics
