# Campaign Bible: The Seeker's Trial

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### [TAG: LORE_CORE]

**The Origin Myth: The Leakage of the Outer Dark**
The known world is not a planet, but a "Safe Zone"—a continental petri dish cultivated by the Ancients within the endless, toxic expanse of the Dark Continent. Humanity did not evolve naturally; we were "gardened." The power known as **Nen** is not a gift of the gods, but a biological contamination—a leakage from the Dark Continent that permeated the Safe Zone's barrier three thousand years ago. It is life energy forced to evolve to survive a hostile cosmos. To use Nen is to open a microscopic hole in one's own soul to the "Outside," allowing the chaotic potential of the universe to flow through a fragile human vessel. The Seeker Association exists not just to hunt treasure, but to act as the immune system of the Safe Zone, pruning those who let too much of the "Outside" in.

**Timeline of Events**
1.  **-3000 BR (Before Revelation):** The **Great Barrier Breach**. A crack in the continental seal allows the first wave of "Aura" to flood the Lake Mobius basin. Fauna mutates instantly; humanity nearly goes extinct.
2.  **-2500 BR:** **The First Awakening.** A monk named Isaac Netero’s ancestor meditates for 50 years and accidentally punches a hole in reality, discovering the principle of "Ten" (Containment).
3.  **-1000 BR:** **The Weeping War.** Nations fight over the "Vobero Ores" (Nen-conducting stones). The war ends when the sky literally rains blood for 40 days and nights due to a mass-ritual gone wrong.
4.  **-800 BR:** **Formation of the Seeker Association.** Established to police the use of "The Flow" (later called Nen) and prevent another Weeping War.
5.  **-200 BR:** **The Puppeteer's Plague.** A Nen-curse animates all statues in the Northern Hemisphere, causing them to march into the sea. The event is hushed up by history books as a "mass hallucination."
6.  **-50 BR:** **The Zoldyck Pact.** The assassin family signs a treaty with the V5 Nations: they are immune to prosecution as long as they never accept a contract on a Head of State.
7.  **-10 BR:** **The Disappearance of the Kurta Clan.** The Phantom Troupe massacres the clan for their Scarlet Eyes. The brutality changes the underworld’s ecosystem forever.
8.  **-5 BR:** **Greed Island Launch.** The game is released. 99% of players disappear inside the console. It becomes an urban legend.
9.  **Current Year:** **The 287th Exam.** The year the party joins. The pass rate is predicted to be the lowest in history due to the "Rookie Crusher" examiner.
10. **+6 Months (Future):** **The Chimera Event.** The Queen washes ashore on the Balsa Islands. The countdown to extinction begins.

**The Metaphysical "Why"**
The conflict exists because Evolution is not finished. Humanity has plateaued. The Chimera Ants represent "Hyper-Evolution"—nature's attempt to correct the stagnation of the Safe Zone. The heroes are fighting not just monsters, but the universe's desire to replace humanity with something stronger.
