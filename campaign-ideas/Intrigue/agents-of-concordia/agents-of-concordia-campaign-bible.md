# Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### The Origin Myth: The Trinity-Tunguska Resonance
History books claim the Atomic Age began in 1945. They are wrong. When the first atomic bomb was tested at Trinity, and simultaneously synchronized with a Soviet dark-matter experiment at the Tunguska site, the fabric of reality didn't just split; it *harmonized*. This event, known as the **Resonance**, punctured the veil between Earth and the **Etheric Plane**. Magic flooded back into the world, but it was raw, radioactive, and highly responsive to human ideology. In the West, magic manifested as "Glamour"—sleek, individualistic, and transactional. In the East, it became "The Current"—industrial, brutalist, and collective. The Cold War is not just a battle of economies, but a metaphysical war to decide which flavor of reality will consume the planet.

### Timeline of the Weird War
1.  **1908:** The Tunguska Event occurs; actually an early attempt by Czarist mystics to punch a hole in heaven.
2.  **1945:** The Trinity Test. The hole opens. Oppenheimer doesn't quote scripture; he accidentally summons a Fire Djinn.
3.  **1947:** The Roswell Incident. Not aliens, but a Soviet "Thought-Form" drone that crashed while attempting to psionically map American dreams.
4.  **1953:** Stalin dies. Official reports say stroke; reality is his soul was harvested by the **Bureau of Brutalist Architecture** to power the Moscow Metro wards.
5.  **1957:** Sputnik launched. It broadcasts a low-frequency necromantic hum that reanimates the dead in rural Kansas for 48 hours.
6.  **1961:** The Berlin Wall is erected. It is not just concrete; it is built on a ley line, effectively acting as a magical dam preventing Western "Glamour" from infecting the East.
7.  **1962:** Cuban Missile Crisis. Not nuclear missiles, but canisters of "Liquid Apathy" capable of depopulating Florida.
8.  **1963:** The Assassination Attempt (Averted). JFK is saved when his convertible's enchantment deflects the bullet. The public is told he had a "lucky reflex."
9.  **1964:** The British Invasion. The Beatles use subconscious bardic magic to pacify global youth. MI6 creates "Project: Yoko" to disrupt it.
10. **1965 (Current Year):** The appearance of the **Torsion Device**, a machine capable of twisting the ideological alignment of an entire continent.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The Etheric Plane reflects the dominant consciousness of humanity. If the West wins, reality becomes a chaotic, hyper-commercialized lucid dream where belief defines power (Solipsism). If the East wins, reality becomes a perfect, grey clockwork mechanism where individual will is impossible (Determinism). **UNCLE** exists to maintain the stalemate, because if either side truly wins, free will dies.
