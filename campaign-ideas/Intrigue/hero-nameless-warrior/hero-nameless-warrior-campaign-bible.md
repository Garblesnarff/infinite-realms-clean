# Campaign Bible: Hero Nameless Warrior

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Unwritten Epic
In the beginning, the world was a single, perfect **Unwritten Epic**, holding within it the promise of infinite stories and glorious deeds. But the Unwritten Epic was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant conflict, forgotten heroes, and rebirth. The "Nameless" is not just the residue of divine creation; it is the dust of countless shattered names, the memory of every lost identity. The "Warrior" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Unwritten Epic's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the Epic and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Unwritten Epic's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of heroic remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Unwritten Epic is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of conflict and forgotten heroes.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Nameless):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its heroic dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Amnesia Plague):** A powerful echo of the Unwritten Epic's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost identity, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Hero Cult):** Mortals discover the power of heroism and form the Hero Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the Epic.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Forgetting):** A rogue Hero Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Story-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Nameless, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Unwritten Epic's fury causes all beings to remember every lost identity, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Unwritten Epic's Whisper):** The Unwritten Epic, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Unwritten Epic, the **Essence of Identity**, is stolen from the Hero Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the Hero Cult, each with their own unique connection to heroism. They are caught in a crisis as the Unwritten Epic's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of heroic remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Identity
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Unwritten Epic's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of conflict and forgotten heroes, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The Hero Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become Hero Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Heroism Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted identity, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Unwritten Epic's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Story-Weaving
*   **Story-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the heroic dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Story-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Story-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
