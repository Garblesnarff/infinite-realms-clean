## Central Conflict

Idealism versus pragmatism in nation-building. The party fought for freedom, but what does that mean? Centralized power versus local autonomy, wealth versus equality, pure ideals versus compromise. Personal ambitions threaten to tear apart what they built together. The question: will they "throw away their shot" or will ambition be their undoing? Can revolutionaries become governors without becoming what they overthrew?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Verbal Combat System**
*   Political debates and rap battles use opposed performance/persuasion checks with escalating rhetoric. Win debates to shape policy and gain influence.

### 2. **Legacy Points**
*   Track what history will remember. Actions that benefit others build positive legacy. Selfish acts create negative legacy. Final session reveals historical judgment.

### 3. **The Immigrant's Drive**
*   Characters who are "outsiders" (immigrants, lower class, minorities) gain bonus to ambition-driven actions but face prejudice in formal settings.

### 4. **Alliance Web**
*   NPCs have shifting loyalties based on party's political positions. Supporting one faction's agenda alienates others.

### 5. **The Dual Nature**
*   Combat and debate use parallel systems—initiative in battle, initiative in cabinet meetings. Same stakes, different weapons.

### 6. **Historical Echoes**
*   At campaign end, play forward in time to see how the party's choices affected future generations. Did their nation thrive or fail?
