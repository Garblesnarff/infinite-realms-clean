### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Beneath the Watching Eye**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the totalitarian city-state of Oceanus, the Party controls every aspect of life through constant surveillance, magical thought-reading, and the rewriting of history itself. The players are members of a secret resistance cell trying to overthrow the regime while avoiding the Thought Police, navigating a world where truth is whatever the Party says it is, and even thinking rebellious thoughts can mean death.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the true history of Oceanus's founding. What government existed before the Party, and how did the Party actually come to power?
    *   Write the official Party version of history. How do these two accounts differ, and what does this reveal about the Party's methods?
    *   Describe the development of the Reality Engine. Who created it, and what magical principles allow it to alter collective memory?
    *   Explain the structure of Oceanus society: Inner Party, Outer Party, and Proles. What keeps each class in place?
    *   Detail the Thought Police's magical training and capabilities. How do they detect thoughtcrime, and what are the limits of their powers?
    *   Write the legend of Emmanuel Goldstein as the Party presents him versus who he actually might be.
    *   Describe the "war" that Oceanus is perpetually fighting. Who are the enemies, and what is the truth about this conflict?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Inner Party** (Major - Primary Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain absolute control over reality itself by controlling information, memory, and thought.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A small elite (perhaps 2% of the population) who enjoy luxury and make all decisions. Led by whoever currently holds the title "Big Brother."
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect the people from external enemies and internal disorder through benevolent guidance.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To achieve immortality of the system—creating a regime that perpetuates itself forever by making rebellion literally unthinkable.
        *   **Assets:** The Reality Engine, Thought Police, complete control of resources, magical mind-reading and compulsion, the telescreen network.
        *   **Relationships:** Oppresses the Outer Party and Proles; hunts the Brotherhood; maintains the facade of war with external enemies who may or may not exist.
    *   **The Outer Party** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Individual members want to advance to the Inner Party or at least survive without being purged.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The educated middle class (13% of population) who serve as administrators, functionaries, and enforcers. Strictly ranked.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To loyally serve the Party and maintain social order.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many harbor private doubts but suppress them through doublethink. Some secretly aid the resistance. Others inform on suspected thoughtcriminals to advance their careers.
        *   **Assets:** Education, administrative control of day-to-day governance, access to information (though heavily censored).
        *   **Relationships:** Both the victims and enforcers of the regime; the party members primarily come from this class.
    *   **The Proles** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To survive day-to-day—finding food, shelter, simple pleasures.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None. The vast majority (85% of population) who live in relative squalor but with less direct surveillance.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. The Party considers them subhuman and leaves them largely alone as long as they don't organize.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** A few remember the time before the Party. Some are beginning to organize thanks to the resistance's efforts.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers, immunity to sophisticated propaganda (because they're uneducated), physical labor skills, neighborhood knowledge.
        *   **Relationships:** Ignored by the Party as long as they remain disorganized; the resistance's potential army.
    *   **The Brotherhood** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To overthrow the Party and restore truth and freedom.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Cell structure. No member knows more than a handful of others. Unclear if Emmanuel Goldstein actually leads it.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—officially, they don't exist.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To preserve true history, spread awareness, and build toward a revolution. Deep paranoia about Party infiltration.
        *   **Assets:** Hidden archives, safe houses, sympathizers in all levels of society, forbidden knowledge.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by the Thought Police; may be partially controlled by the Party as a trap for dissidents.
    *   **The Thought Police** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To identify and eliminate thoughtcrime before it can spread.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Secret police with agents at all levels of society. Answerable only to the Inner Party.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect society from traitors and saboteurs.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To maintain a state of permanent fear where everyone suspects everyone else, making organized resistance nearly impossible.
        *   **Assets:** Magical mind-reading, network of informants, telescreen surveillance, access to Room 101, authority to arrest anyone without cause.
        *   **Relationships:** Feared by everyone; infiltrated into all other factions; some agents have begun to doubt after years of breaking innocents.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Emmanuel Goldstein:** The eternal revolutionary, possibly mythical, possibly the previous Big Brother, possibly a Party invention.
    *   **O'Brennan:** High-ranking Thought Police inquisitor, calm and intellectual, believes in the Party despite (or because of) being "corrected" in Room 101.
    *   **Julia Parsons:** Prole woman who remembers the time before the Party, becomes key to organizing the Proles, illiterate but wise.
    *   **Winston Smith:** Inner Party defector who designed parts of the Reality Engine, wracked with guilt, aids the resistance.
    *   **Big Brother:** The current holder of the title, whose face appears on every telescreen. Their true identity is secret even to most of the Inner Party.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Outer Party Functionary - Secretly Doubting"
    *   "Thought Police Mind-Reader Agent"

    *   "Inner Party Official - True Believer"
    *   "Room 101 Torturer - Creating Personalized Nightmares"
    *   "Ministry of Truth Records Clerk"

*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Victory Square:** The central plaza for Party rallies and public executions.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The massive telescreen array, Big Brother statue, the platform for Two Minutes Hate rallies, execution posts.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Shifting crowds of Outer Party members and Proles during rallies, Thought Police monitoring, Party officials.

        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The old man who was executed last week kept shouting a name that was erased from history." "There's a blind spot in the telescreen coverage near the statue's base." "During the last rally, someone in the crowd didn't chant and wasn't arrested—who are they?"
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Massive telescreens showing Big Brother's face, red Party banners, crowds in uniform clothing), Sound (The roar of orchestrated hate, marching boots, telescreen broadcasts), Smell (Sweat from packed crowds, industrial smoke, cheap victory gin).
    *   **The Ministry of Truth:** Where history is rewritten and propaganda is created.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The memory holes (chutes where documents are destroyed), the printing rooms, the forbidden archive in the deepest vault, the Reality Engine chamber.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Outer Party clerks, supervisors, Thought Police monitors, armed guards.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Access to all official records (heavily censored), ability to "update" historical documents.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A clerk has a nervous breakdown from too much doublethink, discovering a document that contradicts itself within paragraphs, witnessing a mass purging of records about a recently unpersoned individual, Reality Engine activation causes brief mass confusion, finding a clerk who subtly helps the resistance.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "There's an archive that even the Party doesn't destroy, hidden somewhere in the building." "The Reality Engine requires human sacrifices to function at full power." "One of the senior clerks is keeping a true diary in Oldspeak."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Endless corridors of filing cabinets, pneumatic tubes whooshing documents, clerks endlessly typing), Sound (Typewriters, the whoosh of memory holes, telescreen broadcasts), Smell (Paper, ink, the ozone smell from the Reality Engine when it operates).
    *   **The Ministry of Love:** Where political prisoners are broken and remade.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Room 101 (personalized fear chambers), the confession chambers, the holding cells, the reeducation theaters.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Thought Police interrogators, torturers, broken prisoners, guards.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None for most. For the Inner Party: the ultimate tool for psychological control.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Hearing a prisoner betray everyone they love, witnessing someone emerge from Room 101 as a hollow shell, a guard who shows subtle mercy, discovering the Inner Party watches the torture for entertainment, finding a prisoner who maintains their defiance even after torture.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Room 101 contains something different for each person—it's magically personalized." "Some prisoners are never meant to be released—they're kept as permanent test subjects." "There's a Thought Police officer who secretly helps prisoners prepare for interrogation."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Windowless walls, harsh interrogation lights, the featureless metal door of Room 101), Sound (Screams, the hum of machinery, the calm voices of interrogators), Smell (Fear sweat, disinfectant, the metallic smell of blood).

        *   **Key Landmarks:** The pub (where Proles drink and forget), the market (selling near-worthless goods), tenement buildings, the resistance safe house (hidden among ordinary buildings).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Prole workers, black market traders, occasional Thought Police patrols (but less frequent than in Party areas).
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Black market goods, information, hiding places, simple pleasures (alcohol, gambling, simple food).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A Prole who remembers the old days, a Party raid looking for contraband, a street fight, children playing games that echo pre-Party culture, a Thought Police informant trying to infiltrate resistance activities.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Old Julia knows songs from before the Revolution." "There's a cellar where people meet to share forbidden stories." "The Party doesn't care what the Proles do as long as they stay stupid and drunk."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Crumbling buildings, laundry hanging between buildings, less telescreen coverage, genuine human expressions), Sound (Laughter, arguments, music, life), Smell (Cooking food, garbage, humanity, less antiseptic than Party areas).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party fails to maintain their loyalty facade in Session 3.
    *   **THEN:** They are flagged for "enhanced monitoring." Thought Police begin following them constantly, making all resistance activities significantly harder and requiring new methods to evade detection.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to rescue their captured member in Session 4.
    *   **THEN:** They gain a loyal ally but the Ministry of Love increases security. If they choose to abandon them, that character returns later as a broken informant working for O'Brennan.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully organizes the Proles in Session 5.
    *   **THEN:** The Proles become a major asset in the final uprising, but the Party begins crackdowns in the Proles district, causing civilian casualties that the party must grapple with.
    *   **IF:** The party destroys the Reality Engine in Session 6.
    *   **THEN:** The Party can no longer rewrite history on a mass scale, but they're immediately identified as the culprits and become the most wanted fugitives in Oceanus. If they don't destroy it, it's used against them in the final act.
    *   **IF:** The party accepts the traitor's offer to join the Inner Party in Session 7.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an alternate ending where they live in luxury but slowly realize they've become the monsters they fought. The campaign becomes about whether they can redeem themselves from within.
    *   **IF:** A party member breaks under Room 101 in Session 11.
    *   **THEN:** That character gains the "Broken" condition—they're mechanically and roleplay compromised. However, their breaking can provide a distraction that helps others succeed. If all resist, they take severe penalties but maintain their integrity.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses authoritarian control in Session 12 rather than true freedom.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where they become benevolent dictators, but slowly start justifying the same tactics the Party used "for the greater good." Show the next generation beginning to resist them.
    *   **IF:** The party achieves true victory and establishes democratic freedom.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue showing the messy, chaotic, but genuine process of people learning to be free again, including mistakes and setbacks, but with hope.
