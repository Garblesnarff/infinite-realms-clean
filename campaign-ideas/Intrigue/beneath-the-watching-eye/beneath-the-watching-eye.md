*A Dystopian Resistance / Psychological Horror campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Beneath the Watching Eye
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dystopian Resistance / Psychological Horror / Political Thriller
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** oppressive, paranoid, gray, monitored, thoughtcrime, doublethink, desperate hope
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the totalitarian city-state of Oceanus, the Party controls every aspect of life through constant surveillance, magical thought-reading, and the rewriting of history itself. The players are members of a secret resistance cell trying to overthrow the regime while avoiding the Thought Police, navigating a world where truth is whatever the Party says it is, and even thinking rebellious thoughts can mean death. They must preserve their humanity and sanity while building a revolution in a society designed to make rebellion impossible.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Constant Surveillance:** Every action might be watched. Trust is nearly impossible. Allies could be informants or mind-controlled agents.
*   **Thought Police:** Enemies can detect hostile intent, read surface thoughts, and identify lies. Traditional deception is extremely difficult.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** The Party controls all resources. Food, healing, equipment, and safe spaces are rare and precious.
*   **Moral Complexity:** The party will face impossible choices between the greater good and personal relationships. Sacrifice is inevitable.
*   **Sanity Mechanics:** Constant oppression, mind manipulation, and witnessing atrocities can break characters psychologically.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act arc that takes the party from isolated dissidents to leaders of a revolution that will reshape reality itself.

*   **Act I — Awakening (Sessions 1–4):** The party members, seemingly loyal citizens, begin to remember the truth that the Party has suppressed. They make contact with the resistance, learning the true history of Oceanus while avoiding detection by the omnipresent Thought Police.
*   **Act II — The Ministry of Truth (Sessions 5–8):** The party infiltrates the regime's central apparatus, discovers how reality itself is being rewritten through magical manipulation of memory and records, and uncovers a horrifying secret: the Inner Party is preparing to make thoughtcrime detection automatic and inescapable.
*   **Act III — Revolution or Oblivion (Sessions 9–12):** Armed with the truth and a plan to broadcast it to the entire city, the party leads a desperate uprising. They must confront both the physical might of the regime and the psychological warfare of Room 101, where prisoners are broken by their deepest fears. The final battle is as much for minds as for territory.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Memory Holes"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party members are low-level Party functionaries who begin experiencing "glitches"—memories that don't match official records.
    *   The Anomaly: They independently discover the same discrepancy: a person the Ministry of Truth says never existed, but they all remember clearly.
    *   First Contact: A mysterious figure, Goldstein, leaves each of them a message in a place only they would look, inviting them to a meeting.

**Escalation:** A co-worker who also shows signs of remembering is arrested by the Thought Police during a routine audit.

### Session 2 — "The Brotherhood"

*   **Focus:** Alliance Building / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Meeting: The party meets in a supposedly unmonitored space (an abandoned sector). They share their experiences and realize they're not alone in their doubts.
    *   The Test: Goldstein reveals he represents the Brotherhood, the resistance. He tests their commitment with impossible questions and moral dilemmas.
    *   The Truth Archive: They're shown fragments of true history—evidence that the war the Party claims to be fighting has been over for years, and the enemy they hate never existed.

**Escalation:** Goldstein is killed moments after the meeting. His last words: "Trust no one. The Brotherhood itself may be a Party trap."

### Session 3 — "Thoughtcrime"

*   **Focus:** Stealth / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Watcher: The party realizes they're being followed by an agent of the Thought Police, a mind-reader who can detect disloyalty.
    *   The Game: They must maintain a facade of absolute loyalty while secretly communicating. They develop a code of doublethink—holding contradictory beliefs simultaneously.
    *   The Safe House: They discover a hidden resistance safe house in the Proles district, where the Party's control is weakest.

**Escalation:** One party member is summoned to the Ministry of Love for "routine questioning." The others must decide: rescue them or protect the cell?

### Session 4 — "The Ministry of Love"

*   **Focus:** Rescue / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Infiltration: The party infiltrates the dreaded Ministry of Love, where political prisoners are broken and remade.
    *   Room 101: They witness the horror of Room 101, where prisoners face their worst fears made manifest through illusion magic until they betray everything they believe.
    *   The Rescue: They free their captured member, but discover the prisoner has been partially "corrected"—their memories are now unreliable.

**Escalation:** During the escape, they steal classified documents revealing the Party's ultimate plan: a ritual to make thought-reading automatic across the entire city.

### Session 5 — "The Proles Stir"

*   **Focus:** Social / Building the Movement
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Among the Forgotten: The party goes deep into the Proles districts, where the uneducated masses live in relative freedom because the Party considers them subhuman and harmless.
    *   The Spark: They share the stolen truth with Prole leaders. Initially dismissed, but one old woman remembers the time before the Party and confirms their story.
    *   Organization: They begin training Proles in resistance tactics, discovering that the uneducated are immune to some of the Party's magical thought control because they were never taught to internalize it.

**Escalation:** A massive purge begins in the Outer Party. The Thought Police are arresting thousands based on predictive thoughtcrime models.

### Session 6 — "The Ministry of Truth"

*   **Focus:** Heist / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Heart of Lies: The party infiltrates the Ministry of Truth, where history is literally rewritten. They see workers throwing contradictory records into "memory holes" that erase them from reality.
    *   The Forbidden Archive: In the deepest vault, they find the original historical records, proving the Party came to power through a coup, not liberation.
    *   The Reality Engine: They discover the Ministry houses a massive magical device that can alter collective memory on a city-wide scale.

**Escalation:** They're discovered. They must either destroy the Reality Engine now (crippling the Party but alerting them) or escape with the evidence (leaving the weapon intact).

### Session 7 — "War is Peace"

*   **Focus:** Moral Choice / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Impossible Choice: The party learns that the "war" the city is always fighting is actually against their own outer settlements—the Party bombs its own people to maintain fear and control.
    *   The Turncoat: One of their most trusted allies is revealed to be a deep-cover Thought Police agent. The betrayal runs deeper than they imagined.
    *   The Ultimatum: The traitor offers them a deal: join the Inner Party, live in luxury, and help "guide" society, or continue to resist and be systematically destroyed.

**Escalation:** The traitor activates a beacon before dying. The Ministry of Love knows their location and is sending forces to capture them alive for "correction."

### Session 8 — "Doublethink"

*   **Focus:** Chase / Psychological Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Hunt: The party must flee through the city while Thought Police use scrying magic and mind-readers to track their mental states.
    *   The Madness: To evade detection, they must genuinely believe contradictory things—using the Party's own doublethink against them.
    *   The Breaking Point: Each character faces a moment where they must choose between their mission and their sanity. Some memories must be willingly surrendered to create believable false identities.

**Escalation:** They discover the Party's ultimate ritual is only days away. Once complete, every citizen will be permanently mind-linked to Big Brother's will.

### Session 9 — "The Broadcast"

*   **Focus:** Preparation / Building the Plan
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Plan: The party devises a desperate scheme to seize the Victory Square's massive telescreen array and broadcast the truth to the entire city during the Two Minutes Hate rally.
    *   Unlikely Allies: They recruit members from within the Outer Party, the Thought Police, and even Inner Party members who have secretly begun to doubt.
    *   The Rehearsal: They practice the plan, knowing that even with perfect execution, many won't survive.

**Escalation:** Big Brother himself (revealed to be not one person but a title for whoever controls the Inner Party) issues a proclamation: anyone harboring rebellious thoughts has 24 hours to report to the Ministry of Love for voluntary correction or be vaporized.

### Session 10 — "The Two Minutes Hate"

*   **Focus:** Heist / Social Manipulation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Rally: During the massive Two Minutes Hate rally in Victory Square, the party executes their plan, fighting through security to reach the broadcast center.
    *   The Truth Revealed: They seize control and broadcast the forbidden archive—true history, evidence of the Party's lies, and proof of the upcoming mass mind-control ritual.
    *   The Response: The city erupts into chaos. Some citizens awaken to rage. Others refuse to believe and attack the awakened. The Party's forces mobilize for total war.

**Escalation:** Big Brother himself appears on the telescreens, not denying the accusations but declaring that truth itself is whatever the Party decides, and those who cannot accept this will be unmade.

### Session 11 — "Room 101"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Personal Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Assault: The party leads the uprising in the streets, but they must also assault the Ministry of Love itself to stop the ritual.
    *   Room 101: Each party member faces a personalized Room 101 experience—their deepest fear made manifest, designed to break their will.
    *   The Ritual Chamber: They reach the heart of the Ministry where the mind-control ritual is being completed by the Inner Party's most powerful mages.

**Escalation:** To stop the ritual, one party member must sacrifice themselves, allowing their mind to be destroyed but creating a psychic shockwave that breaks the mental conditioning of everyone in the city.

### Session 12 — "Freedom is Slavery"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Bittersweet Victory
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Aftermath: The Party's central control is shattered. The city descends into confused chaos as citizens grapple with conflicting memories and newly freed minds.
    *   The Choice: The party must decide the future. Rebuild with democratic principles? Establish benevolent guidance? Or let the city determine its own fate, even if it chooses poorly?
    *   Big Brother's Last Lesson: They confront the final Big Brother, who reveals the horrifying truth: the previous Big Brother was also a rebel who won, but eventually became what he fought against because "someone must maintain order."
    *   The Ending: The party sees the telescreen network repurposed to connect minds voluntarily, helping share truth and rebuild trust. But they also see the temptation to "guide" people for their own good. The cycle threatens to begin again—will they break it?

**Epilogue:** Years later, whether they chose freedom or control, showing the consequences of their decision.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Emmanuel Goldstein** — *The Eternal Revolutionary*
    *   **Role:** Leader (or symbol) of the Brotherhood resistance.
    *   **Personality:** Passionate, eloquent, possibly more idea than person.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** May be a Party creation—a controlled opposition designed to identify dissidents. Or is he the previous Big Brother, still fighting?

2.  **O'Brennan** — *The Thought Police Inquisitor*
    *   **Role:** Primary antagonist, a high-ranking Thought Police officer.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, intellectual, genuinely believes in the Party's mission.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was once a rebel who was "corrected" in Room 101. He sometimes has moments of terrible clarity where he remembers who he was, but he crushes those thoughts immediately.

3.  **Julia Parsons** — *The Prole Prophet*
    *   **Role:** An uneducated Prole who, paradoxically, sees truth more clearly than the educated because she was never taught doublethink.
    *   **Personality:** Practical, earthy, unexpectedly wise.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She can't read, which means she's immune to written propaganda, but it also means she can't access the forbidden archive without help.

4.  **Winston Smith** — *The Inner Party Defector*
    *   **Role:** An Inner Party member who secretly aids the resistance.
    *   **Personality:** Cultured, haunted by guilt, desperate for redemption.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He helped design the Reality Engine and Room 101. His knowledge is invaluable, but can he be trusted or has he built in backdoors for the Party?

5.  **Big Brother** — *The Eternal Leader*
    *   **Role:** The face of the regime, appearing on every telescreen.
    *   **Personality:** Depends on who currently holds the title.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** "Big Brother" is not immortal but a title and role passed between Inner Party members, with memory magic making each seem like they've always existed.

## Key Locations

1.  **Victory Square:** The massive central plaza where telescreens broadcast the Two Minutes Hate and Party rallies occur.
2.  **The Ministry of Truth:** A towering pyramid where history is rewritten and records are destroyed or falsified.
3.  **The Ministry of Love:** A windowless fortress where political prisoners are broken and remade through psychological torture.
4.  **The Proles District:** The slums where the majority live in ignorance but relative freedom, beneath the Party's notice.
5.  **The Forbidden Archive:** A secret vault containing true historical records that prove the Party's lies.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is truth versus power. The Party claims that objective reality doesn't exist—that truth is whatever those in power say it is. The resistance fights to prove that truth exists independent of belief, that history cannot be erased, and that human dignity requires the freedom to think forbidden thoughts. But the Party's ultimate question haunts them: if you defeat them and take power, how will you avoid becoming them?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Thoughtcrime Detection**

*   Thought Police and magical sensors can detect hostile intent. Players must make Deception checks not just with words but with thoughts, maintaining a facade of loyalty even in their own minds. Doublethink (believing two contradictory things) grants advantage.

### 2. **Reality Instability**

*   As the party uncovers truths and the Party rewrites history, players may have conflicting memories. The DM can present alternate versions of past events and players must determine which is real through investigation and trust.

### 3. **Sanity and Loyalty Points**

*   Characters track Sanity (mental stability under oppression) and Loyalty (how convincingly they appear to support the Party). Low Sanity causes mechanical penalties and roleplay challenges. Low Loyalty attracts Thought Police attention.

### 4. **Room 101**

*   When a character is subjected to Room 101, the player secretly tells the DM their character's worst fear. The DM creates a personalized encounter. The character can resist but will take permanent psychic damage, or submit and gain a Broken condition that makes them unreliable.

### 5. **The Memory Hole**

*   When the Party erases something from history using the Reality Engine, it disappears from written records and most people's memories. Only those who witnessed it firsthand can remember, and even then, they begin to doubt themselves over time.

### 6. **Mass Combat: The Uprising**

*   In the final sessions, use simplified mass combat rules where the party's actions inspire or demoralize sections of the population, creating ripple effects across the battlefield.
