# Operation Family Deception - World-Building Specification

## The World of Berlint

**Setting**: Cold War-equivalent between Westalis (Western) and Ostania (Eastern). Magic and technology blend. 1960s aesthetic with magical enhancements.

**Berlint**: Capital city of Ostania. Divided like Berlin but both sides in same city. Checkpoints, surveillance, espionage everywhere. Beautiful European architecture hiding spy games.

**Tension**: Fragile peace after devastating war. Intelligence operations maintain balance. One wrong move could restart conflict.

## Operation Strix

**Objective**: Westalis Intelligence needs agent close to Donovan Desmond (Ostanian nationalist leader) to determine if he's planning war.

**Method**: Infiltrate Eden Academy through son Damian. Must maintain family unit for school social requirements.

**Handler**: Sylvia Sherwood (WISE director) assigns mission to best agent: Twilight.

**Complication**: Creating believable family unit harder than expected. Developing real feelings not part of plan.

**Stakes**: If mission fails, war may restart. Millions of lives depend on success.

## WISE (Westalis Intelligence Service)

**Structure**: Spy agency protecting Westalis through intelligence operations. Code names from chess (Twilight, Nightfall, etc.).

**Twilight**: Best agent, master of disguise, perfect memory, near-superhuman skills. Orphaned by war (motivation to prevent another). Cover identities: psychiatrist Loid Forger, others as needed.

**Resources**: Safe houses, equipment, support network. Can acquire needed documents, weapons, intelligence.

**Culture**: Professional, results-oriented, pragmatic. Morally grey but trying to prevent worse.

## Garden (Assassin Organization)

**Purpose**: Eliminate threats to Ostanian peace through assassination. Shadow organization, politically neutral.

**Thorn**: Elite assassin, superhuman combat abilities. Cover identity: Yor Briar/Forger, city hall clerk. Simple, kind when not killing. Raised by assassin organization after parents died.

**Method**: Poison specialist, hand-to-hand expert, near-invulnerable. Graceful and deadly.

**Shopkeeper (Handler)**: Assigns targets, provides equipment, manages assassins.

**Morality**: Kill bad people to prevent wider chaos. Questionable but sympathetic.

## Subject 007 (Anya)

**Origin**: Escaped from Project Apple, experimental program creating psychics for military use. Designation: Test Subject 007.

**Ability**: Telepathy within range. Reads surface thoughts constantly (cannot turn off). Exhausting and overwhelming.

**Cover**: Normal orphan, adoption candidate. Pretends to be ordinary child (difficult).

**Development**: Desperate for family, chooses not to expose secrets because wants them to stay together.

**Academic**: Average student, compensates with mind reading. Sports: hopeless. Social: surprisingly good.

**Character**: Loves spy anime, thinks spy work is exciting (innocent perspective), wants world peace (childlike idealism).

## Bond (Dog)

**Origin**: Also from Project Apple. Experimented on, gained precognition.

**Ability**: Sees future (usually disasters), tries to prevent them. Frustrated humans don't understand. Genuine good boy.

**Adoption**: Anya can hear his thoughts, understands ability, they rescue each other.

**Personality**: Loyal, protective, intelligent, frustrated by communication barrier.

**Comedy**: Elaborate future visions, simple prevention actions misinterpreted as dog behavior.

## Eden Academy

**Institution**: Most prestigious school in Ostania. Produces political, business, and military elite. Extremely competitive, merit-based (Stella Stars) and punishment-based (Tonitrus Bolts) system.

**8 Stella Stars**: Goal for Imperial Scholar status (access to exclusive social events where Desmond appears).

**Challenge**: Anya is average student. Must excel through effort and family support.

**Damian Desmond**: Target's son. Arrogant rich kid desperate for father's approval. Develops crush on Anya (she's oblivious). Actually lonely child.

**Social Dynamics**: Class warfare, competition, friendship, betrayal—all at elementary school level.

## Supporting Cast

**Franky Franklin**: Twilight's informant, spy equipment supplier, romantic failure. Wants what Twilight accidentally found (family). Comic relief but loyal ally.

**Yuri Briar**: Yor's younger brother, State Security officer (secret police hunting spies like Twilight). Siscon (sister complex), overprotective, genuinely dangerous. Suspects Loid but no proof.

**Fiona Frost**: Another WISE agent, in love with Twilight, wants to replace Yor. Excellent spy, terrible at human emotion. Eventually accepts Twilight's choice.

**Becky Blackbell**: Anya's best friend, wealthy shipping heiress. Romantic, encourages Anya-Damian friendship. Genuinely supportive.

**Handler (Sylvia)**: Twilight's superior. Elegant, professional, ruthless. Notices his attachment to fake family, conflicted about exploiting it.

## The Family Dynamic

**Loid's Perspective**: Started as mission requirement. Surprised by competence of "wife" and charm of "daughter." Accidentally caring. Struggling with attachment compromising professionalism.

**Yor's Perspective**: Married for cover (single woman suspicious). Surprised husband is kind, daughter is adorable. Learning to be normal person and mother. Hiding assassination work.

**Anya's Perspective**: KNOWS EVERYTHING. Sees Loid is spy, Yor is assassin, Bond is precognitive. Keeps secrets because having family is wonderful. Actively manipulates to keep them together.

**Bond's Perspective**: Sees family's future, works to protect it. Prevents disasters constantly. Good boy doing his best.

**Growth**: Fake family becoming real family through shared experiences, genuine care, and choice to stay together.

## The Secrets

**Twilight doesn't know**: Yor is assassin, Anya reads minds, Bond sees future.
**Thorn doesn't know**: Loid is spy, Anya reads minds, Bond sees future.
**Anya knows**: Everything. Keeps secrets because loves family.
**Bond knows**: Future disasters. Prevents them. Good boy.

**Eventually**: Secrets revealed progressively. Acceptance, trust, genuine family built on lies becoming genuine family built on truth.

## Mission vs. Heart

**The Conflict**: Operation Strix requires maintaining family. But family becoming real creates vulnerability. Caring makes you weak—or strong?

**Loid's Journey**: From "for the mission" to "for them." Learning to admit he cares.

**Yor's Journey**: From "for the cover" to "for my family." Learning she deserves love.

**Anya's Journey**: From desperate orphan to loved daughter. Learning to trust.

**Resolution**: Choose each other permanently. Mission matters, but family matters more.

## Threats to Family

**Exposure**: Any secret revealed could destroy family unit.
**Mission Conflict**: Orders might require betraying family.
**External Enemies**: Project Apple wants Anya back. Garden might order Yor to kill target (who turns out to be Loid?). State Security (Yuri) investigating Loid.
**Internal**: Fear of rejection if truth revealed.

**Protection**: Anya manipulates to preserve family. Eventually, parents choose family over mission. Found family becomes real family worth fighting for.

This supports wholesome spy family comedy campaign about found family, secret identities, genuine growth from fake foundation, and choosing love over duty.
