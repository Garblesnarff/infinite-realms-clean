# Operation Family Deception: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Family" is not a bloodline. It is a sentient, self-perpetuating "narrative construct," a living story of power, betrayal, and deception that has existed for centuries. Each "member" is not born into it, but is "written" into it, their life becoming a chapter in the Family's ongoing saga. "Operation Family Deception" is not a mission; it is the Family's core function, its very reason for being. It is a constant, internal struggle for narrative control, where each member tries to "re-write" the story to their own advantage, often at the expense of others. The "deception" is not just against outsiders, but against each other, and ultimately, against themselves, as they lose their true identities to the Family's narrative. The Family's "patriarch" is not a person, but the original, foundational lie, a narrative seed that has grown into a monstrous, all-consuming story.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Lie (Ancient History):** A powerful, ambitious individual tells a single, foundational lie to gain power. This lie, repeated and built upon, becomes the narrative seed of the Family.
2.  **The Birth of the Family (c. -500 years):** The narrative seed achieves sentience, becoming the "Family." Its first "members" are the descendants of the original liar, whose lives are subtly shaped by the Family's narrative.
3.  **The Age of Deception (c. -400 to -100 years):** The Family grows, its narrative consuming more and more lives. It becomes a powerful, shadowy organization, manipulating kingdoms and empires from behind the scenes.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day the Mirrors Lied (c. -100 years):** For 24 hours, all mirrors in the Family's ancestral home show not your reflection, but the reflection of the person you *pretend* to be. Many Family members go mad.
5.  **The Great Schism (c. -50 years):** A powerful Family member tries to "re-write" the Family's narrative, leading to a brutal internal conflict. The "Un-Writers" are born from this schism.
6.  **The Rise of the Patriarch (c. -20 years):** The original, foundational lie, now fully sentient, becomes the "Patriarch," the living embodiment of the Family's narrative.
7.  **Operation Family Deception (Present Day):** The Family initiates its most ambitious narrative yet: a global deception designed to re-write the history of an entire nation. The players are caught in the middle of this operation.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Lie (1 week ago):** A single, powerful lie told by a Family member echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original lie.
9.  **The Narrative Collapse (Present Day):** The Family's narrative is becoming too complex, too contradictory. It is on the verge of collapsing, threatening to unravel the very fabric of reality.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Story (1 day ago):** The entire world begins to manifest as a story. People's lives become chapters, their actions plot points. The horror of narrative control becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against a parasitic narrative. The Family is not just a powerful organization; it is a living story that consumes its members. The players are caught in this narrative, either as unwilling protagonists or as desperate attempts to "edit" the story. The horror comes from the realization that their lives are not their own, but are merely plot points in a larger, more sinister narrative. The goal is not to "win" against the Family, which is impossible, but to "escape" its narrative, to write their own story, or, perhaps, to find a way to "re-write" the Family's narrative into something benevolent. The ultimate horror is the realization that you are just a character in someone else's story.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Patriarch's Quill
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A quill made from a single, black feather. It writes in a neat, implacable, and utterly final script.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this quill to write a single, binding, magical contract. Any party who signs the contract is magically bound to uphold their end of the bargain, on pain of being "erased" from existence by the Family. The quill can also be used to "serve a summons" on any being, forcing them to appear for a negotiation.

### 2. The Blank Page's Eraser
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, white eraser that seems to absorb all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this eraser to "un-write" a single, non-magical object from existence. If used on a creature, the creature must make a CHA save or have a single, minor memory erased. **Curse:** The eraser slowly consumes the wielder's own memories. Each day the eraser is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own memory. At 5 failures, the wielder's memory is completely erased, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 3. The Red Pen of Narrative Control
**Type:** Legendary Pen
**Description:** A simple, red pen that seems to hum with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this pen to subtly "edit" the Family's narrative. They can change minor details of the past or present, alter a character's personality, or introduce a new plot point. **Curse:** The pen slowly consumes the wielder's own identity. Each day the pen is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wielder's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Red Pen.

### 4. The MacGuffin of Ultimate Power
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A strange, glowing, and intricately-carved object. It hums with a faint, alluring energy.
**Mechanics:** The MacGuffin is a pure plot device. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. But everyone *thinks* it's incredibly important, and will try to steal it from you. Its presence subtly manipulates the Family's narrative, creating new plot points and driving the story forward.

### 5. The Deus Ex Machina's Watch
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pocket watch that seems to run backwards. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this watch to subtly manipulate time. They can rewind time by a few seconds, or fast-forward it by a few seconds. Once per day, the watch can be used to perform a "Deus Ex Machina" intervention, resolving an impossible situation, but at a cost. **Curse:** The watch slowly consumes the wielder's own sense of time. Each day the watch is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose their sense of time for 1 hour.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Causality
In this world, the story dictates reality. Plot points are physical forces.
*   **Narrative Control:** Powerful Family members can subtly manipulate reality by "re-writing" the narrative. A minor edit to a document might change a historical event. A well-placed rumor might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*   **Plot Armor:** Protagonists have "plot armor." They are impossibly lucky, surviving certain death because the story demands it. This manifests as a pool of "Story Points" that can be spent to avoid damage, succeed on impossible checks, or introduce a convenient plot twist.
*   **Deus Ex Machina:** When the narrative reaches an impossible impasse, a "Deus Ex Machina" will appear, resolving the situation in a sudden, unexpected, and often absurd way. This is not always benevolent.

### Subsystems: Narrative Score and Identity Score
*   **Narrative Score:** Each player has a "Narrative Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they perform actions that are "story-worthy" (heroic deeds, dramatic betrayals, witty banter). High Narrative makes them more susceptible to the Family's narrative control, but also grants them more "plot armor."
*   **Identity Score:** Each player has an "Identity Score" (from 0 to 10). This score decreases when they lie, pretend to be someone they're not, or keep secrets. Low Identity makes them more susceptible to the Family's narrative manipulation, as they lose their sense of self. Restoring trust and being honest can increase their Identity Score.
