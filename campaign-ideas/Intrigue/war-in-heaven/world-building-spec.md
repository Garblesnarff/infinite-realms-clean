### **World-Building Specification Brief: War in Heaven**

**1. Core Concept:**
Playing as angels during the War in Heaven, the party witnesses and participates in Lucifer's rebellion, choosing between loyalty to divine authority or the cause of freedom, in a cosmic conflict that creates Hell and reshapes existence.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the hierarchy of angels and their original purpose
*   Explain the nature of Heaven before the rebellion—what was paradise like?
*   Describe Lucifer's position as the Morningstar and his relationship to the Throne
*   Write about the philosophical questions Lucifer raises—are they valid or prideful?
*   Detail the war's progression—initial skirmishes to cosmic battles
*   Explain the transformation of fallen angels into demons
*   Describe how Hell is created from the Abyss

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Heavenly Host** (Major) - Loyal angels led by Michael, defending divine order
*   **The Rebel Angels** (Major) - Lucifer and his followers, fighting for freedom
*   **The Undecided** (Minor) - Angels trying to remain neutral or find compromise
*   **The Throne's Direct Will** (Major) - Divine manifestations, ultimately unstoppable

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Lucifer, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Beelzebub, Abdiel, Uriel
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Archangel Commander," "Seraph Warrior," "Cherub Scout," "Newly Fallen Angel," "Divine Manifestation"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Throne of Light** - Center of Heaven, divine authority
*   **The Fields of Heaven** - Paradise before war
*   **The Void** - Cosmic battleground
*   **Pandemonium** - Lucifer's fortress, becomes Hell's capital
*   **The Abyss** - Where the defeated fall, transforms into Hell

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party stays loyal THEN they become part of Heaven's eternal guard but question if crushing freedom was right
*   IF party joins rebellion THEN they Fall, transform, must build civilization in Hell
*   IF party seeks compromise THEN rejected by both sides, possibly exiled to creation as watchers
*   IF party successfully persuades others THEN change the balance of power, affecting war's progression
*   The Fall of Lucifer is inevitable (this is Paradise Lost), but HOW it happens and the party's role varies
