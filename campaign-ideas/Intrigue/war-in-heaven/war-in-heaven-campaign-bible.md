# Campaign Bible: War in Heaven - The Shattered Concordance

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
## Section 1: Deep Lore & History

### Origin Myth: The Symphony and the Discord
Before the War, there was only the **Great Harmony**. Existence was not built of matter, but of Song—a single, infinite frequency emanating from the Throne that dictated the structure of reality. The angels were not merely servants; they were living notes in this chord, maintaining the physics of light and gravity through choral resonance. The Conflict began not with a sword, but with a **Counter-Melody**. Lucifer Morningstar did not simply disobey; he improvised. He introduced a jazz-like dissonance into the static perfection of the Great Harmony, arguing that beauty requires the contrast of silence and the risk of discord. The War is effectively a battle between the Sheet Music (Predestination) and the Improvisation (Free Will).

### Timeline of the Cosmos
1.  **The First Utterance:** The Throne speaks the Primal Word; the Void gains viscosity and becomes the Aether.
2.  **The Birthing of the Choirs:** The Seraphim are woven from the heat of the first stars; the Cherubim are carved from the gravity of black holes.
3.  **The Day of Mirrors:** Lucifer suggests that the Throne should see Itself. The first reflective surface is created. The Throne looks away.
4.  **The Incident of the 13th Note:** *[Weird/Rare]* An unnamed angel attempts to sing a note lower than the "Floor of Existence," accidentally creating the concept of "Below" (The Abyss).
5.  **The Drafting of Man:** The Archangels present the blueprint for Humanity. Lucifer laughs at the design's fragility; Michael weeps at its beauty.
6.  **The Great Silencing:** *[Weird/Rare]* For one microsecond, the Throne stops singing. In that silence, the angels feel the terrifying cold of true independence.
7.  **The Presentation of the Morningstar:** Lucifer is granted the Jewel of Authority. He wears it not on his brow, but swallows it, internalizing his power.
8.  **The First Argument:** Lucifer asks, "If the Throne is infinite, why is there an 'Outside'?" This question creates the metaphysical space for Rebellion.
9.  **The Schism of Light:** *[Weird/Rare]* Color splits from pure White. The Loyalists cling to Gold/White; the Rebels adopt the Prism (Chaos of Color).
10. **The Drawing of the First Sword:** Michael forges "Peacekeeper" from a hardened ray of light. The concept of "Violence" is formally introduced to the cosmos.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The universe runs on **Willpower converted to Mass**. The Loyalists believe that a singular Will (The Throne) prevents the universe from dissolving into entropy. The Rebels believe that distributed Will (Democracy of Divinity) creates a stronger, more vibrant reality. The conflict is literally tearing the laws of physics apart—gravity fails when angels doubt; stars die when Archangels weep.
