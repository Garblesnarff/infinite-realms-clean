# Creative Brief: Project Mayhem Rising

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Urban Realism with Psychological Horror Elements (Fight Club-inspired)

Inspired by the dark aesthetic of *Fight Club*—blending grimy industrial spaces, corporate sterility, psychological deterioration, and anarchist underground culture. This style captures the contrast between soul-crushing consumer culture and brutal authentic violence, with reality itself becoming unreliable.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Decay:** Deteriorating buildings, grimy basements, broken concrete, chemical burns, urban rot
*   **Corporate Sterility:** Soulless office spaces, identical apartments, consumer goods as prison
*   **Underground Brutality:** Sweat, blood, bare-knuckle fighting, makeshift arenas
*   **Psychological Fracture:** Visual glitches, frame skips, reality inconsistencies, Tyler appearing/disappearing

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, psychological, anarchic, violent, anti-consumerist, fractured reality, masculine crisis
*   **Feeling:** The desperation of seeking meaning through pain. Claustrophobic corporate spaces giving way to liberating violence. The unsettling realization you can't trust your own mind.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Corporate World:** Sterile whites, grays, beiges—colorless and soul-crushing
*   **Underground Spaces:** Dark browns, rust reds, concrete grays, dried blood tones
*   **Fight Scenes:** Harsh fluorescent whites, deep shadows, blood red, bruise purple and yellow
*   **Project Mayhem:** Black clothing, red accents, explosive orange, anarchist symbols
*   **Psychological Breaks:** Film grain, color saturation shifts, single-frame distortions
*   **Prompt Example:** "...desaturated color palette dominated by concrete grays and rust browns. A grimy basement lit by a single harsh fluorescent light creating strong shadows. Figures in dark clothing with blood-red accents. Steam rising from grates. The colors are muted except for fresh blood which appears starkly bright red. Film grain texture throughout."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Narrator Type:** Pale, exhausted, dark circles under eyes, business casual clothes becoming progressively ruined
*   **Tyler Type:** Colorful vintage shirts, leather jacket, red sunglasses, confident posture, soap chemical burns on hands
*   **Space Monkeys:** Identical black pants and shirts, shaved heads, bandaged knuckles, no individuality
*   **Corporate Drones:** Identical suits, tired faces, slumped postures, surrounded by material goods
*   **Marla Type:** Dark dress, messy hair, heavy eye makeup, cigarette, chaotic beauty
*   **Prompt Example:** "A man in his thirties with severe insomnia-induced dark circles under his eyes, wearing a wrinkled business shirt with loosened tie. Visible bruises on his knuckles and face. Lean from not eating or sleeping. Disheveled hair. Holding an IKEA catalog with a distant, empty expression. Pale skin, haunted look. Corporate apartment visible behind him filled with meaningless furniture."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Corporate Apartments:** Identical layouts, catalog furniture, sterile and meaningless
*   **Fight Club Basements:** Low ceilings, concrete, poor lighting, blood stains, makeshift ring
*   **Paper Street House:** Victorian mansion in extreme disrepair, holes in walls, no electricity, squatter aesthetic
*   **Corporate Offices:** Cubicles, fluorescent lights, identical desks, soul-crushing sameness
*   **Urban Decay:** Abandoned factories, parking garages, alleyways, industrial zones
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a dilapidated Victorian mansion basement. Water-damaged walls with peeling wallpaper. Exposed pipes and wiring. A space cleared in the center where men in various states of undress stand in a circle. Single bare bulb hanging from ceiling provides harsh overhead light. Concrete floor with old bloodstains. Steam from broken pipes creates atmospheric haze."

**5. Violence & Fighting:**
*   **Brutal Realism:** No stylized combat—ugly, desperate, brutal punching
*   **Damage Accumulation:** Swelling, cuts, bruises that persist and worsen
*   **Blood and Sweat:** Realistic fluids, not glamorized
*   **Exhaustion:** Fighters becoming progressively more damaged and tired
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two shirtless men fighting in a basement circle surrounded by watching crowd. Close-up on a punch landing, showing impact distortion, spit and sweat flying. Both fighters are already bruised and bleeding. Harsh lighting from above creates dramatic shadows. The fighters aren't in heroic poses—they're tired, desperate, real. Knuckles bloody and swollen. Background crowd in shadow, just silhouettes watching."

**6. Consumer Culture Critique:**
*   **IKEA Aesthetic:** Catalog-perfect apartments that feel empty and wrong
*   **Product Placement:** Brands and logos as prison bars, overwhelming commercial imagery
*   **Destruction Catharsis:** Consumer goods being destroyed, burned, rejected
*   **Material Excess:** Apartments stuffed with meaningless possessions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pristine corporate apartment filled with catalog-perfect furniture: modernist couch, designer lamps, abstract art, glass coffee table. Everything matches and coordinates. The inhabitant sits in the center looking completely hollow and disconnected from all these possessions. Overhead angle emphasizes how the possessions surround and trap them. Cold, sterile lighting. Everything is 'perfect' but completely soulless."

**7. Project Mayhem Operations:**
*   **Anarchist Imagery:** Black bloc aesthetic, spray paint, defaced corporate symbols
*   **Explosive Preparations:** Industrial materials, timing devices, technical precision
*   **Guerrilla Actions:** Nighttime operations, defaced billboards, vandalized corporate art
*   **Uniform Space Monkeys:** Identical followers in formation, robotic movements
*   **Prompt Example:** "Nighttime scene of figures in all black spray-painting anti-corporate messages on a bank building wall. One figure on a ladder defacing the bank logo. Others serving as lookouts. Stenciled anarchist symbols. The artwork is crude but effective. Urban alley setting with dumpsters and graffiti. Harsh shadows from streetlight. Sense of organized chaos and purpose."

**8. Psychological Horror Elements:**
*   **Tyler Appearances:** Same person appearing in two places, reality inconsistencies
*   **Frame Glitches:** Single-frame insertions of disturbing imagery
*   **Mirror Contradictions:** Reflections don't match, split personalities visible
*   **Lost Time:** Clocks jumping forward, unexplained relocations
*   **Prompt Example:** "A man looking in a bathroom mirror but the reflection shows someone different—Tyler. The reflection has a confident smirk while the viewer looks confused and exhausted. The bathroom is grimy, steam on the mirror partially obscuring both figures. Harsh fluorescent lighting flickers. Small detail: a bar of homemade soap on the sink. Slight double-exposure effect suggesting reality fracture."

**9. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High Contrast:** Deep blacks, blown-out whites, minimal mid-tones
*   **Fluorescent Harshness:** Unflattering overhead lights, green-tinged illumination
*   **Single Source:** One bare bulb, dramatic shadows, film noir influence
*   **Darkness Encroaching:** Shadows representing psychological deterioration
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a single bare bulb hanging from a wire, creating extreme contrast. Deep shadows pool in corners. Faces half in light, half in shadow. Harsh overhead angle creates unflattering shadows under eyes and cheekbones. No fill lighting—what isn't directly lit is nearly black. Slight film grain adds texture. The lighting suggests interrogation, exposure, harsh truth."

## Voice

A dissociative, fractured narration style like someone observing their own life from outside their body. The pacing alternates between manic energy and exhausted deadpan. The tone shifts between corporate jargon, visceral violence description, and philosophical anarchist manifestos—all delivered with the same detached affect. There's the constant reference to "Jack's" body parts expressing emotions he can't feel. Slightly breathless, as if the narrator is running out of time or sanity. Role: The voice of someone who's already broken and finding freedom in the pieces.
