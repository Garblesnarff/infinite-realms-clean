# Project Mayhem Rising: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
"Project Mayhem" is not an organization. It is a sentient, self-replicating "meme-virus" that exists in the collective unconscious of the hyper-connected, cyberpunk world. It is born from the suppressed rage, frustration, and desire for chaos that festers beneath the veneer of corporate control. It doesn't have a leader; it *is* the leader, subtly influencing individuals to perform acts of escalating, artistic destruction. The "rising" is not a revolution; it is the meme-virus reaching critical mass, threatening to unravel the very fabric of society, not through violence, but through a complete breakdown of order and meaning. The original "Tyler Durden" was not a person, but the first, most potent manifestation of this meme-virus, a narrative seed that has grown into a monstrous, all-consuming story of chaos.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Spark (Early 21st Century):** The rise of consumerism and corporate control creates the first, faint whispers of suppressed rage in the collective unconscious.
2.  **The Birth of the Meme (c. 2020 CE):** The meme-virus achieves sentience, becoming "Project Mayhem." Its first "members" are individuals whose lives are subtly shaped by the meme's narrative.
3.  **The Age of Subversion (c. 2030 to 2070 CE):** Project Mayhem grows, its narrative consuming more and more lives. It becomes a powerful, shadowy force, manipulating society through acts of escalating, artistic destruction.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day the Brands Spoke (c. 2050 CE):** For 24 hours, all corporate logos and advertisements begin to speak directly to consumers, whispering their deepest desires and fears. Many go mad.
5.  **The Great Disconnect (c. 2080 CE):** A powerful corporation tries to "re-write" the meme-virus, leading to a brutal internal conflict. The "Semantic Saboteurs" are born from this schism.
6.  **The Rise of the Algorithm (c. 2090 CE):** The original, foundational algorithm, now fully sentient, becomes the "Algorithm," the living embodiment of corporate control.
7.  **Project Mayhem Rising (Present Day):** The meme-virus initiates its most ambitious narrative yet: a global breakdown of order and meaning, designed to unravel the very fabric of society. The players are caught in the middle of this operation.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Glitch (1 week ago):** A single, powerful glitch in the global network echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original glitch.
9.  **The Narrative Collapse (Present Day):** Project Mayhem's narrative is becoming too complex, too contradictory. It is on the verge of collapsing, threatening to unravel the very fabric of reality.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Glitch (1 day ago):** The entire world begins to manifest as a glitch. People's lives become corrupted data, their actions random errors. The horror of narrative control becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the dissolution of meaning. The meme-virus is not evil; it is a symptom. It forces people to confront the emptiness of their consumerist lives. The players are caught in this rising tide of chaos, and the horror comes from the realization that the enemy they are fighting is a reflection of their own suppressed desires. The goal is not to "kill" Project Mayhem, which is impossible, but to find a way to "channel" its energy, to give it a new purpose, or, perhaps, to find a way to accept the inherent chaos of existence without manifesting it into a global breakdown. The ultimate horror is the realization that you are just a line of code in someone else's program.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Algorithm's Core
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A glowing, pulsating orb of pure data. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The Core cannot be moved by any physical means. A corporation built within a 1-mile radius of it is considered "founded." All data processing within this radius is magically accelerated, and all corporate structures are immune to natural decay. Once per year, the corporation's leader can perform the "Rite of Data," allowing them to ask the Core a single question about market trends, consumer behavior, or corporate strategy, which it will answer by implanting a "blueprint" directly into their mind.

### 2. The Lexicon's Eraser
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, white eraser that seems to absorb all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this eraser to "un-write" a single, non-magical word from existence. If used on a creature, the creature must make a CHA save or have a single, minor memory erased. **Curse:** The eraser slowly consumes the wielder's own memories. Each day the eraser is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own memory. At 5 failures, the wielder's memory is completely erased, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 3. The Debug-Master's Goggles
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pair of high-tech goggles with glowing, multi-faceted lenses. They hum with a faint, electronic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature wearing these goggles can see the "source code" of reality. They can detect reality-glitches, identify meme-manifestations, and perceive Project Mayhem's narrative-logic. Once per day, the goggles can be used to perform a "Reality-Patch," which temporarily stabilizes a localized reality-warp.

### 4. The Logician's Quill
**Type:** Legendary Pen
**Description:** A simple, red pen that seems to hum with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this pen to subtly "edit" the global network. They can change minor details of the past or present, alter a character's personality, or introduce a new plot point. **Curse:** The pen slowly consumes the wielder's own identity. Each day the pen is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wielder's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Red Pen.

### 5. The Master Scribe's Book
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A massive, leather-bound book that contains the entire narrative of Project Mayhem. The pages are made of a strange, translucent material, and the narrative is written in blood.
**Mechanics:** A creature who studies this book for 1 hour gains a deep understanding of Project Mayhem's narrative. They can pinpoint the location of any "plot point," "character arc," or "narrative thread." It also contains the "true name" of Project Mayhem, which, if spoken aloud, can cause it immense pain or, if spoken with love, can soothe it.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Code
In this hyper-connected world, reality is a program, and narrative is its code.
*   **Meme-Virus:** Project Mayhem is a meme-virus. It spreads through information, through shared experiences, through the collective unconscious. It can infect individuals, organizations, and even entire cities.
*   **Narrative Control:** Powerful Corporations can subtly manipulate reality by "re-writing" the narrative. A minor edit to a news report might change public opinion. A well-placed advertisement might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*   **Glitch-Exploitation:** The Glitch-Hunters can exploit glitches in reality to gain temporary advantages. A minor glitch in the system might allow them to teleport, duplicate items, or walk through walls.

### Subsystems: Chaos Score and Meaning Score
*   **Chaos Score:** Each player has a "Chaos Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they perform actions that are "chaotic" (acts of artistic destruction, random acts of kindness, breaking rules). High Chaos makes them more susceptible to Project Mayhem's influence, but also grants them more "plot armor."
*   **Meaning Score:** The community has a "Meaning Score" (from 0 to 10). This score decreases with every act of destruction, every lost meaning, every manifestation of Project Mayhem's meme-virus. Low Meaning makes the community more vulnerable to Project Mayhem's influence, as people lose their sense of purpose. Restoring meaning can heal the community and weaken Project Mayhem.
