# Campaign Bible: The Eternal Feast

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
## 1. Deep Lore & History

### Origin Myth: The Great Simmer
Before the dimensions solidified, reality was a raw, boiling soup of potential energy known as the **Protomatter Broth**. It was chaotic, flavorless, and unformed. The entity known as **The First Palate** (an abstract cosmic concept of "Taste") realized that without separation, nothing could be savored. It created the **Great Simmer**, a metaphysical reduction process that separated the Broth into distinct flavors: The Spicy (Fire), The Crisp (Ice), The Bitter (Shadow), and The Umami (Prime Material). However, the leftovers of this process—the dregs at the bottom of the pot—became **The Hunger**, a void that seeks to re-absorb all flavors back into bland nothingness. The Eternal Feast was built not just as a restaurant, but as the "Lid" on the pot, keeping the steam of creation from evaporating and the Hunger from boiling over.

### Timeline of the Feast
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Mise en Place):** Eternal Chef Sazón discovers the "Zero Point" between dimensions and lays the foundation stone: a fossilized egg of a Time-Dragon.
2.  **-8,500 Y (The First Burn):** The Fire Dimension attempts to annex the Kitchen. Sazón wins the "Duel of the Jalapeño," eating a pepper so hot it burned the concept of aggression out of the Fire Lord.
3.  **-6,000 Y (The Sour Era):** A lemon from the Chaos Dimension rolls under the fridge. Its decomposition causes a localized reality rot that turns all spoken words into vinegar for a century.
4.  **-4,200 Y (The Silent Service):** The staff goes on strike. The Hunger rises 15%. The strike ends when the Universe agrees to invent "Tips."
5.  **-2,000 Y (The Great Review):** A celestial food critic gives the restaurant 3/5 stars. The resulting depression causes the Ice Dimension to expand, freezing the salad bar for 500 years.
6.  **-900 Y (The Spork Incident):** An artificer attempts to introduce the "Spork" to the dining room. The insulted geometry of the Order Dimension declares war. The Spork is banned.
7.  **-300 Y (The Day of Floating Soup):** Gravity reverses in the dining room due to a hiccup in the Dream Dimension. Soup is served on the ceiling. It becomes a tradition on Tuesdays.
8.  **-50 Y (The Missing Salt):** Sazón leaves to find the "True Salt." He never returns. The Seal begins to degrade.
9.  **-10 Y (The Rancid Decade):** Food quality dips. Minor breaches of the Hunger manifest as "Shadow Roaches" in the pantry.
10. **0 Y (Present Day):** The new staff (The Party) is hired. The menu begins to glow with ominous phosphorescence.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The Hunger is not evil; it is **entropic blandness**. It wants to turn the vibrant, distinct dimensions into a grey, flavorless nutrient paste. The Restaurant maintains the **flavor profiles** of reality. If the food is good, reality stays crisp and distinct. If the food is bad, reality becomes mushy.
