# The Eternal Feast - World-Building Specification

## The Restaurant's True Nature

### Foundation and Purpose
- Created 10,000 years ago by Eternal Chef Sazón
- Built at convergence point of all dimensions
- Original purpose: Neutral meeting ground
- Hidden purpose: Seal on the Hunger Between Worlds
- Operates continuously across all time zones

### How It Works
- Exists in pocket dimension
- Doors appear in every reality
- Only those who "need" it can find doors
- Need = hunger (physical, spiritual, emotional)
- Self-sustaining through customer satisfaction
- Powered by joy of good meal

### The Staff Legacy
- Ownership passes through mysterious selection
- Staff are chosen, not hired randomly
- Each brings specific skill needed for current era
- Previous staff ascended, died, or disappeared
- Current party: Selected for final test

### The Seal Mechanics
- Restaurant's existence maintains dimensional barriers
- Satisfied customers strengthen seal
- Disappointed customers weaken it
- Perfect meals add years to seal
- Restaurant closing would be catastrophic
