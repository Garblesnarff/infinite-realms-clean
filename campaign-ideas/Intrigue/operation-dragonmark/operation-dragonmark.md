# Operation Dragonmark
## *"Licensed to Cast"*

### Campaign Overview

In the glittering capitals of the Five Kingdoms, a shadow war rages between rival intelligence agencies wielding magic, steel, and cunning. The players are elite operatives of the Dragonmarked Bureau—a clandestine organization that protects the realm from magical terrorism, arcane arms dealers, and rogue wizards bent on world domination. Each agent bears a mystical dragonmark, granting them unique supernatural abilities and clearance to operate beyond the law.

When a mad artificer known only as "Goldclaw" steals the Apocalypse Grimoire—a spellbook capable of summoning ancient dragons to do the wielder's bidding—the Bureau activates its best team. From the casino-temples of Monte Celestia to the frozen spy nests of the Shadowfell, the agents must infiltrate enemy strongholds, seduce dangerous contacts, survive explosive chases through planar portals, and stop Goldclaw's countdown to draconic armageddon. But as they peel back layers of the conspiracy, they discover traitors within their own agency and a plot that goes far deeper than one madman's scheme.

This is a high-octane campaign of tuxedos and transformations, martinis and magic missiles, where every mission could be your last and trust is the rarest commodity of all.

### Plot Twists and Complications

**The First Betrayal**: Agent thought to be loyal is actually Goldclaw's inside agent; occurs just after players trust them completely.

**M's Dark Past**: Director Morgantha was the one who originally hired Goldclaw before he went rogue; she's been trying to fix her mistake for decades.

**The Real Goldclaw**: The man they've been chasing is actually the third person to assume the Goldclaw identity; it's a title passed down through a conspiracy.

**The Apocalypse Grimoire's Truth**: The book doesn't summon dragons—it allows the user to BECOME an ancient dragon permanently, but at the cost of their humanity.

**Dragonmark Curse**: The Dragonmarks are actually fragments of an ancient dragon's soul; using them too much means the dragon slowly reforms using the agents as vessels.

**The Bureau's Foundation**: The organization was originally founded by dragons to keep humans from becoming too powerful; recent directors have subverted this purpose.

**Ally Revealed**: Dmitri the Ghost has been protecting the players all along, sabotaging enemy operations behind the scenes.

**Ultimate Sacrifice**: Stopping Goldclaw's final plan requires one agent to absorb all the Dragonmarks, becoming something no longer quite human.

**The Minister's Choice**: When finally confronted, the Minister chooses to redeem himself, revealing crucial intelligence before sacrificing himself.

**Vesper's Truth**: She's actually from a timeline where Goldclaw succeeded; she's been manipulating events to prevent that future.

**008's Redemption**: Agent Sterling appears to betray the party but is actually running a deep infiltration to expose the real conspiracy.

**The Cycle Continues**: Even if Goldclaw is defeated, someone else (possibly someone close to the players) takes up the mantle.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Stop the summoning/transformation ritual and prevent the dragon apocalypse; capture or eliminate Goldclaw; secure or destroy the Apocalypse Grimoire.

**Secondary Victory**: Expose the conspiracy within the government; purge traitors from the Bureau; preserve the organization's integrity and mission.

**Personal Victory**: Each player character resolves their personal arc (revenge, redemption, romance, identity, etc.); find balance between duty and humanity.

**Perfect Victory**: Achieve all of the above while maintaining your cover identities; minimize civilian casualties; keep the shadow war secret from the general public; reform the Bureau's mission to be truly independent.

**Legendary Victory**: Turn Goldclaw into an asset or ally by addressing his core trauma; reveal and reform the dragon conspiracy running both sides; unite rival spy agencies against a greater threat; players become the new directors of a reformed Bureau.

### Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic Defeat**: Goldclaw completes the ritual and transforms into an ancient dragon or summons multiple ancient dragons; the realm falls under draconic rule; the Bureau is destroyed.

**Major Defeat**: The conspiracy succeeds in overthrowing the government; players are killed, captured, or turned; the Apocalypse Grimoire falls into worse hands; dragons enslave or destroy major population centers.

**Partial Defeat**: The Bureau is disbanded and agents are disavowed permanently; too many innocents die due to player actions; personal relationships are destroyed beyond repair; players become the very thing they fought against.

**Moral Defeat**: Victory is achieved but at such a cost that it wasn't worth it; players lose their humanity in the pursuit of victory; the methods used make the players no better than the villains.

### Campaign Tone

This campaign should feel like a James Bond film set in D&D—glamorous locations, high-stakes action, gadgets disguised as magic items, martini-sipping sophistication mixed with brutal violence. Embrace the over-the-top nature while maintaining real stakes and consequences. Every session should have at least one "Bond moment"—a signature scene of impossible action, devastating quip, or shocking reveal. Balance the spectacle with genuine emotional beats and moral complexity. The villains should be charismatic and somewhat understandable, not pure evil. Romance, betrayal, and sacrifice should all feature prominently. Most importantly, make the players feel like the most dangerous, capable, and stylish heroes in the realm.
