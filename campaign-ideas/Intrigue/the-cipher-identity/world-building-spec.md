# The Cipher Identity - World-Building Specification

## The Chimera Protocol

**Origin**: Created 30 years ago by intelligence coalition to have assets in every organization. Sleeper agents implanted with false identities, activated when needed.

**Process**:
- Select candidates with specific skills
- Erase original memories
- Implant cover identity and backstory
- Place in target organization
- Live naturally until activation code spoken
- Post-activation: Complete mission, self-terminate memory of event

**Scale**: 200+ sleeper agents across realm in governments, militaries, criminal organizations, merchant guilds, even adventuring parties.

**Players' Role**: Were investigating Chimera, got too close, were wiped as compromise solution instead of kill (handler protected them).

## Memory Fragment Categories

**Combat Training**: Martial skills, tactical thinking, weapons expertise
**Languages**: Speak multiple languages without knowing why
**Locations**: Know places they've never consciously visited
**People**: Faces without names, names without faces
**Emotions**: Feelings divorced from context (love, guilt, rage)
**Skills**: Professional abilities (lockpicking, disguise, forgery)
**The Mission**: Fragmented objective that drove everything

## The List (Dead Agents)

1. **Wraith** - Assassinated in sleep, never knew danger
2. **Specter** - Killed during extraction attempt
3. **Shadow** - Suicide (recovered memories too much)
4. **Ghost** - Missing, presumed terminated
5. **Phantom** - [THE CIPHER] Survived, found players
6-8. **The Players** - Marked for termination

All were former Chimera investigators, all had memories wiped, all hunted.

## Intelligence Factions

**The Obsidian Directorate**: Black ops group, created Chimera, want loose ends eliminated
**The Sterling Agency**: Legitimate intelligence, investigating Chimera, see players as assets to flip
**The Grey Council**: International oversight, want Chimera exposed and dismantled
**The Architect's Network**: Temporal agents trying to prevent disaster timeline

## Key Locations Detail

**Safehouse Network**: 15 locations players don't remember establishing, each with supplies, weapons, intel caches, and memory triggers.

**The Memory Archive**: Former temple converted to intelligence facility. Contains psychic imprints of interrogations, mission records on crystal storage, heavily guarded by mind-reading wardens.

**Mendoza's Clinic**: Exists in permanent demiplane, accessed through shifting portal. Contains memory theater (relive memories), personality backup chambers, and storage of erased identities.

**Chimera Facility**: Abandoned arcane-tech complex in remote mountains. Original programming chambers still functional, records of all subjects, and The Architect's original workshop.

## The Architect's Identity

**True Nature**: Is the player character from a failed timeline where they didn't investigate Chimera, resulting in catastrophic activation that killed millions.

**Method**: Used recovered time magic to travel back, became The Architect, created Chimera Protocol as controlled version to prevent worse alternative.

**Paradox**: If players stop Architect, they create timeline where Architect returns to stop them—infinite loop.

**Resolution Options**:
- Kill Architect (creates loop)
- Believe Architect (prevents worse future)
- Find third option (dismantle Chimera without catastrophe)
- Become Architect (time loop completion)

## Memory Restoration Consequences

**Partial Recovery** (Safe): Regain skills and general history, no traumatic specifics
**Medium Recovery** (Risky): Remember missions and relationships, face moral complications
**Full Recovery** (Dangerous): Everything returns including trauma, PTSD, programmed triggers
**Over-Recovery** (Catastrophic): Remember things that never happened, personality fracture

## Additional Lore

**Memory Magic Ethics**: Society debates use of memory modification. Some healing applications accepted, but weaponized memory alteration is war crime.

**Identity Philosophy**: Religious and philosophical movements centered on whether mind or soul defines person. Memory loss creates theological crisis.

**The Forgotten**: Support group for those who've lost memories to magic, combat trauma, or forced erasure. Players can find community here.

**Assassination Tradecraft**: Elite assassins use specific techniques visible in players' unconscious habits—tells that reveal past to those who know.

This supports campaign focused on identity, paranoia, and moral complexity of memory and choice.
