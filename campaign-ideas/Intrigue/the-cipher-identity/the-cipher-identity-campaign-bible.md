# Campaign Bible: The Cipher Identity

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The God of Secrets
In the dawn of time, when the first lie was told, a new god was born: **Cipher**, the god of secrets, codes, and hidden things. Cipher did not want worship; it wanted currency. It created a metaphysical system known as the **Mnemonic Echo**, a plane of existence where memories, identities, and personalities could be stored, copied, and traded like commodities. The city of Veridia was built on a "thin spot" over this plane, allowing certain individuals to access it. The "Cipher Protocol" is not a technology; it is a form of high magic, a ritual that allows a mortal to bargain with the Mnemonic Echo. The Agency is not a government body; it is the church of Cipher, and its agents are its unwilling clergy, their identities offered up as tithes.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-5000 Y (The First Lie):** A mortal tells the first lie, creating the concept of a "secret" and giving birth to the god Cipher.
2.  **-3000 Y (The Founding of Veridia):** The city of Veridia is founded on a Mnemonic Thin-Spot. Citizens report strange cases of amnesia and deja vu.
3.  **-1200 Y (The First Agent):** A cabal of wizards makes first contact with Cipher and develops the rituals to access the Mnemonic Echo. They form "The Agency" to hoard this power.
4.  **-700 Y (The Identity Wars):** Rival factions within the Agency learn to steal and overwrite identities, leading to a century of silent, paranoid conflict where no one was sure if their allies (or even they themselves) were who they claimed to be.
5.  **-400 Y (The Great Lock):** The Agency develops the "Master Key" and "Firewall" protocols, securing the Mnemonic Echo and establishing their absolute control.
6.  **-100 Y (The Day of a Thousand Faces):** A surreal event where every citizen of Veridia wore a different face for 24 hours, a side effect of a botched Agency experiment.
7.  **-20 Y (The Rogue Echo):** The first agent, known only as "Echo," successfully breaks his conditioning and escapes the Agency, becoming a ghost in the system.
8.  **-5 Y (The Corruption):** The Mnemonic Echo begins to show signs of instability. Memories are degrading, identities are blending, and "data wraiths" are spawning.
9.  **-1 Month (The Blank Slate Protocol):** The Agency, fearing a total system collapse, initiates a desperate plan to "reboot" a section of the Echo, wiping dozens of agents, including the party.
10. **Present Day:** The party awakens in a compromised safe house with no memory, a dead body, and a mission from a handler they don't know.

### The "Why": The Soul as Data
The central conflict explores the nature of self: is a person defined by their memories and experiences, or is there an inherent soul? The Mnemonic Echo is failing, and identities are becoming corrupted data. The party is fighting not just a conspiracy, but the **metaphysical decay of personhood**. If the Echo collapses, it won't just destroy the Agency; it will erase the very concept of "self" from the world, turning all sentient beings into blank, programmable slates. The party must discover who they were in order to decide who they want to become.

## 6. ITEM DATABASE
[TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]

### Artifacts of the Echo
1.  **The Master Key:** A crystalline key that can "unlock" any identity, revealing the subject's original, core self. It can also be used to permanently overwrite an identity with a new one.

3.  **The Shard of Cipher:** A piece of the god's own being. Allows the user to ask one question and receive a perfectly true, but dangerously cryptic, answer once per week. Also makes the user impossible to scry upon.
4.  **The Un-Writer:** A device that doesn't destroy things, but erases them from memory and history. Using it on a person means no one, not even the user, will remember they ever existed.
5.  **The Ghost-Stream Drive:** A USB drive that allows the user to enter the Mnemonic Echo physically, without the need for a terminal. It also allows them to navigate the hidden "backdoors" of the system.

7.  **The White Noise Machine:** A small device that, when activated, makes it impossible for anyone in a 10-foot radius to form a coherent thought.
8.  **The Forget-Me-Not:** A small, wilted flower. As long as you hold it, you are physically incapable of lying.
9.  **The Dial-Up Modem of Divination:** A modem that can be used to "dial into" the Mnemonic Echo. It's very slow and makes a horrible screeching noise, but it can retrieve one small, corrupted piece of data.
10. **The Burner Phone to Nowhere:** A phone that can only call numbers that don't exist. Sometimes, someone answers.
11. **The Glitched Sunglasses:** Sunglasses that make the world look like a corrupted video file. Grants advantage on checks to spot magical illusions.

16. **The Emergency Moustache:** A fake moustache that, when worn, makes you completely unrecognizable to your immediate superiors.
17. **The Red Herring:** A literal, rotting red herring. Waving it around in an investigation will cause everyone to focus on a completely irrelevant clue.
18. **The Inconvenient Truth Serum:** A potion that makes someone tell the truth, but only about things that are socially awkward and unhelpful.
19. **The Placeholder:** A small, grey cube with the word "ITEM" on it. It can be used as any one mundane, non-magical item, but only once.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Identity & Flashbacks
*   **Cover Identity:** Each player starts with a "Cover Identity" sheet with basic skills. They do not know their true class or abilities.
*   **Flashbacks:** At moments of high stress or when encountering a trigger (a specific name, place, or object), the GM can grant a player a "Flashback." The player describes a brief, fragmented memory of their past life.
*   **Unlocking Abilities:** After a Flashback, the player "remembers" a class feature, spell, or skill from their "True Identity" sheet. This is how they level up and regain their power, piece by piece. The GM controls the flow of these unlocks to pace the campaign.

### Subsystem: The Cipher Deck
*   **The Deck:** The GM has a deck of cards. Each card has a single, cryptic word on it (e.g., "Umbrella," "Porcelain," "Train," "Seven").
*   **Triggers:** At the start of a session, the GM draws three cards. These are the "trigger words" for the session.
*   **Activation:** When a player unknowingly says a trigger word in conversation, their character is hit with a wave of psychic static from the Mnemonic Echo. This might cause a Flashback, a temporary debuff, or attract the attention of a Data-Wraith. This makes conversation tense and unpredictable.
