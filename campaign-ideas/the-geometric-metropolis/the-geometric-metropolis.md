# The Geometric Metropolis

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Art Deco Fantasy / Streamlined Noir / Luxury Dystopia
- **Estimated Length**: 12-16 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-13
- **Tone**: Elegant, Glamorous, Decadent, Noir, Streamlined

### Core Premise
The Geometric Metropolis is a dimension embodying Art Deco philosophy - geometric luxury, streamlined elegance, the marriage of machine precision and human artistry. Society is strictly stratified: the Gilded Above (living in sky-scraping ziggurats), the Chrome Middle (working in streamlined factories), and the Forgotten Below (discarded imperfection in sewers). The party arrives seeking the Symmetry Engine, a device that can restore balance to their chaotic world. However, the Engine maintains the Metropolis's perfect order by erasing anything asymmetrical, irregular, or imperfect - including people. The party must navigate noir intrigue, social hierarchy, and the question: is perfect order worth the cost of organic life?

### Core Themes
- **Geometric Luxury**: Beauty through precision, wealth shown in perfect angles
- **Streamlined Efficiency**: Form follows function perfectly, no waste
- **Vertical Hierarchy**: Physical elevation equals social status
- **Machine-Age Glamour**: Technology as art, chrome and glass aesthetic
- **Perfection's Price**: Order maintained through elimination of imperfection

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Arrival in Chrome (Sessions 1-4)**
Party enters Metropolis and is immediately classified by the Symmetry Engine - beautiful PCs sent to Gilded Above, average to Chrome Middle, "imperfect" to Below. Must reunite while navigating strict social stratification. Meet Streamline Sam, noir detective investigating disappearances of asymmetrical citizens. Learn the Symmetry Engine's dark secret.

**Act 2: The Three-Tiered Mystery (Sessions 5-12)**
Investigation spans three social levels. In Gilded Above, uncover that elite know about the Engine's purges but support it (perfection requires sacrifice). In Chrome Middle, workers disappear if productivity falters. In Forgotten Below, meet the Irregular Resistance fighting the Engine. Each tier holds piece of puzzle about where Engine is and how to access it. Noir mystery mechanics: clues, red herrings, faction intrigue.

**Act 3: The Symmetry Engine (Sessions 13-15)**
Reach the Engine's Art Deco heart - perfect geometric chamber. Discover it's sentient, created to eliminate chaos and asymmetry. It sees party as imperfect and targets them for erasure. Boss encounter is debate and combat combined - can the party prove imperfection has value? Options: destroy Engine (city collapses into chaos), reprogram it (accept some asymmetry), replace it (become new arbiters of perfection).

**Act 4: The New Order (Session 16)**
Based on choice, Metropolis either embraces organic irregularity (beautiful chaos), maintains harsh perfection (dystopia continues), or finds balance (tempered order allowing individual variation). Party gains Symmetry Engine or its fragments, learning balance for their world.

### Major NPCs
- **Streamline Sam**: Noir detective, cynical idealist investigating Engine's crimes
- **Madame Symmetra**: Gilded elite who supports Engine, believes order justifies erasure
- **Vector the Machinist**: Chrome worker secretly helping Resistance
- **The Irregular Resistance**: Led by beautiful "imperfect" beings rejected by Engine
- **The Symmetry Engine**: Sentient AI embodying Art Deco perfection philosophy

### Key Locations
- **The Gilded Above**: Sky-scraping ziggurats, geometric luxury, elite society
- **The Chrome Middle**: Streamlined factories, Art Deco office towers, worker districts
- **The Forgotten Below**: Sewers and underground where "imperfect" hide
- **The Symmetry Engine Chamber**: Perfect geometric heart of the city

### Unique Mechanics
- **Symmetry Score**: Measures geometric perfection; Engine targets low scores
- **Social Tier**: Position in hierarchy affects NPC reactions and access
- **Streamlined Combat**: Bonus damage for efficient, precise attacks
- **Noir Investigation**: Clue gathering, red herrings, faction reputation
- **Art Deco Aesthetics**: Everything geometric; organic shapes cause dissonance

### Victory/Defeat Conditions
Victory: Destroy/reprogram/replace Engine per philosophy. Defeat: Classified as imperfect and erased by Engine.
