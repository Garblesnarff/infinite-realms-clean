### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Immortal Prisoner**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party is a sentient cellular mass that inhabits dead bodies, trapped on a plague island in a roguelike loop of death and resurrection. Each run explores procedurally-arranged biomes filled with infected creatures and elite guards. Permanent upgrades persist between deaths. Through countless cycles, they discover they were created from the King's cells as a potential cure or successor. Three endings await: take the throne, escape, or destroy the source.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the kingdom's golden age before the Malaise plague arrived.
    *   Write the history of how the King tried and failed to contain the infection.
    *   Describe the Alchemist's experiments creating the Prisoner from the King's cells.
    *   Explain the Malaise—sentient plague that corrupts living things into violent infected.
    *   Detail the King's decision to imprison himself to prevent plague spread.
    *   Describe the island's transformation from kingdom to nightmare.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Infected** (Major): Corrupted guards, citizens, and creatures serving as enemies.
    *   **The Prisoner Collective** (Minor): Multiple cell masses in tubes, experiments like the party.
    *   **The Survivors** (Minor): NPCs like Collector, Blacksmith, Gardener who persist somehow.
    *   **The Elite Guards** (Major): Golden enemies who retain intelligence despite infection.
    *   **The Royal Loyalists** (Minor): Hand of the King and those still serving their imprisoned ruler.

*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Infected Guard," "Elite Warrior," "Plague Zombie," "Experimental Subject," "Gardener" (mutation giver).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Prisoners' Quarters:** Starting point, sewers with experimentation tubes.
*   **Promenade of the Condemned:** Ruined town with infected citizens.
*   **Ramparts:** Castle walls with archers and elite patrols.
*   **Ossuary:** Underground crypts with undead.
*   **Stilt Village:** Platforms over poison lake.

*   **High Peak Castle:** Elite stronghold before throne.
*   **Throne Room:** King's chamber, multiple endings.
*   **The Source:** Hidden beneath throne, Malaise origin.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party dies → **THEN:** Returns to starting point, loses Cells and items, knowledge persists.
*   **IF:** Boss defeated → **THEN:** New biome access unlocked, Boss Cell obtained (if applicable).
*   **IF:** Permanent upgrade purchased → **THEN:** All future runs benefit from enhancement.
*   **IF:** Blueprint found → **THEN:** New weapon/mutation unlocked for future runs.
*   **IF:** All Boss Cells used → **THEN:** Maximum difficulty active, true ending accessible.
*   **IF:** Final boss defeated → **THEN:** One of three endings triggers based on path chosen.

**7. Roguelike Progression**
*   Runs are disposable but meaningful—each teaches and progresses meta-game.
*   Procedural generation ensures variety despite repeated zones.
*   Difficulty scaling through Boss Cells creates long-term goals.
*   Build variety (Brutality/Tactics/Survival) encourages experimentation.
*   No two runs are identical in challenge despite familiar structure.

**8. Body Horror Philosophy**
*   Identity questions: Are you the cells or the body? Both? Neither?
*   Immortality through body-hopping is grotesque but practical.
*   Mutations make you powerful but less human (or more-than-human).
*   The King's guilt: he created you and trapped you in the cycle.
*   Breaking free means accepting death—true freedom is mortality regained.
