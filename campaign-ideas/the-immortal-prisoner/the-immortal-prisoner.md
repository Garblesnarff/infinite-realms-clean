*A Roguelike Metroidvania / Permadeath campaign — Medium Campaign (15-20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Immortal Prisoner
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Roguelike Metroidvania / Body-Hopping Horror / Escape Quest
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **13-15**
**Tone (keywords):** brutal, experimental, permadeath, body-horror, mysterious island, progress through failure, grotesque
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party awakens as a sentient mass of cells—an immortal parasite that can inhabit and reanimate dead bodies. Trapped on a plague-cursed island dominated by a sprawling, ever-changing castle, they must fight through hordes of corrupted creatures and deadly biomes to reach the source of the infection. Each death forces them to start over from the prison sewers, but knowledge and permanent upgrades persist between runs. Through countless deaths and resurrections, they piece together the mystery of the island, the plague, and their own cursed existence.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A repeating loop structure where each "run" explores further until the truth is revealed.

*   **Act I — The First Runs (Sessions 1-7):** The Prisoner awakens in the sewers with no memory, only instinct to escape. Early runs establish the pattern: possess a body, fight through procedurally-arranged areas, die, respawn, try again. The party begins mapping the island: Promenade, Ramparts, Ossuary, Ancient Sewers, Toxic Sewers. Each area has elite guards and a boss preventing progression. Permanent upgrades are discovered that persist between deaths. Fragments of lore reveal the island was once a kingdom, now consumed by something called the Malaise. The King disappeared. Someone is maintaining the infection deliberately.
*   **Act II — Breaking Through (Sessions 8-14):** The party reaches new biomes: Stilt Village, Clock Tower, Forgotten Sepulcher, Caverns. Boss battles become more challenging and reveal more story. They discover the Alchemist—experimenting on prisoners to stop the plague, but the experiments created them. The Collector NPC provides lore: the King tried to seal the plague but failed. The party learns they're not escaping—they're fighting toward the source. Permanent mutations unlock powerful abilities. NPCs repeat dialogue—they're stuck too, or don't notice the loops.
*   **Act III — The Truth at Hand (Sessions 15-20):** The party finally reaches the High Peak Castle and confronts the Hand of the King—the final guardian. Beyond lies the Throne Room where the King sits, infected and immortal, maintaining the plague to prevent it from spreading beyond the island. The horrible truth: the Prisoner is made from the King's own cells—they ARE the King's failed attempt at salvation. Three endings available: Kill the King and take the throne (continue the cycle), Escape and let the plague spread, or Find the true source beneath the castle and destroy it (true ending, requires finding all lore). Each ending has consequences for the island and the world beyond.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of immortality as curse, progress through failure, body horror and identity, sacrifice for the greater good, and breaking cycles. It asks: Is immortality worth the cost? What do you become after endless deaths? Can you find meaning in repetition? The central conflict is escaping not just the island but the cycle of death and rebirth.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Permadeath and Runs**
*   Each death returns party to starting point with nothing
*   Runs are self-contained adventures—start weak, grow powerful, die, repeat
*   Knowledge persists: enemy patterns, map layout (randomized but recognizable), boss strategies
*   No mechanical penalty—death is expected and part of progression
*   Meta-progression through permanent upgrades

### 2. **Cells Currency**
*   Enemies drop Cells—glowing currency
*   Cells lost on death unless spent at Collector between levels
*   Permanent upgrades: health flask refills, starting gold, stat bonuses, gear unlocks
*   Risk/reward: Push further to collect more Cells or bank early to ensure progress
*   Higher difficulty tiers (activated through Boss Cells) grant more Cells

### 3. **Procedural Level Generation**
*   Same zones but different layouts each run
*   Rewards exploration—secret rooms contain blueprints and power scrolls
*   Enemy placement varies, forcing adaptation
*   Multiple paths through island (choose branching routes)
*   Reduces repetition despite running same zones multiple times

### 4. **Brutality/Tactics/Survival Build Paths**
*   Three stat paths that affect weapons and playstyle
*   Brutality: High damage melee, glass cannon builds
*   Tactics: Ranged weapons, traps, turrets, strategic play
*   Survival: Tanky, shields, health regeneration
*   Power scrolls in levels boost chosen stat
*   Weapons scale with stats—encourages specialization

### 5. **Mutation System**
*   Unlock mutations (passive abilities) via blueprint discovery
*   Choose 3 mutations per run from unlocked pool
*   Examples: "Deal bonus damage to enemies on fire," "Don't lose gold on hit," "Life leech from kills"
*   Strategic selection based on build and upcoming challenges
*   Can respec mutations at rest points

### 6. **Boss Cells & Difficulty Tiers**
*   Defeating final boss at any tier grants a Boss Cell
*   Use Boss Cells to increase difficulty (up to 5)
*   Higher difficulty: tougher enemies, better rewards, new affixes, more lore
*   Each tier adds new challenges: cursed chest mechanics, Malaise infection meter, timed doors
*   Encourages repeated playthroughs to see all content

### 7. **Body Horror Mechanics**
*   Prisoner is a mass of cells—abilities reflect this: rapid healing, mutation adaptation
*   Can absorb enemy abilities temporarily
*   Visual transformation as mutations accumulate
*   Existential questions: Are you the body or the cells? Who were you before?

### 8. **Timed Doors & Risk Management**
*   Some doors require reaching within time limit for rewards
*   Encourages speed over exploration
*   Missing timed doors is fine—just miss loot
*   Creates tension: safe slow clear vs. risky fast run

### 9. **Three Ending Paths**
*   Final choice determines ending and philosophical stance
*   Throne: Accept burden of eternal wardenship (order through sacrifice)
*   Escape: Prioritize freedom over responsibility (selfish but understandable)
*   True: Find and destroy source (heroic sacrifice, true ending)
