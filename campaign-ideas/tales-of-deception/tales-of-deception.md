The party is hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Amy Dunne, beloved daughter of famous adventuring authors, from her home on the morning of her fifth wedding anniversary to the charming but suspicious Nick Dunne.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Unreliable Information:** NPCs lie constantly. Player assumptions will be deliberately subverted.
*   **Dual Perspectives:** Information contradicts between sources. Players must determine truth.
*   **Social Deduction:** Success requires reading micro-expressions, catching inconsistencies, managing public opinion.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** No clear heroes or villains. Everyone is deeply flawed.
*   **Media Pressure:** Public opinion affects investigation success. The party must manage their image.
*   **Surprise Twist:** The midpoint revelation completely recontextualizes everything players thought they knew.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Perfect Wife Vanishes (Sessions 1–3):** Amy Dunne disappears on her anniversary. The party investigates the crime scene (signs of struggle), interviews neighbors (all love Amy, find Nick suspicious), and discovers Nick's affair. Evidence increasingly damns Nick. Media circus begins.

*   **Act II — The Twist (Sessions 4–5):** At the midpoint, players discover Amy's diary—revealing she's alive and orchestrated everything. Flashbacks show her meticulous planning. The investigation shifts from "who killed Amy" to "where is Amy and what is her endgame?"

*   **Act III — The Hunt (Sessions 6–7):** Racing to find Amy before she completes her plan (to die and frame Nick permanently). Discover she's manipulated everyone—her "friends," ex-boyfriends, the media. But Amy's plan starts unraveling due to unforeseen circumstances.

*   **Act IV — The Return (Sessions 8–10):** Amy returns claiming she was kidnapped, with a new fabricated story. The party knows the truth but she's orchestrated perfect evidence. Climax involves deciding whether to expose her (risking their reputation against a master manipulator) or become complicit in the deception. Media frenzy reaches fever pitch.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Amy Elliott Dunne** — *The "Amazing Amy"*
    *   Brilliant, psychopathic, meticulous planner. Daughter of famous authors who based children's book character on her. Uses perceived image to manipulate. Main antagonist and victim simultaneously.

2.  **Nick Dunne** — *The Husband*
    *   Charming but weak, unfaithful, financially dependent on Amy. Genuinely didn't harm her but looks incredibly guilty. Morally gray—not innocent, but not a murderer.

3.  **Margo "Go" Dunne** — *Nick's Twin Sister*

4.  **Desi Collings** — *Amy's Obsessed Ex*
    *   Wealthy, obsessive, "saved" Amy before. Amy uses him as tool in her plan, then as scapegoat.

    *   Nick's young student affair. Makes him look guilty but is genuine victim of situation.

6.  **Tanner Bolt** — *The Defense Attorney*
    *   Celebrity lawyer specializing in defending guilty-looking husbands. Media-savvy manipulator.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Dunne House:** Crime scene of the "abduction"—staged perfectly to suggest struggle.
2.  **The Bar:** Nick and Go's failing tavern, where Nick was during disappearance.
3.  **The Media Circus:** Press conferences, television studios, public opinion battleground.
4.  **Amy's Hideout:** Where she's actually staying while "missing."
5.  **Desi's Lake House:** Gilded cage where Amy stages final phase of plan.
6.  **The Police Station:** Where conflicting evidence and testimonies collide.

## Central Conflict

Truth versus Performance. Everyone in this campaign is performing for someone—Amy for the public, Nick for the jury, the media for ratings, the party for their reputation. The central question: in a world where everyone is lying and image is reality, how do you pursue justice? Can the truth even matter when the perfect lie is more convincing?

Subtext: The toxicity of performative relationships, the danger of idealized expectations, and how media narratives destroy nuance.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dual Perspective Narrative**
*   Sessions alternate between "present day investigation" and "flashback diary entries."
*   Players receive Amy's diary as evidence—written to sound like a victim's testimony.
*   Post-twist, players realize the diary was fabricated and must re-evaluate everything.

### 2. **The Unreliable Narrator System**
*   When NPCs describe events, the DM can later reveal they were lying or misremembering.
*   Players must cross-reference testimonies to find inconsistencies.
*   No NPC is automatically trustworthy—everyone has ulterior motives.

### 3. **Public Opinion Tracker**
*   Measure public sentiment toward Nick, Amy, and the party's investigation.
*   High opinion enables access and cooperation. Low opinion creates obstacles.
*   Media appearances can shift opinion dramatically but require Performance/Deception checks.

### 4. **The Media Circus**
*   Press conferences are skill challenges (Persuasion, Deception, Insight to read reporters).
*   Soundbites taken out of context can damage investigation.
*   Television personalities like Ellen Abbott try the case in public opinion.

### 5. **Amy's Contingencies**
*   Amy has backup plans for every scenario. When players disrupt one scheme, she adapts.
*   DM uses player actions to determine which contingency Amy activates.

### 6. **The Evidence Board**
*   Players maintain a visual board of evidence, noting which pieces might be fabricated.
*   Post-twist, they must identify what's real versus what Amy planted.

### 7. **The Moral Choice System**
*   At climax, players must decide: expose Amy (risky, she might destroy them), help Nick escape (become criminals), or accept the lie (become complicit).
*   No "good" option exists—only different shades of compromise.

## The Great Twist (Session 4–5 Midpoint)

Everything players believe is wrong. The structure:

**What Players Think:** Amy is murdered/abducted. Nick is the killer. They're solving a murder mystery.

**The Reveal:** Amy is alive. She orchestrated everything. The campaign shifts from murder investigation to psychological thriller.

**How to Execute:**
*   Players discover Amy's actual plans (hidden notes, digital evidence, payments to actors).
*   Flashback scenes show Amy's perspective—meticulous planning, cold calculation, revenge motivation.
*   Recontextualize all previous "evidence"—the struggle was staged, the diary was fiction, witnesses were manipulated.

---

## Campaign Themes

*   **Performative Identity:** Everyone is playing a role for their audience.
*   **Media as Weapon:** Public opinion is more powerful than truth.
*   **Toxic Relationships:** Marriage as battlefield, love as control.
*   **Unreliable Narration:** Nothing is as it first appears.
*   **The Perfect Victim:** How society's biases affect who we believe.
*   **Justice vs. Truth:** Sometimes proving the truth is impossible.

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign "succeeds" when:
*   Players uncover the complete truth of Amy's plan
*   They navigate the moral choice at the climax (whatever they choose)
*   They understand that there is no traditional "justice" available
*   They've experienced the full narrative twist and its implications

This is a campaign about the journey and revelation, not about defeating evil.

---

## Failure States

*   Players accept the initial narrative without questioning (DM should seed doubt)
*   They resort to violence (ruins the psychological thriller aspect)
*   They ignore the media aspect (missing half the campaign's theme)
*   They expect a traditional hero's resolution (campaign deliberately denies this)

---

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Pre-plan the "twist" reveal carefully—seed enough doubt before, but not so much it's obvious
*   Keep meticulous notes on what each NPC claims versus what actually happened
*   Prepare fake diary entries that sound convincing but contain subtle inconsistencies
*   Practice delivering information that later turns out to be false without lying to players
*   Study how media narratives work—simplification, sensationalism, bias confirmation
*   Be ready for players to discover the twist early—have contingencies
*   Understand that player frustration with unreliable information is intentional (but monitor table fun)
*   The goal is for players to feel clever when piecing it together, not cheated

## Alternate Endings

### **The Exposure**
Party exposes Amy publicly. She's brilliant enough to turn it back on them. Becomes he-said-she-said. Pyrrhic victory at best.

### **The Escape**
Party helps Nick flee. He becomes fugitive. Amy "wins" but Nick is free. Morally compromised ending.

### **The Acceptance**
Party realizes they can't beat Amy's perfect plan. Nick returns to toxic marriage. Party becomes complicit in the lie. Darkest ending.

### **The Recording**
Party obtains irrefutable evidence (Amy confessing on recording). But releasing it destroys multiple lives. Must weigh justice against collateral damage.
