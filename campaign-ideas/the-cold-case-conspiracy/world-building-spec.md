### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Cold Case Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept:**
When the respected Clutter family is methodically murdered in their Kansas farmhouse for money that didn't exist, investigators and journalists must conduct painstaking investigation to find the killers—two damaged drifters—and grapple with questions of evil, justice, and capital punishment.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Holcomb, Kansas 1959—population 270, wheat farming community, everyone knows everyone
*   Explain the Clutter family's standing—Herbert was wealthy farmer, respected leader, Methodist, employer
*   Write about Bonnie's depression—suffered from psychological issues, mostly bedridden
*   Describe Nancy and Kenyon—wholesome American teenagers, popular and quiet respectively
*   Detail Dick Hickock's background—intelligent but sociopathic, former farm worker, car accident, married with children
*   Explain Perry Smith's tragic history—Native American/Irish mix, horrific childhood abuse by mother, orphanages, father's abandonment, motorcycle accident causing brain damage and chronic pain
*   Write about Floyd Wells' lie—told Dick that Clutters kept $10,000 in safe (completely false)
*   Describe the planning—Dick convinced Perry, they acquired shotgun and supplies, drove to Kansas
*   Detail November 14-15, 1959—the murders occurred, four people killed for $40
*   Explain the investigation—KBI, local sheriff, FBI, hundreds interviewed, breakthrough from prison informant
*   Write about the capture—Las Vegas, December, tip from old acquaintance
*   Describe the trial—both found guilty, death penalty imposed despite insanity defense attempts
*   Detail five years on death row—appeals exhausted, executions carried out April 14, 1965

**3. Factions:**

*   **The Journalists** (Major) - Truman Capote, Harper Lee, researching for book
*   **The Holcomb Community** (Major) - Townspeople, witnesses, devastated and frightened
*   **The Killers** (Major) - Dick and Perry, on run then captured and tried
*   **The Defense** (Minor) - Lawyers arguing diminished capacity, insanity
*   **The Prosecution** (Minor) - Seeking death penalty for heinous crime

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Alvin Dewey, Perry Edward Smith, Richard "Dick" Hickock, Truman Capote, Herbert Clutter (deceased)

**5. Locations:**
*   **Clutter Farmhouse** - Isolated, prosperous home, four separate murder locations

*   **Garden City** - Larger nearby town, KBI headquarters
*   **Cross-Country Trail** - Kansas to Mexico to Las Vegas, following killers' flight
*   **Las Vegas** - Where killers captured passing stolen checks
*   **Kansas State Penitentiary** - Pretrial holding, death row, execution facility
*   **The Courtroom** - Small Kansas county courthouse, trial location
*   **Death Row** - Where killers spend five years appealing
*   **The Gallows** - Execution location (hanging in 1965)

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party investigates crime scene thoroughly THEN discovers: four victims, systematic execution, minimal theft, no clear motive
*   IF forensic analysis conducted THEN finds: boot prints, shotgun pellets, rope type, timeline established
*   IF hundreds of townspeople interviewed THEN creates suspect pool but no clear lead initially
*   IF Floyd Wells questioned in prison THEN reveals he told Dick about (nonexistent) safe
*   IF Dick Hickock investigated THEN connections to Wells, recent release, known associate Perry Smith
*   IF manhunt organized THEN killers are already fleeing cross-country
*   IF killers' trail followed THEN track through stolen checks, motel stays, Mexico, Las Vegas
*   IF tip received from Las Vegas THEN killers arrested passing stolen checks
*   IF interrogations conducted THEN initial denials, then each blames other, finally Perry confesses all four murders
*   IF crime reconstructed THEN horrific pointlessness revealed—no safe existed, killed for $40
*   IF psychiatric evaluation ordered THEN Perry shows brain damage and trauma, Dick shows sociopathy
*   IF insanity defense attempted THEN rejected, both found legally sane despite psychological damage
*   IF trial proceeds THEN overwhelming evidence, guilty verdicts, death penalty for both
*   IF appeals exhausted THEN executions proceed five years after crime
*   IF Capote publishes book THEN immortalizes crime, raises questions about journalistic ethics
*   IF party witnesses executions THEN confronts moral reality of capital punishment
*   IF party refuses to witness THEN avoids complicity but questions remain
