# Creative Brief: Capsuleer Empires

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Hard Sci-Fi Realism (EVE Online-inspired)

Inspired by EVE Online's cold, realistic space aesthetic—a style emphasizing massive capital ships, corporate brutality, and the vast emptiness of space. This style captures both the beauty of the cosmos and the ruthless nature of immortal capitalism.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Scale and Vastness:** Emphasize the enormous size of capital ships against the void of space.
*   **Corporate Aesthetics:** Each empire has distinct design philosophy—industrial, sleek, religious, utilitarian.
*   **Cold Realism:** Space is beautiful but hostile, empty, and indifferent.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Corporate, ruthless, vast, immortal, economic warfare, cold-beauty.
*   **Feeling:** The loneliness of space, the weight of immortality, the thrill of risk when nothing is truly at stake.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Hard-edged, geometric, realistic spacecraft design.
*   **Forms:** Massive capital ships, industrial stations, utilitarian design over aesthetics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive Caldari battleship in realistic EVE Online style, angular industrial design with geometric plating, visible weapons arrays, floating in deep space."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Faction-coded with realistic space backgrounds.
*   **Caldari:** Grays, blues, industrial metals.
*   **Gallente:** Greens, golds, organic curves.
*   **Amarr:** Golds, whites, religious grandeur.
*   **Minmatar:** Rusts, browns, scrap-welded aesthetics.
*   **Space:** Deep blacks, distant stars, colorful nebulae.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of industrial grays and blues for Caldari ships, against the deep black of space with distant golden nebulae."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Capsuleers are rarely seen—focus is on ships and stations.
*   **When shown:** Humans in utilitarian spacesuits or corporate attire.
*   **Pods:** Egg-shaped capsules containing naked pilots in fluid.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A capsuleer in their pod, a translucent egg-shaped chamber filled with fluid, neural interfaces visible, floating in a ship's pod bay."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic space—star fields, nebulae, planets, stations.
*   **Stations:** Massive orbital structures mixing industrial and faction aesthetics.
*   **Null-Sec:** Empty, lawless space with wrecks and territorial markers.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Jita 4-4 trade hub, a massive orbital station surrounded by hundreds of ships of all sizes, docking and undocking, with a planet and stars in the background."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Realistic space lighting—harsh sunlight on one side, deep shadow on the other.
*   **No Sound:** Space is silent—no atmospheric effects.
*   **Weapon Effects:** Bright laser beams, missile trails, explosion flashes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by harsh sunlight from a distant star, casting half the battleship in brilliant light and the other half in deep shadow, with laser fire cutting through the void."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Emphasize scale and isolation—massive ships against empty cosmos.
*   **Techniques:** Use silhouettes of capital ships, show fleet formations, include wreckage for stakes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of a massive fleet battle in null-sec, dozens of capital ships exchanging fire, smaller frigates swarming, with the wreckage of destroyed ships floating in zero-gravity."

## Voice

A cold, professional voice with measured delivery and corporate precision. The tone is analytical and detached, viewing everything as assets and liabilities. Slight Eastern European or Nordic accent suggesting international corporate culture. The emotion is controlled ambition masking ruthlessness. Audio quality is pristine with slight comms-channel filtering. Role: A corporate broker, or a capsuleer veteran narrating their empire's rise.
