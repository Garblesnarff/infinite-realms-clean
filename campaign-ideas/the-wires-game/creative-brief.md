# The Wire's Game - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
Gritty urban realism. Handheld documentary aesthetic. Authentic city life. Baltimore-inspired architecture and street culture. Visual storytelling emphasizing place and community.

**Colors**: Brick red, asphalt grey, police blue, corner yellow (streetlights), institutional green.

## Music
Opening: "Way Down in the Hole" variants. Urban instrumentals. Hip-hop and street music. Silence in key dramatic moments. Diegetic music from cars, clubs, radios.

## Voice Direction
**Street**: Authentic urban dialogue, slang, code-switching
