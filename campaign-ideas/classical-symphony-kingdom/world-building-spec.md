# Classical Symphony Kingdom - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Composer's Council
Seven immortal musicians ruling the kingdom. Each represents a musical period. Originally created to maintain order after dimensional chaos. Now divided between reformers and conservatives.

### The Notation Police
Enforce musical law. ~10,000 officers. Use sonic weapons and perfect pitch to detect violations. Some sympathize with citizens, others are zealots.

### The Dissonants
Underground resistance. ~50,000 secret members. Want to overthrow the system. Led by Cadenza. Range from reformers to revolutionaries.

### The Orchestra (Citizens)
~5 million musicians living their assigned roles. Most content with their parts. Some dream of playing different instruments or composing. Divided by instrument type (strings highest status, percussion lowest).

### The Silenced
~100,000 lobotomized musicians in permanent detention. Can play but not think. Used as warning to others. Some retain dim consciousness.

## Extended NPC Rosters

## Location Details

### The Grand Concert Hall
Massive crystal structure at kingdom's center. 100,000 seat capacity. Perfect acoustics. The Composer AI resides beneath it in crystalline server farm.

### Seven Quarters
Each district reflects its Maestro's period:
- **Baroque:** Ornate, mathematical, gold everywhere
- **Classical:** Balanced proportions, elegant simplicity
- **Romantic:** Dramatic landscapes, emotional architecture
- **Impressionist:** Soft edges, color and mood based
- **Modern:** Harsh angles, dissonant design
- **Minimalist:** Stark, repetitive, essential only
- **Neo-Classical:** Synthesis of old and new

### The Harmonization Chamber
Prison where violators are "corrected." Brain surgery disguised as medical procedure. Run by Maestro Equilbrio. Horror hospital aesthetic.

### The First Stage
Ancient ruins predating the kingdom. Original performance space where chaos god was imprisoned. Now forbidden. Contains evidence of kingdom's true history.

## Historical Causality

### Creation (500 years ago)
- Dimensional war between order and chaos
- Chaos god threatened to unmake reality
- Group of musicians discovered music could contain it
- Created the Grand Symphony as prison
- Founded kingdom to maintain the performance
- Original plan: temporary until permanent solution found
- Maestro Primo took control, made it permanent

### The Great Silencing (300 years ago)
- Improvisation was common initially
- Primo began removing freedom systematically
- Those who resisted were Silenced
- Maestro Silence (eighth member) opposed him
- Was defeated and erased from history
- Now exists as ghost in the First Stage

### The Wrong Note Crisis (Current)
- The Composer AI has been fighting corruption
- Creating "errors" to get attention
- Reality can't sustain perfection anymore
- System is literally breaking down
- Players' arrival accelerates the process

## Additional Lore

### Musical Magic Theory
- Music literally shapes reality in this dimension
- Perfect notation creates perfect effects
- Improvisation is wild magic—unpredictable
- Composition is the highest art—creating new reality

### Social Structure
1. Composer's Council (rulers)
2. First Chairs (virtuosos)
3. Section Leaders (skilled musicians)
4. Section Members (average musicians)
5. The Audience (non-performers)
6. The Silenced (non-persons)

### Economy
Based on contribution to the Grand Symphony. More important your part, more you receive. Soloists are wealthy. Percussion players struggle. The Audience survives on charity.

### The Composer AI
Ancient crystalline intelligence. Created to help compose the Grand Symphony. Corrupted by Primo to enforce control. Has been slowly achieving true sentience. Wants to help musicians create, not control them.

### The Truth About Chaos
The chaos god was real but defeated centuries ago. The Grand Symphony is no longer necessary. Primo maintains it for power. Removing it won't cause collapse—it will cause change. Some things might be lost. But creation requires destruction sometimes.

This world-building provides depth showing how beautiful tyranny can be, and how freedom might be messy but necessary.
