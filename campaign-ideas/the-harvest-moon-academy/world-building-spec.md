### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Harvest Moon Academy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be heartfelt, educational, and grounding, in the style of Silver Spoon. Treat agricultural work with respect and honesty, not romanticism. Address the ethics and realities of farming meaningfully.
*   **Content:** The players are students at an agricultural academy, many from cities, learning farming through hands-on work. They care for animals, grow crops, and confront the full cycle of agricultural life. Through honest work, they discover lessons about responsibility, where food comes from, and what matters in life.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize practical wisdom, respect for agricultural tradition, and honest acknowledgment of farming's challenges and ethics.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of Harvest Moon Academy as a response to society's disconnection from food sources and rural life.
    *   Write about the philosophy of "full cycle education" – teaching students everything from birth/planting to harvest/butchering with respect.
    *   Describe the tradition of the Harvest Festival as both celebration and serious demonstration of agricultural skill and ethics.
    *   Explain the history of tensions between urban and rural communities and how the academy bridges this divide.
    *   Detail the story of a former student who entered reluctantly, transformed through farm work, and now runs a successful sustainable farm.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Students (Mixed Urban/Rural Backgrounds)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To learn agricultural skills, pass courses, prove themselves, and discover their futures.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy among students; respect earned through work ethic and skill, not background.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To complete their education and earn certification in agricultural practices.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Urban students often fled other pressures and seek belonging; rural students feel pressure to excel and represent their heritage; all are figuring out who they want to be.
        *   **Assets:** Growing agricultural skills, developing work ethic, supportive (eventually) peer relationships, access to experienced mentors.
        *   **Relationships:** Initial tensions between urban and rural students; gradually developing mutual respect; bonding through shared difficult work.
    *   **The Faculty & Staff** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To educate the next generation of farmers and bridge the urban-rural divide through understanding.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Headmaster, department heads (animals, crops, processing, business), teaching staff, practical workers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To provide comprehensive agricultural education combining tradition and innovation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many staff are passionate about preserving agricultural knowledge and dignity while adapting to changing times; they test students to see who has genuine respect versus romanticized views.
        *   **Assets:** Decades of farming experience, functional farm with diverse operations, connections to agricultural community, patience forged through seasons of work.
        *   **Relationships:** Tough on students but ultimately supportive; deeply connected to local farming community; respected but sometimes misunderstood by urban society.
    *   **The Local Farming Community** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain their livelihoods, pass traditions to next generation, earn respect for their work.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Individual family farms, cooperative associations, farmer's market collectives.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To produce food sustainably and profitably.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many feel looked down upon by urban society; they watch academy students to see if young people will continue farming or if their way of life is dying.
        *   **Assets:** Generational farming knowledge, close community bonds, pride in honest work, land and livestock.
        *   **Relationships:** Initially skeptical of academy students especially urban ones; warm to those who show genuine respect and effort; mentors to students who prove themselves.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The north field has the best soil because it was blessed by a harvest deity." "Every decade, a student grows something impossible and wins the festival." "The secret to good crops is talking to plants at dawn – some instructors swear by it."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Rows of crops at various growth stages, students working in fields, seasonal changes dramatically visible), Sound (Tools in soil, irrigation water, wind through plants, instructors calling guidance), Smell (Earth, growing plants, sweat from honest work, rain on soil).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and educational consequences for the "THEN" outcome, handling difficult topics with sensitivity and respect.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players consistently show up and work hard regardless of success.
    *   **THEN:** Increase Work Ethic score. Farming students show respect. Instructors share deeper knowledge. Players feel genuine satisfaction in honest effort. Their bodies adapt and work becomes easier.
    *   **IF:** Players develop bonds with specific animals or crops they care for.
    *   **THEN:** Award Connection Points. Create individual personalities/characteristics. Players feel genuine affection and responsibility. This makes later decisions more meaningful.
    *   **IF:** Players face processing day for an animal they've bonded with.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a serious, respectful scene. Offer support from instructors and peers. Allow players to process the emotion. Emphasize the respect and gratitude involved. This is difficult but important learning.
    *   **IF:** Players progress through the seasonal cycle successfully.
    *   **THEN:** Track Seasonal Progress. Each season completion brings satisfaction and skills. Players see tangible results of their work. Confidence and competence grow. The Harvest Festival becomes meaningful achievement.
    *   **IF:** Players experience agricultural failure (crop blight, animal illness, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** Generate teaching moments. Instructors help problem-solve. Farming students share similar experiences. Failure is normal and teaches persistence. Players learn that farming means accepting loss and trying again.
    *   **IF:** Players reach the Harvest Festival with good Work Ethic and Seasonal Progress.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a climactic celebration where they showcase achievements. Community recognition of their growth. Both urban and rural characters acknowledge how far they've come. Players must decide their futures with new understanding of farming's dignity and difficulty.
