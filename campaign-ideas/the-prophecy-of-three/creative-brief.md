# Creative Brief: The Prophecy of Three

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Space Opera with Three Distinct Faction Aesthetics (StarCraft-inspired)

Inspired by the epic space warfare of *StarCraft* with clearly defined visual languages for each race: industrial human military, organic alien horror, and crystalline psionic ancients. This style captures the scale of galactic warfare, the beauty and terror of alien species, and reality-warping cosmic horror.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Faction Identity:** Each race has completely distinct visual language
*   **Scale:** Massive space battles, planetary invasions, armies clashing across alien landscapes
*   **Void Horror:** Reality-breaking effects, dimensional rifts, nightmarish Dark Archon forms
*   **Unity Theme:** Eventually show three factions fighting together, contrasting visual styles cooperating

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Space opera, three-faction war, galactic scale, prophecy, cosmic horror, unity despite difference, ancient evil
*   **Feeling:** The vastness of space conflict. Three distinct civilizations, each beautiful and terrifying in their own way. Hope found in impossible alliances. Reality-breaking horror as ultimate threat.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Terran Dominion:** Military grays, olive greens, industrial browns, red warning lights, steel and rust
*   **Swarm Collective:** Organic purples, sickly greens, bone whites, pulsing bio-luminescent pink/purple
*   **Protectorate:** Crystalline blues, golds, white energy, glowing cyan and yellow psionics
*   **Dark Archons/Void:** Reality-warping blacks shot through with impossible colors, purple-red chaos energy, things that hurt to look at
*   **Prompt Example:** "...showing three-faction battle. Terran marines in gray power armor with red visors firing gauss rifles (orange muzzle flashes). Swarm zerglings—purple-green four-legged beasts with scythe arms—charge in swarms. Protectorate zealots in golden armor with glowing blue psi-blades cut through enemies. Above, the sky tears open with purple-black void rifts."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Terran:** Power-armored marines (bulky suits, red visors), combat suits for officers, mechani zed units, gruff military aesthetic
*   **Swarm:** Zerglings (quadrupedal with scythes), hydralisks (serpentine with spines), ultralisks (massive armored beasts), infested humans
*   **Protectorate:** Zealots (golden armor, psi-blades), templars (robes and psionic focus), their face features are alien but noble
*   **Dark Archons:** Impossible geometry, too many angles, shadowy forms with burning eyes, tentacles of reality-warping energy
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Protectorate zealot in gleaming gold-white armor with glowing cyan energy blades extending from wrist-mounted psi-emitters. Their face has golden skin, glowing eyes without pupils, elegant alien features. Blue energy aura surrounds them. Behind them, a massive crystalline structure pulses with power."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Terran Bases:** Industrial metal structures, bunkers, missile turrets, command centers with satellite dishes
*   **Swarm Hives:** Organic creep covering ground (purple-pink living carpet), structures made of bone and flesh, hatcheries spawning units
*   **Protectorate Nexus:** Crystalline architecture, floating structures, golden temples with geometric perfection
*   **Void-Corrupted:** Reality tears, floating rocks, reversed gravity, impossible angles, nightmarish creatures
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Swarm hive: purple-pink creep covers the ground like living tissue. Organic structures resembling giant ribcages and pulsating sacs dot the landscape. A spawning pool bubbles with genetic material. In the distance, a massive hive spire reaches toward alien sky. Everything is biomechanical horror-beautiful."

**5. Combat and Space Battles:**
*   **Ground Combat:** Marines vs. Zerglings vs. Zealots—three completely different combat styles
*   **Space Battles:** Terran battlecruisers (industrial warships), Swarm leviathans (living space whales), Protectorate carriers (elegant golden ships)
*   **Abilities:** Psionic storms (blue lightning), nuclear strikes (mushroom clouds), Swarm burrow and emerge
*   **Void Combat:** Reality breaking, impossible geometries, attacks that don't follow physics
*   **Prompt Example:** "Space battle: A Terran battlecruiser—massive gray industrial warship bristling with guns—fires Yamato cannon (massive orange energy beam). A Swarm leviathan—living purple creature the size of a ship—spawns bio-fighters. A Protectorate carrier—elegant golden vessel—launches glowing interceptors. Background shows planet and stars, with purple void rift tearing reality."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Terran:** Harsh industrial lighting, muzzle flashes, red warning lights in dark corridors
*   **Swarm:** Bio-luminescence from organic structures, sickly green-purple glow
*   **Protectorate:** Radiant psionic energy lighting everything in blue-gold glow
*   **Void:** Light doesn't work right—shadows cast multiple ways, colors shift wrongly
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by faction. Terran scenes have harsh white floodlights and red alarms. Swarm areas glow with bioluminescent purple-pink from creep and structures. Protectorate locations radiate serene golden-blue psionic light. Void-corrupted areas have lighting that comes from wrong directions and casts impossible shadows."

## Voice

A voice that begins with military crispness reporting battlefield situations, evolves to carry prophetic weight, and ultimately speaks with cosmic horror awe. The pacing is urgent during battles, contemplative during prophecy moments. The tone shifts between tactical command ("Focus fire on the hive cluster!"), ancient prophecy ("Three as One shall seal the Dark..."), and desperate hope facing extinction ("If we fail here, the galaxy falls"). There's awareness of commanding armies while individual heroes matter most. Slightly filtered like radio communication, but clear. Role: The voice of galactic war and prophecy.
