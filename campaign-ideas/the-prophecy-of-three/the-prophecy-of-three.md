An ancient prophecy speaks of three chosen heroes from each race who must unite to stop the return of the Dark Archons—extradimensional beings that once enslaved all sentient life.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-40 sessions)

A four-act arc of faction warfare, prophecy revelation, and united resistance.

*   **Act I — Faction Warfare (Sessions 1-10):** The party serves as elite operatives for their chosen faction (Terran, Swarm, or Protectorate). They conduct missions to secure resources, establish bases, and fight the other two factions. Terrans deal with rebellion and corruption, Swarm agents gain individuality while serving the hivemind, Protectorate warriors redeem their honor. They hear whispers of an ancient prophecy but dismiss it as superstition. A mysterious Dark Voice begins appearing in visions.
*   **Act II — The Prophecy Revealed (Sessions 11-20):** Ancient temples activate across the galaxy, revealing the Prophecy of Three: champions from each race must unite or all will fall. The party is marked by prophecy-signs, making them targets and heroes simultaneously. They conduct a mission where all three factions' champions meet and realize they must work together despite centuries of hatred. Meanwhile, reality tears open and Dark Archons begin emerging. Each faction's leadership refuses to believe the threat or cooperate.
*   **Act III — Breaking Allegiances (Sessions 21-30):** The party defects from their factions to pursue the prophecy, branded traitors by their own people. They recruit followers from all three races, building a secret unified army. They steal artifacts from each faction needed for the prophecy ritual. Major battles pit the party's coalition against loyalist forces from all three factions while Dark Archons grow stronger. A cataclysmic event (colony world consumed by void) finally convinces faction leaders the threat is real.
*   **Act IV — The Dark Archon War (Sessions 31-40):** The three factions form an uneasy alliance with the party as intermediaries. Massive combined fleets assault Dark Archon strongholds across dimensional rifts. The party leads ground forces through nightmare realms where reality breaks down. They discover the Dark Archons seek to merge all dimensions into chaos. The final battle occurs at the Nexus—the center of all reality—where the party must use the artifacts to seal the rift forever. The epilogue shows the galaxy learning to coexist, with the party as symbols of unity.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Three-Faction System**
*   Party chooses faction at start: Terran Dominion, Swarm Collective, or Protectorate
*   Each faction has unique units, abilities, and campaign focus
*   **Terran:** Versatile tech, infantry and vehicles, defensive structures
*   **Swarm:** Rapid spawning, biological units, consume/evolve mechanics
*   **Protectorate:** Advanced tech, powerful but expensive units, shields and psionics
*   Eventually party unites all three; can command mixed forces

### 2. **Resource Management & Base Building**
*   Gather minerals (gold equivalent) and vespene gas (magical energy)
*   Build bases with specific structures: barracks, factories, tech labs
*   Produce armies between major story missions
*   Upgrade units: armor, weapons, special abilities
*   Base defense missions: enemy waves attack party's stronghold

### 3. **Hero Units**
*   Party members are "Hero Units"—powerful individuals leading armies
*   Cannot be mass-produced; if they fall, mission often fails
*   Gain experience and unlock abilities/upgrades
*   Each has unique powers themed to their faction
*   Can command regular units in battle

### 4. **Prophecy Marks**
*   Characters receive prophecy marks granting visions and powers
*   Unlock prophetic abilities: glimpse future, communicate across distance, sense Dark Archon presence
*   Three marks must unite to activate prophecy's full power
*   NPCs react to marks: worship, fear, or hunt marked individuals

### 5. **Mass Combat System**
*   Command armies of 50-200 units in major battles
*   Tactical RTS-style positioning: flanking, high ground, unit counters
*   Rock-paper-scissors balance: infantry > light units, vehicles > buildings, air > ground
*   Party makes strategic decisions; dice resolve individual combats
*   Victory through objectives: destroy base, hold point, escort VIP, survive waves

### 6. **Void Corruption**
*   Areas touched by Dark Archons become corrupted
*   Reality warping effects: gravity shifts, time loops, mutations
*   Prolonged exposure corrupts characters: must make Wisdom saves
*   Corrupted areas have nightmarish creatures and physics-breaking terrain
*   Cleansing corruption requires artifacts or massive psionic effort

### 7. **Unified Army (Late Game)**
*   After factions ally, party commands mixed-race armies
*   Combine faction strengths: Terran medics heal Swarm beasts, Protectorate shields protect Terran tanks
*   Special "Unity" units available only to prophesied champions
*   Must maintain faction loyalty: favoring one faction too much causes others to lose faith
