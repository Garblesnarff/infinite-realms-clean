### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Mothman Prophecies**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Strange sightings of a massive winged creature with burning red eyes have plagued the riverside town of Point Pleasant for months. The creature, known only as the Mothman, appears before disasters—its presence a harbinger of death and destruction. The players must investigate the sightings, decode cryptic prophecies, and uncover the truth behind the entity before a catastrophic event destroys not just Point Pleasant, but the entire region. Time is running out, and the red eyes are watching.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of Point Pleasant and its history as a river trading town in Appalachia.
    *   Write the history of the sealed mine and the 1930s expedition that breached the ancient chamber beneath.
    *   Describe the Native American legend of the "Thunderbird's Cursed Brother," a sky demon that feeds on death.
    *   Explain the construction and significance of the Silver Bridge, and the engineering flaws that led to its collapse.
    *   Detail the pattern of disasters in Point Pleasant's history and their connection to the Mothman sightings.
    *   Write about the Thorne family curse and their hereditary connection to prophetic visions.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Witnesses** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To document and understand the Mothman phenomenon. To warn others of impending disasters.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose coalition of ordinary townsfolk who have seen the creature. Led by Mary Hyre, a local reporter.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We must warn people about the danger and find answers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Several members are becoming obsessed, bordering on cult-like worship of the Mothman.
        *   **Assets:** Detailed journals of sightings, connections to local media, a growing archive of prophecies.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrusted by town authorities; seeking help from the players; wary of the Church of Judgment.
    *   **The Church of Judgment** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To interpret the Mothman as divine judgment and prepare the faithful for the apocalypse.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Pastor Ezekiel Thorne, with a congregation of fearful believers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Repent, for the end times are upon us. The Mothman is an angel of God.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Thorne believes his family is chosen to interpret the visions and may be willing to sacrifice others to appease what he sees as divine wrath.
        *   **Assets:** A devoted congregation, knowledge of the Thorne family's cursed history, ritual knowledge passed down through generations.
        *   **Relationships:** Antagonistic toward the Witnesses (whom they see as heretics); may try to recruit or convert the players.
    *   **Town Council** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain order, preserve the town's reputation, and avoid mass panic.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Mayor Johnston and a council of local business owners.
        *   **Public Agenda:** These sightings are mass hysteria. We need to stay calm and focus on recovery after the bridge collapse.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The council knows about the sealed mine and the expedition. They've covered it up for decades to protect the town's economy.
        *   **Assets:** Political authority, control over local law enforcement, access to historical records.
        *   **Relationships:** Actively working to suppress the players' investigation; secretly fearful of what they might uncover.
    *   **The Buried Ones** (Major - Hidden Faction)
        *   **Goals:** To complete the ancient ritual that will fully manifest their god-entity into the material world.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A secret cult descended from the original miners who breached the temple. Led by an unknown figure known only as "The Seer."
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown to most. They appear as ordinary townsfolk.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To use the Mothman's prophetic energy to open a permanent gateway to their deity's realm, even if it means destroying Point Pleasant.
        *   **Assets:** Secret access to the sealed mine, forbidden ritual knowledge, psychic connection to the Mothman.
        *   **Relationships:** Actively sabotaging the players' investigation; may be infiltrating other factions; will kill to protect their secret.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully decode a prophecy and prevent a disaster.
    *   **THEN:** The Disaster Clock slows by one increment. Townsfolk begin to trust the players more. The cult becomes more desperate and aggressive.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to prevent a disaster (fire, flood, accident).
    *   **THEN:** The Disaster Clock advances by two increments. Public panic increases. The Church of Judgment gains more followers. The Mothman appears more frequently.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the identity of The Seer.
    *   **THEN:** The cult attempts to assassinate the players or frame them for a crime. The Seer flees to the sealed mine to complete the final ritual.
    *   **IF:** The players convince the Town Council to reveal the truth about the mine.
    *   **THEN:** The public learns of the cover-up. Mayor Johnston is ousted. The players gain access to sealed records and official support, but also draw the cult's full attention.
    *   **IF:** A player accumulates 10 or more Prophecy Points.
    *   **THEN:** The player begins experiencing constant visions and may become an NPC (temporarily or permanently) as they lose touch with reality. The Mothman begins appearing specifically to that player.
    *   **IF:** The players confront the Mothman directly before understanding its nature.
    *   **THEN:** The encounter is likely disastrous. Players may die, go mad, or be marked by the entity. However, survivors gain critical insight into the Mothman's true purpose.
