# The Eternal Shores of Tír na nÓg

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Celtic Mythology / Otherworld Fantasy / Timeless Mystery / Fae Politics
- **Estimated Length**: 16-22 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 4-14
- **Tone**: Enchanting, Timeless, Bittersweet, Mystical, Deceptive

### Core Premise
The players died (or were taken) to Tír na nÓg, the Land of Eternal Youth, where time stands still, beauty is perfect, and joy is endless. Unlike other afterlives focused on judgment or punishment, the Celtic Otherworld seems like paradise. But paradise has a price - time moves differently here, memories fade, and leaving is nearly impossible. The players discover they're not entirely dead but caught between worlds. They must navigate fae politics, resist the lure of eternal contentment, solve the mystery of why they were brought here, and find a way back to the mortal world before they forget why they ever wanted to leave. The campaign explores the seduction of paradise and whether eternal youth is worth losing everything that makes you human.

### Major NPCs

- **Manannan mac Lir**: God of the sea and Otherworld. **Role**: King / Guide / Trickster. **Personality**: Charming, ancient, neither good nor evil, enjoys riddles and games, guards the boundaries between worlds. **Flaw/Secret**: Lonely despite his court; brings mortals to the Otherworld because he misses genuine emotion; the fae have lived so long they feel little.

- **Niamh of the Golden Hair**: Beautiful sidhe princess. **Role**: Love Interest / Temptation / Tragic Figure. **Personality**: Enchanting, genuinely compassionate but alien in morality, doesn't understand why mortals want to leave paradise. **Flaw/Secret**: She brought mortal heroes here before (Oisin); they always eventually want to leave; she's heartbroken by this pattern but cannot stop herself from hoping.

- **The Dagda**: Father-god figure. **Role**: Authority / Judge / Ancient Power. **Personality**: Wise, powerful, jovial but terrifying when roused, plays harp that controls emotions. **Flaw/Secret**: Knows the Otherworld's beauty is a trap; maintains it anyway because without mortals, the fae fade; needs human emotion to remember what it means to truly live.

- **The Morrigan**: Triple goddess of fate and war. **Role**: Antagonist / Oracle / Force of Nature. **Personality**: Appears as maiden, mother, and crone; knows past and future; cryptic and ominous. **Flaw/Secret**: Warns players that staying means losing themselves; might help if they prove worthy; represents the harsh truth beneath beautiful lies.

- **Oisin the Poet**: Ancient mortal trapped for centuries. **Role**: Warning / Quest Giver / Tragic Example. **Personality**: Once heroic, now faded, struggling to remember his mortality, desperate to leave but afraid of aging instantly when he does. **Flaw/Secret**: He's the proof of what happens - came here willingly, stayed 300 years (felt like 3), returned and crumbled to dust; exists now as ghost, warning others.

### Key Locations

- **The Blessed Shores**: Where mortals arrive. Beautiful beaches, perfect weather, welcoming fae. Everything seems wonderful. The seduction begins here.

- **The Crystal Palace**: Manannan's court. Magnificent, timeless, filled with music and feasting. Every pleasure available. Easy to lose yourself in contentment.

- **The Eternal Orchard**: Trees bear fruit in all seasons simultaneously. Eating the fruit deepens your connection to the Otherworld and makes leaving harder. Symbolic temptation.

- **The Mist Between Worlds**: Boundary region where reality is uncertain. Time flows strangely. Paths lead to both mortal world and deeper into the Otherworld. Navigation is perilous.

- **Tech Duinn**: The dark Otherworld, house of the dead. Contrast to Tír na nÓg's beauty. Where those who cannot stay in paradise go. Shows that Celtic afterlife has shadow too.

- **The Sidhe Mounds**: Ancient burial mounds that are doorways to the Otherworld. Players might escape through these, but only during specific times (Samhain, Beltane).

### Central Conflict
Paradise is a trap. The players must resist the seduction of eternal youth and contentment while solving why they were brought here and finding escape. Time moves differently - minutes in the Otherworld are years in the mortal world. Their loved ones age and die. The central tension is between the beauty of the Otherworld and the cost of staying. The fae need mortals but don't understand mortality's value. The campaign explores themes of timelessness vs. growth, contentment vs. striving, immortality's hidden costs, and whether paradise without struggle has meaning.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Time Dilation**: Track mortal world time vs. Otherworld time. Every session in the Otherworld = years passing in mortal world. Creates urgent need to escape while environment encourages staying.

- **Fading Humanity**: The longer players stay, the more they forget mortal concerns, emotions dull, memories fade. Track "Fading" stat. High Fading makes you more fae, less human. Mechanically powerful but emotionally hollowed.

- **Otherworld Food**: Eating fae food binds you to the realm. Creates tension between necessary sustenance and growing attachment. Each meal makes leaving harder.

- **Time-Specific Escape**: The doors between worlds open only at certain times (Samhain, Beltane) or during specific circumstances. Must reach correct location at correct time. Generates urgency.

- **Fae Bargains**: Everything with the fae is deals and exchanges. Words bind literally. Creates social combat and negotiation challenges. Breaking bargains has severe consequences.

- **Memory Anchors**: Players must actively maintain memories of why they want to leave. Roleplaying moments where they recall loved ones, unfinished business, mortality's value. Mechanical reminders prevent Fading.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players solve the mystery, resist Fading, reach a sidhe mound during Samhain or Beltane, and escape back to the mortal world. They're changed by the experience but fundamentally still human and mortal.

**Bittersweet Victory**: Players escape but significant time has passed - decades or centuries. Their mortal world has moved on. They're strangers in their own time. They survived the Otherworld but lost what they were returning to.

**Tragic Victory**: Some players choose to stay because they've Faded too far or found something in the Otherworld they can't leave. Others escape. Party splits between worlds.

**Defeat**: Players Fade completely, becoming fae themselves. They forget why they wanted to leave, become part of the Otherworld's eternal court. Not torment, but loss of self. They exist forever as something they never wanted to be.

**The Oisin Ending**: Players escape after too long. Return to mortal world and crumble to dust as centuries of age catch up instantly. They're free but it kills them.
