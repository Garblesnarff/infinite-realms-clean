# Creative Brief: The Organic Expanse

## Art Style: Art Nouveau (Mucha / Klimt / Horta-inspired)

Flowing organic lines, nature motifs, decorative but functional design, botanical femininity, no straight edges.

### Core Principles:
- **Whiplash Curves**: S-curves and flowing lines, nothing angular
- **Natural Motifs**: Flowers, vines, hair, water - nature as structure
- **Organic Architecture**: Buildings that could be plants, structures that grow
- **Feminine Aesthetic**: Long flowing hair, draped fabrics, soft power, grace
- **Stained Glass**: Light through colored glass flowers and botanical patterns
- **Asymmetric Balance**: Natural arrangement rather than geometric symmetry

### Color Palette:
Pastels, earth tones, jewel tones - spring greens, dusty roses, warm golds, deep purples. Colors flow into each other like gradients.

## Music: Romantic / Impressionist Fusion
Debussy, Ravel, but with more romantic sweep. Harp prominent. Flowing melodies that curve like vines. Waltz rhythms (3/4 time). Natural sound integration - birdsong, water, wind.

## Voice Acting:
Soft, flowing, musical voices. Sentences curve and flow. Emphasis on beauty in speech. Lots of sustained vowels, minimal hard consonants.
