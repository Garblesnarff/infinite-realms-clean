# Creative Brief: The Seeker's Trial

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Tactical Dark Fantasy with Strategic Emphasis (Hunter x Hunter-inspired)

Inspired by the strategic depth and moral complexity of *Hunter x Hunter*, with clean character designs that emphasize personality, calculated combat with visible energy systems, and dark fantasy elements that don't shy from consequence. This style captures intense psychological warfare, creative power applications, and the weight of impossible choices.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Intelligence and Strategy:** Characters in thinking poses, visible aura systems showing tactical advantage, environmental manipulation
*   **Clean but Detailed:** Realistic proportions with distinct personal style, detailed expressions showing psychology
*   **Aura Visualization:** Nen energy as visible colored auras, different manifestations per type (enhancement glow, emission beams, conjured objects, manipulation strings)
*   **Moral Complexity:** Characters with sympathetic antagonists, creatures that blur human/monster lines, scenes showing difficult choices

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Strategic, psychological, morally complex, brutal examination, mastery, evolution, calculated, willpower, consequence
*   **Feeling:** Tension of outsmarting opponents rather than overpowering them. Weight of choices with no right answers. Respect between worthy adversaries. Horror of evolution beyond human comprehension.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, detailed linework with realistic proportions but stylized faces that convey personality instantly
*   **Forms:** Characters appear grounded and human with practical clothing. Nen abilities manifesting as clear visual effects. Chimera designs mix insect anatomy with other creatures seamlessly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed anime-style digital painting of a young Seeker in a thinking pose, hand on chin. Their visible aura—a soft white glow—surrounds them, concentrated at their eyes showing Gyo technique. Clean linework with realistic proportions. Behind them, a mind-map of tactical possibilities floats as thought bubbles."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Relatively realistic, naturalistic colors with pops of saturated aura colors
*   **Aura Colors:** Each character's Nen manifests in signature colors—white for basic aura, personalized hues for abilities (purple electricity, yellow constructs, red enhancement)
*   **Environmental:** Urban grays and browns contrasted with lush greens of examination forests, stark whites of combat arenas
*   **Prompt Example:** "...realistic color palette with muted greens of the forest examination zone. The characters' Nen auras glow in contrasting colors—one with purple transmuted electricity, another with blue conjured chains. Environmental details show trampled grass and broken branches from combat."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Each character has distinctive clothing and accessories reflecting personality, not generic fantasy armor
*   **Practical Fashion:** Modern-casual mixed with functional gear—jacket with hidden weapons, practical boots, distinctive hairstyles
*   **Nen Type Indicators:** Subtle visual cues to Nen type—Enhancers appear muscular and straightforward, Manipulators often have props, Specialists have unique quirks
*   **Chimera Design:** Horrifying but beautiful fusion of insect exoskeleton with other creature features and human intelligence in eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young Seeker wearing a green jacket over a white shirt, distinctive spiky hair, and practical boots. Their hands crackle with enhanced aura—yellow-green energy coating their fists. Next to them, an assassin friend with silver-white hair, wearing a sleek dark outfit with skateboard. A magician-jester character in the background with red hair styled upward, dressed in theatrical clothes with playing card motifs."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Diverse settings from urban to wilderness to impossible game worlds, all with tactical elements visible
*   **Examination Zones:** Deadly but logical environments—trick towers with trap mechanisms visible, forests with dangerous fauna, urban arenas with exploitable cover
*   **Game World:** Greed Island shows fantasy landscapes that appear real, with game-card aesthetic elements integrated
*   **Chimera Territory:** Conquered nations with creeping insect hive architecture overtaking human buildings
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive tower prison carved from stone, showing multiple trap mechanisms—swinging axes, pit falls, moving walls—all visible to show the strategic puzzle. Small figures of examination candidates navigate paths. Dark oppressive atmosphere but clear geometry showing the mental challenge."

**6. Nen Abilities and Combat:**
*   **Style:** Each ability is visually distinct and clearly communicated, showing both beauty and tactical function
*   **Enhancement:** Aura coating body parts with glow and intensity lines
*   **Emission:** Energy blasts with trailing particle effects, clear trajectory lines
*   **Transmutation:** Aura changing properties (electricity crackling, gum stretching, blade sharpness)
*   **Conjuration:** Solid objects materializing from aura (chains, weapons, rooms) with magical circles
*   **Manipulation:** Visible strings or waves of influence connecting user to target
*   **Combat Philosophy:** Emphasis on strategy over spectacle—small, precise moves with huge impact
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tactical combat scene showing a Nen battle. One fighter concentrates all their aura into their fist using Ko—the arm glowing intensely white-yellow while the rest of their body is suppressed. Their opponent uses Zetsu to completely hide their aura, appearing as a normal person, preparing a surprise attack. Visible aura trails and concentration points show the strategic depth. Environment shows exploitable terrain."

**7. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Realistic lighting with dramatic shadows during tense moments, Nen auras providing colored light sources
*   **Aura Illumination:** Characters glow softly when using Ren, intensely when using Hatsu
*   **Psychological Lighting:** Dark shadows during moral dilemmas, harsh overhead lighting during examinations
*   **Purpose:** Create tension through lighting choices, highlight strategic moments, show emotional states
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the glow of the character's purple Nen aura in an otherwise dark room. Strong shadows emphasize the psychological tension. Their eyes show tactical calculation through sharp highlights. The opponent is backlit, appearing as a threatening silhouette."

**8. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Strategic framing that shows both combatants and environment, emphasizing chess-match aspects
*   **Techniques:** Split-screen showing simultaneous action, overhead tactical views, close-ups of intense eyes during psychological warfare, environmental context always visible
*   **Intelligence Focus:** Compositions that show characters thinking, strategizing, and adapting rather than just fighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition showing the Seeker exam. Left panel: overhead tactical view showing candidate positions in a forest like pieces on a board, with paths and sightlines visible. Right panel: close-up of the protagonist's eyes showing intense focus and calculation as they analyze the situation. Both panels connected by visible thought-lines showing strategic planning."

## Voice

A calm, calculated voice with understated intensity, like a master strategist who sees twelve moves ahead. The pacing is measured during analysis, quick during tactical execution, slow and heavy during moral weight. The tone shifts between clinical observation, genuine respect for worthy adversaries, and barely controlled determination. There's an underlying theme of "willpower conquers all" and "the cost of power." Slight breathiness during extended Nen use. Role: The voice of strategic mastery and the weight of consequence.
