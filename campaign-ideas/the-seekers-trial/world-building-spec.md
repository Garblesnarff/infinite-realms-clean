### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Seeker's Trial**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Professional Seekers hunt treasures, monsters, and men in a world where passing the brutal Seeker Examination (1-in-10,000 survival rate) grants access to Nen—life energy manipulated through willpower. The party must pass the exam, master their unique Nen abilities, and ultimately face the Chimera Swarm—evolved monsters consuming humans to birth a king who threatens all civilization through overwhelming power and terrifying intelligence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the discovery and history of Nen, why it's kept secret from non-Seekers, and the philosophical debate about restricting such power.
    *   Write the history of the Seeker Association's formation and its role in maintaining world order.
    *   Describe the Dark Continent—a forbidden landmass where the Chimera Ants originated, filled with impossibly dangerous creatures.
    *   Explain the five calamities that previous expeditions brought back from the Dark Continent and why it's now restricted.
    *   Detail the legendary Seekers of previous generations and their contributions to Nen theory.
    *   Describe the Zoldyck family—legendary assassins who've mastered transmutation and manipulation techniques.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A party member develops a Nen ability with severe conditions/restrictions.
    *   **THEN:** The ability's power increases proportionally to restriction severity. Generate scene of them successfully using it at crucial moment, then scene of restriction preventing use at worst possible time. NPCs comment on the clever but risky ability design.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats a Phantom Troupe member.
    *   **THEN:** The entire Troupe targets them for revenge—they never forgive the death of a member. Generate scene of remaining members swearing vengeance. Party gains reputation as legendary but now permanently hunted.
    *   **IF:** A party member overcomes their Nen initiation and discovers their type.
    *   **THEN:** Unlock type-specific ability tree. Generate personality-based revelation scene where their Nen type perfectly matches their nature. Master teacher provides guidance on developing Hatsu.
    *   **IF:** The party learns Gyo and uses it to see hidden Nen.
    *   **THEN:** Previously invisible abilities, traps, and aura concentrations become visible. Generate scene revealing enemy's hidden technique. Enemies adapt by using Zetsu more frequently.
    *   **IF:** The party participates in the Palace Invasion.
    *   **THEN:** Split them into separate infiltration teams facing different Royal Guards. Generate parallel combat encounters showcasing each Guard's unique abilities. Time pressure mechanics as King's En detection pulses.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to spare or negotiate with Chimera Ants who show humanity.
    *   **THEN:** Some ants become allies, providing intelligence and assistance. However, other humans view this as betrayal. Generate scene of conflicted ant choosing between species loyalty and newfound humanity.
    *   **IF:** Chairman Netero sacrifices himself to wound the King with the poison bomb.
    *   **THEN:** Massive power vacuum in Seeker Association. The King survives but is slowly dying from radiation poisoning. Generate scene of King's final philosophical conversation with Komugi, showing his evolution. World learns how close extinction was.
    *   **IF:** The party develops an ability that requires revealing it to opponents to work.
    *   **THEN:** The ability gains significant power boost per Nen contract theory. Generate scene of tactical explanation serving as distraction while real strategy unfolds. Enemies may find counterplay after hearing explanation.
