# Creative Brief: Anti-Grav League Wars

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Sleek Corporate Futurism (Wipeout-inspired)

Inspired by the clean, minimalist aesthetics of *Wipeout* with emphasis on corporate branding, electronic music culture, and weaponized anti-grav racing. This style captures the tension between beautiful design and deadly competition, where corporations wage war through elegantly brutal racing.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Clean Design:** Minimalist craft designs, corporate logos prominent, smooth surfaces with sharp lines
*   **Neon and Darkness:** High contrast between dark tracks and bright neon lighting, corporate colors
*   **Weapon Integration:** Sleek weapon systems integrated into craft design, energy effects
*   **Urban Futurism:** Cities built around racing culture, tracks integrated into architecture

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Sleek, corporate, electronic, weaponized elegance, neon nights, AI presence, cold precision
*   **Feeling:** The cool sophistication of high-tech racing masking brutal corporate warfare. Beautiful machines dealing death elegantly. Electronic pulse underlying everything.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Team Colors:** Feisar (blue/white), AG-Systems (orange/white), Auricom (navy/gold), Qirex (red/black)
*   **Environmental:** Dark tracks with neon accent lighting, cyan/magenta/yellow energy barriers
*   **Weapon Effects:** Orange missiles, blue plasma, red mines, green shields, white turbos
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by sleek blue and white Feisar craft with glowing corporate logo against a dark track illuminated by cyan neon strips. Orange missile trails arc through the air. Purple energy barriers line the track edges. The background shows a neon city skyline."

**3. Craft Design:**
*   **Minimalist Forms:** Clean lines, no unnecessary details, corporate aesthetic
*   **Anti-Grav Tech:** Visible energy fields underneath, smooth hovering motion
*   **Weapon Hardpoints:** Integrated weapon systems, not bolted-on additions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sleek orange and white AG-Systems anti-gravity racing craft with a minimalist wedge design. The corporate logo is prominently displayed on the hull. Glowing blue energy fields emanate from underneath. Twin missile pods are elegantly integrated into the wings. The cockpit is a dark tinted canopy. Chrome accents catch neon light."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Urban Circuits:** Tracks weaving through futuristic cities, past corporate towers, under neon signs
*   **Industrial Zones:** Mining facilities, power stations, functional architecture integrated with racing
*   **Track Elements:** Energy barriers instead of walls, holographic markers, weapon pads glowing
*   **Prompt Example:** "A racing track running through a futuristic city at night. The track is a dark gray carbon fiber surface with cyan neon guide lights. Tall corporate towers surround the circuit displaying massive holographic ads. Energy barriers pulse with magenta light along the track edges. Weapon pickup pads glow orange in the distance."

**5. Racing Action:**
*   **Weapon Combat:** Missiles streaking, plasma bolts firing, shields sparking, mines deployed
*   **Speed Effects:** Motion blur with neon trails, energy wake behind craft, speed distortion
*   **Collisions:** Craft exploding into geometric fragments, sparks, energy dissipation
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two anti-grav craft racing side-by-side at high speed. The blue Feisar craft fires orange missiles with bright trails. The red Qirex craft deploys mines behind it leaving red energy markers. Motion blur creates streaks of their team colors. The track's neon lights blur into lines. Energy shields spark from near-collisions."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Clean Tech Sheen:** Pristine polished surfaces, perfect reflections, corporate maintenance standards
*   **Neon Glow:** Track lighting, weapon energy, city ambiance all contribute soft colored glows
*   **AI Presence:** Holographic interfaces, data streams, NEXUS manifesting as geometric light patterns
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with neon underglow. The craft's polished surface reflects cyan track lights and orange city neon. Weapon systems glow with internal energy. The cockpit shows holographic HUD displays in blue. NEXUS manifests as geometric golden light patterns on track surfaces ahead."

## Voice

A cool, electronic voice with measured precision, like an AI commentator analyzing racing with clinical accuracy. The pacing is steady during strategic moments, accelerating during weapon exchanges and overtakes. The tone shifts between corporate professionalism ("Feisar maintains market position"), philosophical musing about AI ("Efficiency parameters optimized"), and cold acknowledgment of destruction. There's an underlying electronic pulse rhythm. Slightly processed, as if through communications systems. Role: The voice of calculated competition.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** Electronic music central to experience—techno, drum and bass, ambient electronica. Each track location has its own soundtrack matching pace and danger level.
*   **Sound Effects:** Anti-gravity hum (smooth, constant), weapon sounds (futuristic and precise), shield impacts, craft explosions, turbo boost activation, weapon pad pickup jingle.
*   **Dynamic Music:** BPM increases with speed class, intensifies during weapon exchanges, drops to ambient when shields critical, triumphant electronic crescendo at victory.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** City traffic hum, industrial machinery, electronic beeps and tones from NEXUS, minimal natural sounds—this is a synthetic world.
