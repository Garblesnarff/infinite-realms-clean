**Title:** The Flashpoint Paradox
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Paradox / Alternate Reality / Moral Dilemma / Dark Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **10** → Finish **17**
**Tone (keywords):** altered reality, dark consequences, time paradox, moral weight, world at war
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Swift, the legendary speedster hero, has done the unthinkable—traveled back in time to save their murdered mother, changing a single moment in history. But this act of love has created the Flashpoint: an alternate timeline where the world is at war, heroes never formed, and villains rule kingdoms. The players wake in this twisted reality with vague memories of the "real" world. They must convince Swift that saving one life has doomed millions, navigate a world where former allies are enemies, and help restore the original timeline—even though it means Swift's mother dies again.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

One moment changed, the whole world broken.

*   **Act I — Welcome to Flashpoint (Sessions 1–5):** The players wake in a world that's wrong. The kingdom of Atlantis is at war with the Amazonian Empire. Heroes they knew are villains or never existed. Cities are battlefields. Only the players seem to have fragmented memories of another timeline. They discover Swift hiding in this world, haunted by what they've done but unable to undo it without losing their mother. The party must survive in a world at war while piecing together what changed and why.
*   **Act II — The War of Gods (Sessions 6–11):** The players navigate the Flashpoint timeline, witnessing its horrors firsthand. Atlantis, led by the vengeful Emperor Aquarian, floods coastal cities. The Amazon Queen Antiope conquers nations with her armies. The few surviving heroes are broken, twisted versions of themselves. The party must unite fractured allies, stop catastrophic battles, and search for the Chronomancer—a wizard who might have the power to fix time itself.
*   **Act III — The Choice (Sessions 12–15+):** The players and Swift reach the moment where time can be corrected. But fixing it requires Swift to let their mother die again—and may erase the Flashpoint timeline's inhabitants from existence. The party must decide: restore the original timeline and condemn this world to never-existing, find a way to merge the timelines, or accept the Flashpoint as the new reality. Their choice will determine the fate of two worlds.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Swift** — *The Guilty Time-Traveler*
    *   **Role:** The speedster who changed time to save their mother, now haunted by the consequences.
    *   **Personality:** Guilt-ridden, desperate, and conflicted. They know what they did was selfish but can't bring themselves to undo it.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They've tried multiple times to "fix" the Flashpoint without losing their mother, but every attempt makes things worse.

2.  **Emperor Aquarian** — *The Vengeful Atlantean*
    *   **Role:** Ruler of Atlantis, at war with the surface world after his beloved was killed in this timeline.
    *   **Personality:** Grief-stricken rage given form. He was once heroic but the Flashpoint's changes twisted his tragedy.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** In the original timeline, he and his love were heroes together. The Flashpoint erased her differently, driving him to vengeance.

3.  **Amazon Queen Antiope** — *The Conqueror*
    *   **Role:** Leader of the Amazonian Empire, conquering the world in the name of her fallen sister.
    *   **Personality:** Ruthless, martial, and convinced that only Amazon rule can bring peace.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** In the original timeline, she was an honored warrior but not a conqueror. The Flashpoint warped her into something darker.

4.  **The Chronomancer** — *Master of Time*
    *   **Role:** A mysterious wizard who understands temporal mechanics and might help restore the timeline.
    *   **Personality:** Detached, viewing time as a tapestry to be observed, not interfered with.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They know that fixing the Flashpoint may erase them too, as they don't exist in the original timeline.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of unintended consequences, the cost of changing fate, and the weight of moral choices. The central conflict is between personal happiness and universal good. Can one person's grief justify dooming millions? And if two timelines exist, which one is "real"? Who has the right to decide which world deserves to exist?

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Fragmented Memories**
*   Players have advantage on checks related to knowledge from the "original" timeline, but must make Wisdom saves to avoid confusion when their memories conflict with reality.
*   As the campaign progresses, original timeline memories become clearer while Flashpoint memories fade—or vice versa, depending on choices.

### 2. **Butterfly Effect Tracker**
*   Every time the players make a significant change in the Flashpoint timeline, roll on a Butterfly Effect table.
*   Changes can stabilize the timeline (making it harder to fix), create new problems, or offer unexpected opportunities.

### 3. **The Restoration Choice**
*   At the campaign's climax, the party must vote on what to do:
    *   **Restore**: Original timeline returns, Flashpoint never existed, Swift's mother dies.
    *   **Merge**: Attempt to combine elements of both timelines (extremely risky, unpredictable results).
    *   **Accept**: Keep the Flashpoint as the new reality and find peace with the changes.
*   The choice has permanent, campaign-ending consequences that should be honored in future play.
