### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Flashpoint Paradox**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Swift changed time to save their mother, creating the Flashpoint: a war-torn alternate timeline. The players must convince Swift to restore the original timeline, navigate a world at war, and help fix time—even though it means losing Swift's mother again.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the moment Swift changed: what they did and how it rippled through time.
    *   Write how the Flashpoint timeline diverged: key events that changed differently.
    *   Describe the war between Atlantis and the Amazons: its origin and current state.
    *   Explain what happened to heroes in the Flashpoint: who died, who turned villain, who never rose.
    *   Detail the Time Nexus and how temporal mechanics work.
    *   Write about those who remember the original timeline and why.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** Create detailed profiles for each faction.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Memory Bearers** (player faction): Those who remember the original timeline and seek to restore it.
    *   **Atlantean Empire**: Vengeful kingdom flooding the surface world.
    *   **Amazonian Conquerors**: Militant empire conquering nations.
    *   **Resistance Cells**: Scattered survivors trying to survive the war.
    *   **Swift's Allies**: Those who want to help Swift but don't know about time travel.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Swift, Emperor Aquarian, Queen Antiope, The Chronomancer, Swift's Mother.
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Flashpoint Hero" (twisted version), "War Refugee", "Atlantean Soldier", "Amazon Warrior", "Time-Displaced Person".

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **New Themyscira:** Amazon capital, militaristic fortress.
*   **Sunken Europe:** Flooded coastal cities.
*   **The Wasteland:** War-torn former cities.
*   **The Time Nexus:** Where time was changed and can be fixed.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Players convince Swift to restore the timeline → Generate the restoration sequence.
*   **IF:** A major Flashpoint hero joins the party → Their presence stabilizes or destabilizes reality.
*   **IF:** The war escalates to mutual destruction → Generate apocalypse scenario, forcing immediate action.
*   **IF:** Players choose to merge timelines → Generate unpredictable hybrid reality consequences.
