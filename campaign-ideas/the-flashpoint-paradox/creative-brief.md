# Creative Brief: The Flashpoint Paradox

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark War-Torn Fantasy (Flashpoint Comics Style)

Inspired by the dark, war-torn aesthetic of DC's *Flashpoint* storyline. This style captures a world at war, twisted heroes, and the visual dissonance of a timeline gone wrong.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Wrongness:** Show familiar heroes and locations but twisted, darker, more militaristic.
*   **War-Torn Landscape:** Constant battle damage, flooded cities, burned territories, ash and rain.
*   **Contrasting Memories:** Visual echoes of the "right" timeline bleeding through—double exposures, ghost images.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Alternate reality, war-torn, dark, dissonant, wrongness, militaristic, tragic consequences.
*   **Feeling:** Everything is familiar but wrong. The atmosphere is oppressive, violent, and tragic.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated with harsh reds and oranges from war. Grays, browns, and dark blues dominate. Occasional bright flashes of memory showing vibrant "right" timeline colors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, desaturated color palette of war—grays, browns, blood reds—with ghostly overlays of vibrant blues and golds from the original timeline bleeding through."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Flashpoint Heroes:** Darker, more militaristic versions—heavier armor, weapons instead of symbols, grimmer expressions.
*   **Swift:** Haunted, wearing damaged costume, lightning trails tinged with darkness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Guardian in Flashpoint—wearing black, battle-scarred armor instead of bright colors, face grimmer, wielding weapons, with faint ghost image of their heroic original self."

**4. Backgrounds:**
*   **Style:** War zones, flooded coastal cities, Amazon fortresses, Atlantean occupied territories, battlefields.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A flooded European city, half-submerged buildings, Atlantean war-machines patrolling, ash falling like snow, with faint ghostly overlays of the city as it was in the original timeline."

**5. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses split or overlay compositions showing both timelines simultaneously, emphasizing the wrongness and dissonance.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split-screen composition: left shows the war-torn Flashpoint world, right shows the same location in the original timeline, with Swift standing between them, hand outstretched toward the original timeline."
