# Creative Brief: When Magic Rises

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Urban Fantasy with Magic Waves (Kate Daniels-inspired)

Inspired by the magic apocalypse of *Kate Daniels* where technology fails and magic surges in waves. This style captures post-Shift Atlanta's ruins rebuilt with magic, shapeshifter pack dynamics, ancient power manifesting, and the stark contrast between magic waves and tech waves.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Magic-Tech Contrast:** Ruined skyscrapers next to magic-built structures, dead cars, torchlight and swords
*   **Power Escalation:** From street mercenary fights to reality-warping god battles
*   **Shapeshifter Prowess:** Large predator forms, pack formations, beast lords radiating dominance
*   **Ancient Magic:** Power words causing reality distortion, ancient artifacts glowing with power

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Post-apocalyptic magic, power escalation, shapeshifter packs, ancient gods, Atlanta ruins, wave cycles
*   **Feeling:** A world rebuilt after magic destroyed technology. Ancient powers returning. The strong survive through skill and strength.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Post-Shift Atlanta:** Gray concrete ruins, green vegetation overtaking buildings, torch orange
*   **Magic Waves:** Glowing magical energy in blues, purples, whites—unnatural colors
*   **Shapeshifters:** Natural animal colors but more vibrant—golden manes, silver fur, black pelts
*   **Prompt Example:** "...post-apocalyptic Atlanta street with ruined skyscrapers overgrown with vegetation. Torches provide orange light. During magic wave, blue-purple magical energy crackles through the air. A massive golden lion shapeshifter patrols. Contrast between nature reclaiming and magical energy."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Mercenaries:** Practical armor, swords (guns fail in magic), tactical but medieval-inspired
*   **Shapeshifters in Human Form:** Powerful builds, predatory grace, eyes that reflect animal nature
*   **Beast Forms:** Larger than natural animals, more powerful, intelligent eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A female mercenary in practical leather armor with sword at hip. Athletic build, determined expression, scars showing experience. Behind her, ruins of Atlanta with the Keep (massive fortress) visible. Carries both sword and magical artifacts. Post-apocalyptic but capable."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Atlanta Ruins:** Modern city partially destroyed, rebuilt with magic-compatible materials
*   **The Keep:** Massive stone fortress, shapeshifter pack headquarters, imposing and defended
*   **Magic Zones:** Areas where reality bends, ancient power manifests, dangerous beauty
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Keep—massive stone fortress with medieval architecture but modern scale. Pack territories marked with banners. Shapeshifters in various forms patrol walls. Built to withstand magic waves and tech waves. Atlanta ruins visible in background. Imposing, defended, pack stronghold."

**5. Magic and Combat:**
*   **Power Words:** Reality distorting around speaker, visible shockwaves of power
*   **Shapeshifting:** Dramatic transformation sequences, bodies reshaping mid-combat
*   **Magical Combat:** Swords glowing with power, vampires swarming, ancient creatures from myth
*   **Prompt Example:** "Combat scene during magic wave. A warrior speaks a power word—reality visibly distorts around them in concentric waves. Facing them, undead vampires swarm forward, controlled by distant necromancer. Blue magical energy crackles. Ruined street as battlefield. High-power magical combat."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Magic Wave Lighting:** Unnatural glow from magical sources, torches, power effects
*   **Tech Wave Lighting:** Natural light, dimmer without magic enhancement
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by blue-purple magical wave energy, creating dramatic shadows. Torches add orange highlights. The magic wave makes everything slightly more vibrant and dangerous. Shapeshifter eyes reflect light with predatory gleam. Post-apocalyptic atmospheric lighting."

## Voice

A tough, sarcastic voice with underlying deadly competence. The pacing builds from street-level combat to apocalyptic god battles. The tone shifts between mercenary professionalism, pack loyalty, dark humor, and determination to survive impossible odds. There's an underlying theme of growing into power. Slightly crude humor masking genuine heroism. Role: The voice of a survivor who refuses to be defined by bloodline.
