They discover they're caught in an ancient conflict between gods, with one party member possibly descended from legendary power. As they navigate the Pack (shapeshifter society), the Order of Merciful Aid (knight defenders), vampires controlled by necromantic Masters, and the terrifying fae, they uncover a conspiracy involving Roland—an ancient being who has destroyed civilizations. The final confrontation will determine whether Atlanta survives, whether magic or technology dominates, and whether ancient powers can reclaim their thrones.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act arc of escalating power, ancient revelations, and apocalyptic confrontations.

*   **Act I — Mercenary Life (Sessions 1-5):** The party establishes themselves as mercenaries in post-Shift Atlanta, working for the Mercenary Guild while navigating the treacherous politics of the Pack (shapeshifters), the Order (knights), and the People (vampires). They learn about magic waves that shut down technology, how to fight undead and rogue magic, and the complex territorial divisions of Atlanta. A party member discovers hidden heritage or power, drawing attention from ancient forces. They're recruited by the Order or challenged by the Pack.
*   **Act II — Pack Politics and Power (Sessions 6-12):** A party member becomes entangled with the Pack, possibly as mate to Curran, the Beast Lord (alpha of all Atlanta shapeshifters). They navigate internal Pack politics, challenge duels, and territorial disputes. Meanwhile, they discover that one of them is descended from Roland, an ancient wizard-king who destroyed Atlantis and countless civilizations. The People's necromancers grow aggressive, attacking with vampire hordes. Ancient artifacts and power words (words of power that reshape reality) surface, suggesting Roland is preparing to return.
*   **Act III — Roland's Shadow (Sessions 13-18):** The party discovers Roland is not just returning—he's been manipulating events for millennia. One party member is his daughter/son, hunted by him for their power or to eliminate the only threat to his rule. They must grow in power to face someone who destroyed entire civilizations. They learn power words, forge alliances with fae (dangerous but necessary), and discover ancient weapons. Hugh d'Ambray, Roland's Warlord, launches attacks with armies of undead and constructs. The party must defend Atlanta while growing strong enough to face a demigod.
*   **Act IV — The God War (Sessions 19-25):** Roland arrives, bringing ancient magic that threatens to reshape reality. The party must unite shapeshifters, knights, vampires, fae, and witches against an enemy who has toppled empires. They face Roland's generals, ancient creatures of myth, and finally Roland himself—a being thousands of years old with magic that rewrites the laws of nature. The final battle determines Atlanta's fate, whether technology or magic dominates the world, and whether the party member with Roland's blood can surpass their father or must sacrifice themselves to stop him. Some may become Pack alphas, others may claim divine mantles, and the world will never be the same.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of destiny versus choice, whether bloodline determines character, power's corrupting influence, and fighting against forces that seem invincible. It asks: Are you defined by your parents? Can ancient evil be redeemed? Is power worth the cost? The central conflict pits the party against an ancient being who has destroyed civilizations, while one of them carries his blood and must choose whether to repeat history or forge a new path.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Magic Waves**
*   Magic and technology are mutually exclusive
*   During magic waves: tech fails, magic surges, undead rise, supernatural creatures strengthen
*   During tech waves: magic fails, guns work, modern equipment functions
*   Must plan operations around wave timing

### 2. **Power Words**
*   Ancient language that shapes reality itself
*   Speaking a power word correctly can kill, heal, command, or reshape
*   Each word requires immense power and concentration
*   Wrong pronunciation is catastrophically dangerous

### 3. **Pack Hierarchy**
*   Shapeshifters organize in strict hierarchy led by Beast Lord
*   Challenge duels can change leadership
*   Loup status (losing humanity to beast) is death sentence
*   Mates of alphas must be strong enough to hold position

### 4. **Vampiric Navigation**
*   Vampires are mindless undead controlled by necromancers
*   Navigators "pilot" vampires from remote locations
*   Master navigators control multiple vampires simultaneously
*   Vampires show navigator's personality and skills

### 5. **The Flare**
*   Periodic magic surges of incredible intensity
*   Technology fails completely, magic reaches apocalyptic levels
*   Ancient creatures awaken, barriers between worlds thin
*   Most dangerous time but also most powerful

### 6. **Ancient Bloodlines**
*   Some characters descend from legendary beings
*   Bloodline powers manifest in crisis
*   Draw attention from ancient enemies and allies
*   Must choose whether to embrace or reject heritage

### 7. **Magic Nullification**
*   Some areas or beings nullify magic completely
*   Slayers (magic immune humans) exist and hunt magic users
*   Steel (cold iron) weakens many supernatural beings
*   Tech works in magic-null zones even during waves

### 8. **Lyc-V Virus**
*   Shapeshifting is caused by Lyc-V virus
*   Silver is deadly poison to shapeshifters
*   Full moon increases beast influence
*   New shapeshifters must learn control or go loup
