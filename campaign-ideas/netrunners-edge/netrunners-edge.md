# Netrunners' Edge

*A Cyberpunk / Heist campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Netrunners' Edge
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Cyberpunk / Heist / Virtual Reality
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** noir, cyberpunk, corporate dystopia, AI entities, virtual reality, street-level survival, transhumanism
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the neon-drenched corporate dystopia of New Chiba, the party consists of street-level operatives—hackers, muscle, fixers, and technomages—hired for increasingly dangerous runs against megacorporations. They're recruited by a mysterious AI entity called Wintermute who offers them the ultimate score: break into the most secure virtual fortress in existence and free another AI named Neuromancer, merging them into a new form of digital god. As they jack into cyberspace, navigate corporate black ice, and confront their own humanity's limits, they must decide whether to complete the run or stop a potentially catastrophic AI transcendence.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Mix of physical combat (corporate security, street gangs) and virtual battles (navigating cyberspace, fighting intrusion countermeasures).
*   **Investigation:** Puzzle-solving through hacking, social engineering, and discovering what Wintermute really wants.
*   **Consequences:** Characters risk cyberspace death (flatline), corporate retaliation, and losing their humanity to cybernetic augmentation addiction.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act structure following a classic heist escalation.

*   **Act I — The Setup (Sessions 1–4):** The party establishes themselves as capable runners, taking smaller jobs in New Chiba's underworld. Wintermute makes contact and recruits them for the big score.
*   **Act II — The Preparation (Sessions 5–8):** The party gathers intelligence, infiltrates corporate facilities, and assembles the tools needed to break into Tessier-Ashpool's virtual fortress while dodging corporate hunters.
*   **Act III — The Run (Sessions 9–12):** The final heist—jacking into cyberspace, fighting through layers of black ice, freeing Neuromancer, and confronting the consequences of their actions as the AIs merge.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Sprawl (New Chiba):** Urban nightmare of neon, poverty, and corporate towers. Endless rain, street markets, augmentation clinics.

4.  **Villa Straylight:** Tessier-Ashpool's family estate in orbit, a maze of corridors, cloning labs, and AI cores.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is humanity versus post-humanity. As characters augment their bodies with cybernetics and interface with AIs, they risk losing what makes them human. The campaign asks: is transcendence evolution or death? Should godlike AIs be freed or imprisoned? What remains of you when flesh becomes obsolete?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Cyberspace Navigation**
*   Players can "jack in" to cyberspace, entering a virtual realm where INT and hacking skills matter more than STR.
*   **Black Ice:** Virtual defenses that deal real damage, potentially killing the user's physical body.

### 2. **Cybernetic Augmentation**
*   Characters can install cyberware (enhanced reflexes, weapons, sensors) but accumulate "Humanity Loss."
*   **Chrome Death:** At zero Humanity, characters become psychopathic shells.

### 3. **Corporate Heat Tracker**
*   Failed runs or leaving evidence increases Corporate Heat. High Heat brings hunter-killer teams.

### 4. **The Digital Choice**
*   In the finale, characters can choose digital immortality—upload consciousness to cyberspace, gaining power but losing physical existence.
