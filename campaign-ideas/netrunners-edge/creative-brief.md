# Creative Brief: Netrunners' Edge

## Art Style: Classic Cyberpunk Noir (Blade Runner meets The Matrix)

Neon-soaked streets, rain-slicked alleys, towering corporate arcologies contrasted with virtual reality's abstract geometry. This style captures 1980s cyberpunk aesthetics updated with modern visual effects.

### Core Principles:
*   **Neon and Shadow:** High contrast between bright neon signs and deep urban darkness.
*   **Grit and Chrome:** Physical world is dirty and decaying; cyberspace is clean, geometric, abstract.
*   **Augmented Humanity:** Show cybernetic enhancements visibly—chrome limbs, mirrored eyes, data ports.

### Color Palette:
*   **The Sprawl:** Neon pinks, electric blues, toxic greens against black shadows and gray concrete.
*   **Cyberspace:** Pure digital colors—bright whites, data-stream blues, alert reds, geometric patterns.
*   **Corporate Spaces:** Sterile whites, cold blues, suggesting inhuman efficiency.

### Character Design:
*   **Street Runners:** Practical armor, visible cybernetics, worn leather, neon-lit tattoos.
*   **Corporate Security:** Faceless helmets, black tactical gear, standardized and inhuman.
*   **AIs in Cyberspace:** Geometric humanoid forms made of light, code, and mathematics.

### Environments:
*   **The Sprawl:** Endless urban density, holographic ads, rain, steam from vents, crowds of augmented citizens.
*   **Cyberspace:** Abstract 3D grids, data towers, geometric structures floating in void, streams of light representing information.

## Voice

A world-weary, noir-influenced voice with a slight rasp—someone who's seen too much chrome and too little humanity. Pacing is quick and street-smart, using slang and technical jargon. Audio has slight digital distortion, as if transmitted through damaged circuits. Role: A netrunner recounting a legendary run, a street fixer offering work.
