# Creative Brief: The Buried Empire

## Art Style: Ancient Majesty meets Archaeological Wonder

Inspired by Indiana Jones, Stargate, ancient Egyptian and Greek aesthetics, the crystalline stasis of suspended animation, and Lovecraftian "things that should stay buried." Emphasizes pristine ancient wonder alongside creeping corruption.

### Visual Principles:
* **Frozen in Time**: Everything perfectly preserved—no dust, no decay, just sleeping.
* **Crystal Stasis**: Citizens visible in transparent crystals, beautiful and eerie.
* **Majestic Architecture**: Impossibly grand buildings showing advanced civilization.
* **Creeping Corruption**: As seals weaken, darkness seeps in—black veins through pristine white marble.

### Color Palette:
Pristine whites, golds, and marble for Aethermoor proper. Cool blues and purples for stasis crystals. Deep black for the corruption. Torchlight and magical illumination in warm tones. Contrast between ancient perfection and modern decay as surface world items enter.

### Character Design:
Aethermorians in perfect ancient clothing—togas, robes, formal wear frozen mid-action. Surface characters look rough and dirty by comparison. Awakened Aethermorians confused by modern clothing. The Consuming Dark appears as absence—silhouette against light, wrong shadows.

## Music Direction:
Ancient epic—choirs, harps, formal compositions when exploring untouched areas. Silence in crystal gardens. Increasingly discordant music as corruption spreads. Language barrier music—Aethermorian instruments sound beautiful but alien.

## Voice Acting:
Aethermorians speak archaic formal language. Empress Solaria commands with absolute authority, disoriented by time passage. Sentinel Construct speaks in precise formal diction, hiding terrible knowledge. The Void Sage speaks with prophetic madness. The Consuming Dark makes no sound—its presence creates silence.
