### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Bloodless Terror**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Across the desert borderlands, livestock are being found dead—completely drained of blood with strange puncture wounds. Locals blame the legendary Chupacabra, but the players discover the truth is far stranger: the creature is not a natural predator but an escaped specimen from a secret government facility conducting xenobiological experiments. The players must track the creature through the desert, uncover the conspiracy behind its creation, and decide whether to kill it or expose the truth.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Chupacabra sightings in folklore versus the modern reality.
    *   Write the history of Facility Black Mesa and Project Xenogenesis.
    *   Describe the alien DNA used to create the hybrid creatures and its origin (recovered from a crash site).
    *   Explain the purpose of creating the Chupacabra as a potential bio-weapon.
    *   Detail the breakout event that released multiple specimens.
    *   Write about previous containment attempts and why they failed.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Ranchers and Locals** (Minor): Victims of the attacks, ranging from believers in folklore to skeptics.
    *   **Project Xenogenesis** (Major): Secret government program creating alien hybrids. Goals: recover specimens, silence witnesses. Led by shadowy directors.
    *   **The Cleanup Team** (Major): Field agents led by Agent Stone. Goals: eliminate or recover creatures, sanitize evidence, control narrative.
    *   **The Whistleblowers** (Minor): Scientists like Dr. Vasquez who feel guilty. Goals: help the players, expose the truth, save the creatures if possible.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Chupacabra (Specimen X-17), Dr. Elena Vasquez, Agent Marcus Stone, Ranch Owner Carlos Mendez
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Frightened Rancher," "Government Operative," "Captured Specimen," "Facility Guard"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Border Desert:** Isolated ranches, badlands, sparse communities
*   **Facility Black Mesa:** Underground research complex with holding cells, laboratories, and alien DNA storage
*   **The Badlands Nest:** Cave system where creatures have established territory

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Players expose the facility publicly → **THEN:** Government scrambles to cover up, higher-level agents respond, media attention creates chaos
*   **IF:** Players kill all specimens → **THEN:** Government thanks them quietly and threatens silence, the program continues elsewhere
*   **IF:** Players help creatures escape → **THEN:** Attacks continue elsewhere, government manhunt targets players and creatures
