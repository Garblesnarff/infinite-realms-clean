Across the desert borderlands, livestock are being found dead—completely drained of blood with strange puncture wounds. Locals blame the legendary Chupacabra, the "goat-sucker" cryptid, but the players discover the truth is far stranger: the creature is not a natural predator but an escaped specimen from a secret government facility conducting xenobiological experiments. The players must track the creature through the desert, uncover the conspiracy behind its creation, and decide whether to kill it or expose the truth.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6-10 sessions)

A desert investigation mixing cryptozoology, government conspiracy, and monster hunting.

*   **Act I — Blood in the Desert (Sessions 1–3):** The players are hired to investigate livestock killings attributed to the Chupacabra. They track the creature, witness an attack, and discover it's unlike any natural predator. Government agents arrive to "sanitize" the evidence.
*   **Act II — The Facility (Sessions 4–6):** Following clues, the party discovers a secret research station where the creature was created through alien DNA hybridization. They uncover evidence of multiple specimens and a breakout. The facility is being abandoned and sterilized.
*   **Act III — The Hunt (Sessions 7–10):** The players must track and confront the Chupacabra in its desert lair while avoiding government cleanup teams. They discover it's not alone—there are multiple creatures. The final choice: eliminate the threat or expose the conspiracy and protect the creatures.

## Major NPCs

    *   **Role:** A genetically engineered creature created from alien DNA recovered from a crash site, designed as a potential bioweapon.
    *   **Personality:** Intelligent but alien. Driven by hunger but shows problem-solving ability and can communicate simple concepts.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It's slowly dying—its hybrid physiology is unstable. It's desperate and increasingly aggressive as its condition deteriorates.

2.  **Dr. Elena Vasquez** — *The Guilty Scientist*
    *   **Role:** A xenobiologist who worked on the project and feels responsible for the creature's suffering and escape.
    *   **Personality:** Brilliant, guilt-ridden, and conflicted. She wants to help the creature but fears the consequences of the truth being revealed.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She helped the creature escape because she believed it deserved freedom, not knowing it would start killing.

3.  **Agent Marcus Stone** — *The Cleaner*
    *   **Role:** A government operative tasked with recovering or eliminating the specimens and silencing witnesses.
    *   **Personality:** Professional, ruthless, and pragmatic. He's not evil, just following orders to protect national security.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He's seen what happens when these projects go public—mass panic, careers destroyed, the program continues in secret anyway.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of scientific responsibility, government secrecy, and whether artificial life deserves protection. The central conflict is the players' choice between eliminating a dangerous predator or exposing a conspiracy and potentially protecting the creatures.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Tracking the Creature**
*   The Chupacabra is highly intelligent and leaves minimal evidence. Tracking requires:
    *   **Survival checks** to follow sparse tracks in desert terrain
    *   **Investigation checks** to analyze kill sites and behavior patterns
    *   **Insight checks** to predict where it will strike next based on available prey

### 2. **Government Interference**
*   Agent Stone and his team actively work against the players:
    *   Confiscating evidence
    *   Intimidating witnesses
    *   Tracking the players' movements
    *   Attempting capture if the players become too much of a liability
*   The DM can use this to create time pressure and moral dilemmas.

### 3. **The Chupacabra's Abilities**
*   **Blood Drain:** Paralytic saliva followed by precision blood extraction, leaving victims alive but weakened
*   **Desert Adaptation:** Can survive extreme heat, requires minimal water
*   **Camouflage:** Skin can shift colors to match desert environment
*   **Night Vision:** Most active at night with enhanced senses
*   **Intelligence:** Can set ambushes, use tools, and learn from mistakes
