### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Memory Keepers**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players live in a colorless, emotionless Community governed by Sameness. When one becomes Receiver of Memory, they experience humanity's past (color, love, war, pain) and discover the truth: the Community euthanizes those who don't conform. The party must escape, expose the truth, or overthrow Sameness.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   After an undefined past catastrophe, society chose Sameness—eliminating color, emotion, choice, and memory to prevent conflict.
*   The Receiver of Memory bears all of humanity's historical memories alone, advising the Elders on decisions.
*   "Release" is euphemistic euthanasia—the elderly, weak, rule-breakers, and non-conforming babies are killed.
*   Climate control eliminates weather variation. Genetic engineering eliminated physical differences.
*   Elsewhere—the world beyond the Community—still exists and is free but harsh.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Community (Controlling System):** Governed by Committee of Elders, maintains Sameness through pills, language precision, and release.
*   **The Elders (Antagonists):** Believe Sameness prevents suffering, willing to kill to maintain control.
*   **The Receiver (Player Role):** Sole keeper of memory, isolated by knowledge, advises Elders.
*   **The Awakened (Potential Allies):** Individuals who stopped taking pills or glimpsed truth, hiding their feelings.
*   **Elsewhere Communities (Unknown):** Other societies beyond the borders—some free, some equally controlled.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Giver (memory keeper), The Chief Elder (community leader), Jonas's Father (unwitting killer), Fiona (love interest), Gabriel (baby catalyst).
*   **Tier 2/3:** Community members (emotionless citizens), Elders, Nurturers, workers in various assignments.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Community:** Identical houses in precise rows, colorless, community centers, Assignment buildings, controlled climate.
*   **The Annex:** The Giver's dwelling, books (forbidden elsewhere), only location where Receiver sees color.
*   **The House of the Old:** Where elderly live before release, calm and sterile, euthanasia room hidden.
*   **The Nurturing Center:** Baby care facility, viewing rooms for family unit selection, release room for non-conforming infants.
*   **Elsewhere:** Natural world beyond borders—forests, rivers, weather, cold—freedom with hardship.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** Receiver shares memories with others → **THEN** they awaken to emotions but risk exposure and release.
*   **IF** party discovers what "release" means → **THEN** moral crisis and decision to act.
*   **IF** party stops taking pills → **THEN** emotions return but they must hide their awakening.
*   **IF** party escapes with Gabriel → **THEN** survival challenges in Elsewhere, hunted by Community.
*   **IF** party releases all memories to Community → **THEN** societal chaos as everyone experiences truth simultaneously.
*   **IF** party submits to Sameness → **THEN** hollow safety but loss of humanity.
