**6. Causality:**
*   IF party investigates too openly THEN Martin becomes aware and dangerous

*   IF party confronts Martin with evidence THEN he reveals playroom/attempts to kill them
*   IF Martin escapes initial confrontation THEN he flees country or accelerates killing
*   IF Lisbeth takes revenge on Bjurman THEN he hires assassins, escalating danger
*   IF party finds Anita Vanger THEN she leads them to Harriet in Australia
*   IF party exposes Vanger crimes publicly THEN family uses wealth to discredit/destroy them
*   IF Henrik dies before resolution THEN Harriet never gets closure, Martin inherits everything
*   IF party protects Lisbeth from assassins THEN she becomes loyal ally for future campaigns
*   IF conspiracy network is exposed THEN powerful enemies across society target the party
*   IF Harriet returns THEN family power structure collapses, Henrik finds peace
