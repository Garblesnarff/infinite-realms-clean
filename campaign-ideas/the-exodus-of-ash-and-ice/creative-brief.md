# The Exodus of Ash and Ice - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Apocalyptic Journey** - Road movie meets weather disaster, desperate survival aesthetic

**Colors**: Ash territories in oranges/blacks, ice lands in blues/whites, safe zones in precious greens

**Caravan Look**: Ragged, layered, protective gear against extremes, cultural diversity, thousand-yard stares

**Weather Titans**: Massive elemental beings, faces in ash clouds, eyes in blizzards, terrible majesty

## Music
- Journey Theme: Somber strings, persistent drums (endless march)
- Ash Lords: Rumbling bass, distorted heat, crackling fire
- Frost Titans: High crystalline sounds, cold drones, ice percussion
- Hope Theme: Fragile melody struggling against harsh environment

## Voice Acting
- Elder Smoke: Crackling fire, ash-choked, ancient rage
- Glacier Queen: Cold wind, ice creaking, patient inevitability
- Caravan Master Kael: Exhausted authority, moral weight
- Weather Warlord: Smooth manipulator hiding monstrosity

**Tagline**: "When Weather Wages War, Refugees Choose Survival"

**Key Art**: Massive refugee caravan between towering ash storm (left, orange) and ice blizzard (right, blue), tiny humans fleeing impossible forces
