# The Exodus of Ash and Ice
**When Weather Wages War, Refugees Choose Survival**

## Campaign Overview

The War of Seasons has made the world uninhabitable. The Ash Lords—conscious volcanic storms of superheated gas and choking smoke—battle the Frost Titans—sentient blizzards of absolute zero cold. Their conflict spans continents, reducing everything between to scorched wasteland or frozen tundra. Millions of refugees flee ahead of the weather fronts, seeking the narrow habitable zones that shift and shrink daily.

The party leads or joins a caravan of 10,000 refugees struggling to reach the rumored Temperate Sanctuary—a valley supposedly protected from both ash and ice by ancient wards. But the journey crosses hundreds of miles of contested territory where breathing the air can kill, where temperatures swing from deadly heat to lethal cold in hours, and where the weather itself hunts those who displease it.

Along the way, they'll discover this war wasn't random: Someone deliberately woke the sleeping weather titans and set them against each other. Someone benefits from the endless refugee crisis. And the Temperate Sanctuary may not be the haven promised—it may be a trap, or it may demand a price the refugees cannot afford to pay.

## Core Themes

- **Survival at Any Cost**: Moral compromises in desperate times
- **Leadership Under Pressure**: Making impossible choices
- **Refugee Crisis**: Displacement, loss, adaptation
- **Weather as Weapon**: Nature weaponized in ancient conflict
- **The Price of Safety**: What would you sacrifice for sanctuary?
- **Collective vs. Individual**: Needs of many vs. needs of few

**The Refugee Highway** - Shifting safe path between extremes, lined with frozen/burned dead

**Temporary Sanctuary camps** - Exploitative stops charging refugees everything for basic survival

**The Temperate Sanctuary** - Verdant valley protected by wards, but wards require fuel: Lives

## Unique Mechanics

**Caravan Management**: Track 10,000 refugees, resources, morale, survival rate

**Temperature Extremes**: Deadly heat vs. deadly cold, equipment management

**Weather Titan Diplomacy**: Attempt negotiation with alien consciousnesses

**Exodus Decision Points**: Choose who lives/dies, what to abandon, which risks to take

## Plot Twists

- The Weather Warlord deliberately woke the titans to create profitable refugee crisis
- Sanctuary wards require regular human sacrifice to maintain
- One PC is descended from those who imprisoned the weather titans originally
- The titans aren't evil—they're responding to being weaponized
- Freeing them might end the war but destroy the Sanctuary
- Refugees themselves can become new weather consciousness through mass death/suffering

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

Victory: Reach Sanctuary and reform it, or defeat Weather Warlord and free titans to negotiate peace, most refugees survive

Defeat: Caravan destroyed, Sanctuary maintained through sacrifice, or war continues eternally with refugees as perpetual victims

## Campaign Notes

Focuses on refugee crisis through fantasy weather war lens. Players make constant survival decisions with no good options. Weather titans are victims weaponized by human greed. Best with players comfortable with dark themes, resource management, and accepting that they can't save everyone.
