# Creative Brief: Enter the Dragon

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Classic Kung Fu Cinema with Fantasy Elements (Bruce Lee Era / Shaw Brothers-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic cinematography of 1970s martial arts films, particularly *Enter the Dragon*, Shaw Brothers productions, and the visual language of classic kung fu cinema. This style captures the vibrant, dynamic action, exotic island fortress setting, and the contrast between disciplined martial arts and criminal decadence.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Dynamic Action Poses:** Emphasize athletic, powerful stances and mid-action combat poses that showcase martial arts techniques.
*   **Architectural Grandeur:** Depict ornate Asian fortress architecture with imposing stone courtyards, pagodas, and underground complexes.
*   **Lighting Contrast:** Use dramatic lighting—bright tropical sunlight versus dark underground chambers—to create visual tension.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Martial prowess, honor, espionage, tournament spectacle, exotic danger, disciplined combat, criminal underworld.
*   **Feeling:** A combination of athletic excellence and sinister conspiracy. The surface is orderly and disciplined (tournament matches, formal ceremonies), while the hidden layers are dark and chaotic (drug labs, slave pens, mirror mazes).

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, dynamic lines for characters in action poses. Architecture features strong geometric shapes with ornate detailing. Combat scenes emphasize flowing movement and impact.
*   **Forms:** Human figures are athletic and muscular, posed to showcase martial arts stances. Buildings blend Chinese palace architecture with fortress functionality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of 1970s kung fu cinema. A martial artist in a powerful dragon stance, fist extended, on a stone platform overlooking a tropical island fortress with pagoda towers."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and saturated during tournament scenes—rich reds, golds, and greens of traditional Asian aesthetics. Dark, oppressive tones for underground areas—browns, blacks, sickly greens.
*   **Contrasts:** Bright tropical daylight (azure skies, emerald waters) versus shadowy dungeons (torch-lit corridors, dark stone).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette of crimson and gold for the tournament banners, set against azure tropical skies, with stone architecture in weathered gray and bronze details."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Athletic, diverse fighters representing different martial arts styles. Each character has a distinctive silhouette and fighting costume.
*   **Han's Forces:** Mix of traditional Asian armor for guards, with Han himself in refined silk robes that conceal his prosthetic hands.
*   **Tournament Fighters:** Varied designs from bare-chested brawlers to robed monks to leather-clad mercenaries.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A menacing crime lord in elegant silk robes of deep purple and black, his right hand concealed in a ornate iron gauntlet. Behind him stands a massive enforcer with a shaved head, bare chest showing ritual scars, fists the size of melons."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The island fortress blends natural beauty (tropical beaches, jungle cliffs) with imposing architecture (stone walls, courtyards, underground passages).
*   **Tournament Grounds:** Open-air arena carved from mountain stone, with viewing platforms and ornate pillars.
*   **Underground Complex:** Torch-lit corridors, damp stone walls, cages and laboratories with alchemical equipment.
*   **Hall of Mirrors:** A disorienting maze of reflective surfaces with ornate golden frames, creating infinite reflections.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tournament arena carved into a mountainside, with multiple stone platforms at different elevations connected by stairs. Red and gold banners flutter in the tropical breeze. Spectators watch from shadowed archways cut into the cliff face."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast, particularly in the Hall of Mirrors and dungeon scenes. Tropical daylight is bright and harsh, creating dramatic shadows.
*   **Combat Lighting:** Rim lighting to emphasize fighters' forms, with dramatic shadows cast on stone surfaces.
*   **Underground Scenes:** Warm torch-light creating pools of amber illumination in deep shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by harsh tropical sunlight from above, casting long shadows across the stone combat platform. The fighter's muscular form is highlighted with rim lighting, droplets of sweat visible in the bright light."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic diagonal compositions for action scenes. Wide establishing shots to showcase the fortress's scale. Close-ups on intense facial expressions during fights.
*   **Techniques:** Use of foreground elements (pillars, banners) to frame fighters. The camera angle often slightly below subjects to make them appear more imposing.
*   **Mirror Scenes:** Compositions that play with reflections, creating visual confusion and symmetry.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide cinematic shot of the island fortress from the sea approach, with stone walls rising from the water, pagoda towers visible above, all framed by tropical foliage in the foreground. A small boat approaches the dock."

## Voice

A commanding, resonant voice with a calm, measured pace that conveys both wisdom and danger. The tone shifts between respectful formality (during tournament announcements) and cold menace (when Han reveals his true nature). There's an underlying current of controlled power, like a coiled serpent. Audio quality is clear and crisp, with subtle echoes in the Hall of Mirrors sequences. Role: The voice of Master Han, tournament announcer, or the island fortress itself as a character.

## Music & Sound Design

*   **Combat Themes:** Fast-paced percussion with traditional Asian instruments (drums, gongs, bamboo flutes), building to crescendos during critical strikes.
*   **Exploration Music:** Suspenseful strings with occasional sharp notes to create tension during nighttime infiltration.
*   **Tournament Fanfares:** Ceremonial music with horns and drums for match announcements.
*   **Sound Effects:** The sharp crack of strikes landing, the rustle of silk robes, the clash of weapons, dripping water in dungeons, the eerie echo of footsteps in the Hall of Mirrors.
