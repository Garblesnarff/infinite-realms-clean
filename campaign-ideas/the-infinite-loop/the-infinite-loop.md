# The Infinite Loop
**Tagline:** *"Live. Die. Repeat. Learn. Overcome."*

## Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a military camp on the eve of a catastrophic battle against an overwhelming monster invasion. They fight bravely but are slaughtered within hours. Then they wake up again at the same moment, with full memories of their deaths. Trapped in a temporal loop that resets every time they die, the party must use knowledge from each iteration to survive longer, learn enemy patterns, and eventually discover why they're looping and how to break free.

Each session represents multiple loop iterations, with the party gradually mastering combat encounters, gathering intelligence, and uncovering the mystery. The loop isn't just the battle—it includes the entire day leading up to it. Changes made in early hours affect late-day outcomes. NPCs don't remember loops, so relationships reset each time, but the party retains all knowledge and can use it strategically.

## Core Themes

- **Learning Through Failure**: Each death teaches something valuable
- **Perseverance**: Never giving up despite repeated defeats
- **Mastery Through Repetition**: Becoming expert at specific scenarios
- **The Value of Time**: Making every loop count
- **Breaking Patterns**: Finding creative solutions to "unwinnable" scenarios
