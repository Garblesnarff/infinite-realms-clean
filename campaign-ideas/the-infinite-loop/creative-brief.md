# The Infinite Loop - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Military camp aesthetic with monster invasion horror. Groundhog Day meets war film. Repeated imagery with slight variations each loop.

## Colors
- **Morning loops:** Dawn colors, hope, fresh start
- **Repeated loops:** Colors slightly more desaturated
- **Late loops:** Vibrant again—mastery brings clarity
- **Battle:** Chaos reds and dark shadows

## Music
**Main Theme:** Ticking clock rhythm building to epic crescendo, resets mid-measure

**Loop Reset Sound:** Backward rush, alarm clock, gasping awake

**Battle Theme:** Evolves from desperate to heroic as party masters it

## Voice Direction
**NPCs:** Reset emotionally each loop—fresh voices vs. party's weary familiarity

**Party:** Growing exhaustion and determination in voices across campaign

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Death:** Shock and horror
- **Reset Realization:** Confusion to understanding
- **Montage:** Rapid loop failures in sequence
- **Breakthrough:** First major victory, catharsis
- **Final Loop:** Everything comes together perfectly
