# Creative Brief: The Void Between

## Art Style: Minimalism (Donald Judd / Agnes Martin / Robert Ryman-inspired)

Pure geometric forms, monochrome or limited color, vast negative space, reduction to essentials, emphasis on presence through absence.

### Core Principles:
- **Negative Space Primacy**: White void is the subject, not the background
- **Pure Geometric Forms**: Cube, sphere, line, plane - no complexity
- **Monochrome**: White space with occasional single element (gray cube, black line)
- **Grid and Measure**: Subtle geometric order underlying apparent emptiness
- **Reduction**: Only what's essential; everything else removed

### Visual Style:
White galleries with single geometric sculptures. Agnes Martin's delicate grids on white. Ryman's white-on-white paintings. The aesthetic of nothing.

## Music: Minimalist Composition / Silence
John Cage (4'33" - literally silence), La Monte Young (sustained single tones), Philip Glass (repetitive minimal patterns). More silence than sound. When sound exists, single tones or simple patterns.

## Voice Acting:
Minimal dialogue. Long silences. When speech occurs, simple declarative sentences. No emotion. No inflection. Pure communication of essential meaning.
