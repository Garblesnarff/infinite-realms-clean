# World-Building Specification Brief: Magma Heart Rebellion

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Magma Heart Rebellion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
* **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
* **Content:** Deep in the volcanic underworld, fire genasi slaves toil for duergar overlords, their elemental heritage suppressed by rune-collars. When a prophesied Fire-Speaker emerges who can command flame without restraint, revolution ignites. The party must navigate an uprising where victory means freedom and defeat means being buried alive in molten rock, all while discovering that the volcano itself is a dormant primordial that both sides seek to awaken.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
* **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
* **Prompts:**
    * Detail the original enslavement of the Emberborn fire genasi 300 years ago after their homeland was conquered.
    * Write the history of the duergar's expansion into the Obsidian Veins and establishment of the adamantine mining operations.
    * Describe the creation of the rune-collar system and how it suppresses fire genasi abilities while draining life force.
    * Explain the Fire-Speaker prophecy and the previous false prophets who led failed rebellions.
    * Detail the ancient pact between the duergar ancestors and the Fire Primordial Infernum—slavery in exchange for controlled magma.
    * Write about Emberborn culture before slavery—their fire-dance traditions, flame-weaving art, and oral histories now forbidden.
    * Describe the formation of the Ashborn Resistance and previous failed uprisings over the centuries.
    * Explain the volcanic geology: how magma flows are controlled, the stability mechanisms, and the danger of collapse.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
* **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement trigger-based state changes.
* **Triggers:**
    * **IF:** Party assists early resistance activities.
    * **THEN:** Gains trust of Ashborn; targeted by duergar security; revolution timeline accelerates.
    * **IF:** Party attempts peaceful negotiation.
    * **THEN:** Reformists gain influence; hardliners and extremists both sabotage efforts; moderates on both sides hope.
    * **IF:** Major sabotage successful.
    * **THEN:** Duergar crackdown intensifies; tunnel stability decreases; resistance gains momentum; innocent casualties.
    * **IF:** Party exposes the Primordial pact.
    * **THEN:** Both societies face existential crisis; some seek new pact, others demand awakening be prevented.
    * **IF:** Great Uprising occurs.
    * **THEN:** Full warfare; map permanently changes; tunnel collapses begin; both sides take heavy casualties.
    * **IF:** Duergar redirect magma flows.
    * **THEN:** Flooding threats force evacuations; strategic advantage but environmental damage; some duergar oppose this.
    * **IF:** Ember's connection to Primordial revealed.
    * **THEN:** Some Ashborn worship her, others fear her; becomes messianic figure or dangerous tyrant depending on actions.
    * **IF:** Reformist duergar assassinated.
    * **THEN:** Peaceful resolution becomes nearly impossible; hardliners gain control; any sympathetic duergar go underground.
    * **IF:** Cinder's extremists commit atrocity.
    * **THEN:** Public opinion shifts against rebellion; internal Ashborn split; moderates attempt to expel extremists.
    * **IF:** Fire elementals freed from servitude.
    * **THEN:** Powerful allies for rebellion but unpredictable; may attack both sides; accelerate Primordial awakening.
    * **IF:** Surface world intervenes.
    * **THEN:** New faction complicates everything; may "liberate" to conquer; both underground groups may unite against outsiders.
    * **IF:** Primordial begins waking.
    * **THEN:** Volcanic activity increases; power available to fire-users surges; catastrophic eruption becomes possible.
    * **IF:** Party negotiates new pact with Infernum.
    * **THEN:** Possible resolution without slavery; requires sacrifice or eternal vigilance; both sides must trust party.
    * **IF:** Revolution succeeds without addressing Primordial.
    * **THEN:** Emberborn free but tunnels becoming unstable; must quickly learn duergar engineering or evacuate.

**7. Heat Endurance & Environment System**
* **Directive:** Implement environmental danger mechanics.
* **Heat Zones:**
    * **Safe:** Normal underground temperature, no checks required.
    * **Warm:** Forges and populated areas, occasional Constitution saves.
    * **Hot:** Near lava flows, frequent Constitution saves or protection needed.
    * **Infernal:** Lava rivers and Primordial chamber, constant saves, special protection required.
    * **Instant Death:** Direct lava contact, primordial fire, no save possible without immunity.
* **Protective Measures:**
    * Magical protection (resist fire, protection from energy)
    * Special equipment (heat-resistant clothing, breathing apparatus)
    * Fire genasi natural resistance
    * Engineering solutions (water barriers, heat shields)
* **Consequences of Heat Exposure:**
    * Exhaustion levels
    * Fire damage
    * Equipment damage
    * Reduced effectiveness in combat
    * Long-term health issues

**8. Revolutionary Warfare Mechanics**
* **Directive:** Implement asymmetric warfare system.
* **Resistance Activities:**
    * Sabotage missions (forges, magma controls, supply lines)
    * Liberation raids (freeing slaves from specific locations)
    * Intelligence gathering (duergar plans, tunnel maps, security)
    * Recruitment (convincing cautious slaves to join)
    * Supply acquisition (weapons, food, medicine)

    * Permanent map changes from battles
    * Named NPC casualties add weight

**9. Rune-Collar System**
* **Directive:** Implement suppression mechanics.
* **Collar Effects:**
    * Suppresses innate fire genasi abilities
    * Prevents most spellcasting (DC 20 check to cast, damage on failure)
    * Drains life force (Constitution damage over time)
    * Allows remote deactivation (punishment via agony)
    * Explodes if tampered with incorrectly
* **Breaking Collars:**
    * Requires knowledge of runic magic
    * Can be sabotaged collectively (Magma Heart destruction)
    * Ember can temporarily disable for individuals
    * Permanent removal is major milestone
* **Post-Collar Freedom:**
    * Fire genasi regain full abilities
    * Psychological adjustment period
    * Some abilities enhanced from suppression rebound
