# Magma Heart Rebellion

*An Elemental Revolution / Volcanic Dungeon campaign — Medium Campaign (20–28 sessions) — Hard difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Magma Heart Rebellion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Elemental Revolution / Volcanic Exploration / Freedom Fighter Campaign
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 20–28 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **6** → Finish **14–15**
**Tone (keywords):** scorching, revolutionary, oppressive, elemental, defiant, volcanic, freedom
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Deep in the volcanic underworld of the Obsidian Veins, fire genasi slaves toil for duergar overlords, mining adamantine from rivers of lava and forging weapons in infernal heat. For generations, the Emberborn have known only chains, their elemental heritage suppressed by rune-collars that drain their power. When a prophesied Fire-Speaker emerges who can command flame without restraint, revolution ignites—but the duergar control the magma flow that keeps the volcanic tunnels from collapsing. The party must navigate an uprising where victory means freedom and defeat means being buried alive in molten rock, all while discovering that the volcano itself is a dormant primordial that both sides seek to awaken.

## What "Hard" Difficulty Means Here

* **Encounters:** Extreme environmental hazards—lava flows, heat exhaustion, toxic fumes, collapsing tunnels. Enemies use the environment tactically.
* **Moral Complexity:** The duergar aren't mindlessly evil; some oppose slavery. Some Emberborn are willing to destroy everyone for freedom.
* **Resource Management:** Heat endurance, breathable air, and escape routes are constantly threatened.
* **Revolutionary Warfare:** Asymmetric tactics, guerrilla fighting, sabotage, and the ethics of revolution.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 20–28 sessions)

A four-act arc from slavery to revolution to choosing the future.

* **Act I — The Chains of Fire (Sessions 1–7):** The party witnesses the brutal slavery system, meets the Fire-Speaker, and joins the early underground resistance movement.
* **Act II — Embers of Rebellion (Sessions 8–14):** The rebellion goes public. Raids, sabotage, and freeing slaves across multiple forge-prisons. The duergar respond with brutal crackdowns.
* **Act III — The Molten War (Sessions 15–21):** Full-scale uprising. The duergar threaten to redirect magma flows to destroy rebel-held tunnels. Discovery of the dormant primordial.
* **Act IV — The Awakening Choice (Sessions 22–28):** Both sides seek to awaken the Fire Primordial for ultimate power. The party must choose: destroy it, awaken it for one side, or find a third path where the Emberborn coexist with the volcano itself.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict operates on multiple levels:
* **Freedom vs. Order:** Is violent revolution justified? What about innocent casualties?
* **Survival vs. Justice:** Both sides claim the other's victory means extinction.
* **Power vs. Responsibility:** Should the Fire Primordial be awakened for tactical advantage?
* **Revenge vs. Reconciliation:** Can peace exist after generations of slavery and oppression?

The party must navigate these tensions while preventing total annihilation.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Heat Endurance**

* Volcanic environment requires constant Constitution saves against heat exhaustion.
* Protective equipment reduces saves but limits mobility.
* Fire genasi have natural resistance; others need magical protection or creative solutions.

### 2. **Lava Flow Dynamics**

* The duergar can redirect magma flows using ancient mechanisms.
* Tunnels can be flooded with lava, creating permanent obstacles or weapons.
* Party must understand and possibly sabotage these control systems.

### 3. **Revolutionary Warfare**

* The Emberborn use guerrilla tactics—hit and run, sabotage, espionage.
* Party can organize raids, recruit followers, and manage resistance cells.
* Reputation with both sides affects available options.

### 4. **The Rune-Collar System**

* While enslaved, party has limited magic use.
* Can be partially circumvented through creativity and Ember's help.
* Breaking the collar system is a major campaign objective.

### 5. **Primordial Awakening**

* Throughout the campaign, the Fire Primordial slowly awakens from seismic activity and combat.
* Its awakening level affects volcanic stability, power available to fire-users, and danger level.
* Party actions accelerate or slow this awakening.

### 6. **Tunnel Collapse**

* Major battles and sabotage risk collapsing tunnel sections.
* Engineering checks can prevent or cause strategic collapses.
* Permanent map changes based on destruction.

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Prophecy is False:** Ember isn't prophesied—she's directly possessed by the awakening Primordial.

2. **Duergar Defectors:** A significant faction of duergar join the revolution, complicating the "us vs them" narrative.

3. **Emberborn Collaborators:** Some fire genasi benefit from the current system and oppose revolution.

4. **The Ancient Pact:** The original duergar made a deal with the Primordial: enslave fire genasi to keep it sleeping.

5. **Surface Intervention:** A surface kingdom learns of the conflict and plans to "liberate" both groups (really: conquer).

6. **The True Cost:** Awakening the Primordial will grant freedom but trigger a supervolcano eruption.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

### Victory Conditions:

* **Revolutionary Victory:** Free all Emberborn, establish new society, find way to maintain tunnels without duergar expertise.
* **Negotiated Peace:** Broker treaty where slavery ends but duergar maintain engineering control; tense coexistence.
* **Primordial Pact:** Make new agreement with Infernum that doesn't require slavery.
* **Mass Exodus:** Evacuate all Emberborn to the surface; abandon the Obsidian Veins.

### Defeat Conditions:

* **Crushed Rebellion:** Duergar violently suppress uprising; surviving Emberborn face even worse oppression.
* **Volcanic Catastrophe:** Primordial fully awakens or magma flows flood everything; total destruction.
* **Endless War:** Stalemate leads to generations of brutal conflict in collapsing tunnels.
* **Surface Conquest:** External force conquers weakened underground, enslaving or killing both groups.
