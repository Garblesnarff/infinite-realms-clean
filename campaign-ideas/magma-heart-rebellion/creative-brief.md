# Creative Brief: Magma Heart Rebellion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Revolutionary Fire meets Volcanic Hell

Inspired by the volcanic landscapes of Mustafar (Star Wars), the revolutionary aesthetics of Les Misérables and V for Vendetta, the elemental genasi art from D&D, and the industrial oppression of dystopian fiction. This style captures both the infernal beauty of living in a volcano and the human cost of slavery and revolution.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

* **Contrast Fire and Shadow:** Brilliant lava light against oppressive darkness, freedom versus chains.
* **Show Revolutionary Aesthetics:** Symbols of rebellion, raised fists, broken chains, fire as liberation symbol.
* **Emphasize Heat and Struggle:** Everything and everyone shows wear from extreme heat and brutal labor.
* **Elemental Beauty:** Fire genasi should be beautiful and alien—living flames made flesh.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
* **Keywords:** Scorching, revolutionary, oppressive, defiant, volcanic, passionate, brutal, liberating, molten, inspiring.
* **Feeling:** The suffocating heat of oppression giving way to the cleansing fire of revolution. Hope struggling against despair. The beauty and terror of elemental power unleashed.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
* **Style:** Sharp, angular forms for duergar architecture and chains. Flowing, flame-like curves for fire genasi and lava flows. Strong contrasts between geometric oppression and organic rebellion.
* **Textures:** Rough obsidian, polished adamantine, flowing lava, burned flesh, tattered slave garments, revolutionary banners.
* **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed painting of a fire genasi slave with glowing ember eyes and hair of living flame, wearing tattered clothes and iron chains. Behind them, rivers of lava flow through obsidian tunnels. Their posture shows both exhaustion and defiance."

**3. Color Palette:**
* **Style:** Dominated by oranges, reds, and blacks—lava orange, blood red, charcoal black, ash gray. Punctuated by the blue-white of adamantine and the brilliant yellows of unrestrained fire.
* **Lighting Influence:** Everything lit by lava-glow—orange and red light creating dramatic shadows. Free fire (rebellion) burns brighter and hotter than controlled forges (oppression).
* **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of molten orange, deep blood red, and obsidian black, with dramatic lighting from rivers of lava casting long shadows. Free flames burn brilliant yellow-white, contrasting with the duller orange of controlled forges."

**4. Character Design:**
* **Fire Genasi (Enslaved):** Diminished flames, ember-eyes dull, flame-hair suppressed by rune-collars, showing exhaustion and malnutrition but underlying defiance.
* **Fire Genasi (Rebellious):** Flames fully realized, brilliant hair of fire, glowing patterns on skin, fierce and beautiful, wearing symbols of resistance.
* **Duergar Slavers:** Gray-skinned, militaristic armor, cruel expressions, carrying whips and control rods, efficient brutality.
* **Duergar Reformists:** Same build but less harsh, conflicted expressions, less ornate armor, trying to bridge two worlds.
* **Prompt Example:** "A fire genasi revolutionary with hair of brilliant white-gold flames, glowing orange patterns across their dark skin, broken rune-collar hanging from their neck. They hold a makeshift weapon and stand before a banner of flame. Expression fierce and liberated."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
* **Style:** Volcanic tunnels carved from obsidian, rivers of lava providing light and heat, massive forges where slaves labor, oppressive architecture designed for control.
* **Slave Quarters:** Cramped, minimal, heat-baked, showing desperate poverty.
* **Duergar Fortresses:** Imposing, geometric, designed to intimidate, showing wealth built on exploitation.
* **Rebel Territory:** Transformed spaces with revolutionary art, broken chains as decorations, fire as symbol of freedom.
* **Prompt Example:** "A massive underground forge where dozens of fire genasi slaves labor in chains, mining adamantine from a river of lava. The architecture is brutally functional obsidian. Duergar overseers watch from elevated platforms. The heat haze distorts everything. The misery is palpable."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
* **Style:** Dramatic contrast from lava-light. Everything glows orange-red. Deep shadows hide suffering. Revolutionary fire burns bright enough to banish shadows.
* **Shadows:** Oppression hides in shadow. Liberation seeks the light. Duergar use shadows for control, rebels use fire to illuminate.
* **Purpose:** Lighting reinforces themes of oppression versus liberation, controlled flame versus free fire.
* **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by flowing lava below, casting upward orange light that creates harsh shadows. A fire genasi stands atop a rise, their own flames burning so bright they create a zone of brilliant light around them, banishing the oppressive darkness."

**7. Composition:**
* **Style:** Revolutionary compositions—figures rising up, raising fists, breaking chains. Oppressive compositions—looking down on slaves, emphasizing their powerlessness. Use vertical divides showing social hierarchy.
* **Techniques:** Low angles for revolutionary moments (looking up to heroes). High angles for oppression (looking down on slaves). Use lava flows as leading lines. Frame rebels against flames.
* **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle heroic shot of Ember-Who-Speaks raising her fist, flames erupting from her hand toward the sky. Behind her, dozens of fire genasi slaves are breaking their chains. The composition emphasizes rising up, resistance, collective power."

## Music Direction

**Overall Tone:** Revolutionary anthems mixed with the sounds of industry and elemental fury. Percussion of hammers on anvils transitioning to drums of war. Fire given musical voice.

**Main Theme:** Begins with oppressive industrial percussion (chains, hammers, machines), gradually incorporating revolutionary drums, rising to triumphant brass and choir singing of freedom.

**Slave Theme:** Mournful, chain-sounds as percussion, exhausted breathing, but with embers of defiance—occasional flares of melodic hope.

**Revolutionary Theme:** Inspired by Les Mis and protest songs. Building from whispered meetings to full-throated anthems. Fire-sounds (crackling, roaring) as musical elements.

**Duergar Theme:** Military precision, dark and oppressive, grinding industrial sounds, efficient brutality expressed musically.

**Ember's Theme:** Elemental and passionate. Sounds of fire given melody—crackling builds to roaring. Voice of flame made music.

**Primordial Theme:** Ancient, overwhelming, barely musical. The sound of a volcano waking. Pure elemental power beyond good or evil.

**Battle Music:** Revolutionary songs mixed with combat sounds, lava-flows, explosions, triumphant horns, the chaos of uprising.
