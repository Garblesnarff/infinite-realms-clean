## Art Style: Cozy Pixel Art Rural Life (Stardew Valley-inspired)

Inspired by the warm, inviting pixel art and pastoral aesthetics of *Stardew Valley*. This style captures the comfort of rural life, the changing seasons, the charm of small-town characters, and the contrast between natural beauty and corporate sterility.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Warmth:** Cozy homes, welcoming town squares, golden harvest fields
*   **Seasonal Beauty:** Distinct color palettes and environmental changes for spring, summer, fall, winter
*   **Character Charm:** Distinct, memorable character designs with clear personalities
*   **Nature vs. Corporation:** Lush natural areas contrasted with sterile Joja branding

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Cozy, heartwarming, pastoral, wholesome, community-focused, seasonal, nostalgic, peaceful-yet-purposeful
*   **Feeling:** The comfort of tending a garden on a spring morning. The warmth of townspeople waving hello. The satisfaction of a bountiful harvest. The quiet resistance against soulless modernization.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Spring:** Fresh greens, pastel flowers, light blues, new growth
*   **Summer:** Vibrant greens, golden sun, bright blues, warm earth tones
*   **Fall:** Orange, red, brown, golden harvests, cooling atmosphere
*   **Winter:** White snow, blue shadows, warm indoor lighting, bare trees
*   **Joja Corp:** Sterile blues, cold whites, corporate logos, soulless uniformity
*   **Junimo Magic:** Rainbow colors, sparkles, natural greens and golds
*   **Prompt Example:** "...cozy pixel art of a small farm in spring. Neat rows of growing parsnips and green beans with little sprouts. A small farmhouse with smoke rising from the chimney. Apple trees in bloom with pink and white flowers. A farmer in overalls waters crops with a watering can. Soft morning light, birds flying overhead. Warm, inviting color palette."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Farmers (Party):** Simple, relatable designs with work clothes, overalls, sun hats
*   **Townspeople:** Distinct silhouettes and color schemes (Pierre's vest, Shane's Joja uniform, Emily's colorful outfits)
*   **Junimos:** Small apple-shaped forest spirits in various colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple)
*   **Facial Features:** Expressive despite pixel limitations, warm smiles or troubled frowns
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pixel art character with messy brown hair wearing blue overalls and a red flannel shirt. They hold a copper watering can and have a friendly, determined expression. Next to them, a small green apple-shaped Junimo with large black eyes bounces happily. Behind them, a rustic wooden farmhouse. Stardew Valley art style."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Farm:** Tilled soil, growing crops, wooden fences, barn and coop, scarecrow
*   **Pelican Town:** Cozy buildings, Pierre's store, saloon with warm lighting, town square
*   **Community Center:** Grand but rundown building, room-by-room restoration showing progress
*   **The Mines:** Dark caverns with ore veins, glowing mushrooms, wooden support beams, slimes
*   **Forest & Beach:** Natural beauty, forageable items, fishing spots, secret areas
*   **Joja Mart:** Sterile fluorescent lighting, blue branding everywhere, soulless aisles
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art of a restored Community Center interior. Polished wooden floors, completed notice board with bundles checked off. Junimos dancing around a glowing magical bundle. Warm lighting from candles and windows showing sunset outside. Garlands and decorations celebrating the restoration. People from town gathered happily."

**5. Seasonal Activities & Festivals:**
*   **Spring:** Planting, egg festival with colorful eggs hidden, flower dance with ribbons
*   **Summer:** Luau with communal pot, bright beach scenes, crops at full growth
*   **Fall:** Harvest displays, pumpkin patches, Stardew Valley Fair booths
*   **Winter:** Snow-covered everything, ice fishing, Festival of Winter Star with presents
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art of the Flower Dance festival. Townspeople in fancy clothes standing in pairs ready to dance. A maypole with ribbons in the center. Cherry blossom trees in full bloom creating pink petals falling. Musicians with instruments. Party characters in their best outfits. Spring atmosphere with warm afternoon light."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Soft Pixel Shading:** Not harsh, emphasizes cozy atmosphere
*   **Time of Day:** Morning light, harsh noon sun, golden hour, evening warmth, night stars
*   **Indoor Warmth:** Fireplaces, candles, homey lighting contrasts with cold outside
*   **Magical Glow:** Junimo magic has soft rainbow shimmer
*   **Prompt Example:** "...pixel art lit by golden hour sunlight. Long shadows across harvested fields. A farmer sits on their porch with a drink, watching the sunset. Crops ready for harvest glow in warm light. Crows scatter from a scarecrow. Peaceful, accomplished mood. Warm oranges and golds dominate the palette."

## Music & Sound

An acoustic, countryside soundtrack featuring guitar, piano, and light orchestration that changes with seasons and locations. Spring is hopeful and energetic, summer is bright and active, fall is warm and contemplative, winter is quiet and introspective. Town music is friendly and social, mine music is tense, Joja music is deliberately soulless elevator music. Festival tracks are celebratory. Stardew-inspired: Harvest Moon-like pastoral melodies with modern production.

## Voice

A warm, gentle narrator voice that sounds like a friendly neighbor or wise grandparent. Sometimes observational ("The crops are growing well"), sometimes encouraging ("The townspeople are counting on you"), sometimes wistful ("Your grandfather would be proud"). The pacing is never rushed—everything happens in due time. The Joja voice is corporate, sterile, falsely cheerful. Role: The voice of rural wisdom and community values.
