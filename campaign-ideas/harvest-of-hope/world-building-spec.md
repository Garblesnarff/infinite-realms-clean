**Harvest of Hope**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party inherits a neglected farm in Pelican Valley, a dying rural town being consumed by Joja Corporation. To save the community, they must restore the farm and the abandoned Community Center by completing magical bundles for forest spirits called Junimos. Through seasonal cycles of planting and harvest, festivals and friendships, they choose between Joja's efficient modernization or preserving the valley's traditions and community bonds.

*   **IF:** Party completes all bundles → **THEN:** Community Center fully restored, Joja Mart abandoned, valley saved.
*   **IF:** Party buys Joja membership → **THEN:** Alternative path unlocked, Community Center becomes warehouse, lose Junimo magic.

*   **IF:** Seasonal festivals are successful → **THEN:** Town morale improves, relationships deepen, special rewards earned.

**7. Relationship Systems**
*   Each NPC has gift preferences (loved, liked, neutral, disliked, hated).
*   Heart events trigger at specific relationship levels revealing backstory.
*   Some NPCs have interconnected storylines (Marnie/Lewis, Shane/Jas/Marnie, Wizard/Witch/Caroline).
*   Town unity is measured—affects final confrontation difficulty.
*   Romance optional but available for those interested in that subplot.

**8. Economic Loop**
*   Plant crops → Harvest → Sell or process → Buy improvements → Plant better crops.
*   Artisan goods multiply value but require time and equipment investment.
*   Animals provide daily products (milk, eggs) for steady income.
*   Mining provides ores for tools and gems for gifts/selling.
*   Balance profit optimization with bundle completion requirements.
