## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-30 sessions)

A year-long journey through seasons, each bringing new challenges, crops, and community events.

*   **Act I — Spring & Summer: Roots and Growth (Sessions 1-10):** The party arrives in Pelican Valley to discover their inherited farm in ruins and the town on the brink of surrender to Joja Corp. They meet the townspeople—each with personal struggles—and discover the overgrown Community Center inhabited by mysterious forest spirits called Junimos. The spirits offer a deal: complete bundles of local goods to restore the Center and unlock ancient magic. Meanwhile, Joja offers a quick solution: sell out and let them develop everything. The party must choose sides while learning farming, mining, fishing, and foraging.
*   **Act II — Fall & Winter: Challenges and Choices (Sessions 11-20):** As the party deepens relationships with townspeople, personal quests emerge: helping Shane overcome addiction, supporting Emily's artistic dreams, uncovering the truth about Penny's difficult home life, solving the mystery of the wizard and his ex-wife. The Community Center restoration progresses, but Joja Corp escalates their takeover attempts. Winter brings hardship—crops don't grow, the mines are dangerous, and money runs scarce. The party must prove the traditional way can survive modern challenges.
*   **Act III — Second Spring: Triumph and Transformation (Sessions 21-30):** The Community Center nears completion, and ancient magic begins returning to the valley. The Junimos reveal their true purpose: restoring balance between civilization and nature. The final confrontation with Joja Corp comes as they attempt to bulldoze key locations. The party must rally the entire town to resist. With the Center complete, ancient magical infrastructure activates—greenhouses that grow year-round, minecarts that transport goods, and a connection to the enchanted Ginger Island. The valley transforms into a thriving community where tradition and progress coexist. The party chooses whether to stay as farmers or move on, knowing the seeds they planted will flourish.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of community versus corporate efficiency, tradition versus progress, the value of slow living, and building relationships over accumulating wealth. It asks: What makes a community worth saving? Can we resist soulless modernization? Is there value in inefficiency and seasonal rhythms? The central conflict is Joja Corp's attempt to replace community with convenience, human connection with optimized consumption.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Seasonal Calendar & Crop Cycles**
*   28-day seasons with specific crops, fish, and forageable items per season
*   Planning planting schedules for maximum profit vs. bundle completion
*   Festivals on specific dates bringing town together
*   Weather affects crop growth and available activities
*   Multi-season crops (ancient fruit, sweet gem berries) for long-term investment

### 2. **Energy & Stamina System**
*   Each action (watering, mining, fishing) costs stamina
*   Must manage daily stamina pool—exhaustion causes consequences
*   Food restores stamina with different values
*   Exhaustion without eating reduces max health temporarily
*   Balancing productivity with rest and social activities

### 3. **Relationship Hearts System**
*   Each NPC has relationship level tracked with hearts (0-10)
*   Gift-giving, dialogue choices, and completing personal quests increase hearts
*   Higher hearts unlock personal cutscenes and storylines
*   Some NPCs are romanceable (if party wants that subplot)
*   Town unity required for final confrontation—must maintain good relationships

### 4. **Community Center Bundles**
*   Six rooms with bundles requiring specific items (crops, artisan goods, fish, ores, etc.)
*   Completing bundles unlocks rewards: greenhouse, minecarts, bus to desert, panning, friendship
*   Bundles require seasonal planning—some items only available specific times
*   Alternative: Joja Community Development Form (pay gold instead, but lose magic)
*   Bundle completion is main victory condition against Joja Corp

### 5. **Skills & Professions**
*   Five skills: Farming, Mining, Foraging, Fishing, Combat
*   Skills level through use (plant crops to level Farming, etc.)
*   At levels 5 and 10, choose profession specializations
*   Professions grant unique abilities (Better crop quality, ore processing, double harvests, etc.)
*   Party members can specialize in different skills for efficiency

### 6. **Artisan Production**
*   Convert raw goods to valuable artisan products (preserve jars, kegs, looms, etc.)
*   Wine, cheese, cloth, pickles, jelly increase crop value significantly
*   Time investment vs. immediate profit decisions
*   Quality levels: base, silver, gold, iridium (affects price and bundle completion)

### 7. **Festival Mini-Games**
*   Each seasonal festival has activities: egg hunts, fishing contests, fortune telling, grange displays
*   Success at festivals improves town relationships and provides unique rewards
*   Festivals are break days from regular farm work—social focus
*   Some festivals reveal character development and storylines

### 8. **Joja Corruption Mechanic**
*   Track "Valley Integrity" vs. "Joja Influence"
*   Shopping at Joja (cheaper but soulless) increases their influence
*   Community Center progress decreases Joja's power
*   If Joja Influence gets too high, worse outcomes become possible
*   Final battle difficulty determined by how much community was built vs. Joja appeased
