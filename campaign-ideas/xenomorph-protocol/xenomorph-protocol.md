# Xenomorph Protocol

*A Survival Horror / Sci-Fantasy campaign — Short Campaign (6–8 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Xenomorph Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Survival Horror / Sci-Fantasy / Alien Monster
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **6** → Finish **9–10**
**Tone (keywords):** claustrophobic, survival, hunted, corporate betrayal, body horror, desperate
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party wakes from magical stasis aboard the mining vessel *Covenant's Fortune*, responding to a distress beacon from a derelict ship. What should be a routine salvage operation becomes a nightmare when they discover a cargo hold full of strange crystalline eggs. One hatches, and the party finds themselves trapped in confined corridors with the perfect predator—a creature that bleeds acid, can't be bargained with, and exists only to kill. Worse, their corporate employers have classified the creature and want it captured alive, making the party expendable.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Asymmetric Horror:** The Xenomorph cannot be defeated in traditional combat. It's faster, stronger, and smarter. The party must use environment, traps, and desperation tactics.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Limited healing, limited rest, limited ammunition. Every resource expenditure must be carefully considered.
*   **Permanent Death Threat:** Character death is real and likely. The Xenomorph kills quickly and brutally.
*   **Confined Space:** The ship's corridors and rooms are cramped. There's nowhere to run, and the creature can use the vents.
*   **Trust No One:** The corporation has sent a secret agent among the party to ensure the creature survives. One party member may be working against the others.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A desperate fight for survival across three acts, escalating from discovery to infestation.

*   **Act I — Discovery (Sessions 1–2):** The party explores the derelict, discovers the eggs, and experiences the first chestburster. They realize they're dealing with a perfect killing machine and try to contain it, but it escapes into the ship's ventilation system.
*   **Act II — The Hunt (Sessions 3–5):** The Xenomorph is loose in the *Covenant's Fortune*. The party must locate it, avoid it, and try to either kill it or jettison it into space. Meanwhile, the corporate agent sabotages their efforts, and they discover there are now multiple creatures—the original has been reproducing.
*   **Act III — Infestation (Sessions 6–8):** The ship is overrun. The party must activate the self-destruct, reach the escape pods, and survive long enough to evacuate. But the corporation's rescue ship has arrived with orders to capture the Xenomorphs—and eliminate witnesses.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Distress Signal"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Atmospheric Dread
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party's ship, responding to a salvage beacon, finds the derelict *Prometheus Dawn*. Potential profit, but something feels wrong.
    *   The Derelict: Exploring the abandoned ship, they find signs of catastrophe—bodies with massive chest wounds, acid burns on walls, claw marks.
    *   The Cargo: In the hold, thousands of crystalline eggs in bio-mechanical chambers. The party's corporate handler (via sending stone) orders samples taken.

**Escalation:** An egg hatches. A facehugger latches onto a party member's face. The creature cannot be removed without killing the host.

### Session 2 — "Chest Burster"

*   **Focus:** Body Horror / First Kill
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Incubation: The facehugger eventually falls off. The victim seems fine. They return to the *Covenant's Fortune* with samples.
    *   The Birth: During a meal, the infected character convulses. A small serpentine creature erupts from their chest in a shower of blood. First character death.
    *   The Escape: The chestburster flees into the vents before anyone can react. The party realizes it's growing rapidly.

**Escalation:** Hours later, they find molted skin. The creature is now man-sized. The hunt begins.

### Session 3 — "Perfect Organism"

*   **Focus:** Cat and Mouse / Environmental Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The First Hunt: The party attempts to track and kill the Xenomorph. They corner it in engineering. Combat ensues.
    *   Acid Blood: When damaged, the creature bleeds molecular acid that burns through metal floors. Melee combat is nearly suicidal.
    *   Retreat: The party learns they can't fight it directly. They must use the environment—blast doors, airlocks, fire.

**Escalation:** The corporate handler reveals this is a "valuable specimen" and must be taken alive. Lethal force is "discouraged."

### Session 4 — "The Judas"

*   **Focus:** Paranoia / Betrayal
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Sabotage: The party's traps fail. Someone is sabotaging them. Equipment disappears. Doors that should be locked are open.
    *   The Traitor: The corporate agent reveals themselves (or is discovered). They've been ensuring the Xenomorph survives to be delivered to the company's bio-weapons division.
    *   The Nest: Following the Xenomorph, the party discovers it's been cocooning victims in a hidden section of the ship. More eggs are present. There are now multiple Xenomorphs.

**Escalation:** The ship's AI reveals it's been subverted by the corporation. It will not allow the party to destroy the specimens.

### Session 5 — "Into the Abyss"

*   **Focus:** Survival / Desperate Tactics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Overrun: Multiple Xenomorphs hunt the party through increasingly restricted areas as they seal off infested sections.
    *   Mother's Lair: The party finds the Queen—a massive Xenomorph that's been laying eggs. She's intelligent and enraged.
    *   Pyrrhic Victory: The party can damage the Queen, but her acid blood and protective drones make direct combat nearly impossible.

**Escalation:** The ship's systems are failing. The infestation has damaged critical infrastructure. They have hours before life support fails.

### Session 6 — "Nuke It From Orbit"

*   **Focus:** Action / Desperation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Self-Destruct: The party activates the ship's emergency self-destruct. They have 10 minutes to reach the escape pods.
    *   The Gauntlet: The route to the pods takes them through infested territory. Xenomorphs attack from vents, ceiling, everywhere.
    *   The Corporate Ship: A rescue vessel arrives—but they're not here to save the party. They're here to secure the specimens.

**Escalation:** The corporate marines are hostile. The party is marked for "termination with extreme prejudice" as witnesses.

### Session 7 — "Get Away From Her"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Final Stand
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Escape Pod Siege: The party barricades in the escape pod bay while Xenomorphs and corporate marines both attack.
    *   The Queen's Wrath: The Queen, wounded and enraged, pursues the party personally for killing her brood.
    *   The Airlock: Using power loaders, environmental hazards, or desperate sacrifice, the party must defeat or jettison the Queen.

**Escalation:** The self-destruct countdown reaches zero. The ship begins exploding around them.

### Session 8 — "Survivors"

*   **Focus:** Epilogue / Final Twist
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Escape: The survivors launch in an escape pod as the *Covenant's Fortune* explodes, taking the Xenomorphs and corporate marines with it.
    *   Adrift: They're alone in space with limited supplies. Rescue will take weeks or months.
    *   The Stowaway: A final check of the pod reveals one egg or a juvenile Xenomorph hidden aboard. The nightmare isn't over.

**Alternate Ending:** The party successfully cleanses the pod and drifts into stasis, vowing to expose the corporation when rescued.

## Key Locations

1.  **The *Prometheus Dawn* (Derelict):** An abandoned mining ship where the eggs were found. Shows signs of previous infestation and desperation.
2.  **The *Covenant's Fortune* (Player Ship):** A mid-sized mining vessel with engineering, crew quarters, bridge, cargo hold, medbay, and extensive ventilation shafts the Xenomorph uses to move unseen.
3.  **The Nest:** A section of cargo hold the Xenomorphs have converted to a hive, filled with resin, cocoons, and eggs.
4.  **Engineering:** Critical location with power systems, airlocks, and the self-destruct mechanism.
5.  **The Vents:** Dark, cramped crawlspaces perfect for Xenomorph ambushes.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is survival against impossible odds. The Xenomorph represents nature as a hostile, perfect killer—beautiful in its efficiency and utterly pitiless. The corporation represents human greed and the willingness to sacrifice lives for profit. The party is caught between these two evils, fighting for their lives while betrayed by their employers. Victory isn't about heroism; it's about survival at any cost. The horror comes from powerlessness, from being hunted in confined spaces, and from the realization that those who should protect you see you as expendable.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Xenomorph AI**

*   The DM controls the Xenomorph with specific behaviors: it hunts the wounded, uses vents to ambush, retreats if seriously injured, and learns from party tactics.
*   It becomes more aggressive and intelligent each session, representing growth and learning.

### 2. **Motion Tracker**

*   The party has limited motion trackers showing movement within a radius. The beeping creates tension as blips approach.
*   However, trackers can't distinguish friend from foe and don't work through some materials.

### 3. **Acid Blood**

*   Xenomorphs bleed molecular acid. Melee attacks risk splash damage. Killing them in certain locations (above critical systems) causes collateral damage.
*   This makes traditional combat extremely risky.

### 4. **The Corporate Traitor**

*   At the start, the DM secretly designates one player (or NPC if the group is small) as having hidden corporate loyalties.
*   This player receives secret objectives: ensure specimen survival, sabotage lethal weapons, etc.
*   They can reveal themselves or stay hidden, creating paranoia.

### 5. **Oxygen and Resources**

*   As the ship is damaged, sections lose atmosphere. The party must manage oxygen supplies when in compromised areas.
*   Ammunition, healing, and other resources are strictly limited with no restocking.
