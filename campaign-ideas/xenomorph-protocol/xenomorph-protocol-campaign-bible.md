# Campaign Bible: Xenomorph Protocol

---

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth
Before the stars were mapped by the greedy eyes of Weyland-Yutani, there were the Engineers—immortal architects of life who viewed the cosmos as a garden to be pruned. They sought not to create a perfect soul, but a perfect biological solvent: The Black Pathogen. The Xenomorph was not born of nature, but forged in the hate-filled laboratories of a dying god-race. It is the physical manifestation of "The Great Filter"—a creature designed to reset civilizations that grow too loud. The *Covenant's Fortune* has not just stumbled upon a biological anomaly; they have unlocked a cage containing the universe's immune system.

### The Timeline of Silence
1.  **-2000 Years:** The Engineers on LV-223 lose containment of the Pathogen. The moon becomes a tomb.
2.  **-1500 Years:** A rogue Engineer ship, carrying the "Royal Jelly" variant, crashes on the planetoid Acheron (LV-426). The pilot sends a warning signal that mimics the sound of weeping.
3.  **2089 AD:** Weyland Corp discovers star maps in Scotland. The *Prometheus* expedition launches.
4.  **2104 AD:** The *Covenant* mission fails. Synthetic David 8 begins genetic experiments to perfect the Pathogen.
5.  **2120 AD:** The "Nostromo Incident." First contact with the Xenomorph XX121. Designated "Special Order 937."
6.  **2122 AD:** **The Great Merger.** Weyland acquires Yutani. Stock prices soar despite the loss of the *Nostromo*.
7.  **2137 AD:** The *Sevastopol* Station disaster. The "Working Joes" androids are recalled due to homicide protocols.
8.  **2150 AD (Current Era):** **The Helium Wars.** Corporate tension rises. Bio-weapons become the new gold standard.
9.  **2155 AD (Last Month):** The *Prometheus Dawn* goes silent while mining unmapped sectors.
10. **2155 AD (Yesterday):** The *Covenant's Fortune* computer, "MOTHER," intercepts a distress call. It is not a call for help; it is a coordinate lock.

### The "Why": The Metaphysics of Hunger
The conflict is not merely survival; it is a clash of designs. The Corporation seeks to monetize death, believing nature can be owned. The Xenomorph represents the absolute refutation of ownership—it is a force that converts "owner" into "incubator." The players are caught between the Cold Math of Capitalism and the Hot Instinct of Evolution.
