# Campaign Bible: Ghost Who Walks

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Echo of the First Oath
Before time was measured, there was the **Great Shadow**, a primordial darkness that sought to consume all light. From the heart of the first star, a single spark of defiance, the **First Oath**, was sworn: to protect the innocent, to fight injustice, and to never yield. This oath echoed through the nascent cosmos, creating a lineage of guardians. The world is not merely a planet; it is a battleground where the echoes of this First Oath clash with the lingering tendrils of the Great Shadow. The "Ghost Who Walks" is not a single individual; it is the living embodiment of this eternal oath, a spirit passed down through generations, each successor inheriting the mantle, the memories, and the unwavering resolve of those who came before. The conflict is eternal, a cosmic struggle for the soul of existence, played out in the jungles and cities of a world perpetually on the brink.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Oath):** The primordial oath is sworn, creating the lineage of the Ghost Who Walks.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Great Shadow's First Strike):** The Great Shadow manifests as the **Singh Brotherhood**, a force of piracy and cruelty.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Skull Cave's Genesis):** The first Ghost Who Walks establishes the Skull Cave, a hidden sanctuary and repository of knowledge.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Oath of the Jungle):** The Ghost Who Walks forms an unbreakable bond with the jungle and its creatures, becoming its protector.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Pirate King's Reign):** A particularly brutal Pirate King, empowered by the Great Shadow, terrorizes the coasts for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Whispering Jungle):** The jungle itself, under the Ghost Who Walks' influence, begins to whisper warnings and guidance to those who listen.
7.  **-500 Y (The Lost Chronicle):** A vital chronicle detailing a weakness of the Great Shadow is stolen from the Skull Cave.
8.  **-100 Y (The Phantom's Betrayal):** A Ghost Who Walks, corrupted by the Great Shadow, briefly turns against their oath, causing widespread chaos before being redeemed.
9.  **-10 Y (The Singh Brotherhood's Resurgence):** The Singh Brotherhood, under a new, cunning leader, begins to consolidate power, threatening the entire region.
10. **Present Day:** The current Ghost Who Walks is young and untested, facing the most organized and dangerous resurgence of the Singh Brotherhood in centuries.

### The "Why": The Burden of Legacy
The central conflict is the struggle between **Legacy and Corruption**. The Ghost Who Walks is a symbol of unwavering justice, a beacon against the encroaching darkness. But the Great Shadow, through its agents like the Singh Brotherhood, seeks to break this legacy, to prove that even the purest oath can be corrupted. The party's struggle is to uphold this ancient oath, to fight not just for justice, but for the very idea of justice, to prove that even in the face of overwhelming evil, one person (or a lineage of them) can make a difference. It is a fight against the erosion of hope and the triumph of cynicism.
