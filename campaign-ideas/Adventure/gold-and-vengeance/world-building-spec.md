**Gold and Vengeance: The Betrayer's Debt**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players were part of a successful crew that pulled off a major gold heist, only to be betrayed by one of their own who murdered their mentor, stole the gold, and left them for dead. After escaping from prison or hiding, they reunite with one purpose: steal back the gold and make the traitor pay for his crimes. The campaign becomes a cat-and-mouse game as they infiltrate the traitor's organization, recruit new specialists, and plan an audacious heist to reclaim what's theirs—all while the traitor knows they're coming and prepares his own deadly traps. This is about justice, vengeance, and proving that you don't betray family and walk away clean.
