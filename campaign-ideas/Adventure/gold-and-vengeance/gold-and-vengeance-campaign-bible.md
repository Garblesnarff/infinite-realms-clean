# Gold and Vengeance: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
In the dawn of the world, the Ocean was a young, lonely entity. It watched the Sun, a brilliant, fiery god, dance across the sky each day. The Ocean grew possessive and, in a fit of childish jealousy, it reached up with a colossal wave and snatched the Sun from the sky, pulling it down into its deepest, coldest trenches. The sudden, intense cold of the abyss instantly cooled the Sun, solidifying it into a single, impossibly large sphere of solid gold. The world was plunged into darkness, until the Moon, the Sun's grieving sister, shone her borrowed light upon the world. The Ocean, realizing its mistake but too proud to admit it, keeps the Sun-Gold as its secret treasure. The "gold" that mortals find in the sea - flakes, dust, and the occasional nugget - are merely fragments that have broken off the slumbering, golden god in the deep. The "Vengeance" of the title is twofold: the Ocean's own violent, possessive wrath against any who would try to steal its "pretty thing," and the faint, dreaming vengeance of the trapped Sun-god, which manifests as curses and an unnatural, maddening "gold-lust" in those who find its fragments.

### Timeline
1.  **The Great Theft (c. -10,000 years):** The entity of the Ocean pulls the Sun from the sky, encasing it in the abyssal trench. The world enters the "Long Night."
2.  **The Moon's Tears (c. -9,900 years):** The Moon goddess, weeping for her brother, creates the first stars from her tears to bring some light to the world.
3.  **The First Flake (c. -8,000 years):** A volcanic eruption on the sea floor breaks off the first major fragment of the Sun-Gold. It is carried to the surface and discovered by coastal mortals, who are driven mad by its concentrated divinity.
4.  **(Surreal) The Whispering Tides (c. -7,500 years):** For a century, the tides do not ebb and flow silently. Instead, they whisper the dreams of the sleeping Sun-god, prophecies of fire and light that no one can understand.
5.  **The Rise of the Pirate Kings (c. -5,000 to -2,000 years):** Mortals learn to sail the seas, and the hunt for the "Sunken King's Ransom" begins. The great pirate dynasties are founded.
6.  **The Ocean's First Antibody (c. -1,500 years):** The Ocean, feeling the "thefts" of its treasure, creates the first Kraken, a being of pure possessiveness and rage, to guard the deeper trenches.
7.  **(Surreal) The Coral Bloom (c. -900 years):** A single, massive coral reef grows overnight, spanning an entire ocean. The coral is made of solidified memories and, if eaten, shows the consumer a vision of the Great Theft. The reef vanishes after one year.
8.  **The Brethren Court's Folly (c. -500 years):** The first unified Pirate Brethren Court pools its resources to try and raise the Sun-Gold. Their entire fleet is swallowed by a single, targeted whirlpool, and the Ocean's Vengeance becomes a known, feared phenomenon.
9.  **The Drowning of 'El Dorado' (c. -200 years):** The legendary pirate king, Esteban "El Dorado" Diaz, finds a map to the Trench of the Sun-Gold. His entire island-nation stronghold is pulled beneath the waves by the Ocean in a single night.
10. **(Surreal) The Day of False Dawn (c. -1 year):** For a full day, the entire ocean glows with a faint, golden light, and the water becomes warm to the touch. The Sun-Gold is dreaming of escape, and its power is beginning to leak out, weakening the Ocean's hold.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is between mortal ambition and a cosmic, possessive innocence. The Ocean is not evil; it is a child who has stolen a toy it cannot comprehend and does not want to give back. Its "Vengeance" is the tantrum of a toddler with the power of a god. The Sun-Gold is not a treasure; it is a caged, dreaming deity whose divine essence corrupts the very mortals who seek to "liberate" it. The players are caught between the avarice of their own kind, the possessive fury of a living ocean, and the maddening call of a trapped god. The central theme is that the greatest treasures are those that should never be possessed.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Sun-Sliver
**Type:** Legendary Longsword
**Description:** A blade forged from a large fragment of the Sun-Gold. It glows with a warm, golden light and feels hot to the touch.
**Mechanics:** The sword is a +3 longsword that deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius. Any sea monster created by the Ocean's Vengeance that sees the light must make a Wisdom save or become frightened. **Curse:** The wielder can no longer heal naturally by resting. They must consume gold pieces to regain hit points (1 gp per HP).

### 2. The Ocean's Heart
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Orb)
**Description:** A swirling blue orb, given by the Wave-Sage. It is a piece of the Ocean's own consciousness.
**Mechanics:** The holder can cast *Control Water* at will. Once per week, they can cast *Tsunami*. **Curse:** The holder begins to feel the Ocean's possessiveness. They must make a Wisdom save each day or become obsessed with a single item in their possession, refusing to let anyone else touch it.

### 3. The Map of Memory
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Map)
**Description:** A sea chart made from the Coral Oracle's own body. The coastlines and islands shift and change.
**Mechanics:** The user can ask the map to show them the location of any person, place, or thing they have seen before. The map will rearrange itself to show the route. It can also be used to navigate through the Ocean's "moods," allowing a ship to pass through a divine tantrum (a storm) unscathed.

### 4. The Kraken's Mantle
**Type:** Legendary Armor (Plate)
**Description:** Plate armor crafted by the Abyssal Forgeworks, infused with a living Kraken symbiote. The armor is slick, black, and seems to move on its own.
**Mechanics:** The armor is +2 plate armor and grants the wearer a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to breathe underwater, and resistance to cold and lightning damage. The wearer can also use an action to sprout two tentacles from their back, which can be used to make grapple attacks. **Curse:** The symbiote is hungry. The wearer must submerge the armor in salt water for 1 hour each day or gain a level of exhaustion.

### 5. The Flag of the Drowned Choir
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Banner)
**Description:** The ghostly, tattered flag of Captain Arioso's ship. It is cold to the touch and constantly billows as if in a phantom wind.
**Mechanics:** When flown from a ship's mast, the ship becomes "ghostly." It can become semi-incorporeal for up to 1 hour per day, allowing it to pass through other ships and ignore non-magical difficult terrain (like reefs or storms). The crew of the ship, however, is plagued by feelings of intense sorrow and must make a Wisdom save each day or have disadvantage on all attack rolls.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Barnacle That Tells Time:** A single, large barnacle that opens and closes its "mouth" to perfectly chime the hours.
2.  **The Homesick Spyglass:** A spyglass that doesn't show you what's far away, but instead shows you a view of your childhood home.
3.  **A Message in a Bottle from Yourself in the Future:** The message is smudged and illegible.
4.  **The Peg-Leg of Bouncing:** A peg-leg that allows the user to jump up to 30 feet in the air, but they cannot control the landing.
5.  **A Skeleton Key That is Also a Skeleton:** A key made of bone that can open any simple lock, but it complains about the cold the entire time.
6.  **The Impatient Anchor:** An anchor that weighs the normal amount, but it refuses to stay at the bottom of the sea for more than 10 minutes.
7.  **A Pirate's Hook That is a Backscratcher:** A menacing-looking pirate's hook, but the point is soft and perfectly shaped for scratching an itch.
8.  **The Cannibal's Fork:** A fork that makes any food taste vaguely like human flesh.
9.  **A Treasure Map That Leads to a Better Treasure Map:** A very complex and dangerous treasure map. The treasure chest at the end contains another, even more complex map.
10. **The Existential Parrot:** A parrot that doesn't repeat what you say, but instead asks you probing, uncomfortable questions about your life choices.
11. **A Rope of Infinite Knots:** A 50-foot rope that has a new, impossibly complex knot in it every morning.
12. **The Cowardly Cutlass:** A sword that will try to leap out of your hand and hide if it sees a larger sword.
13. **A Bottle of Ship-in-a-Bottle:** A normal-looking bottle. If you break it, a full-sized, slightly damaged ship appears.
14. **The Sobering Rum:** A bottle of rum that, when drunk, makes you instantly sober and fills you with regret.
15. **A Compass That Points to the Nearest Argument:** It spins wildly in any tavern.
16. **The Sea Shanty of Forgetfulness:** A piece of sheet music. Anyone who plays it forgets the last 24 hours. The music itself is also forgotten.
17. **A Single, Self-Polishing Gold Coin:** It's not magical, just very proud of its appearance.
18. **The Moody Figurehead:** A ship's figurehead whose facial expression changes to match the mood of the captain.
19. **A Bag of Winds (and Perfume):** A bag that can release a gust of wind, but the wind always smells strongly of cheap perfume.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Divine Contamination
The Sun-Gold is not just a metal; it is the solidified essence of a god. This divinity "contaminates" everything it touches.
*   **Gold-Lust:** Any mortal who touches a piece of Sun-Gold must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC dependent on the size of the fragment). On a failure, they gain a form of indefinite madness, becoming obsessed with acquiring more gold, willing to do anything to get it.
*   **Sea's Scorn:** The Ocean can "feel" the presence of Sun-Gold. Any ship carrying more than a trivial amount of Sun-Gold is more likely to be targeted by storms, sea monsters, and other hazards. This manifests as the DM making more frequent and more dangerous random encounter checks.
*   **Divine Radiance:** Sun-Gold cannot be hidden by magical darkness or mundane means. It always sheds a faint, golden light, even if wrapped in lead. This makes smuggling it incredibly difficult.

### Subsystems: Notoriety and Vengeance
*   **Notoriety:** The players gain Notoriety for acts of piracy, daring raids, or discovering major secrets. High Notoriety makes them a target for both the Brethren (as rivals) and the Consortium (as criminals), but it also grants them influence in pirate ports.
*   **Ocean's Vengeance:** This is a tracked score, from 0 to 20. It increases whenever the players take a significant amount of Sun-Gold, damage a sacred coral reef, or openly defy the will of a Tide-Speaker. As the score increases, the Ocean's response becomes more direct and personal. At 1-5, storms are more frequent. At 6-10, sea monsters actively hunt them. At 11-15, the Great Kraken takes an interest. At 16-20, the Ocean may attempt to sink the island they are standing on. The score can be lowered by making offerings, helping the Tide-Speakers, or returning Sun-Gold to the sea.
