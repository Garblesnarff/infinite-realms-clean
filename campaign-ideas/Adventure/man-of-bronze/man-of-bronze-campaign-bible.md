## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
In the dawn of thought, there were two concepts: The Architect (pure, cold, unfeeling logic) and The Beast (raw, hot, unthinking instinct). They battled for dominion over the nascent reality, their conflict threatening to tear the universe apart before it was even truly formed. A third, lesser god, a god of craftsmen and mediators, sacrificed itself to forge a "Fulcrum" between them. This Fulcrum was not a place or a thing, but a state of being, a perfect, metaphysical alloy of Law and Chaos, Flesh and Spirit, Civilization and Savagery. This state is known as "Bronze." To anchor this concept in reality, the god's dying breath created a lineage of mortal avatars, each destined to become the "Man of Bronze." This is not a title of strength, but of balance. The Man of Bronze is the living fulcrum upon which the world rests. Their skin takes on a bronze sheen, a physical manifestation of their spiritual state. They are tasked with walking the line between the city and the jungle, the machine and the monster, ensuring neither side overwhelms the other. But a decade ago, the last Man of Bronze, a hero named Arion, vanished without a trace. Without its fulcrum, the world is tipping into chaos. The great cities are becoming sterile, emotionless hives of logic, while the wilderness is erupting with monstrous, unnatural life. The world is looking for a new Man of Bronze, and the players are prime candidates.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Argument (The Beginning):** The Architect and The Beast come into being and begin their eternal conflict.
2.  **The Forging of the Fulcrum (Age of Myth):** The god of craftsmen, Hephaestus-Anansi, sacrifices itself to create the concept of "Bronze" and the lineage of its avatars.
3.  **The First Man of Bronze (c. -30,000 years):** A nameless proto-human becomes the first Man of Bronze, teaching his tribe how to use fire (logic) without burning down the forest (instinct).
4.  **The Age of Balance (c. -29,000 to -100 years):** A long, unbroken line of Men of Bronze maintains the equilibrium of the world. They are heroes, philosophers, explorers, and kings.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Colors Fought (c. -5,000 years):** For 24 hours, colors refuse to blend. Red objects repel blue objects, yellow and green will not touch. The world becomes a stark, separated mosaic. This is the first sign of a major imbalance, quickly corrected by the Man of Bronze of that era.
6.  **The Birth of Arion (c. -50 years):** Arion, the most powerful and perfect Man of Bronze in history, is born. He ushers in a golden age of exploration and understanding.
7.  **The Vanishing (c. -10 years):** Arion enters the "Un-Jungle," a place of pure, sterile logic, on a quest to understand The Architect. He never returns.
8.  **The Tipping (c. -9 years to present):** Without its fulcrum, the world begins to lose its balance. The great metropolis of Aethelburg becomes a place of silent, emotionless efficiency, while the jungles of Ki'Var erupt with "Chaos-Beasts."
9.  **(Surreal) The Echo-Storms (c. -5 years):** Storms begin to rain not water, but echoes of past conversations and future arguments. You can hear your own birth and death in a single downpour.
10. **(Surreal) The Melting of the Maps (c. -1 year):** All maps of the world simultaneously melt into puddles of incoherent ink. The world's "meaning" is becoming unstable. The need for a new Man of Bronze is now critical.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a philosophical debate made manifest. The world is literally a scale, and without a central point, it cannot balance. The players are not just adventurers; they are potential philosophical concepts. Their actions have weight, pushing the world towards one extreme or the other. Siding with the sterile logic of the cities might save people from the monsters of the jungle, but it will create a world without art, love, or free will. Siding with the raw chaos of nature might bring freedom, but it will be a world of constant, brutal, and mindless violence. The quest to become the Man of Bronze is a quest to find the "middle way," to prove that both logic and instinct, civilization and savagery, are necessary for a complete and meaningful existence.

## [TAG: LOCATIONS_MAIN]
### Aethelburg, the Cog-City
The capital of sterile logic, a city of brass, glass, and clockwork.
*   **The Great Cog:** The center of the city, a miles-wide clockwork mechanism that controls the city's functions. **Smell:** Ozone, clean metal, lubricating oil. **Sound:** The constant, soft, perfectly synchronized ticking and whirring of a million gears.
*   **The Logic Exchange:** The "market," where citizens trade services and goods based on a complex, algorithmically-determined system of "utility units." **Smell:** The absence of smell, sterile, clean air. **Sound:** The soft click of abacus beads and the whisper of pneumatic tubes.
*   **The Emotion-Purging Cathedral:** A "hospital" where Cog-Disciples go to have their "irrational" emotions surgically and alchemically removed. **Smell:** Antiseptic, strange chemicals. **Sound:** A low, calming hum, punctuated by the occasional, quickly-silenced scream.
*   **The Silent Orchards:** Parks where the trees are made of metal and glass, the fruit is polished stone, and clockwork birds sing mathematically perfect songs. **Smell:** Cold metal, ozone. **Sound:** The soft, metallic rustle of leaves, the chiming of the birds.
*   **The Maintenance Tunnels:** The grimy, greasy underbelly of the city, where goblin-mechanics like Wrench keep the Great Cog running. **Smell:** Oil, grease, sweat, and goblin musk. **Sound:** The clang of dropped tools, the hiss of steam pipes, greasy cackling.

### The Ki'Var Jungle, the Green Hell
A jungle super-charged with chaotic, primal energy. Nature red in tooth and claw.
*   **The Spawning Pits:** Bubbling, primordial pools where Chaos-Beasts are spontaneously generated. **Smell:** Ammonia, sulfur, birth, and decay. **Sound:** The constant, wet, squelching and popping of new flesh being formed.
*   **The Howling Peaks:** Mountains that are not rock, but the fossilized vocal cords of a dead god. The wind blowing through them creates a constant, terrifying howl. **Smell:** Ozone, static electricity. **Sound:** A deafening, multi-tonal howl that can drive men mad.
*   **The Great-Horned Shaman's Cave:** A cave painted with the blood of his enemies, filled with the skulls of his rivals. **Smell:** Blood, musk, damp fur. **Sound:** The constant, low growl of the Shaman and his beasts.
*   **The Blood-Tree Grove:** A grove of carnivorous trees that feed on the Chaos-Beasts. **Smell:** Rotting meat, and a sickly-sweet floral scent. **Sound:** The buzz of giant flies, the snap of a branch closing on prey.
*   **The River of Instinct:** A river that does not flow, but "thinks." It will randomly change course, grow teeth, or try to drown you if it senses "logic" or "planning." **Smell:** Mud, algae, raw life. **Sound:** A low, gurgling, almost mocking sound.

### The Un-Jungle of Geometry
A place where Arion vanished, a region of the world being "conquered" by The Architect.
*   **The Crystalline Forest:** A forest where the trees have been replaced by perfectly-faceted, non-reflective crystals. **Smell:** None. **Sound:** A perfect, unnerving silence.
*   **The River of Angles:** A river that flows only in straight lines and takes perfect 90-degree turns. The "water" is a viscous, mercury-like fluid. **Smell:** Ozone, hot metal. **Sound:** The soft, sharp "click" as the river turns a corner.
*   **The City of the Prime Polygon:** A "city" that is a single, massive, multi-faceted geometric shape. Home of the Un-Beasts. **Smell:** Sterile, clean air. **Sound:** A chorus of pure, musical tones.
*   **Arion's Last Stand:** A small, circular area of "normal" jungle in the center of the Un-Jungle, preserved by Arion's final act. **Smell:** Normal jungle smells, which are shocking in their context. **Sound:** Normal jungle sounds, which are deafening in their context.
*   **The Monolith of Pure Logic:** A 1000-foot tall, perfectly smooth, black monolith. The "heart" of the Un-Jungle and a direct conduit to The Architect. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** A sound that is the opposite of sound, which actively erases other noises.

### The Fortress of the Bronze Patrons
A hidden monastery-fortress, built in a place of perfect natural balance.
*   **The Chamber of the Scale:** The central chamber, containing a massive, metaphysical scale that shows the current balance of the world. **Smell:** Old stone, incense, ozone. **Sound:** The faint, almost imperceptible creak of the great scale.
*   **The Reliquary of Heroes:** A vault containing the artifacts of previous Men of Bronze. **Smell:** Polished bronze, old leather, magic. **Sound:** A respectful silence.
*   **The Training Grounds:** A series of rooms and outdoor spaces designed to test a candidate's body, mind, and spirit. **Smell:** Sweat, clean mountain air, ozone. **Sound:** The shouts of instructors, the clash of practice weapons.
*   **The Library of Balance:** A library containing philosophical texts on the nature of balance. **Smell:** Old paper, leather, and the faint scent of ozone. **Sound:** The soft rustle of turning pages.
*   **The Meditation Gardens:** A garden where every plant, rock, and stream is in perfect, harmonious balance. **Smell:** Flowers, wet earth, clean air. **Sound:** The gentle trickle of water, the buzz of a single bee.

### The Glitch-Zone
A region of reality warped by the Architects of the Unbalanced Equation.
*   **The Probability Market:** A market where you can buy or sell "luck." **Smell:** Ozone, and the scent of whatever you desire most. **Sound:** A cacophony of a thousand different conversations happening at once.
*   **The River of "What If":** A river that, if you drink from it, shows you the outcome of a single, different choice in your past. **Smell:** Regret, and the scent of ozone. **Sound:** The whisper of a thousand might-have-beens.
*   **The Town of Schrodinger:** A town that is simultaneously in ruins and perfectly preserved. **Smell:** Dust and decay, mixed with fresh bread and flowers. **Sound:** Screams of terror mixed with happy laughter.
*   **The Null-Factor's Laboratory:** A laboratory that seems to be built from pure mathematics. **Smell:** Chalk dust, ozone, and the faint smell of burning reality. **Sound:** The frantic scratching of chalk on a blackboard, the Null-Factor's cheerful humming.
*   **The Fountain of Randomness:** A fountain that spouts not water, but random, small objects (a shoe, a fish, a love letter, a hand grenade). **Smell:** Everything and nothing. **Sound:** A constant, surprising series of plops, clangs, and splashes.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Fulcrum Blade
**Type:** Legendary Longsword
**Description:** The personal weapon of the Man of Bronze, a sword that seems to be made of solidified, shimmering twilight. It is neither heavy nor light, neither sharp nor dull, but perfectly "correct."
**Mechanics:** The sword is a +3 weapon. It is so perfectly balanced that the wielder can use their reaction to parry a melee attack, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll. Once per day, the wielder can plant the sword in the ground to create a "Zone of Balance" in a 30-foot radius. Within the zone, all damage rolls (both for enemies and allies) result in their average number (e.g., a d6 is always 3.5, rounded to 4).

### 2. The Scales of Judgment
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A set of small, perfectly crafted bronze scales. They do not measure weight, but concepts.
**Mechanics:** If you place two objects on the scales, the scales will tip towards the object that is more "conceptually significant." For example, a king's crown would outweigh a mountain. If you place objects representing two courses of action on the scales, they will tip towards the action that would create more "balance" in the world. This can be used to get hints from the DM.

### 3. The Armor of the Unmoved
**Type:** Legendary Plate Armor
**Description:** Armor worn by a previous Man of Bronze who was a master of stoicism. It is made of a strange, grey metal that seems to absorb light and sound.
**Mechanics:** The armor is +2 plate armor. The wearer is immune to being charmed, frightened, or moved against their will. They also gain the ability to, once per day, declare that they are "unmoved" by a single event. For the next minute, they are immune to all damage and effects from that event (e.g., a dragon's breath, a building collapsing on them). **Curse:** The wearer slowly loses their ability to be "moved" by emotion, suffering disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

### 4. The Eye of the Storm
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Amulet)
**Description:** A bronze amulet containing a perfectly still, perfectly clear gemstone. Inside the gem, a tiny, raging storm can be seen.
**Mechanics:** The amulet allows the wearer to find the "center" of any chaotic situation. It grants advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern motives in a crowd, and on checks to navigate through a riot or a battlefield. Once per day, the wearer can use it to create a 30-foot sphere of perfect calm and silence, even in the middle of a hurricane or a magical explosion.

### 5. The Seed of the Middle Way
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A simple, bronze-colored seed. It is the "potential" for a new Man of Bronze.
**Mechanics:** The seed cannot be used by just anyone. A character must first prove they are "in balance" (DM's discretion, based on their actions). Once they have, they can plant the seed in their own heart. This begins the transformation into the Man of Bronze, a process that is long, painful, and requires further trials. If planted in the ground in a place of perfect balance, it will grow into a "Sanctuary of the Fulcrum," a permanent safe haven from the forces of both Law and Chaos.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Clockwork Orange:** A mechanical orange that, when peeled, reveals a perfectly functioning, tiny clockwork mechanism.
2.  **A Feral Spoon:** A spoon that has "gone wild" and will aggressively try to scoop up any nearby liquid.
3.  **The Philosopher's Stoned:** A rock that, when you hold it, makes you ponder deep, philosophical questions, but you are also just very, very high.
4.  **A Map to a Place That Doesn't Exist Yet:** A map that shows a city or location that will only come into being if you follow the map to its location.
5.  **The Apathetic Sword:** A sword that is technically magical, but can't be bothered to do anything special.
6.  **A Bag of Holding... a Grudge:** A bag that will hold your items, but it will remember every time you put something smelly or sharp in it, and will occasionally refuse to give you an item back out of spite.
7.  **The Emergency Moustache:** A fake moustache that, when worn, makes everyone perceive you as a "competent, trustworthy stranger." Single use.
8.  **A Single, Re-usable Echo:** A small, smooth stone that can "record" one sound and then "play it back" once.
9.  **The Boot of Inopportune Stomping:** A single boot that will, at the most socially awkward moment possible, stomp its foot loudly.
10. **The Schrödinger's Key:** A key that fits any lock, but has a 50% chance of locking it permanently instead of opening it.
11. **A Jar of Sentient Pickles:** A jar of pickles. The pickles are sentient, telepathic, and very, very bored.
12. **The Anti-Gravity Paperweight:** A paperweight that is so heavy, it has its own, tiny gravitational field.
13. **The Humble Pie:** A pie that, when eaten, forces you to admit your biggest mistake to the person nearest to you.
14. **A Single, Disappointed Glove:** A glove that, when you put it on, sighs with disappointment, no matter what you do.
15. **The Bureaucrat's Pen:** A pen that can create triplicate copies of any document, but the document is now 100 pages long and filled with incomprehensible legalese.
16. **The Arrow of Near-Misses:** An arrow that will always miss its target, but in a very dramatic and impressive way.
17. **A Single, Unpeelable Potato:** A potato whose skin is magically bonded to its flesh. It cannot be peeled.
18. **The Tea-Cup of Tempests:** A teacup that has a tiny, raging storm inside it.
19. **The Socially Anxious Cloak:** A cloak that will try to hide behind you if it is the center of attention.
20. **A Rock That Gets Your Jokes:** A small, friendly rock. If you tell it a joke, it will vibrate with silent, appreciative laughter.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Extremes
The world is literally being pulled apart by two opposing concepts. This affects all aspects of reality.
*   **Conceptual Purity:** In a place of pure Law (like Aethelburg), chaotic magic (like Wild Magic) is dampened. All Wild Magic rolls are made with disadvantage. In a place of pure Chaos (like Ki'Var), lawful magic (like Abjuration) is dampened, requiring a successful spellcasting check to even cast.
*   **The Tipping Point:** The world has a "Balance Score," from -10 (Pure Law) to +10 (Pure Chaos). The DM tracks this score. The party's actions can shift the score. At the extremes (-8 or +8), reality begins to fray, causing environmental damage and strange effects. If the score reaches -10 or +10, the world is torn apart and the campaign is lost.
*   **Bronze Resonance:** Items, people, and places that are "in balance" have a special resonance. A Man of Bronze (or a candidate) can sense this resonance, allowing them to find hidden paths, discern truth from lies, and feel the "weight" of a decision.

### Subsystems: The Path to the Fulcrum
Becoming the Man of Bronze is not a matter of leveling up, but of achieving personal balance.
*   **The Inner Scale:** Each player has a personal "Inner Scale," tracking their actions on a scale from Law to Chaos. Actions that are purely logical, emotionless, or civilized push the scale towards Law. Actions that are purely instinctual, emotional, or savage push it towards Chaos.
*   **Achieving Balance:** To become a candidate for the Man of Bronze, a player must bring their Inner Scale to a perfect zero. This requires them to consciously take actions that balance their previous tendencies.
*   **The Transformation:** Once a character is at zero, they can undergo the Ritual of Bronze. This is a series of grueling trials that test their ability to *maintain* that balance under pressure. Success means they become the new Man of Bronze. Failure means they are consumed by the process, becoming either a being of pure Law or pure Chaos.
