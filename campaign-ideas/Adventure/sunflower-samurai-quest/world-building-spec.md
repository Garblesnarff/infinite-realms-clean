# World-Building Specification Brief: Sunflower Samurai Quest

**Core Concept:** Players are three unlikely companions—two rival swordsmen and a young woman—traveling anachronistic Edo Japan searching for "the samurai who smells of sunflowers." Each session brings episodic adventures mixing hip-hop culture with feudal aesthetics. They bicker, bond, and eventually discover the sunflower samurai is Fuu's father, who abandoned her to protect her from Christian persecution. The campaign is road trip found-family—journey matters more than destination.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Edo-period Japan with impossible anachronisms—hip-hop, graffiti, baseball—treated as normal.
*   Christian persecution during Sakoku isolation period—families hunted, forced into hiding.
*   Sunflowers as secret Christian symbol—representing faith and resilience.
*   The three paths philosophy—everyone walks their own road, sometimes together, sometimes apart.

**Factions:**
*   **The Bakufu Government:** Corrupt officials, hunt Christians, tax heavily, maintain order through oppression.
*   **Yakuza Networks:** Underground economy, honor among thieves, frequent antagonists.
*   **Christian Underground:** Hidden believers using coded symbols, persecuted minority.
*   **The Traveling Trio:** Mugen (wild fighter), Jin (stoic ronin), Fuu (determined seeker).

**Locations:**
*   **Edo Japan Roads:** Diverse settings each session—coastal villages, mountain passes, urban centers.
*   **Nagasaki:** Port city with Christian history, foreign traders, cultural mixing point.
*   **The Dojo:** Sunflower samurai's peaceful refuge, surrounded by sunflower fields.
*   **Various Tea Houses:** Meeting points, rest stops, sources of rumors and quests.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party kills too freely, THEN Jin's honor philosophy clashes with Mugen's brutality.
*   IF they don't follow sunflower clues, THEN they wander episodically but never find Fuu's father.
*   IF Fuu's father dies before meeting her, THEN she carries lifelong regret and unanswered questions.
*   IF the trio stays together after quest ends, THEN they become legendary wandering heroes.
