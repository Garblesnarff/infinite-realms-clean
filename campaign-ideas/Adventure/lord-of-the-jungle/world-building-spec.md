### **World-Building Specification Brief: Lord of the Jungle**

**1. Core Concept:**
Adventurers venture into deepest jungle where they encounter a human raised by apes who rules the wild, discovering lost cities and protecting untamed wilderness from colonial exploitation while questioning what defines civilization.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the origin of the Jungle Lord—tragedy that left infant in the wild, adoption by great apes
*   Explain the lost city of Opar and its Atlantean heritage, degeneration over millennia
*   Describe the great ape tribes and their social structure, intelligence, and territories
*   Write about the indigenous tribes, their history, and relationship with the jungle
*   Detail colonial expansion and its impact on the region
*   Explain the jungle's spiritual aspects—is there truly a "spirit of the wild"?

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Great Apes** (Major) - Intelligent primates, adoptive family, jungle protectors
*   **The Tribe of Mbonga** (Major) - Indigenous people, ancient traditions, jungle knowledge
*   **The Cult of Opar** (Major) - Degenerate Atlanteans, worship Flaming God, guard treasures
*   **Colonial Expedition** (Major) - Explorers, soldiers, traders, varying morality
*   **Ivory Hunters & Slavers** (Minor) - Ruthless exploiters, unambiguous villains
*   **Conservation Society** (Minor) - Enlightened colonials who oppose exploitation
*   **Animal Kingdom** (Minor) - Lions, elephants, other apex predators with territories
