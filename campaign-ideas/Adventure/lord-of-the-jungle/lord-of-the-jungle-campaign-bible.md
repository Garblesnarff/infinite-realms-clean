# Lord of the Jungle: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The Jungle is not a place; it is a being. A single, continent-spanning, sentient plant organism named "Veridia." Its "roots" are mycelial networks that delve deep into the planet's mantle, drawing heat and memories. Its "trees" are fruiting bodies, connected by a single, shared consciousness. The "animals" are not separate creatures, but semi-independent, mobile antibodies, created by Veridia to maintain its ecosystem. And the "Lord of the Jungle" is not a person, but a title, a symbiotic role. When a sufficiently complex creature (historically, a mortal) proves its worth, Veridia bonds with it, making it its avatar. The Lord becomes the jungle's immune system, its protector, and its voice. In return, the host gains immense power over the flora and fauna. But the current Lord, an ancient being known only as "The Gardener," is dying. The symbiotic bond is failing, and Veridia itself has fallen sick, infected by an extra-dimensional, crystalline blight that drives its antibodies mad and twists its growth into cancerous forms. The jungle is now holding a brutal, chaotic "audition" for the next Lord, drawing outsiders into its depths to see who is worthy of its power and its burden.

### Timeline
1.  **The Seeding (Primordial Age):** A single, panspermic seed, Veridia, lands on the barren planet and begins to grow, slowly terraforming the continent.
2.  **The First Antibodies (c. -2,000,000 years):** Veridia creates its first mobile life-forms, the "Primal Beasts," to cultivate and protect it.
3.  **The First Lord (c. -50,000 years):** A lost, early mortal stumbles into the jungle. Veridia, curious about this separate consciousness, forms the first symbiotic bond, creating the first "Lord of the Jungle."
4.  **The Age of Harmony (c. -49,000 to -1,000 years):** A succession of Lords presides over a golden age. The jungle is a paradise, and its Lords are benevolent demigods.
5.  **(Surreal) The Pollen Storms (c. -900 years):** For a decade, the jungle releases clouds of psychoactive pollen that cover the globe. All air-breathing life on the planet experiences shared, vivid dreams of a single, giant, green eye. This is Veridia's first attempt to communicate with the wider world.
6.  **The Blightfall (c. -500 years):** A "meteor" of crystalline, extra-dimensional blight crashes into the heart of the jungle. It is not rock, but a parasitic, crystalline consciousness. The infection begins.
7.  **The Madness of Beasts (c. -450 years):** The blight spreads through the mycelial network. Veridia's antibodies, the animals of the jungle, begin to go mad, becoming unnaturally aggressive and twisted.
8.  **(Surreal) The Weeping Canopy (c. -100 years):** The "leaves" of Veridia, each the size of a small mountain, begin to weep a thick, black, tar-like sap. The rivers run black, and the air is thick with the smell of decay. This is the jungle's pain made manifest.
9.  **The Gardener's Decline (c. -50 years to present):** The current Lord, "The Gardener," is slowly consumed by the blight he is trying to fight. His bond with Veridia weakens, and the jungle's auditions for a new host begin, drawing adventurers, explorers, and fools into its depths.
10. **(Surreal) The Un-Beating Heart (c. -1 week):** The "Heartwood," a colossal, pulsating organ at the center of the jungle, stops beating for a full minute. The silence is felt by every living thing on the continent, a premonition of the final death of Veridia.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle for the soul of a dying god. Veridia is a living world, and its sickness is a cancer that threatens to consume it entirely. The players are potential saviors, but the nature of that salvation is in question. Do they become the new Lord and try to fight a losing battle against the blight? Do they side with factions who would exploit the jungle's power, even if it kills it? Can the blight be "cured," or must the infected parts be "amputated"? The core of the story is a choice between palliative care, radical surgery, or euthanasia for a living continent, with the players cast as the unwilling doctors.

## [TAG: LOCATIONS_MAIN]
### The Canopy of Whispers
The "roof" of the jungle, a miles-thick layer of interwoven, mountain-sized leaves and branches.
*   **The Great Tree-Library:** The home of the Simian Senate, a city built in and around a colossal, hollow tree where historical scrolls are stored. **Smell:** Old paper, ozone, monkey musk. **Sound:** The rustle of leaves, the chattering of apes, the soft slap of hands signing.
*   **The Hanging Gardens of the Bloom-Seekers:** A massive, mobile research station suspended from the canopy by powerful cables. **Smell:** Sterile chemicals, antiseptic, and the faint scent of a thousand different flowers. **Sound:** The hum of generators, the beep of machinery, the clink of glass.
*   **Kaia's Proving Ground:** A section of the canopy where the Primal Guard have set up deadly traps and obstacle courses. **Smell:** Sweat, blood, fear. **Sound:** The snap of a trap, a warrior's kiai, the buzz of giant, venomous insects.
*   **The Aviary of the Sky-Kings:** A vast, open space in the canopy, home to colossal, semi-intelligent birds of prey. **Smell:** Musk, feathers, ozone. **Sound:** The piercing cries of giant raptors, the rush of wind from massive wings.
*   **The Spider-Silk Bridges:** The only way to cross the great chasms in the canopy, bridges woven from the silk of giant, territorial spiders. **Smell:** Dust, decay, and the faint, sweet smell of spider venom. **Sound:** The scuttling of giant spiders, the hum of the wind through the silk strands.

### The River of Black Sap
A great, slow-moving river of the jungle's black, tar-like "blood," a place of sorrow and addiction.
*   **The Tar-Pit Shantytown:** A wretched hive of scum and villainy, where the Hunters of the Black Sap have set up a ramshackle "town" to harvest the sap. **Smell:** Tar, chemical fumes, despair. **Sound:** The bubbling of the sap, the ravings of addicts, the crackle of alchemical fires.
*   **The Weeping Grotto:** A cave behind a waterfall of black sap, where the Gardener's pain is most concentrated. **Smell:** Decay, rot, and an overwhelming sense of grief. **Sound:** The slow, thick drip of the sap, the whispers of forgotten memories.
*   **Rosie's Ferry:** The only "safe" way to cross the river, a rickety ferry operated by "River-Rat" Rosie. **Smell:** Polecat, cheap gin, and desperation. **Sound:** Rosie's constant, cheerful chatter, the groan of the ferry's ropes.
*   **The Sunken Temple of the Serpent-Speakers:** A temple that is slowly sinking into the black sap, home to ancient naga mystics. **Smell:** Incense, old stone, and the cloying sweetness of the sap. **Sound:** Hissing chants, the bubbling of the river.
*   **The Fields of Black Lilies:** Fields of beautiful, white lilies that grow on the banks of the river, their roots drawing up the black sap. They are beautiful, deadly poisonous, and highly sought after by alchemists. **Smell:** A sweet, funereal scent. **Sound:** Absolute silence.

### The Fungal Forests of the Myco-Technicians
A region of the lower jungle where the trees have been replaced by giant, bio-luminescent mushrooms.
*   **The Spore-Mind's Nexus:** The central, largest mushroom, which houses the core of the Myco-Technician's hive-mind. **Smell:** Damp earth, ozone, and a clean, electric smell. **Sound:** A low, telepathic hum that vibrates in your skull.
*   **The Fungal Labs:** Caverns where the Myco-Technicians experiment with new fungal creations. **Smell:** Yeast, chemicals, and the scent of rapid growth. **Sound:** The squelch of growing fungi, the pop of releasing spores.
*   **The Bridge-Fungus:** A single, massive mushroom that has been grown to span a mile-wide chasm. **Smell:** Fresh mushrooms, damp air. **Sound:** The faint, almost imperceptible creak of its growth.
*   **The Garden of Forbidden Flavors:** A fungal garden where the Myco-Technicians cultivate mushrooms that can replicate any flavor, and some that have never been tasted before. **Smell:** A confusing, overwhelming mix of every food you've ever smelled. **Sound:** The gentle puff of spores being released.
*   **The Graveyard of Trees:** The edge of the fungal forest, where the Myco-Technicians are actively killing and replacing Veridia's "trees" with their own fungi. **Smell:** Rotting wood, fresh fungus. **Sound:** The slow, grinding sound of fungal roots breaking down wood.

### The Crystal Scar
The crater where the blight-meteor crashed, now a growing, crystalline landscape that is actively converting the jungle.
*   **The Blight-Heart:** The "meteor" itself, a massive, pulsating crystal that is the heart of the infection. **Smell:** The absence of smell, a sterile, clean scent. **Sound:** A perfect, pure, high-frequency sine wave that makes your teeth ache.
*   **The Crystal Palace of the Prophet:** A twisted, beautiful palace grown from the blight, where the Crystal Prophet preaches his geometric gospel. **Smell:** Ozone, crystal. **Sound:** The ringing and chiming of the crystal structures, the Prophet's musical voice.
*   **The Forest of Glass:** A section of the jungle where all the trees, plants, and animals have been perfectly converted into unmoving, crystal statues. **Smell:** None. **Sound:** Absolute, unnerving silence.
*   **The "Conversion" Pits:** Areas where the blight is actively fighting and converting Veridia's antibodies. **Smell:** The sharp tang of ozone mixed with the coppery scent of blood. **Sound:** The snarls of dying beasts, the crackle of growing crystal.
*   **The Geometric River:** A river that has been infected. The water now flows in perfect right angles and forms crystalline ice-sculptures, even in the jungle's heat. **Smell:** Ozone, cold. **Sound:** The sharp crack of freezing water, the scrape of ice.

### The Heartwood of Veridia
The "brain" and "heart" of the entire jungle organism, a miles-wide, living nexus of wood, vines, and pulsating organs.
*   **The Gardener's Grove:** A small, peaceful, and dying section of the Heartwood where the Gardener resides. **Smell:** Rich soil, blooming flowers, and the faint scent of decay. **Sound:** The rustle of leaves, the creak of ancient wood, the Gardener's tired breathing.
*   **The Chamber of Lords:** A cavern in the center of the Heartwood where the consciousness of all previous Lords of the Jungle reside as echoes. **Smell:** Dust, memories, ozone. **Sound:** A chorus of a thousand whispering voices.
*   **The Antibody Vats:** Pulsating, organic pods where Veridia creates its animal "antibodies." **Smell:** Birth, ammonia, primordial soup. **Sound:** The wet, squelching sound of new life being formed.
*   **The Root-Nexus:** The deepest part of the Heartwood, where Veridia's "roots" converge before plunging into the planet's mantle. **Smell:** Hot earth, minerals, ancient magic. **Sound:** A deep, planetary rumble.
*   **The Scar of the Blight:** A cancerous, crystalline growth on the Heartwood itself, the main point of the blight's infection. **Smell:** Rot, ozone, and the scent of a dying god. **Sound:** The crackle of the blight's growth, the pained groan of the Heartwood.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Heart of Veridia
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** A pulsating, seed-like organ, given to the true Lord of the Jungle. It is the psychic and biological focus of the symbiotic bond.
**Mechanics:** The holder is considered the "Lord of the Jungle." They can cast *Speak with Animals* and *Speak with Plants* at will. Once per day, they can cast *Transport via Plants* to travel anywhere within the jungle. As an action, they can issue a psychic command to the jungle, causing effects similar to *Entangle*, *Spike Growth*, or summoning a swarm of beasts. **Curse:** The holder feels Veridia's pain as their own, taking 1d6 psychic damage every hour the blight is not being actively fought.

### 2. The Gardener's Scythe
**Type:** Legendary Scythe
**Description:** A long, wicked-looking scythe, with a blade of hardened wood and a handle of twisted, blighted crystal. It was the Gardener's tool and weapon.
**Mechanics:** The scythe is a +3 weapon. It deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to plants and an extra 2d8 radiant damage to crystalline creatures (like the blighted). The wielder can use it to cast *Blight* once per day. **Curse:** The wielder must make a Wisdom save each day. On a failure, they become obsessed with "pruning" and "weeding," and will attack any creature they deem "imperfect" or "unnatural."

### 3. The Spore-Loom of the Myco-Technicians
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** A large, complex loom made of living fungus. It can weave fungal spores into solid, biological constructs.
**Mechanics:** A user who attunes to the loom can spend 8 hours to weave a "Fungal Homunculus," a loyal servant with the stats of a Scarecrow. They can also weave smaller items like fungal armor, spore-grenades, or grappling hooks. Using the loom is intoxicating, and requires a CON save to avoid being stunned for 1 hour after use.

### 4. The Unbroken Scroll of the Simian Senate
**Type:** Artifact (Scroll)
**Description:** A single, massive scroll, miles long, containing the entire, unabridged history of the jungle, written by generations of ape-historians.
**Mechanics:** A creature who spends 1 hour reading the scroll can ask it a single question about the jungle's past. The scroll will provide a truthful, detailed answer. Once per week, the reader can find a "hidden story" in the margins, which functions as a *Legend Lore* spell. **Curse:** The knowledge is overwhelming. Each time the scroll is read, the user must make an INT save or have their own memories temporarily replaced by the memories of an ancient ape.

### 5. The Perfect Blight-Crystal
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** The "heart" of the original blight-meteor, a flawless, mathematically perfect, pulsating crystal.
**Mechanics:** The crystal emits an aura of pure, logical order. Any creature within 30 feet cannot tell a lie or act randomly. Once per day, the holder can use it to cast *Geas* on a creature, commanding it to perform a single, logical action. The crystal can also be used to "tame" and control lesser blighted creatures. **Curse:** The holder slowly loses the ability to experience emotion. After holding it for a week, they become immune to being charmed or frightened, but they also cannot benefit from inspiration or advantage gained through emotional means.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Monkey's Paw That Gives Advice:** A classic monkey's paw, but instead of granting wishes, it just gives you three pieces of very bad, but well-intentioned, advice.
2.  **The Self-Peeling Banana:** A banana that, when you intend to eat it, peels itself. It's a bit unsettling.
3.  **A Vine That Thinks It's a Snake:** A 50-foot length of vine that hisses, tries to bite you, and moves on its own. It is, however, just a vine.
4.  **The Archaeologist's Brush of Revelation:** A small brush that, when used to clear dust from a ruin, whispers a single, completely false "fact" about its history.
5.  **A Bag of Holding, but for Smells:** A bag that can capture and store smells. You can open it later to release the smell.
6.  **The Carnivorous Flower Pot:** A flower pot that will slowly eat any plant you put in it.
7.  **A Mosquito That Steals Memories:** A single, preserved mosquito in amber. If you crack the amber, the mosquito will fly out, "bite" a random creature, and then fly back to you, telepathically showing you a single, mundane memory from that creature.
8.  **The Unimpressed Rock:** A rock that you can show your greatest treasures or accomplishments to. It remains completely, unimpressed.
9.  **A Compass That Points to the Nearest Edible Thing:** Useful, but often distracting.
10. **The Alchemist's Regret:** A potion that, when drunk, makes you vividly remember every bad decision you've ever made.
11. **A Liana That's a Terrible Liar:** A vine that you can use as a rope, but it will constantly tell you it's about to break, even when it's perfectly safe.
12. **The Critic's Fruit:** A piece of fruit that, when eaten, gives you the ability to find a flaw in anything, no matter how perfect.
13. **A Map Drawn by a Blind Ape:** It's surprisingly accurate, but only if you read it with your eyes closed.
14. **The Malingering Machete:** A machete that complains of a headache whenever you try to chop something with it.
15. **A Jar of Instant Rain:** A jar that, when opened, causes a small, personal raincloud to follow you for an hour.
16. **The Tourist's Camera:** A strange, Progenitor device that takes "pictures." The pictures are perfect, but they always include a strange, out-of-place person in a brightly-colored shirt giving a thumbs-up.
17. **A Single, Indestructible Flower:** A beautiful flower that cannot be cut, burned, or destroyed. It does, however, wilt if you insult it.
18. **The Humidifier Rock:** A rock that is always slightly damp and makes the air around it uncomfortably humid.
19. **A Sample of "Silent" Water:** Water taken from a place where sound doesn't exist. It makes no sound when poured or splashed. Drinking it makes you unable to speak for a minute.
20. **The Apathetic Ant-Hill:** A small, portable ant-hill. The ants within couldn't care less about what you do. They have their own problems.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Symbiosis
Veridia is a single, interconnected organism. This has tangible effects on magic and survival.
*   **Jungle-Sense:** Any spell that gathers information (e.g., *Scrying*, *Locate Creature*) has a chance of being "intercepted" by Veridia's consciousness. The DM can choose to answer with the jungle's own, alien perspective, providing a true but perhaps unhelpful or misleading answer.
*   **Shared Life-Force:** Healing magic is less effective in the jungle, as Veridia jealously guards its own life-force. All magical healing is halved. However, characters can learn to "bond" with the jungle (through actions, or by siding with certain factions), allowing them to draw on its life force to heal, at the cost of taking on some of its sickness (psychic damage, or a temporary mutation).
*   **Antibody Response:** The more a party uses powerful, destructive magic or technology, the more the jungle perceives them as a threat. This increases the frequency and hostility of "random" encounters, as Veridia sends its antibodies to deal with the "infection."

### Subsystems: Blight-Corruption and Lord's Favor
*   **Blight-Corruption:** Exposure to the blight (being damaged by blighted creatures, spending time in the Crystal Scar) forces a character to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain a level of Blight-Corruption. Each level grants a minor crystalline "gift" (e.g., +1 AC as your skin hardens) but also a drawback (e.g., disadvantage on social checks as you become more alien). At 5 levels, the character becomes a Blighted NPC under the DM's control.
*   **Lord's Favor:** This is a tracked score representing the party's standing with Veridia itself. It increases when the party acts in the jungle's interest (cleansing blight, helping its antibodies, etc.) and decreases when they harm it. High favor can lead to the jungle actively helping the party (vines lowering to help them climb, animals showing them the way). Low favor can lead to the jungle actively trying to kill them (sentient plants attacking, the ground opening up beneath them). This is the primary metric for determining who is "worthy" of becoming the next Lord.
