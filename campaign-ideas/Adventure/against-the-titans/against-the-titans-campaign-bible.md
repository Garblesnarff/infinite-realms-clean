# Campaign Bible: Against the Titans

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Scars
Before the world was, there was the **Cosmic Flesh**, an infinite, living tapestry of raw creation. The Titans were its first thoughts, vast and powerful, but also clumsy and destructive. In their primordial dance, they tore great gashes in the Cosmic Flesh, creating the stars, the planets, and the very fabric of reality. These gashes, however, never truly healed. They festered, becoming the **Void-Wounds**, from which monstrous, formless entities now leak into existence. The world is not a planet; it is a scab, precariously holding back the true horror of the Titans' careless birth. The Titans themselves are not evil; they are merely children, playing with a universe they do not understand, and their games threaten to unravel everything.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Primordial Dance):** The Titans, in their chaotic birth, tear the Cosmic Flesh, creating the universe.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Void-Wound):** A tear in reality above the nascent world begins to leak formless horrors.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Age of Giants):** Lesser Titans, the Giants, are born from the world's fear, acting as a buffer between mortals and their colossal parents.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Sleep):** The Elder Titans, exhausted by their creation, fall into a deep slumber, their dreams shaping the world's early myths.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Titanomachy Echo):** A localized psychic ripple from a forgotten Titan war causes all mountains to briefly sing in unison, driving 10% of the mortal population mad.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Sky-Shattering):** A sleeping Titan rolls over, causing a meteor shower that lasts a century, reshaping continents and creating the "Crater-Lands."
7.  **-500 Y (The Whispering Peaks):** A new Void-Wound opens in the highest mountain range. Those who climb too high hear the whispers of cosmic horror.
8.  **-100 Y (The Titan's Sigh):** A Titan stirs in its sleep, causing a global earthquake that lasts a week, destroying ancient civilizations and revealing forgotten dungeons.
9.  **-10 Y (The First Awakening):** A minor Titan, **Kronos the Restless**, begins to stir, its dreams manifesting as localized reality distortions and monstrous births.
10. **Present Day:** Kronos the Restless fully awakens, its colossal shadow falling over the capital city. Its first act is to pluck the highest tower from the city and use it as a toothpick.

### The "Why": The World as a Toy
The conflict is not a battle for survival; it is a struggle for **Relevance**. The Titans are waking up, and they see the world as their plaything, a vast sandbox filled with interesting toys (mortals). They are not malicious, but utterly indifferent to the lives they crush underfoot. The world's existence is a cosmic accident, and the Titans are simply reclaiming their property. The party's struggle is to prove that their lives, their world, and their choices have meaning, even in the face of such overwhelming, indifferent power.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Titan Proximity
*   **Aura of Indifference:** When within 1 mile of an active Titan, all creatures must make a WIS save (DC 10 + 1 per mile closer) at the start of each day. On a failure, they gain a level of "Cosmic Indifference," making them less empathetic and more prone to nihilism.
*   **Reality Distortion:** When within 1000 feet of an active Titan, localized reality distortions can occur. Roll a d6 at the start of each hour:
    *   1-2: Minor gravity fluctuations (jump height doubled/halved).
    *   3-4: Sensory overload (colors shift, sounds echo strangely).
    *   5-6: Temporal stutter (one round is skipped or repeated).

### Subsystem: Colossus-Scale Combat
*   **Targeting:** Attacking a Titan is like attacking a moving mountain. Specific "weak points" (eyes, joints, Void-Wounds) must be targeted, requiring high attack rolls or specific maneuvers.
*   **Movement:** Titans move so slowly that their movement is often measured in "zones" rather than feet. Players can spend multiple rounds traversing a Titan's limb.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** A Titan's movements create environmental hazards: earthquakes, rockslides, dust clouds, and even localized weather changes.
