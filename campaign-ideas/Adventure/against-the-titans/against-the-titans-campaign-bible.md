# Campaign Bible: Against the Titans

## [TAG: LORE_CORE] Deep Lore & History

### Origin Myth: The Weeping of the World
In the beginning, the world was a silent, gray sphere of smooth obsidian. It did not breathe, and it did not bleed. Then came the **Star-Vomit**, a cosmic sickness that struck the planet's core. To purge this alien infection, the world's crust cracked open, birthing the Titans—white blood cells of stone, fire, and fury. They were not designed to coexist with life; they were designed to scour the infection. Humanity, elves, and dwarves are merely the dust mites living on the fevered skin of a dying god, and the Titans are the immune system trying to scrub us off.

### Timeline of the Colossus Era
1.  **Year 0 (The Cracking):** The first Titan, *Orogenes*, erupts from the planetary mantle. The continent of Aethelgard is split in half.
2.  **Year 15 (The Great Silence):** Civilization collapses. Magic becomes erratic near Titans due to their immense bio-gravitational fields.
3.  **Year 50 (The First Fell):** The hero **Kaelen the Ant** climbs inside the Titan *Ignis* and severs its heart-artery. The first Slayer is born.
4.  **Year 52:** The Slayer’s Guild is founded in the hollowed-out ribcage of *Ignis*.
5.  **Year 108 (The Rain of Teeth):** A sky-born Titan sheds its milk-teeth over the capital city. The teeth are the size of houses; thousands die, but the survivors build unbreachable walls from the enamel.
6.  **Year 200 (The Flesh-Graft Heresy):** A cult attempts to graph Titan flesh onto human infants. The result is the creation of the *Abominants*, now hunted by the Guild.
7.  **Year 350 (The Singing Plague):** A Titan dies and its decomposing body releases a spore that causes victims to sing uncontrollably until their lungs liquify.
8.  **Year 410 (The Day the Mountain Walked):** The Petramach is sighted. The Guild declares a Continental State of Emergency.
9.  **Year 415:** Professor Arkwright proposes the "Symbiosis Theory," suggesting killing Titans accelerates the Star-Vomit infection. He is laughed out of the Royal Academy.
10. **Present Day:** The Petramach changes course toward the Last Bastion.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil; it is **Macro vs. Micro**. The Titans are fighting a war on a planetary scale against a cosmic cancer. Slayers are killing the world's defenders to save the "fleas" (civilization). If the Slayers win and eradicate the Titans, the Star-Vomit will consume the planet's core, and the world will rot from the inside out.
