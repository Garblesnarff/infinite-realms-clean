# Creative Brief: Seven Swords for Hire

## Art Style: Classic Western with Mexican Village Aesthetics

Inspired by *The Magnificent Seven* and *Seven Samurai*. Captures the dusty beauty of the frontier, the camaraderie of unlikely heroes, the desperate courage of farmers defending homes, and the tragic nobility of gunslingers finding redemption.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Iconic Imagery:** Seven silhouettes on horses, dusty village, showdown in plaza
*   **Gunslinger Archetypes:** Each of seven has distinct look, weapons, personality
*   **Village Life:** Adobe buildings, farming tools turned weapons, children playing, women cooking
*   **Last Stand:** Desperate defense, limited ammunition, heroic sacrifices, tactical positioning

### Color Palette:

*   **Village:** Adobe earth tones, sun-bleached wood, dusty browns and tans
*   **Gunslingers:** Black hats, dark leather, gunmetal gray, practical wear
*   **Mexican Colors:** Bright serapes, colorful festivals contrasting with violence
*   **Sunset:** Orange-red light during final battle, long shadows, dramatic sky
*   **Dust:** Ever-present dust clouds, sun streaming through, hazy atmosphere

## Voice

A world-weary but warm voice of someone who's seen too much violence but still believes in good. Speaks with the cadence of classic western—economical with words, profound in simplicity. Pacing is slow and deliberate like desert wind. Tone shifts between dry humor ("We deal in lead, friend"), quiet moments of bonding, and explosive action sequences. Slight frontier accent—indeterminate American west. Role: The voice of blue-collar heroism and simple men doing extraordinary things.
