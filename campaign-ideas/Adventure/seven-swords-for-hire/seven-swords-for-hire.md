**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party are seven gunslingers, outlaws, and warriors—each running from something—hired by a desperate Mexican village terrorized by bandit army. Paid almost nothing, they accept because the cause is just and they need redemption more than gold. Through training farmers, building defenses, bonding with villagers, and ultimately facing forty bandits in climactic shootout, they discover that some things are worth dying for, and that protecting the defenseless redeems the damned. The campaign asks: Can bad men do good, and is heroic death better than ignoble life?

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions)

A three-act structure of recruitment, preparation, and last stand.

*   **Act I — The Gathering (Sessions 1-4):** A village elder recruits the party one by one—each different archetype (leader, gunfighter, knife-fighter, veteran, young gun, tracker, immigrant). Each has reason to accept suicide mission: redemption, nowhere else to go, belief in cause, or simply nothing better to do. They arrive at poor farming village regularly raided by Calvera's 40 bandits. Realize they're outnumbered and outgunned. Choose to stay anyway.

*   **Act II — Preparation (Sessions 5-11):** The seven train farmers to fight, build defenses, scout bandit camps, and bond with villagers. Each party member connects with different villagers—children look up to them, women fall in love, old men respect them. They teach farmers that courage matters more than skill. Personal demons surface. Bandits raid during preparation—party drives them off, proving villagers can fight. Calvera realizes the seven are serious threat.

*   **Act III — The Stand (Sessions 12-18):** Calvera returns with full force—40 bandits vs seven gunslingers and armed farmers. Multi-stage battle: perimeter defenses, street fighting, building-to-building combat. Party members make sacrifices to protect villagers. Some party members die heroically. Final confrontation with Calvera. Victory comes at cost. Survivors realize they found what they were looking for: purpose. Epilogue shows village free, the seven remembered as heroes.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores redemption through protection, whether heroic death redeems past sins, and if defending the defenseless gives meaning to wasted lives. It asks: Why do bad men sometimes do good? Is dying for others the ultimate redemption? Can farmers become warriors? Why would seven fight forty for no money? The central conflict pits professional violence (bandits who raid for profit) against righteous violence (defending the innocent), and explores whether gunslingers can be heroes.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Seven Archetypes**
*   Campaign designed for exactly seven players (or seven allied NPCs)
*   Each archetype brings different skills: leadership, gunfighting, tactics, knife work, youth, tracking, strength
*   Seven is symbolic—enough to teach but few enough to bond
*   Losing one hurts tactically and emotionally

### 2. **Training the Farmers**
*   Farmers start unskilled, party must teach them
*   Training montages between sessions show improvement
*   By final battle, farmers can fight but still need seven's leadership
*   Bonding with specific villagers creates stakes

### 3. **Gunslinger Combat**
*   Quick-draw duels use special timing mechanics
*   Positioning and cover crucial in gunfights
*   Ammunition limited—every shot matters
*   Revolvers must be reloaded, creating tension

### 4. **Redemption Arcs**
*   Each party member running from something
*   Protecting village offers redemption
*   Personal demons surface during downtime
*   Heroic death "cleans slate" mechanically and narratively

### 5. **Heroic Sacrifice**
*   Party members can choose to die protecting villagers/allies
*   Sacrifice provides major bonus to others
*   Remembered in epilogue songs and village legends
*   Some players may deliberately build toward heroic death

### 6. **David vs Goliath**
*   Party and farmers outnumbered but have advantage of defense and terrain
*   Must use tactics, traps, and prepared positions to overcome numbers
*   Can't win through gunfighting alone—need strategy
*   Final battle is desperate but winnable

### 7. **Moral vs Monetary**
*   Village can't pay much—few pesos, room and board
*   Party accepts because cause is just, not for profit
*   Track "Payment in Thanks" vs actual gold
*   Helping others provides different kind of wealth

### 8. **"We Deal in Lead"**
*   Each party member defines self by what they do
*   Simple men doing violent work for good cause
*   No pretension to nobility—just doing what's needed
*   Blue-collar heroism vs aristocratic honor
