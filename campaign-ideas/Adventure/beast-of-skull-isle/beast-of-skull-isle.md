## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8-12 sessions)

A tale of wonder turned to tragedy, and the consequences of exploitation.

*   **Act I — Into the Unknown (Sessions 1–4):** The party joins Lord Crane's expedition aboard the ship *The Siren's Call*, traveling to Skull Isle. They must survive the treacherous storm wall, make first contact with the Isle's native tribe, and discover the existence of Kong when he saves one of their party members from a pack of raptors. They witness Kong's role as the island's protector.
*   **Act II — The Capture (Sessions 5–8):** Lord Crane reveals his true purpose: capture Kong for his "Grand Exhibition" in the capital. Using alchemical gas and mechanical restraints, the expedition subdues the Beast. The party must choose their allegiance. If they resist, Crane turns against them. If they comply, they witness the tribe's despair and the island's ecosystem beginning to collapse without its guardian.
*   **Act III — The Rampage (Sessions 9–12):** Kong is displayed in chains at the capital's Grand Theater. Inevitably, he escapes. The party must navigate the chaos as Kong rampages through the city, searching for the one person he connected with on the island. The campaign climaxes atop the city's tallest tower, where the party must decide Kong's fate: help him escape and face the consequences, or allow the military to gun him down to save the city.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Last Uncharted Place"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Recruitment
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party meets Lord Crane, a charismatic entrepreneur who claims to have a map to Skull Isle, a place considered myth. He offers a fortune for their protection and expertise.
    *   The voyage aboard *The Siren's Call* begins. Crew includes the jaded first mate Renwick, the ambitious naturalist Dr. Selene Voss, and the mysterious navigator who claims to have survived the island before.
    *   The ship enters the storm wall surrounding the island—a supernatural barrier of perpetual lightning and wind. Survival becomes the first challenge.
**Escalation:** The ship crashes on the rocky shore. Several crew members are killed. They are stranded.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The Lost World"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party explores Skull Isle: a primordial jungle filled with dinosaurs, giant insects, and carnivorous plants. The ruins of an ancient civilization dot the landscape.
    *   They encounter the Iwala Tribe, who are initially hostile but relent when they see the party is not here to conquer. The tribe's elder, Moana, warns them: "Do not anger the Guardian. He is all that keeps the Deep Things at bay."
    *   At night, the party is attacked by a pack of velociraptors. A massive roar shakes the jungle. Kong—a 60-foot tall silverback gorilla—emerges and drives the raptors away. He locks eyes with one party member (the most empathetic or smallest PC), then vanishes.
**Escalation:** Lord Crane becomes obsessed. He privately tells his inner circle (possibly including some PCs): "That creature is worth more than this entire island. We're taking it back."

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Beauty and the Beast"
*   **Focus:** Relationship-building / Moral Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party member Kong focused on begins having encounters with the Beast. Kong is curious, surprisingly gentle, and protective. Despite his size, he displays intelligence and emotion.
    *   Dr. Voss studies Kong from afar, noting his role in the ecosystem—he keeps the predators in check and prevents the "Deep Things" (massive, tentacled horrors from the island's interior) from spreading.
    *   Lord Crane prepares his trap: a massive net, alchemical gas grenades, and mechanical restraints. He tasks the party with luring Kong to a clearing.
    *   The party must choose: help Crane, sabotage the plan, or warn the tribe.
**Escalation:** If the party helps, Kong is captured. If they resist, Crane reveals he has explosives planted near the tribe's village as leverage.

### Sessions 6-7 — "The Chains"
*   **Focus:** Consequence / Guilt
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Kong is bound and sedated, loaded onto a hastily-repaired ship. The Iwala Tribe mourns, and Moana delivers a curse: "You have doomed us all. The Deep Things will rise."
    *   During the voyage back, Kong is kept drugged. The party sees his despair—he barely eats, and his eyes search for the one who showed him kindness. If the party resisted, they are imprisoned as mutineers.
    *   The ship arrives at the capital city of Meridian, a gleaming metropolis. Lord Crane promotes his "Grand Exhibition: The Eighth Wonder of the World!" Tickets sell out instantly.
**Escalation:** News from Skull Isle: ships report massive tentacles rising from the sea near the island. The tribe is likely dead.

### Sessions 8-9 — "The Exhibition"
*   **Focus:** Tension / Ethical Dilemma
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Grand Theater is packed with nobles and commoners. Kong is chained on stage, displayed under blinding lights. He roars in anguish and fury.
    *   Crane gives a speech about "Man's dominion over nature." During the performance, Kong breaks one chain. Panic begins.
    *   The party has a brief window: they can either help subdue Kong (gaining favor with the authorities) or sabotage his remaining chains (freeing him but unleashing chaos).
**Escalation:** Kong breaks free. The rampage begins.

### Sessions 10-12 — "The Fall"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Tragedy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Kong rampages through Meridian, searching for the party member he bonded with. He is not mindlessly violent—he swats away attackers but only kills when cornered. He's trying to escape.
    *   The party must navigate the chaos: rescue civilians, confront Crane (who flees with his fortune), and decide whether to help Kong or stop him.
    *   Kong climbs the city's tallest structure—the Skyspire Tower—with the party member he bonded with (either carried gently or pursued if that PC is helping others). The military surrounds the tower with ballistae and spellcasters.
    *   The final choice: Convince Kong to surrender (nearly impossible), help him escape via a portal or skyship (difficult and costly), or let the military fire (Kong's certain death).
**Resolution:** Kong's fate is sealed. If killed, his final act is to gently set down the person he tried to protect. The campaign ends with the party witnessing the aftermath—Crane's reputation destroyed, the city mourning its dead, and the question: "Were we the monsters all along?"

## Major NPCs

1.  **Kong, the Guardian** — *The Tragic Beast*
    *   **Role:** The 60-foot silverback gorilla who rules Skull Isle. He is intelligent, emotional, and protective of his domain and those he bonds with.
    *   **Personality:** Noble, curious, and capable of great gentleness despite his size. He displays grief, rage, and loneliness. He is not a monster—he is a prisoner.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Kong is the last of his kind. His aggression is born from isolation and the burden of protecting the island alone. He forms an intense, heartbreaking bond with one party member.

2.  **Lord Havelock Crane** — *The Exploiter*
    *   **Role:** The expedition's leader, a wealthy entrepreneur who sees Kong as the ultimate spectacle to cement his legacy and fortune.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic, ambitious, and ruthlessly pragmatic. He genuinely believes he is bringing "wonder" to the world but is blind to the cruelty of his actions.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Crane is deeply in debt. He needs Kong's exhibition to succeed or he will lose everything. He will sacrifice anyone to make it happen.

3.  **Moana, Elder of the Iwala** — *The Warning Voice*
    *   **Role:** The spiritual leader of Skull Isle's native tribe. She understands Kong's role as the island's guardian.
    *   **Personality:** Wise, stern, and deeply connected to the island's balance. She speaks in prophecies and warnings, but also shows compassion.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Moana knows the island will fall without Kong, but she also knows trying to stop outsiders often makes things worse. She is resigned to tragedy.

4.  **Dr. Selene Voss** — *The Conflicted Scholar*
    *   **Role:** The expedition's naturalist and scholar. She documents everything about Skull Isle but grows increasingly uncomfortable with Crane's plans.
    *   **Personality:** Intelligent, curious, but morally torn. She wants to study Kong but is horrified by Crane's captivity plans. She can become an ally if the party resists.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Dr. Voss is secretly writing a journal exposing Crane's methods. If Kong dies, she publishes it, destroying Crane's reputation but offering cold comfort.

## Key Locations

1.  **Skull Isle:** A primordial jungle island surrounded by a storm wall, filled with dinosaurs, giant insects, ancient ruins, and the Iwala Tribe's village.

3.  **Meridian:** The capital city, a gleaming metropolis of marble towers, bustling markets, and the Grand Theater where Kong is displayed.
4.  **Skyspire Tower:** The tallest structure in Meridian, a lighthouse-cathedral hybrid. The site of Kong's last stand.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of exploitation, colonialism, and the tragedy of captivity. The central conflict is not just "stop the monster," but "recognize that we created the monster by tearing him from his home." The players must grapple with their complicity, their empathy, and the impossibility of a happy ending once certain lines are crossed.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Kong's Bond**
*   At the end of Session 3, the DM chooses one PC (preferably the most empathetic or the smallest) to become Kong's fixation. This PC has a unique connection:
    *   **Influence:** That PC can attempt Animal Handling checks to calm or redirect Kong, with advantage.
    *   **Target:** Kong will prioritize this PC's safety above all else, even his own. This is both protective and potentially dangerous (he may kidnap them to "save" them).
    *   **Empathy Link:** The PC occasionally experiences flashes of Kong's emotions (grief, rage, confusion), giving insight into his mental state.

### 2. **Exploration Encounter Table (Skull Isle)**
*   Skull Isle is filled with prehistoric dangers. Roll a d10 each time the party travels through the jungle:
    1.  Velociraptor pack ambush
    2.  Giant spider web trap
    3.  Stampeding herd of triceratops
    4.  Poisonous plant field (Con saves or paralysis)
    5.  Quicksand pit
    6.  Ancient ruin with treasure and traps
    7.  Iwala Tribe patrol (potentially hostile)
    8.  Kong sighting (distant roar, massive footprints, glimpse through trees)
    9.  Deep Thing tendril emerging from underground lake
    10.  Safe passage, but ominous signs (bones, claw marks, distant screams)

### 3. **The Rampage Counter**
*   During Kong's rampage in Meridian (Act III), the party races against a **Rampage Counter**:
    *   The counter starts at 0 and increases by 1d4 each round.
    *   Every 10 points of Rampage represents a city block destroyed and civilian casualties.
    *   The party can reduce the counter by: guiding civilians to safety, distracting Kong, or helping Kong move toward the Skyspire (his instinctive goal—the highest point to escape).
    *   If the Rampage Counter exceeds 50, the military fires on Kong regardless of the party's wishes.
