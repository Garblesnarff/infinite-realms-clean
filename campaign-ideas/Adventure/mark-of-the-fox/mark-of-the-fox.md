## Major NPCs

1.  **Don Diego (The Fox)** — *The Masked Hero*
    *   Appears to be effete noble interested only in poetry and fashion. Actually brilliant swordsman and acrobat. May be party member or ally. Secret identity critical.

2.  **Lolita Pulido** — *The Maiden*
    *   Daughter of impoverished noble family. Beautiful, spirited, hates the Fox initially but loves Don Diego (not knowing they're same person). Or party member's romantic interest.

3.  **Captain Esteban** — *The Antagonist*
    *   Ruthless officer enforcing Governor's cruel policies. Skilled swordsman obsessed with capturing the Fox. Can be sympathetic or villainous depending on portrayal.

4.  **Governor Quintero** — *The Tyrant*
    *   Corrupt official bleeding province dry. Cowardly but protected by soldiers. Represents unjust authority. Main antagonist.

5.  **Fray Felipe** — *The Priest*
    *   Sympathetic friar who tends to the poor. Knows the Fox's identity and provides spiritual and practical support. Represents church's better nature.

6.  **Bernardo** — *The Servant*
    *   Deaf-mute manservant (actually pretending to be deaf—can actually hear). Loyal companion who knows identity. Provides alibis and comic relief.

7.  **Sergeant Garcia** — *The Reluctant Enforcer*
    *   Good-hearted but weak-willed soldier who enforces unjust laws because it's his job. Can potentially be turned to heroes' side.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Pueblo:** Colonial Spanish California town. Mission church, plaza, governor's mansion, garrison.
2.  **The Hacienda:** Noble estates where secret identities maintain public personas.
3.  **The Secret Cave:** Hidden headquarters where the Fox keeps costume, weapons, and plans.
4.  **The Mission:** Church providing sanctuary and assistance to oppressed.

## Central Conflict

Justice versus law, public duty versus secret heroism. The Governor's rules are legal but unjust. The Fox breaks laws to serve true justice. Party members with dual identities must balance their respectable public lives against dangerous secret activities. One slip could expose them, endangering everyone they've protected. Romance complications add stakes—loved ones attracted to one identity but dismissive of the other. The question: can you change an unjust system from within, or must you become an outlaw to serve justice?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dual Identity**
*   Maintain two separate reputations. Public identity provides resources and alibis. Secret identity inspires people but attracts danger.

### 2. **The Mark of Zorro**
*   Signature "Z" carved with sword. Intimidates tyrants, inspires peasants. Leaving the mark is a statement.

### 3. **Swashbuckling Combat**
*   Acrobatic sword fighting emphasizing Dexterity over Strength. Disarming, flourishes, environmental use (chandeliers, balconies).

### 4. **Inspiring the People**
*   Heroic actions increase peasant morale. Can call upon commoners for aid when reputation is high enough.

### 5. **Dramatic Escapes**
*   When caught, can attempt elaborate escape sequences using environment, charm, or acrobatics.

### 6. **Romance Complications**
*   Love interests attracted to one identity, dismissive of the other. Creates dramatic irony and tension.

### 7. **Public Persona Management**
*   Must occasionally attend social functions, maintain cover, gather intelligence while pretending to be frivolous noble.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Romantic swashbuckler with clear heroes and villains. The oppressed are sympathetic, the tyrants are corrupt. Action is thrilling but rarely lethal—disarming and humiliation preferred over killing. Romance is passionate and complicated by secret identities. Humor comes from maintaining bumbling public persona while being actually brilliant. Spanish colonial California is colorful and romantic. Justice always triumphs, but personal sacrifices may be required. The mark of the Fox symbolizes hope to the oppressed and fear to oppressors.
