### **World-Building Specification Brief: Mark of the Fox**

**1. Core Concept:**
In colonial California under corrupt governor, masked swordsman (or party) defends oppressed peasants through daring rescues and duels while maintaining secret noble identity, inspiring revolution through the mark of the fox.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Spanish colonial California—missions, pueblos, ranchos, social hierarchy
*   Explain the economic oppression—excessive taxation, land seizures, forced labor
*   Describe the nobility—some sympathetic, some complicit, some secretly helping
*   Write about the church's role—providing sanctuary, moral voice, practical aid
*   Detail military structure—garrison soldiers, officers, their loyalties
*   Explain how legend of the Fox grows—each daring rescue adds to mythology

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Fox and Allies** (Major) - Masked heroes and those who know/support them
*   **The Oppressed Peasants** (Major) - Suffering populace needing protection and inspiration
*   **Corrupt Administration** (Major) - Governor, cronies, officials profiting from tyranny
*   **The Military** (Major) - Soldiers enforcing unjust laws, varying degrees of sympathy
*   **Noble Families** (Minor) - Some sympathetic, some neutral, some supporting Governor
*   **The Church** (Minor) - Providing moral authority and practical sanctuary
*   **Secret Resistance** (Minor) - Underground network helping the Fox

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Don Diego/The Fox, Lolita Pulido, Captain Esteban, Governor Quintero, Fray Felipe, Bernardo, Sergeant Garcia

**5. Locations:**

*   **The Garrison** - Military barracks, armory, prison cells

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Fox's identity exposed THEN family endangered, allies compromised, must flee
*   IF peasants inspired to violence THEN innocent suffer, must prevent mob justice
*   IF Governor removed too quickly THEN chaos and potential worse replacement
*   IF romance discovers identity THEN trust tested, relationship complicated
*   IF Captain defeated honorably THEN may become ally against Governor
*   IF mark of Fox left on tyrant THEN that person loses all authority and respect
