# World-Building Specification Brief: Sunless Seas

**Core Concept**: Naval exploration and political intrigue on a vast underground ocean that's dying. Three factions compete for survival while the party searches for the ancient magic sustaining the sea.

**Lore Prompts**:
* Ancient civilization created the Sunless Sea as refuge or prison.
* The Breathing Caves—magical ventilation system now failing.
* Leviathans—massive creatures, possibly sapient, connected to the sea's magic.
* Surface Exile history—why they fled underground and can't return.

**Factions**:
* **The Coral Throne**: Merfolk empire, naval superiority, seeking to maintain power.
* **Surface Exile Alliance**: Human/mixed colonies, desperate for survival, excellent traders.
* **Leviathan Cults**: Worship deep creatures, believe sacrifice sustains sea, decentralized fanatics.
* **Free Captains**: Independent traders and pirates; party starts here.
* **The Abyss**: Not faction but force—the deep trenches and what dwells there.

**Key NPCs**:
* **Admiral Thalassa**: Merfolk ruler, military genius, ruthless but not evil.
* **Captain Grimm**: Exile leader, practical survivor, considering desperate measures.
* **High Priest Abyssius**: Cultist leader, genuinely believes in his cause, offers terrible solutions.
* **The Cartographer**: Mystery benefactor, ulterior motives, may be more than human.
* **The Deep Mother**: Ancient leviathan, possibly dying, possibly willing to communicate.

**Locations**:
* **Port Refuge**: Human hub, multicultural, starting point.
* **The Coral Throne**: Underwater city, political center, beautiful and dangerous.
* **Shattered Islands**: 20+ unique islands, each with culture and resources.
* **The Black Current**: Pirate territory, dangerous waters, monster spawning grounds.
* **Abyssal Trench**: Deepest point, leviathan nests, ancient temples.
* **Breathing Caves**: Where air comes from, failing magical system.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF party supports Coral Throne THEN gain naval allies but human exiles turn hostile.
* IF party supports Exiles THEN economic benefits but merfolk see them as enemies.
* IF party investigates Leviathan Cults THEN learn terrible truths about sea's magic.
* IF water levels drop too low THEN entire regions become inaccessible, economic collapse.
* IF party reaches Deep Mother THEN learn the true cost of saving the sea.
* IF party finds all temple pieces THEN can reactivate magic but requires living sacrifice.

**Mechanics**:
* **Naval Combat**: Ship stats, crew actions, boarding, ship-to-ship tactics.
* **Ship Upgrades**: Better hulls, weapons, crew quarters, cargo capacity.
* **Underwater Diving**: Air supply, pressure damage, specialized equipment.
* **Trade System**: Buy/sell across islands, market fluctuations, smuggling.
* **Drowning Sea Timer**: Water level drops affect map, increasing urgency.
* **Reputation**: Each faction tracks party standing; affects prices, quests, combat encounters.
