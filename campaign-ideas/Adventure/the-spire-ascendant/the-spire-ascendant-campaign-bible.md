# Campaign Bible: The Spire Ascendant

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Needle that Sutures the Void
In the era before eras, the cosmos fractured. Reality began to bleed into the Null. To prevent the universe from unspooling like a fraying tapestry, the Architects—entities of pure geometry and law—drove a massive stake into the wound. This stake is **The Spire**. It is not a tower built up, but a needle driven down into the infection. The Spire generates a localized reality field (The Logic of Cards) to impose order upon chaos. However, the infection at the bottom, **The Heart**, has begun to corrupt the needle, turning the ordered logic of the Architects into a twisted game of probability and death.

### The Timeline of Ascensions
1.  **The Anchor Fall:** The Spire impacts the world crust; the impact crater becomes the Bottomless Pit.
2.  **The Era of Silence:** For 300 years, the Spire emits a frequency that renders all nearby sentient life mute.
3.  **The First Shuffle:** The laws of physics within the Spire shift from Newtonian to Card-Based causality.
4.  **The Arrival of Neow:** A cosmic whale spirit crashes into the base, trapped by the Spire's gravity, deciding to weaponize adventurers to free herself.
5.  **The Ironclad’s Pact:** *Surreal Event:* A warrior tribe sells their ability to feel pain to a demon in exchange for fire that never burns out; the Ironclad is the sole survivor.
6.  **The Great Desaturation:** *Surreal Event:* For ten years, the color red ceases to exist in the Spire. Blood flows grey. The Heart pulses in monochrome.
7.  **The Automaton Uprising:** The Bronze Automatons achieve sentience, realize they are trash compactors, and decide to compact the Gods.
8.  **The Rain of Teeth:** *Surreal Event:* A storm in Act II deposits millions of human molars, forming the foundations of "The City."
9.  **The Shattering of the Silent:** The Assassin guild attempts a mass ascent; their souls are trapped in a single Shiv card.
10. **The Current Cycle:** The party arrives. The Heart’s beat is audible even at Base Camp.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil, but **Deterministic Order vs. Chaotic Probability**. The Spire wants to calcify reality into a perfect, unmoving equation. The Heart wants to dissolve reality into pure, bleeding chaos. The Climbers use the Spire’s own weapons (Cards/Order) to introduce "Choice," the one variable the Spire cannot calculate.

## 8. MECHANICS

[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Physics of the Spire
1.  **Card Causality:** Actions cannot be taken without a Card. If you are disarmed, you have no Attack cards. If you are silenced, you have no Skill cards.

3.  **Block Reset:** Armor/Shields (Block) disappear at the start of your next turn. You must actively defend every few seconds.

### Subsystems
1.  **Sanity (Deck Bloat):** The more experiences (cards) you have, the harder it is to think (draw the right card). Players must pay gold to "forget" memories (Remove Cards) to stay sane/efficient.
2.  **Potions:** Liquid spells. Only 3 slots. One use only.
3.  **Ascension:** Every time the campaign is beaten, the world resets but enemies gain +1 to checks/damage. Caps at Ascension 20.
