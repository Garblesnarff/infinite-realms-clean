## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### The Origin Myth: The Gridiron Concordat
In the era before the Leagues, conflict was resolved through blood and steel. The Great Pacification occurred when the "Gridiron Concordat" was signed by the warring High Schools of the Kanto Plains. They agreed that dominance would no longer be measured by death, but by "The Drive"—a ritualistic conquest of territory 10 yards at a time. It is whispered that the first ball, the "Pigskin Prime," was not leather, but the bound heart of a trickster god. Now, the sport is not merely athletics; it is a metaphysical battle of will where belief shapes physics. To hold the ball is to hold the narrative of the world; to score a touchdown is to rewrite history for a brief, shining moment.

### The Timeline of the 10 Yards
1.  **The Year of Leather:** The first American envoys introduce the "Armor of Pads," replacing samurai armor with kinetic impact gear.
2.  **The Immaculate Reception:** A receiver catches a ball that statistically should have passed through his torso; the first instance of "Zone" magic is recorded.
3.  **The Ban of the Metal Cleat:** After a player accidentally severed the tension of surface tension on a lake, metal cleats were regulated.
4.  **The Phantom Down:** During the 50th Christmas Bowl, time stopped for 3 minutes. No one remembers what happened, but the score changed by 2 points.
5.  **Rise of the Golden Generation:** The Shinryuji Naga team discovers "The Impulse," a bio-feedback loop allowing reaction times faster than synaptic firing.
6.  **The Exile of the Kicking Leg:** "Musashi" the Kicker vanishes into the construction trade, rumored to be kicking rivets into steel beams to atone for a missed field goal.
7.  **The Founding of Deimon:** A school for societal castoffs is built on a cursed swamp; Hiruma Yoichi enrolls and enslaves the principal within 24 hours.
8.  **The Eyeshield Legacy:** The legend of "Eyeshield 21" migrates from Notre Dame; it becomes a mantle for the "Ghost Runner," a spirit of speed that possesses the worthy.
9.  **The White Knight's Vow:** Ojo High School swears an oath of "Absolute Kingdom," utilizing high-tech ballistae for defensive training.
10. **The Present Awakening:** A timid errand runner puts on a helmet to hide his fear, and the tachometer on a radar gun explodes.

### The "Why": The Metaphysical Conflict
The universe of this campaign operates on "Shonen Physics"—the belief that willpower equals kinetic energy. The conflict is not just about a trophy; it is about "The Christmas Bowl." This is not a stadium, but a nexus point where the winning team is granted one "Miracle Play"—a chance to alter their destiny permanently. The protagonists are fighting to prove that "Trickery and Effort" (Chaos/Humanity) can dethrone "Talent and Perfection" (Order/Divinity).

## Section 8: MECHANICS

[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### The "Down" System (Combat Turn Structure)
Instead of standard rounds, combat is divided into "Downs."
*   **The Drive:** The party has 4 Downs (Turns) to advance the "Line of Scrimmage" (Battle line) by 10 yards (Zones).
*   **Success:** If they advance 10 yards, Downs reset to 1st.
*   **Failure:** If they fail 4th down, control passes to the Enemy (Defense becomes Offense).

### "Shonen Physics" (Meta-Currency)
*   **Spirit Points (SP):** Gained by roleplaying intense determination or flashbacks.
*   **Uses:**
    *   **Break Limit:** Add +10 to a roll describing an impossible physical feat.
    *   **Team Combo:** Two players act simultaneously on the same initiative count.
    *   **Miracle Recovery:** Stand up from 0 HP with 1 HP by remembering a promise.

### Secret Identity Mechanic
*   **Mask On:** +4 DEX, +4 STR, Charisma set to 18 (Intimidation). Identity is "Eyeshield 21."
*   **Mask Off:** Stats return to normal. Charisma set to 8 (Shy). Identity is "Sena."
*   **Risk:** If Mask HP reaches 0, it shatters. Identity revealed -> Game Over (Socially).
