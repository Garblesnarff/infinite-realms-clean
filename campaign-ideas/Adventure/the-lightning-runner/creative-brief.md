### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**

*   **Field Environment:** Green turf, white yard lines, autumn/winter atmosphere
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an American football field with vibrant green turf marked by white yard lines. Eyeshield 21 in black and red Deimon uniform sprints down the sideline, electric blue-white lightning trailing their movement. The distinctive green eyeshield hides their face. Motion blur emphasizes impossible speed. Defenders lunge but miss. The autumn sky shows dramatic clouds. The atmosphere crackles with energy."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Eyeshield 21:** Lean runner's build, distinctive green eyeshield, number 21, mysterious aura
*   **Hiruma:** Devilish appearance, sharp features, carries prop guns, manic grin
*   **Kurita:** Enormous lineman, gentle expression despite intimidating size
*   **Full Gear:** Helmets, pads, cleats, football uniforms with position-appropriate builds
*   **Prompt Example:** "Eyeshield 21 in full football gear—black helmet with distinctive green eyeshield completely hiding their face, red and black Deimon jersey with large 21 on chest and back, form-fitting pants, cleats. Their build is lean and athletic—runner's physique. They cradle a football while in running stance. Lightning effects crackle around their legs suggesting supernatural speed. Their posture is dynamic, ready to explode into motion."

*   **Prompt Example:** "A packed football stadium during the Christmas Bowl championship. The field is pristine with clear yard markings. Both teams line up in formation. Massive scoreboard shows time and score. Crowds fill every seat creating walls of color. Championship banners hang from the rafters. Broadcast cameras positioned around the field. The atmosphere is electric with national championship tension."

*   **Touchdown Moments:** Crossing the goal line, celebrations, team unity
*   **Prompt Example:** "Eyeshield 21 executes the Devil Bat Ghost technique—cutting sharply to evade a tackler. Electric blue-white lightning explodes from the cut direction. Multiple motion afterimages show the cutting path. The defender lunges at where they were. The football is secured tightly. Their eyeshield catches the light, hiding their expression. The technique is impossible speed and cutting combined."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dynamic Action Lighting:** Dramatic shadows during plays, spotlights on key moments
*   **Lightning Effects:** Speed shown through electrical discharge and motion blur
*   **Strategic Emphasis:** Highlight key players in crucial positions, diagram overlays
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by stadium lights creating strong shadows across the field. Eyeshield 21 is caught mid-sprint in perfect freeze-frame, lightning effects trailing every movement. The lighting makes their speed seem supernatural. Defenders are partially motion-blurred showing they can't match the speed. The green eyeshield reflects the stadium lights, hiding their identity. Electric blue highlights emphasize the impossible velocity."

Includes phrases about catching dreams and running toward the impossible. Role: The voice of hidden potential unleashed through the mask and team support.
