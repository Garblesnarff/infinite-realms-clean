## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### The Origin Myth: The Great Narration
In the beginning, there was only the Blank Page. Then, the Prime Narrator spoke the First Sentence, and the ink flowed into the rivers of Florin and Guilder. Reality here is not composed of atoms, but of Tropes and Narrative Arcs. The world exists because it is being read; should the Reader ever close the book permanently, the lands will dissolve into incoherent draft notes. The "Grand Plot" is a tangible force—destiny is merely the Narrator’s outline, and those who defy it (like the Dread Pirate Roberts) are rare anomalies who have learned to "ad-lib" existence.

### Timeline of the Realms
1.  **The Opening Chapter (1000 years ago):** The First King of Florin pulls the Sword of Syntax from the Stone of Silence.
2.  **The Typos Era (800 years ago):** A magical error causes gravity to reverse on Tuesdays for a decade; the sky-castles of Guilder are built.
3.  **The Great Plagiarism War (600 years ago):** Guilder attempts to steal Florin’s national anthem; Florin retaliates by stealing Guilder’s coastline.
4.  **The Day of Rust (400 years ago):** *[Rare/Weird]* Every sword in the kingdom suddenly turned to licorice due to a curse from a diabetic Warlock. Peace reigned for three days.
5.  **The Rise of the Dread Pirate (50 years ago):** The name "Roberts" is first whispered; shipping insurance rates skyrocket.
6.  **The Miracle Famine (20 years ago):** Chocolate coating becomes scarce; Miracle Max is fired from the Royal Court for suggesting budget cuts on hummus.
7.  **The Buttercup Birth (18 years ago):** The most beautiful woman in the world is born; milk production in local cows doubles out of sheer joy.
8.  **The Erasure of the West (10 years ago):** *[Rare/Weird]* A spilled cup of coffee on the "Book of Ages" wipes a duchy from existence; locals now just call it "The Smudge."
9.  **The Prince’s Ascension (5 years ago):** Humperdinck takes control of the military; hunting becomes the national sport.
10. **The Departure of Westley (3 years ago):** A farm boy leaves for fortune; reports of his death by pirates are greatly exaggerated.

### The Metaphysical Conflict (The "Why")
The world is suffering from "Narrative Atrophy." Prince Humperdinck’s cynicism and forced plotting are turning the genre from a Romance/Adventure into a Grimdark Political Thriller. If True Love does not triumph, the "Genre" of the world will shift, causing the sky to turn grey, wit to vanish, and the Narrator to close the book forever.

*   **The Left Hand:** A player may choose to fight "Left Handed" (Disadvantage). If they switch to "Right Handed" mid-fight, the next attack is a Critical Hit (Once per encounter).

### 2. Mostly Dead
*   When a PC hits 0 HP, they are "Mostly Dead." They do not roll death saves. They enter a stasis where they can speak in whispers but cannot move.
*   **True Death:** Occurs only if the body is destroyed or they give up "Hope."
*   **Miracle Cost:** Resurrection requires a "Miracle Pill" (Cost: All your gold + a Truth).

### 3. True Love's Bond
*   Two PCs (or PC/NPC) can form a Bond.
*   **Mechanic:** When the bonded partner is in danger (0 HP), the other gains *Haste* for 1 minute automatically.

### 4. Reputation & The Mask
*   Reputation is a currency. Wearing the "Dread Pirate Mask" sets Reputation to "Legendary" (Fear Aura), but attracts challengers every session.
