**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Natural, warm color palettes that shift with time of day and season – golden hour oranges and pinks, deep blue night skies, crisp winter whites and blues, rich autumn colors. Campfire light creates warm orange glows.
*   **Texture:** Soft, slightly textured like quality photography. Colors feel rich and inviting. Firelight creates particular warmth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a warm color palette of golden hour lighting, with soft oranges and pinks in the sky, deep blue lake, and warm orange campfire glow. Natural, inviting colors with soft photographic texture."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, natural lighting that emphasizes atmosphere. Golden hour and blue hour are common. Campfire light creates pools of warm orange glow in darkness. Starlight and moonlight create gentle illumination.
*   **Shadows:** Soft, natural shadows that create depth without harshness. Firelight creates dancing shadows. Cold morning light creates crisp shadows.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates cozy atmosphere and emphasizes natural beauty. The contrast between cold air and warm fire/light is essential.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm campfire light creating orange glow in foreground, with cool blue twilight in background. Soft shadows and atmospheric lighting emphasizing cozy warmth versus cool natural surroundings."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Contemplative compositions often featuring wide natural vistas with small human presence, or intimate camping scenes. Characters often shown in harmony with nature, not dominating it.
*   **Techniques:** Wide landscape shots establish natural beauty. Medium shots of camping activities. Close-ups of food, warm drinks, campfire flames. POV shots from tent openings looking at nature.
