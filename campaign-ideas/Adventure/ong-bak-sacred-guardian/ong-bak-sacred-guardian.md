## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A two-act arc of rural virtue confronting urban corruption.

*   **Act I — Journey to the City (Sessions 1–4):** The theft is discovered, and the party travels from their rural village to the sprawling capital. They must navigate urban dangers, street gangs, and the underground fight scene while searching for leads on the Buddha head's location. They meet Humlae (a hustler) and Muay Lek (a bar waitress), who become reluctant allies.
*   **Act II — The Fight Circuit (Sessions 5–10):** The Buddha head is in the possession of Komtuan, a ruthless crime lord who uses it as a trophy. To get close enough to steal it back, the party must fight their way through his underground tournament, facing increasingly dangerous opponents. The campaign climaxes in a fight against Komtuan's champion and a desperate escape with the sacred relic.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Authentic Muay Thai Combat**
*   No magical enhancements or supernatural abilities during fights—pure martial skill.
*   Emphasis on eight points of contact: fists, elbows, knees, shins.
*   Environmental awareness: using ropes, walls, and arena features as part of combat.

### 2. **No-Wire Action**
*   All combat feats must be physically possible—no flying or wire-fu.
*   Jumps and acrobatics limited to realistic human capability.
*   This creates grounded, visceral combat.

### 3. **The Tournament Bracket**
*   Progressive difficulty as the party advances through fight ranks.
*   Each fight showcases a different opponent type and strategy.
*   Can choose which party member fights which opponent based on matchups.

### 4. **Sacred Object Quest**
*   The Buddha head isn't magical but represents cultural and spiritual importance.
*   Its recovery is a duty of honor, not power acquisition.
*   The ending focuses on cultural restoration, not material reward.
