**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party wins all fights honorably → Earn enough respect that some of Komtuan's fighters let them escape.
*   **IF:** Party fights dirty → Lose community support and Ting's moral certainty.
*   **IF:** Humlae's debt is paid → He becomes a permanent loyal ally instead of abandoning them.
*   **IF:** Muay Lek is rescued from Komtuan → She provides the escape route through the compound.
*   **IF:** Buddha head is damaged during recovery → Village must perform atonement ritual but still accepts the party's effort.
