# Creative Brief: Ong Bak: Sacred Guardian

## Art Style: Authentic Practical Combat (Tony Jaa Era)

Raw, visceral action emphasizing real martial arts without wires or CGI. Contrasts serene rural Buddhist culture with gritty urban fight venues.

### Core Principles:
*   **Grounded Realism:** All action must look physically possible and painful.
*   **Cultural Contrast:** Beautiful rural temples vs. dirty urban fight clubs.
*   **Impact:** Emphasize the brutal effectiveness of Muay Thai techniques.

### Style Guide:

**Character Design:**
*   Ting: Simple rural clothing, muscular but lean, determined expression, traditional Mongkon headband during fights.
*   Urban Fighters: Street clothes, tattoos, scars, varied body types showing different fighting styles.

**Color Palette:**
*   Rural: Warm golds, greens, sacred oranges of Buddhist temples.
*   Urban: Concrete grays, neon lights, dark shadows of alleys and fight clubs.

**Combat Aesthetics:**
*   Close-ups on elbow and knee strikes making contact.
*   Environmental destruction—broken furniture, shattered glass.
*   Sweat, blood, and exhaustion shown realistically.

## Voice

Straightforward and earnest, with rural simplicity. No flowery language—direct and honest. The contrast between Ting's simple wisdom and urban characters' cynicism. Role: Ting's internal determination or the village elder's blessings.

## Sound Design

*   The brutal impact of Muay Thai strikes—bones on bones, sharp exhales.
*   Urban noise—traffic, crowds, underground fight audience roars.
*   Rural peace—temple bells, nature sounds, village life.
*   Traditional Thai music during training and sacred scenes.
