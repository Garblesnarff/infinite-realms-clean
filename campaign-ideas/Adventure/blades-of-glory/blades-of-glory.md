*   Can play it safe with triples or risk quads for championship potential

### 3. **Program Components**
*   Each program needs: Opening sequence, Jump elements (planned jumps), Spin sequence, Step sequence, Closing
*   Must choreograph programs balancing technical requirements with emotional storytelling
*   Music choice affects available artistic expression
