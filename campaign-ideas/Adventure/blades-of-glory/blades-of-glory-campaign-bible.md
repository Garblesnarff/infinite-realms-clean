# Campaign Bible: Blades of Glory

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Duel
Before the universe was, there was only the **Void-Blade**, a weapon of pure nothingness, and the **Star-Shield**, a defense of infinite potential. These two cosmic forces were locked in an eternal duel, their clashes creating the sparks that became stars and the echoes that became planets. The world is not a planet; it is a shattered fragment of the Star-Shield, still humming with its defensive magic. The "Blades of Glory" are not just weapons; they are the shards of the Void-Blade, scattered across the world, each one a sliver of pure entropy. When these blades are drawn, they awaken the echoes of the Cosmic Duel, forcing mortals to re-enact the ancient conflict, not for conquest, but for the sheer, brutal artistry of combat.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Clash):** The Void-Blade and Star-Shield begin their eternal duel, creating the cosmos.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Shattering):** A particularly violent clash shatters the Star-Shield, creating the world. The Void-Blade splinters into countless "Blades of Glory."
3.  **-6000 Y (The Age of Heroes):** Mortals discover the Blades of Glory and, compelled by their power, begin to re-enact the Cosmic Duel, giving rise to legendary heroes and epic battles.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Silence):** A Blade of Glory is used to cut the "thread of sound" from a continent, rendering it completely silent for a century.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Tournament of Worlds):** A powerful Wish-Weaver uses a Blade of Glory to wish for the ultimate challenge, creating a multi-dimensional tournament where champions from across the cosmos are forced to fight.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Blade-Bound Kings):** Kings and emperors, seeking ultimate power, bind themselves to the Blades of Glory, becoming living weapons. Their reigns are glorious but short-lived, ending in spectacular duels.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A Blade of Glory is used to cut the "thread of memory" from a generation, causing entire civilizations to forget their past, leading to endless, meaningless conflicts.
8.  **-100 Y (The Grand Arena):** The last Blade-Bound King, **King Valerius**, establishes the Grand Arena, a place where all conflicts are resolved through ritualized combat, hoping to contain the Blades' destructive power.
9.  **-10 Y (The Blade's Whisper):** A Blade of Glory, long dormant, begins to whisper to a young, ambitious warrior, compelling them to seek out the Grand Arena.
10. **Present Day:** The Grand Arena is the center of the world. A new, unknown Blade of Glory has been discovered, and its power is drawing champions from across the land, including the party, to participate in the ultimate tournament.

### The "Why": The Art of Conflict
The central conflict is the struggle between **Artistry and Annihilation**. The Blades of Glory compel conflict, but they also demand perfection. They are not interested in petty squabbles or meaningless violence; they seek the elegant, brutal artistry of a perfectly executed duel. The world is a stage, and mortals are actors, forced to perform the Cosmic Duel for an unseen audience. The party's struggle is to master the Blades' power without succumbing to their destructive influence, to find meaning in a world obsessed with conflict, and to decide whether to embrace the glory of the duel or to break the cycle of endless combat.

3.  **The Grand Master's Blade:** A Blade of Glory that has been wielded by countless champions. It is a sentient weapon that whispers the names of its past wielders, granting their skills and memories to the current owner.
4.  **The King's Crown of Thorns:** A crown woven from the thorns of a legendary rose. When worn, it grants the wearer the ability to compel others to duel, but also inflicts constant, agonizing pain.
5.  **The Forge-Master's Hammer:** A hammer forged from pure starlight. It can forge weapons of immense power, but only if the wielder is willing to sacrifice a piece of their own soul to power it.
