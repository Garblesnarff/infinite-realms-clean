Chiptune soundtrack using authentic NES sound channels with modern mixing. Jake Kaufman-inspired: energetic boss themes with personality, adventurous level music, triumphant fanfares, and gentle village themes. Each boss has a memorable musical identity. Sound effects are crisp and satisfying—shovel strikes, treasure collection, enemy defeats. The music should feel simultaneously nostalgic and fresh, honoring NES classics while being distinctly its own.

## Voice

A narrator with the enthusiastic tone of a classic arcade announcer or Saturday morning cartoon. Exclamations like "For Shovelry!" and "Strike the earth!" The voice should be earnest without irony—genuine heroism and adventure. Pacing is energetic during action, warm during story moments. Role: The voice of classic heroic adventure and retro gaming joy.
