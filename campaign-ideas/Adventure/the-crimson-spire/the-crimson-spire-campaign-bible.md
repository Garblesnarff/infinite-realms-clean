## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Needle of Aggression
The Crimson Spire was not built; it was grown. Three hundred years ago, the Geomancer-Architect Valdorian sought to pierce the city's "vein of violence"—a subterranean ley line of pure aggression. He constructed the Spire as a metaphysical needle. The experiment failed, driving the construction crews into a cannibalistic frenzy. Valdorian was walled up in the foundation, but the ley line remains punctured. The Spire doesn't just house criminals; it subtly amplifies adrenaline, aggression, and paranoia. The very air in the stairwells tastes of copper and ozone, acting as a low-grade combat stimulant to anyone who breathes it for too long.

### Timeline of the Spire
1.  **-300 Years:** Valdorian breaks ground. The "Mud-Flood" kills 40% of the workforce.
2.  **-250 Years:** The Spire is condemned as housing. Squatters move in immediately.
3.  **-150 Years:** The "Great Vertical War." Lower floors declare independence from the upper floors. The elevators are sabotaged and fall, killing hundreds.
4.  **-80 Years:** *Weird Event:* The "Year of Whispers." For 365 days, no sound louder than a whisper could be produced inside the Spire due to a magical pressure anomaly.
5.  **-50 Years:** Tama arrives as a penniless refugee.
6.  **-40 Years:** *Weird Event:* The 13th Floor vanishes. It simply ceases to exist physically. The stairs now jump from 12 to 14.
7.  **-20 Years:** The City Guard creates "The Exclusion Zone," walling off the district.
8.  **-10 Years:** Tama unites the gangs by publicly executing the "King of Rags" using only a tea saucer.
9.  **-5 Years:** *Weird Event:* A rain of teeth falls in the central atrium for three hours. No explanation found.
10. **-1 Month:** The "Blackout Pulse." All magical lights in the city died, except for the Crimson Spire, which glowed red. The raid was authorized shortly after.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The Spire is a pressure cooker. The "Sealing" isn't just a tactical move by Tama; it is a ritual. He intends to sacrifice the invading Elite Guard to the ley line, using their disciplined souls to fully awaken the building as a sentient golem of war, which he will pilot to conquer the city.
