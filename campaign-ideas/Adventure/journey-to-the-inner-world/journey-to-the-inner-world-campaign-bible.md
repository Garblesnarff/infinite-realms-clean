## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
In the beginning, there was the Great Wyrm, a cosmic serpent of creation. It laid a single, colossal egg in the void and then, its purpose served, coiled around it and turned to stone, becoming the very fabric of space. This egg is the world. The "Shell" is the surface world, a place of rigid laws and fading magic, where life has become ordered and predictable. The "Inner World," or the "Yolk," is the still-liquid, primordial core of the planet. It is a realm of pure, chaotic, creative potential, a soup of life where evolution is a constant, violent, and unpredictable process. At the very center of the Yolk is the "Core," a nascent, stellar consciousness that serves as the Inner World's sun. This Core is the embryo of the new Great Wyrm, and the planet is slowly "hatching." The tectonic shifts, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions on the surface are the first cracks appearing in the Shell as the being within prepares to be born.

### Timeline
1.  **The Laying (Age of Myth):** The Great Wyrm lays the World-Egg and becomes the cosmos. The Shell forms and cools.
2.  **The First Cracks (c. -1,000,000 years):** The Core ignites. The first, simple life appears on the surface Shell.
3.  **The Age of Giants (c. -500,000 years):** Life on the surface grows to colossal sizes, feeding on the rich, leaking magical energy from the Yolk.
4.  **(Surreal) The Gravity Shift (c. -100,000 years):** For a thousand years, gravity on the surface world is inconsistent, sometimes reversing entirely for minutes at a time. This event causes the extinction of the Giants and forces life to become smaller and more adaptable.
5.  **The First Descent (c. -10,000 years):** An ancient, advanced civilization on the surface discovers a passage into the Inner World. They are the "Progenitors." They build great cities in the Yolk.
6.  **The Progenitor War (c. -9,000 years):** The Progenitors, unable to handle the chaotic, mutative energy of the Yolk, descend into civil war. One faction, the "Shell-Wardens," seeks to seal the passages and preserve the Shell. The other, the "Yolk-Embracers," seeks to merge with the Yolk's chaotic energy.
7.  **The Great Seal (c. -8,500 years):** The Shell-Wardens win. They seal the major passages to the Inner World and erase all knowledge of its existence from the surface, creating a "Great Amnesia."
8.  **(Surreal) The River of Time Runs Backwards (c. -5,000 years):** A major river on the surface flows backwards for a generation, from the sea to its mountain source. Anything that falls in it is de-aged, causing immense chaos and societal collapse. This is a side effect of the Seals warping reality.
9.  **The Rediscovery (c. -100 years):** A massive earthquake on the surface reveals the entrance to a Progenitor-built passage, a colossal tunnel leading deep into the Shell. The "Journey to the Inner World" becomes possible again.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the Mountains Sang (c. -1 year):** All the mountains on the planet begin to hum a single, resonant frequency. This is the Core's "hatching song" beginning. The Seals are weakening, and the final birth of the new Great Wyrm is imminent.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a battle between Order and Chaos, Stability and Creation, played out on a planetary scale. The Shell represents stasis, safety, and eventual decay. The Yolk represents life, chaos, change, and immense danger. The planet itself is a living being on the verge of a universe-altering birth. The players are not just explorers; they are antibodies, catalysts, or midwives to a cosmic event. Their actions will determine whether the Shell shatters, killing all on the surface, whether the Yolk is stabilized, dooming the new Wyrm to an eternity as an unborn god, or whether a new, symbiotic future can be forged between the two worlds.

**Baron Alistair Finch** (Human Rogue) - Urbane, ruthless, and impeccably dressed, even underground. **Voice:** A smooth, confident baritone, like a practiced politician. **Goal:** To claim the resources of the Inner World and become the richest man in history. **Secret:** His family is broke; this expedition is his last, desperate gamble.
**Elder Maeve** (Human Druid) - Grim, determined, with the weight of the world on her shoulders. **Voice:** A low, urgent whisper, as if the world might crack if she speaks too loudly. **Goal:** To seal the Inner World forever, even if it means sacrificing everyone who has gone down. **Secret:** Her visions of the "Hatching" are incomplete; she has only seen the destruction of the Shell, not what comes after.
**The Luminous One** (Aasimar Warlock) - Serene, detached, speaks in crystalline metaphors. **Voice:** Resonant, chiming, with a faint, musical echo. **Goal:** To achieve the final stage of crystal-transcendence by merging with the Core. **Secret:** The crystal transformation is slowly erasing its original personality and memories.

**Sun-Speaker Kor** (Human Barbarian) - Primal, fierce, and deeply spiritual. **Voice:** A series of guttural clicks, growls, and deep hums that are translated by his "speaker" staff. **Goal:** To protect the Core and ensure the "Birth" happens naturally. **Secret:** He doesn't actually understand the Core's pulses; he's interpreting them based on his own intuition, and is terrified of being wrong.
**Warden-Unit 734** (Construct Paladin) - Logical, relentless, and bound by its ancient programming. **Voice:** A monotone, synthesized voice, like a vintage text-to-speech program. **Goal:** To uphold its final command: "Seal the Way. Permit no passage." **Secret:** Its programming is degrading, and it has developed a "loophole" that might allow it to be convinced that destroying the Shell is a form of "sealing the way."

A vast, underground ocean of thick, primordial soup, where life is constantly being created and destroyed.

*   **The Genesis Caverns:** Caves near the Core where new, bizarre life-forms are spontaneously generated by the intense energy. **Smell:** Birth, ammonia, and a thousand other things. **Sound:** The constant bubbling, popping, and squelching of new creation.
*   **The Final Gate:** The last Progenitor-built structure, a massive gate of unknown material that orbits the Core. **Smell:** Sterile metal, ozone. **Sound:** A low, warning hum.
*   **The Surface of the Core:** Not a physical place that can be stood upon, but the "event horizon" of the nascent consciousness. To touch it is to be unmade and remade. **Smell:** The smell of pure creation. **Sound:** The sound of every possible song at once.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Egg-Cracker
**Type:** Legendary Warhammer
**Description:** A massive warhammer, supposedly carved from the beak-tooth of the first creature to hatch from a different World-Egg. It hums with a resonant frequency that is anathema to the Shell.
**Mechanics:** The hammer is a +3 warhammer that deals an extra 2d8 thunder damage. When it strikes a stone or earth surface, it sends a shockwave in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a STR save or be knocked prone. It can be used to shatter the Progenitor Seals with three successful strikes.

### 2. The Heart of the Yolk
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Orb)
**Description:** A pulsating, gelatinous orb of pure, chaotic life-force, harvested from the Sea of Chaos. It is warm to the touch and constantly shifts in shape and color.
**Mechanics:** Once per day, the holder can use it to cast *Polymorph* on themselves or another creature without requiring concentration. The form is unstable, however, and at the end of each minute, the target must make a CON save or gain a random, minor mutation. If held for more than 1 hour, the holder must make a CON save or permanently merge with the Heart, becoming a being of pure chaos.

### 3. The Progenitor's Key
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Device)
**Description:** A complex, multi-dimensional device of interlocking rings and crystals, used by the Shell-Wardens to create the Great Seal.
**Mechanics:** The Key can be used to open or close any Progenitor-built door or gateway. Once per week, it can be used to cast *Forcecage*. If brought to the Core, it can be used to perform the Great Sealing ritual, which will stabilize the Shell but forever imprison the new Great Wyrm.

### 4. The Luminous Carapace
**Type:** Legendary Armor (Plate)
**Description:** Armor crafted by the Geode-Gnostics from a single piece of living, intelligent crystal. It glows with a soft, internal light and chimes softly when struck.
**Mechanics:** The armor is +2 plate armor that grants the wearer resistance to psychic damage and immunity to being frightened. The wearer can use an action to absorb any light source within 30 feet, plunging the area into darkness and healing themselves for 2d10 hit points. **Curse:** The armor is alive and telepathically bonded to the wearer. It has its own personality (detached, logical) and will occasionally offer unsolicited, often unhelpful, advice.

### 5. The Weaver's Loom
**Type:** Artifact (Tool)
**Description:** A grotesque but beautiful loom from the Flesh-Weavers, made of bone, sinew, and living organs. It can unravel and re-weave the very fabric of life.
**Mechanics:** The Loom can be used to combine two or more willing (or incapacitated) creatures into a single, new being, blending their abilities. It can also be used to grant a creature a new ability (e.g., wings, gills, extra arms) by "weaving" the DNA of another creature into it. Using the Loom is a dark, forbidden art and requires a successful Medicine check against a high DC. Failure results in a horrifying, unstable amalgam that lives only for a few, painful minutes.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Rock That Falls Up:** A small, smooth stone that, when dropped, falls upwards at a speed of 30 feet per round.
2.  **The Impatient Seed:** A seed that, when planted, grows into a full-sized, fruit-bearing tree in 10 seconds, then immediately withers and dies.
3.  **A Compass That Points to the Most Interesting Thing:** A compass whose needle points towards what it considers the most "interesting" thing in a 1-mile radius. Its definition of "interesting" is highly subjective.
4.  **The Biologist's Diary:** A diary from a long-dead Flesh-Weaver. The text is unreadable, but the illustrations of impossible creatures are fascinating.
5.  **A Bottle of Dehydrated Water:** Just add water to create... more water.
6.  **The Self-Solving Rubik's Cube:** A Progenitor puzzle box that solves itself if you leave it alone for a minute.
7.  **A Crystal That Sings Off-Key:** A beautiful, glowing crystal from the Inner World that hums a popular tune, but is painfully out of tune.
8.  **The Pessimistic Pickaxe:** A pickaxe that, when used to mine, whispers discouraging things like "You'll probably just find more rocks" and "Is this really how you want to spend your life?"
9.  **A Mushroom That Tastes Like Your Fondest Memory:** A rare Myconid mushroom. Eating it causes you to vividly re-experience your happiest memory.
10. **The Reversible Gloves:** A pair of gloves that are always inside-out, no matter how many times you turn them.
11. **A Rope Made of Woven Light:** A 50-foot rope that emits dim light and weighs nothing. It is, however, terrified of the dark.
12. **The Geologist's Candy:** A bag of what looks like delicious hard candies, but they are actually just interesting, inedible rocks.
13. **The Echo-in-a-Bottle:** A bottle that has captured the echo of a single, beautiful laugh.
14. **A Worm-That-Doesn't-Walk:** A single, preserved worm from the Society of the Blind Worm. It's just a worm.
15. **The Anti-Map:** A map that shows you everywhere you *haven't* been.
16. **A Piece of Fossilized Gravity:** A small, incredibly dense rock. Anything that comes within 1 foot of it is suddenly 10 times heavier.
17. **The Sentimental Construct:** A small, clockwork bird from the Warden-Units that has fallen in love with one of the party members and refuses to leave them.
18. **A Spore That Tells Jokes:** A Myconid spore that, when inhaled, telepathically tells you a single, terrible pun.
19. **The Philosopher's Fungus:** A fungus that, when eaten, makes you ponder the deep, philosophical questions of the universe, like "Why do we wear shoes?" and "Do rocks feel pain?"
20. **A Shovel That Digs Its Own Grave:** A shovel that, if left unattended, will slowly and sadly dig a shovel-sized hole and then bury itself.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Primordial Chaos
In the Inner World, reality is a suggestion, not a rule. The closer one gets to the Core, the more chaotic it becomes.
*   **Yolk-Flux:** Any spell cast within the Yolk has a 10% chance of triggering a wild magic surge. This chance increases by 10% for each level of the spell.
*   **Spontaneous Evolution:** Spending a long rest in the Yolk forces a character to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain a random, minor, and often bizarre mutation (e.g., their hair becomes feathers, they develop a taste for rocks, they grow a small, useless third arm). These can be reversed by a *Remove Curse* spell, but only on the surface world.
*   **Conceptual Instability:** In the Core's Corona, concepts themselves are unstable. A sword might forget it's sharp. Fire might decide to be cold. This is represented by the DM occasionally asking for a "Reality Check" (a Wisdom save) to see if a character's action or item works as intended.

### Subsystems: Delve Stress and Shell-Shock
*   **Delve Stress:** As the party descends, the physical and psychological pressure mounts. Each day spent underground, the party accumulates 1 point of Delve Stress. For each point, they have a cumulative -1 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. This can be reduced by spending time in a "safe" zone, like the Delver's Guild Terminus.
*   **Shell-Shock:** Characters native to the Inner World are not accustomed to the rigid, unchanging laws of the surface. If they travel to the Shell, they must make a Wisdom saving throw each day. On a failure, they are overwhelmed by the "silence" and "stillness" of a world that is not constantly changing, suffering a point of exhaustion.
