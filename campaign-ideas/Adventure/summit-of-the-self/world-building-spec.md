### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Summit of the Self**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party is drawn to Mount Celeste, a mystical peak that grants clarity to those who reach its summit. Each character carries inner demons manifested as shadow selves (Badelines) that hunt them during the climb. As they ascend through impossibly precise challenges, they must confront and eventually accept their shadow selves, learning that integration rather than suppression is the path to the summit and inner peace.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of Mount Celeste—how it was formed by an ancient emotional magic that tests climbers' resolve.
    *   Write the history of previous climbers and what happened to those who succeeded versus those who gave up.
    *   Describe the Badeline phenomenon—when and how shadow selves first manifested on the mountain.
    *   Explain the Celestial Dash magic—who discovered it and how it's learned by worthy climbers.
    *   Detail Granny's story—the first successful climber who became the mountain's guardian spirit.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Climbers** (Major): Current and past adventurers attempting the summit, each with personal reasons and demons.
    *   **The Caretakers** (Minor): Those who guide climbers from the base, having attempted and turned back themselves.
    *   **The Surrendered** (Minor): Ghosts and spirits of those who gave up, now residing in the Celestial Resort.
    *   **The Integrated** (Minor): Successful climbers like Theo who achieved integration and now help others.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Caretaker (guide at base), Theo (helpful climber), Individual Badelines (personal shadow selves), Granny (summit guardian), Resort Manager (temptation).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Abandoned Climber" (ghostly remnants), "Mountain Spirit" (environmental guardian), "Fellow Traveler" (other active climbers), "Echo of Fear" (manifestation of specific anxieties).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Forsaken City:** Tutorial area, ruined urban structures at mountain base, basic precision challenges.
*   **Old Site:** Ancient ruins, introduction to Celestial Dash, environmental hazards.
*   **Celestial Resort:** Enchanted hotel offering false comfort, filled with those who quit.
*   **Golden Ridge:** Wind-swept cliffs with feather platforms, golden hour lighting.
*   **Mirror Temple:** Hall of reflections, concentrated Badeline encounters, symmetrical architecture.
*   **The Core:** Mountain's crystal heart with pulsing magic, site of integration trials.
*   **The Summit:** Above the clouds, peaceful peak with flags from past successful climbers.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A character fails a precision check → **THEN:** They fall, take damage, and respawn at last checkpoint with determination mark.
*   **IF:** A character accepts their Badeline → **THEN:** Gain integration powers, shadow self becomes ally, new abilities unlock.
*   **IF:** The party rests at Celestial Resort → **THEN:** Recover resources but must resist temptation to abandon the climb.
*   **IF:** A character achieves the summit → **THEN:** Gain inner peace, ability to help others climb, permanent character growth.
*   **IF:** All characters integrate their Badelines → **THEN:** Final ascent becomes possible, party can tackle impossible precision challenges.

**7. Emotional Resonance Mechanics**
*   Track each character's mental state using Determination vs. Despair points.
*   Badeline strength correlates to unresolved trauma—therapy through gameplay.
*   Rest spots provide safe spaces for vulnerability and party bonding.
*   Integration represents accepting flaws as part of whole self, not defeating darkness.
