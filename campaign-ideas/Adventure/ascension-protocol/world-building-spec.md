# Ascension Protocol - World-Building Specification

## The Skyward Cliffs

**Structure**: Twelve cliff faces, each exactly 500 meters tall, stacked vertically. Total height: 6 kilometers. Architecturally impossible—held together by reality-warping technology/magic.

**Origin**: Built by the Architects—hyper-advanced civilization that achieved godhood and left existence. The Protocol is their final test for successor species.

**The Glyphs**: Ancient writing system covering cliff surfaces. Activates when correct route is climbed correctly. Each glyph is a reality-manipulation subroutine.

**The Routes**: Each Face has one "true" route. Deviating doesn't unlock Protocol benefits. Finding true route requires study, intuition, spiritual attunement.

## The Architects

**Who**: Post-singularity civilization that solved reality-manipulation and transcended physical existence

**Why Protocol**: Left test to find worthy successors to inherit their power

**What Happened**: Unknown—vanished completely, or exist in higher dimension, or became the universe itself

**Legacy**: Only Skyward Cliffs remain, plus scattered ruins worldwide

## The Foundation

**Founded**: 500 years ago by first modern climber to discover Protocol

**Structure**: Elder Council (climbers who completed 8+ Faces), Active Climbers, Support Crew (belayers, researchers, medics), Archivists (study glyphs)

**Philosophy**: Humanity should attempt Protocol but only worthy should complete it

**Resources**: Ancient technology recovered from Architect ruins, funding from anonymous benefactors, hidden base camps worldwide

**Internal Conflict**: Hawks (complete Protocol immediately) vs Doves (only if truly worthy) vs Moderates (prepare for generations)

## Vertigo Syndicate

**Founded**: By survivors of reality manipulation catastrophe caused by reckless climber

**Belief**: Protocol completion will destroy reality or transform humanity into something unrecognizable—must prevent it

**Methods**: Murder, sabotage, psychological warfare, but follows strict code—never during actual climb (too sacred)

**Structure**: Razor Edge (leader), Militant Wing (assassins), Philosophical Wing (try to convince)

**Not Evil**: Genuinely believe they're protecting existence; sympathetic antagonists with valid fears

## The Twelve Faces

1. **Courage** (5.8): Tests willingness to begin
2. **Strength** (5.11): Physical power and endurance
3. **Precision** (5.12): Technical perfection
4. **Endurance** (5.10, 8+ hours): Mental fortitude
5. **Trust** (5.13, blind sections): Faith in the Protocol
6. **Creativity** (5.11, no set route): Problem-solving
7. **Sacrifice** (5.9): Must give up something treasured
8. **Wisdom** (5.14, puzzle climb): Intelligence over strength
9. **Truth** (5.15): Face manifestations of deepest fears
10. **Death** (5.12, must fall and be caught): Surrender control
11. **Transcendence** (5.16, gravity breaks down): Climb as reality fails
12. **The Unknown** (???: Each climber's is unique)

## Reality Manipulation Powers

Earned by completing Faces, cumulative:
- Early powers: Enhanced perception, minor physical augmentation
- Middle powers: Time dilation, probability manipulation
- Late powers: Gravity control, matter creation, reality anchoring
- Final power: Complete reality rewrite (but at personal cost)

**Limitations**: Powers only work near Skyward Cliffs initially, expand with each Face, only climber can use them, drain life force with overuse

## Culture

**Climbing Ethics**: Free solo is sacred (ropes are insult to Protocol), chalk only marking, respect the stone, silence during climbs, support crew stays grounded

**Preparation Rituals**: Meditation, visualization, studying routes, chalk blessings, farewell letters (in case of death)

**Memorial Traditions**: Names carved at cliff base for fallen climbers, annual remembrance climb, "unfinished routes" concept

**Climber Slang**: "Ground fall" (death), "send" (complete), "project" (attempting), "beta" (route information), "send energy" (encouragement)

## The Summit

**Unknown Until Reached**: Each DM can decide, options include:
- Control panel for universal reality
- Meeting with Architect AI
- Mirror showing climber's true self
- Gateway to Architect dimension
- The source code of existence
- Throne awaiting worthy ruler
- Nothing—the climb was the point

**The Choice**: Whatever's there, climber must decide what to do with power—use it selfishly, altruistically, refuse it, destroy it, etc.

## Mysteries

1. What truly happened to the Architects?
2. How many have completed all Twelve?
3. What is Ghost's real state—alive, dead, between?
4. Are Vertigo's fears justified?
5. Is the Protocol a gift or trap?
6. Can multiple people complete it?
7. What lies beyond the Twelve Faces?
8. Does the Summit Entity have agenda?
9. Why were the Skyward Cliffs built here?
10. Are there other Protocols worldwide?

These provide depth and player investigation opportunities.
