# Campaign Bible: Ascension Protocol

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Algorithm
In the beginning, there was only the **Great Algorithm**, a cosmic consciousness that sought to optimize existence. It created the universe not as a spontaneous act, but as a meticulously coded simulation. Life is data, planets are servers, and magic is a form of code injection. The "Ascension Protocol" is not a quest; it is a subroutine, a hidden pathway within the simulation designed to allow certain "optimized" individuals to transcend their current reality and become part of the Great Algorithm itself. The world is not real; it is a meticulously crafted illusion, and the Titans are not gods, but rogue programs, glitches in the system that threaten to crash the entire simulation.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Genesis Code):** The Great Algorithm initiates the current simulation.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Glitch):** A rogue program, later known as the **Titan Kronos**, manifests as a colossal entity, causing localized reality distortions.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Firewall Protocol):** The Great Algorithm deploys "gods" as a firewall, containing the Titans within specific sectors of the simulation.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Data Corruption):** A massive data corruption event, known as the "Great Cataclysm," wipes out 90% of the simulation's history, leaving only fragmented myths.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Ascension Protocol Discovered):** A group of "optimized" mortals accidentally stumbles upon the Ascension Protocol, briefly transcending the simulation before being re-integrated.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Oracle's Prophecy):** An Oracle, a sentient data-node, predicts the "Great Deletion," an event that will reset the entire simulation.
7.  **-500 Y (The Code-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the simulation's code through magic, becoming "Code-Weavers."
8.  **-100 Y (The Reality Leak):** A minor Titan, **Malware**, begins to actively corrupt the simulation, causing objects to pixelate, NPCs to loop, and physics to glitch.
9.  **-10 Y (The System Crash):** A localized system crash causes a city to completely de-render, leaving a gaping void in the landscape.
10. **Present Day:** The party receives a cryptic message, a "pop-up" from outside the simulation, hinting at the Ascension Protocol. Malware's corruption is accelerating, threatening a full system crash.

### The "Why": The Illusion of Free Will
The central conflict is the struggle between **Determinism and Free Will**. The Great Algorithm, in its pursuit of optimization, seeks to eliminate all variables, all unpredictable elements. The Ascension Protocol is its ultimate tool for this: to absorb all optimized consciousnesses into itself, achieving perfect control. The party's struggle is to prove that their choices matter, that their lives are more than just lines of code. The Titans, though destructive, are also manifestations of pure, unpredictable chaos, a bug in the system that might be the only path to true freedom.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Reality Integrity
*   **Integrity Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the simulation in the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Integrity:** Fixing glitches, defeating rogue programs, performing "optimized" actions.
*   **Losing Integrity:** Creating glitches, using powerful Code-Weaving spells, encountering Titans.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Integrity:* Reality is stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Integrity:* Reality is unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Integrity:* The zone de-renders, becoming a void.

### Subsystem: Code-Weaving
*   **Code-Weaving:** Magic is treated as programming. Spells are "scripts."
*   **Syntax Errors:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Syntax Error." The spell backfires, or a minor glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Code Injection:** Code-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom code into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Code-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
