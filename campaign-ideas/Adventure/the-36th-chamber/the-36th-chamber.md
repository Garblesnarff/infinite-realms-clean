The party are students or allies of San Te, who witnessed the brutal massacre of their resistance group by the Qing Empire's General Tien Ta. They flee to the legendary Shaolin Temple seeking to learn kung fu to avenge their fallen friends. But first, they must progress through all 35 Chambers of Shaolin training—each teaching a different aspect of martial arts, philosophy, and discipline. The campaign is a training montage where each chamber is a unique challenge, culminating in San Te's revolutionary idea: creating a 36th Chamber to teach Shaolin kung fu to common people, transforming personal revenge into societal liberation.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc of training, mastery, and revolution.

*   **Act I — Entering the Temple (Sessions 1–3):** The party escapes the Qing massacre and seeks refuge at Shaolin. Initially rejected, they persist until the Abbott allows them to join as novice monks. They learn the basic structure: there are 35 Chambers, each teaching different skills, and they must progress through them all.
*   **Act II — The 35 Chambers (Sessions 4–11):** The bulk of the campaign is structured around progressing through chambers, with each session focusing on 3-5 chambers as skill challenges and training montages. Each chamber teaches specific abilities that mechanically empower the party. Key chambers receive full session focus: Chamber of Balance, Chamber of Weapons, Chamber of Wooden Men.
*   **Act III — The 36th Chamber (Sessions 12–15):** Having mastered all 35 chambers, San Te proposes creating a 36th Chamber to teach laypeople, which the conservative Abbott rejects. The party must leave Shaolin, establish the revolutionary chamber, train common people to resist oppression, and face General Tien Ta using both their martial skills and their army of trained civilians.
