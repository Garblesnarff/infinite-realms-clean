# Murder on the Astral Express
## *"The impossible has happened, therefore the impossible must be possible"*

### Campaign Overview

Renowned detective Hercule Poirot—a fastidious, brilliant, and magnificently egotistical investigator—solves impossible murders in the Golden Age of mystery. The party either plays as Poirot and companions, or rotates between different investigations featuring the great detective. Each case is a locked-room puzzle, a gathering of suspects with secrets, and a devastating revelation where all is explained.

This campaign celebrates classic mystery fiction: Orient Express luxury, country house murders, exotic locales, and the triumph of "little grey cells" over brute force. Every case follows the Christie formula: Seemingly impossible crime, closed circle of suspects, buried secrets, and brilliant deduction revealing shocking truth.

The campaign features 8-12 distinct mysteries, each a complete story with its own twist, set in glamorous 1920s-1930s fantasy equivalent.
