# Epochs Unbound
**Tagline:** *"Journey to tomorrow. Witness eternity. Find humanity in the far future."*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers an ancient time machine capable of traveling thousands—even millions—of years into the future. Unlike campaigns focused on preventing catastrophes or fixing timelines, this campaign is pure exploration of the deep future. Each arc jumps further ahead: 1,000 years, 10,000 years, 100,000 years, and eventually to the end of time itself. The party witnesses humanity's evolution, devolution, and transcendence across vast spans of time.

Inspired by The Time Machine's exploration of evolutionary and societal change across millennia, this campaign emphasizes wonder, discovery, and philosophical contemplation. The party cannot change these distant futures—they're too far ahead—but they can learn from them, gather knowledge, and perhaps discover why the time machine was built and what message it carries across the ages.

**Twist 4:** Each visit slightly changes futures, creates branching

**Twist 5:** Party's present is already far future of another civilization

**Twist 6:** The message is warning: don't build time machine (paradox)

**Twist 7:** Last One reveals party must stay in future to complete cycle

**Twist 8:** Time machine was escape pod, present is doomed

## Victory Conditions
