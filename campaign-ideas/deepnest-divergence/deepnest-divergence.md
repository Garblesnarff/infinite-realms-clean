## Campaign Overview

**Campaign Type / Genre:** Horror / Dark Fantasy / Insect Civilization
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15–25 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** horrifying, claustrophobic, alien, evolutionary, parasitic, chitinous, disturbing
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Beneath the known caverns lies the Deepnest—an endless labyrinth of winding tunnels filled with an ancient insect civilization. The Thri-kreen Hive, the Formian Colonies, and the sentient Spider Collectives have maintained a tense peace for centuries, all serving the ancient Broodmothers. When a mysterious parasitic infection begins transforming citizens of the surface world into hybrid insect-creatures, the party must descend into the clicking darkness to find the source. What they discover challenges the very definition of civilization, consciousness, and what it means to remain human in the face of evolutionary horror.

## What "Hard" Difficulty Means Here

* **Encounters:** The insect kingdoms fight with alien tactics—swarm attacks, hive minds, environmental advantages. Traditional combat strategies often fail.
* **Horror Elements:** Body horror, transformation, loss of identity. Players may face permanent physical changes to their characters.
* **Navigation:** The Deepnest is deliberately disorienting. Getting lost, running out of supplies, and being hunted are constant threats.
* **Moral Complexity:** The insect civilizations aren't evil—they're alien. Understanding and empathy are as important as combat prowess.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15–25 sessions)

A four-act arc that descends from investigation to transformation.

* **Act I — The Infection (Sessions 1–6):** A strange plague sweeps through a surface town, transforming people into insect-hybrid creatures. The party investigates, discovering the infected flee underground. They must track them into the Deepnest.
* **Act II — The Three Kingdoms (Sessions 7–12):** The party navigates the political landscape of the insect civilizations, learning about the Broodmothers and the ancient ecosystem. They discover the infection is spreading in the Deepnest too.
* **Act III — The Divergence (Sessions 13–18):** The source revealed—an ancient Broodmother has gone mad, attempting to "evolve" all sentient beings into a singular perfected form. The party must navigate increasingly hostile territory and resist transformation.
* **Act IV — The Metamorphosis War (Sessions 19–25):** The three kingdoms unite against the rogue Broodmother. The party leads an assault into the deepest levels, facing the choice of destroying the source or accepting transformation as evolution.

5. **The Formian Colonies:** Research warrens, alchemical laboratories, libraries of biological knowledge carved in chitin.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict operates on multiple levels:
* **Physical:** Stopping the infection from spreading to the surface world.
* **Philosophical:** Is transformation evolution or extinction? Is unity consciousness or slavery?
* **Personal:** The party's own infection—do they embrace or resist change?
* **Political:** Three kingdoms at war, each with different visions of the future.

The party must navigate these conflicts while facing their own potential transformation.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Transformation Stages**

* Characters infected track transformation through six stages.
* Each stage grants insect abilities but imposes penalties to human interactions.
* Stage 1-2: Minor physical changes, ability to understand insect speech.
* Stage 3-4: Significant changes, insect abilities (climb speed, natural armor, antennae senses).
* Stage 5: Major transformation, begin hearing the Broodmother's call.
* Stage 6: Complete transformation, character becomes NPC unless cured.

### 2. **Hive Mind Communication**

* In the Deepnest, telepathic communication is the norm.
* Party members can tap into limited hive-mind connections as they transform.
* Information overload can occur—requires Wisdom saves to maintain individuality.

### 3. **Alien Navigation**

* The Deepnest uses non-euclidean geometry. Standard mapping doesn't work.
* Navigation requires Survival checks with disadvantage or insect guides.
* Getting lost results in random encounters and resource depletion.

### 4. **Horror Saves**

* Witnessing transformations, body horror, or alien environments requires Wisdom saves.
* Failure results in fear, revulsion, or existential dread conditions.
* Repeated exposure can lead to acceptance or desensitization.

### 5. **Chitinous Combat**

* Insect creatures have unique combat properties: swarm tactics, acid, paralytic venom, hive coordination.
* Traditional weapons less effective against chitinous armor.
* Fire is particularly effective but dangerous in tight tunnels.

### 6. **The Evolutionary Choice**

* At critical moments, party members can choose to accelerate their transformation for power.
* This provides immediate mechanical benefits but advances transformation stages.
* Creates tension between power and identity.

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Willing Converts:** Many of the infected went willingly, seeking escape from mortal pain and limitation.

2. **Surface Conspiracy:** A surface cult has been trading people to the Deepnest for decades in exchange for alchemical secrets.

3. **The First Species:** The Broodmother was once the last of her species. The insect kingdoms are all her "children," evolved from different attempts to recreate her people.

4. **Cure is Destruction:** The only way to cure the infection is to kill the Broodmother, which will cause all her children to become sterile—dooming the kingdoms.

5. **Player Character Origin:** One PC is revealed to have insect ancestry, making them immune to forced transformation but not the call.

6. **The Surface Infection:** By the time the party resolves the Deepnest situation, the infection has spread widely on the surface. The war is coming up.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

### Victory Conditions:

* **Cure and Contain:** Find a way to cure the infection without destroying the insect kingdoms. Extremely difficult.
* **Controlled Evolution:** Broker a peace where transformation is voluntary and regulated.
* **Kingdom Alliance:** Unite the kingdoms to imprison the rogue Broodmother without killing her.
* **Accept Transformation:** The party voluntarily transforms, joining the Deepnest as ambassadors between worlds.

### Defeat Conditions:

* **Total Transformation:** All party members reach Stage 6, becoming NPCs.
* **Kingdom Collapse:** The war destroys the Deepnest civilization, releasing horrors into the surface world.
* **Surface Overrun:** The infection spreads unchecked, beginning global transformation.
* **Broodmother Victory:** The First Broodmother succeeds in her plan, creating a singular consciousness from all sentient beings.

## Campaign Themes

* **Identity vs. Evolution:** At what point does change make you no longer yourself?
* **Unity vs. Individuality:** Is a hive mind slavery or ultimate cooperation?
* **Beauty in Horror:** The insect kingdoms are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying.
* **The Cost of Civilization:** What must be sacrificed to maintain society?
* **Willing vs. Forced:** Is transformation acceptable if chosen freely?
* **The Alien Other:** Understanding those fundamentally different from ourselves.
