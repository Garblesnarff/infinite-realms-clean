# World-Building Specification Brief: Deepnest Divergence

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Deepnest Divergence**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
* **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
* **Content:** Beneath the known caverns lies the Deepnest—an endless labyrinth of winding tunnels filled with an ancient insect civilization. When a mysterious parasitic infection begins transforming citizens of the surface world into hybrid insect-creatures, the party must descend into the clicking darkness to find the source. What they discover challenges the very definition of civilization, consciousness, and what it means to remain human in the face of evolutionary horror. The insect kingdoms aren't evil—they're alien, ancient, and pursuing what they consider progress.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
* **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
* **Prompts:**
    * Detail the extinction of the First Species—the original race that Broodmother Xin'thara belonged to, and why she survived alone.
    * Write the history of the Three Kingdoms: how the Thri-kreen, Silkweavers, and Formians were created by the Broodmothers as attempts to recreate civilization.
    * Describe the philosophy of Evolution-as-Salvation: why the Broodmothers see transformation as improvement rather than destruction.
    * Explain the biology of transformation: the stages, what changes physically and mentally, and whether consciousness is truly retained.
    * Detail the ecosystem of the Deepnest: how bio-luminescent fungi, evolution vats, and living architecture function.
    * Write about the surface cult that has been trading humans to the Deepnest for alchemical secrets for decades.
    * Describe the telepathic hive-mind network that connects all Deepnest inhabitants and what maintaining individuality within it requires.
    * Explain the history of the Brood-Garden: why it was sealed, what experiments happened there, and what went wrong.

* **Triggers:**
    * **IF:** Party reaches transformation Stage 3.
    * **THEN:** They can now communicate telepathically with Deepnest inhabitants. Begin hearing Xin'thara's call. Generate temptation scenarios.
    * **IF:** Party resists transformation completely.
    * **THEN:** The kingdoms respect their commitment but offer less help. Xin'thara sees them as enemies. Must find alternate power sources.
    * **IF:** One party member accepts transformation willingly.
    * **THEN:** They gain significant powers but start receiving secret communications from Xin'thara. Creates party tension. Generate infiltration scenarios.
    * **IF:** Party exposes the surface cult.

    * **Stage 3 (Hybrid):** Major changes—compound eye growth, mandible development, exoskeleton forming. +2 AC, climb speed, telepathy.
    * **Stage 4 (Transformed):** Clearly more insect than human. Additional limbs, full exoskeleton. Enhanced abilities but social penalties. Hear Xin'thara constantly.
    * **Stage 5 (Perfected):** Nearly complete transformation. Retain consciousness but struggle against hivemind. Powerful but losing self.
    * **Stage 6 (Unity):** Complete transformation. Character becomes NPC unless cured immediately.

    * **Alien Horror:** Encountering truly foreign intelligence. Understanding/misunderstanding sanity.
    * **Claustrophobic Horror:** Endless tunnels, getting lost, being hunted. Survival/navigation challenges.
* **Horror Conditions:**
    * **Frightened:** Standard fear.
    * **Disturbed:** Disadvantage on social checks, nightmares, intrusive thoughts.
    * **Desensitized:** No longer bothered by horror but losing empathy.
