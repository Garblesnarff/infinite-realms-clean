---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Wasteland Run
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Post-Apocalyptic / Vehicle Combat / Chase
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **9–10**
**Tone (keywords):** adrenaline-fueled, desperate, vehicular-mayhem, survival, rebellious, explosive
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the scorched wastelands left after the Cataclysm, the tyrannical Warlord Immortan rules the Citadel—controlling the region's only source of fresh water. The party, a group of wasteland survivors and former war-riders, teams up with the Five Brides—women escaping Immortan's forced breeding program—to make a desperate run across 500 miles of hostile desert to the fabled Green Place. Pursued by Immortan's fanatical War Boys, rival wasteland gangs, and the brutal conditions of the wastes themselves, the party must keep moving, keep fighting, and keep hoping there's something worth reaching at the end of the road.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Constant Pressure:** The campaign is essentially one long chase. Rest is rare and dangerous. The enemy never stops pursuing.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Water, fuel, ammunition, and healing are precious commodities that must be carefully managed.
*   **Vehicle Combat Complexity:** Combat happens at high speeds with vehicles, requiring tactical thinking about positioning, terrain, and mechanical condition.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** The wasteland itself is an enemy—sandstorms, toxic zones, treacherous terrain, extreme heat.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc structured as one continuous chase across the wasteland.

*   **Act I — The Escape (Sessions 1–2):** The party helps the Five Brides escape from the Citadel. The alarm is raised and Immortan's entire war party—including his sons and the War Boys—gives chase. The party must establish their convoy, gather initial supplies, and survive the first waves of attacks while getting enough distance from the Citadel.
*   **Act II — The Wasteland Gauntlet (Sessions 3–5):** The run across 500 miles of hostile wasteland. The party encounters rival gangs who control different territories, navigates natural hazards, deals with mechanical breakdowns, and faces increasingly desperate attacks from pursuers. They learn the hard truth: the Green Place may not exist anymore.
*   **Act III — The Return (Sessions 6–8):** With the Green Place dead, the party makes a desperate decision: return to the Citadel and take it. The final act is a massive vehicular battle as the convoy fights its way back through Immortan's forces, ultimately leading to a climactic assault on the Citadel itself to liberate the water and the people.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Gauntlet: The convoy must run a narrow canyon while War Boys attack from above, from behind, and even board the vehicles.

    *   The First Victory: The party defeats or escapes the first wave, but their vehicles take damage and fuel runs low.

**Escalation:** They reach the first waypoint—a settlement that should be friendly—only to find it's been taken over by the Gas Town gang, another of Immortan's allies.

### Session 3 — "Blood and Chrome"

*   **Focus:** Tactical Combat / Resource Management
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Gas Town Ambush: The party must fight through or negotiate with the Gas Town gang while refueling.
    *   Difficult Choices: With limited fuel, they must decide what to carry and what to leave behind. Every gallon matters.
    *   The Revelation: One of the Five Brides is sick. They need medicine, but that requires detouring to dangerous territory.

### Session 4 — "Storm of Sand and Blood"

*   **Focus:** Environmental Challenge / Horror

    *   The Sandstorm: A massive storm blocks the way forward. The party must choose: wait it out (letting pursuers catch up) or drive through it (risking getting lost or destroyed).
    *   Blind Fighting: Combat in the storm where visibility is near zero. Enemies appear from the sand like ghosts.
    *   The Lost: If they entered the storm, they might encounter other lost travelers, or worse—ancient dangers buried in the sand.

    *   The Gauntlet Reversed: The same canyon that was their escape route is now their attack vector. But this time they have surprise and desperation.
    *   Kamikaze Tactics: War Boys are fanatic, but they're not prepared for opponents willing to make the same suicide runs.

**Escalation:** Both of Immortan's sons die in the battle, but so do some of the party's allies. The cost of freedom is measured in blood and sacrifice.

    *   The Water Flows: The party fights to the water controls while allies free the enslaved population.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Citadel:** A massive rock formation carved into a fortress, with water flowing from deep underground wells.
2.  **The War Rig:** Furiosa's heavily-armored truck, essentially a mobile fortress and the convoy's centerpiece.
3.  **The Canyons:** Narrow passes where vehicle combat becomes deadly close-quarters fighting.
4.  **Gas Town:** A settlement built around refineries, controlled by another warlord allied with Immortan.
5.  **The Dead Green Place:** A toxic swamp that was once paradise, now a graveyard of hope.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is about freedom versus control, hope versus despair, and whether redemption is possible for those who've served tyranny. It asks: what are you willing to sacrifice for freedom? And when you achieve it, what will you build? The wasteland is brutal, but human tyranny is worse. The campaign is about choosing to fight even when the odds are impossible.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Vehicle Combat System**

*   Vehicles have their own stat blocks: HP, AC, Speed Zones (slow/combat/chase/max), and mounted weapons.
*   **Speed Zones:** Different combat options available at different speeds. Boarding actions only at combat speed, ramming at chase speed, etc.
*   **Crew Roles:** Driver, gunner, mechanic, boarder. Each PC takes a role each turn, enabling coordinated vehicular tactics.
*   **Damage:** Vehicle damage affects performance. Losing wheels reduces speed, engine damage limits acceleration, etc.

### 2. **Resource Tracking**

*   Track three critical resources: Fuel (measured in gallons), Water (measured in days), Ammunition (abstract into categories).
*   **Scarcity:** The party must make hard choices about when to conserve and when to spend freely.
*   **Acquisition:** Resources are gained through risky scavenging, negotiating with settlements, or looting defeated enemies.

### 3. **The Pursuit Clock**

*   Track how far ahead of Immortan's forces the party is on a scale of 10 (far ahead) to 0 (caught).
*   **Triggers:** Combat, resting, detours, and breakdowns reduce distance. Good driving, shortcuts, and defeating pursuers increase it.
*   **Consequences:** At certain thresholds, Immortan deploys different assets—regular War Boys, elite squads, his sons, himself.

### 4. **Environmental Hazards**

*   The wasteland generates random dangers: sandstorms, rockslides, toxic zones, heat exhaustion, radiation pockets.
*   **Navigation:** Successful Survival checks can avoid hazards or find resources. Failure leads to dangerous encounters.

### 5. **Witness Points**

*   War Boys and party members can earn "Witness Points" for spectacular stunts, brave sacrifices, or impossible victories.
*   **Mechanics:** Spend a Witness Point to automatically succeed on a death saving throw or perform an impossible vehicular stunt.
*   **Spirit:** This rewards cinematic action and encourages players to take dramatic risks.
