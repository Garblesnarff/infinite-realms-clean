### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Steel Meets Sorcery**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A massive magical gate connects the modern world to a medieval fantasy realm called the Special Region. The party—elite modern military specialists—crosses through on a recon and diplomacy mission, equipped with advanced technology. They must navigate this world where dragons are real and magic exists, while preventing interdimensional war and dealing with empires, demihumans, and vengeful gods.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the creation of the Gate: an ancient magical artifact that periodically opens to different worlds, controlled by the gods as a test or game.
    *   Write the history of the Saderan Empire: a centuries-old feudal empire that has conquered most of the known Special Region through military might and political marriage.
    *   Describe the various intelligent species in the Special Region: humans, elves (long-lived forest dwellers), dwarves (mountain craftsmen), various demihumans (catfolk, rabbitfolk, birdfolk), and dragons (ancient, intelligent, immensely powerful).
    *   Explain the divine pantheon: gods are real, active beings who grant power to apostles, demand worship, and occasionally manifest avatars to influence mortal affairs.
    *   Detail the failed invasion: Emperor Molt's arrogant decision to send forces through the Gate to "conquer the other side," and the catastrophic defeat when they encountered modern weapons.
    *   Write about previous Gates: legends say the Gate has opened to other worlds before (explaining why some Special Region magic items seem oddly familiar).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Modern Military Forces** (Major - Player Faction)
        *   **Goals:** Secure the Gate, gather intelligence, establish peaceful relations, prevent threats to the homeland.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Standard military chain of command, ultimately answering to civilian government.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We come in peace but will defend ourselves and innocents.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Different factions within government debate whether to colonize, trade, or isolate—the party may be caught in political crossfire.
        *   **Assets:** Overwhelming technological superiority, discipline, supply lines through the Gate.
        *   **Relationships:** Feared by most in Special Region, but increasingly respected by those they protect.
    *   **Saderan Empire** (Major - Primary Antagonist Initially)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain dominance, save face after the failed invasion, extract concessions from the "demons beyond the Gate."
        *   **Hierarchy:** Emperor at top, with noble houses, Senate, and military command vying for influence.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The Empire is eternal and will never bow to outsiders.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Massive internal divide between hardliners (who want war despite losses) and reformers (who recognize they can't win).
        *   **Assets:** Large armies, slave labor, established infrastructure, magical support.
        *   **Relationships:** Internal political chaos, losing vassal states, desperate for divine intervention.
    *   **Order of the Rose Knights** (Minor - Reformers)
        *   **Goals:** Achieve peace with the modern forces, reform the Empire's worst practices.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Princess Pina, composed of noble daughters seeking to prove themselves.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Knights who serve honor and justice.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use peace negotiations to gain political power and undermine hardline nobles.
        *   **Assets:** Pina's royal status, skilled warriors, growing alliance with modern forces.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed by traditionalist nobles, supported by commoners, courting modern alliance.
    *   **Demihuman Tribes** (Minor - Potential Allies)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, achieve freedom from Empire's oppression, protect their lands.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Tribal councils, warrior chiefs, shaman advisors.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We want to be left alone to live in peace.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some see modern forces as potential liberators; others see them as new oppressors.
        *   **Assets:** Guerrilla warfare expertise, knowledge of wild lands, unique racial abilities.
        *   **Relationships:** Oppressed by Empire, cautiously hopeful about modern forces.
    *   **The Divine Pantheon** (Major - Wildcard)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain their power and worship, test mortals, settle divine disputes through mortal proxies.
        *   **Hierarchy:** High gods (Emroy, Hardy, La), lesser gods, apostles (like Rory).
        *   **Public Agenda:** The gods are eternal and rule all.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The gods are actually concerned that modern weapons might threaten their power—mortality can kill apostles.
        *   **Assets:** Divine magic, apostles with superhuman abilities, the faith of millions.
        *   **Relationships:** Divided—some gods see modern forces as interesting, others as threats to be eliminated.
