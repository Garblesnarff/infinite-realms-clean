# The Game of Faces
**Tagline:** *Play the games of your childhood. Die like an adult.*

## Campaign Overview

Four hundred and fifty-six desperate souls have accepted an invitation to compete in mysterious games for the chance to win 45.6 million gold pieces—enough to erase their crushing debts and start new lives. They're transported to a massive facility hidden from the world, where they'll play six simple children's games. But there's a horrifying twist: lose a game, and you die. Win all six games, and you split the prize money with the other survivors. The facility is run by masked overseers who never show their faces, serving mysterious VIP guests who watch the carnage from gilded observation rooms.

The games themselves are deliberately simple—tag, hide-and-seek, tug-of-war, marbles—but the stakes transform them into nightmares. The players are numbered, not named, wearing colored tracksuits and sleeping in massive dormitories. Between games, alliances form and fracture, romances bloom in the shadow of death, and the psychology of survival pushes people to their breaking points. Some try to maintain their humanity; others become monsters to survive.

As the campaign progresses, players discover the games have been running for decades, funded by ultra-wealthy individuals who bet on outcomes and even participate in secret hunts. The true horror isn't just the deadly games—it's the revelation of who's watching, who's profiting, and what happens to the winners who think they've escaped.
