# The Game of Faces - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Stark Minimalism Meets Childhood Nostalgia

**Overall Aesthetic:** Clean, geometric, unsettlingly perfect spaces contrasted with visceral violence. Pastel colors of childhood games corrupted by blood and death.

**Color Palette:**
- Tracksuit colors: Teal-green (#00CCA7) for players, hot pink (#FF0080) for guards
- Facility: Stark white (#FFFFFF), institutional gray (#808080), sickly green lighting
- Blood: Vivid red (#DC143C) stark against clean backgrounds
- Prize money: Gold glow (#FFD700)

**Guard Aesthetic:**
- Geometric masks: Circle, Triangle, Square
- Matching hot pink jumpsuits
- Black geometric masks
- Anonymous, dehumanized
- Squid Game visual reference

**Game Arenas:**
- Oversized, childlike environments
- Giant doll, playground aesthetics
- Clinical cleanliness until blood splatters
- Eerie contrast: innocent + lethal

## Music and Sound Design

**Ambient/Facility:** Unsettling silence, distant industrial hums, footsteps echo
**Game Themes:** Twisted children's music boxes, distorted playground songs
**Death Sounds:** Gunshots, screams, then eerie quiet, bodies removed efficiently
**Emotional Moments:** Piano-led melancholy, Korean instrumental
**Tension:** Countdown timers, ticking clocks, heartbeats
**VIP Scenes:** Baroque classical, decadent party music

**Voice Direction:**
- Front Man: Modulated, emotionless, authority
- Old Man: Grandfatherly, warm, hiding darkness
- Players: Desperate, human, breaking under pressure
- VIPs: Bored wealthy, casual cruelty, foreign accents

## Cinematic Moments

- **The First Death:** Sudden violence shattering innocence
- **Dormitory Riots:** Lights out, chaos, night-vision horror
- **Marble Game Betrayal:** Close-ups on faces, emotional devastation
- **Glass Bridge Falls:** Slow-motion shattering, bodies plummeting
- **VIP Unmasking:** Reveal of powerful figures, political horror
- **Final Game:** Brutal physicality, rain or harsh lighting, exhaustion
