# Creative Brief: Mountain Pass Legends

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Anime Racing Realism (Initial D-inspired)

Inspired by the realistic-leaning anime aesthetics of *Initial D* with emphasis on technical driving, mountain scenery, JDM car culture, and the beauty of mastery through repetition. This style captures the zen of perfect technique, the intimacy of mountain passes, and coming-of-age through automotive skill.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Technical Detail:** Cars shown mid-drift with proper physics, tire smoke, weight transfer visible
*   **Mountain Atmosphere:** Winding passes, dangerous drops, scenic views, dawn/night ambiance
*   **JDM Car Culture:** Classic Japanese sports cars (AE86, RX-7, S13, etc.), period-appropriate modifications
*   **Moments of Zen:** Quiet mountain beauty contrasted with intense racing focus

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Technical mastery, mountain zen, legacy, JDM culture, coming-of-age, drift art, humble beginnings
*   **Feeling:** The quiet discipline of daily delivery runs transforming into racing mastery. Mountain passes as both workplace and sacred ground. Respect earned through skill.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Vehicle Colors:** Classic JDM—white (AE86), yellow (FD3S), black (S13), red (FC3S), keeping period authenticity
*   **Environmental:** Mountain greens and browns, dawn orange/pink skies, night deep blues, asphalt grays
*   **Drift Smoke:** White/blue tire smoke, orange sparks from scraping, red taillights in darkness
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by dawn orange and pink sky over Mount Akina. A white AE86 Trueno with black hood drifts through a corner leaving blue-white tire smoke. Green mountain forest lines the road. Dark gray asphalt with yellow center line. Red taillights glow."

**3. Vehicle Design:**
*   **Classic JDM:** Period-correct Japanese sports cars from 1980s-1990s
*   **Subtle Modifications:** Aftermarket wheels, lowered suspension, functional parts not flashy
*   **Racing Wear:** Vehicles show use—scratched paint, worn tires, functional not pristine
*   **Prompt Example:** "A white Toyota AE86 Trueno with pop-up headlights raised. Black carbon hood. Simple aftermarket wheels. Slightly lowered suspension. Small dent in rear quarter panel from racing. Racing stickers minimal. Driver visible through window in racing focus position."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Mountain Passes:** Winding two-lane roads with guardrails, dangerous cliff drops, dense forest
*   **Time Specificity:** Dawn (orange sky, long shadows), night (headlight beams, darkness), day (clear views)
*   **Atmospheric Details:** Morning mist in valleys, rain on pavement, autumn leaves, snow potential
*   **Prompt Example:** "A narrow mountain pass road at dawn. The two-lane asphalt winds through dense forest. Metal guardrail lines the outside edge with steep drop visible beyond. Orange morning light filters through trees. Morning mist rises from valley below. Yellow painted center line curves ahead."

**5. Racing Action:**
*   **Drift Dynamics:** Cars at angle with front wheels turned, weight on outside tires, smoke trailing
*   **Technical Details:** Suspension compression visible, tire deformation at contact patch, realistic physics
*   **Motion Emphasis:** Motion blur on background, speed lines, light trails from taillights at night
*   **Prompt Example:** "A red Mazda RX-7 FD mid-drift through a hairpin turn. The car is at 45-degree angle, front wheels turned sharp left. Weight visibly loaded on right-side tires. White tire smoke streams from rear wheels. Background forest motion-blurred. Headlight beams cutting through darkness ahead."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Natural Lighting:** Dawn and night preferred, realistic light behavior, no neon artificiality
*   **Headlight Drama:** At night, headlight beams cutting through darkness create primary lighting
*   **Realistic Shadows:** Proper physics-based shadows, ambient occlusion, natural depth
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by headlights in darkness. The white AE86's pop-up headlights create two bright beams illuminating the road ahead and catching particles in the air. Taillights create red glow behind. Ambient moonlight provides subtle fill. Deep shadows in forest areas."

## Voice

A contemplative, focused voice with underlying passion, like someone who has found purpose through mastery. The pacing is measured during technique discussions, intense but controlled during races. The tone shifts between humble reflection (delivery driver life), analytical focus (racing theory), and respectful admiration for mastery. There's an underlying theme of legacy and succession. Never boastful, always learning. Role: The voice of earned mastery.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** Eurobeat for races (high-energy, driving rhythm), emotional instrumentals for character moments, 90s J-Pop for cultural atmosphere. Each racer has musical theme.
*   **Sound Effects:** Engine notes specific to each car type (rotary whine, inline-4 buzz), tire squeals, transmission shifts, handbrake pulls, engine braking, wind rushing past windows.
*   **Dynamic Music:** Eurobeat starts when race begins, builds during intense moments, drops to instrumental during technique explanations, triumphant or melancholy based on outcome.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** Morning mountain sounds (birds, wind through trees), nighttime silence broken only by engines, rain on windshield, minimal urban noise—mountains are quiet.
