## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of skill mastery, legacy, and earning legendary status.

*   **Act I — Delivery Drivers to Racers (Sessions 1-7):** The party runs delivery routes on Mount Akina, unconsciously mastering the roads through repetition. When the Red Suns team challenges local racers, the party is reluctantly drawn into racing to defend their mountain. They learn basic drift techniques from their parents and older racers, discovering that years of deliveries have made them intimately familiar with every corner.
*   **Act II — Inter-Mountain Battles (Sessions 8-14):** Now recognized racers, the party challenges other mountain passes—Akagi, Usui, Myogi—facing specialized teams with different racing philosophies. They uncover their parents' racing pasts and learn advanced techniques: gutter running, inertia drift, blind attacks. They discover the legendary "White Comet" is planning a final race before retirement.
*   **Act III — The Mountain God Challenge (Sessions 15-20):** The party must prove they're worthy successors by racing the White Comet and other legendary racers from their parents' generation. They face impossible challenges: racing downhill in the rain, battles against superior vehicles, and the ultimate test—mastering "the zone" where driver and machine become one. The final race determines if the new generation can surpass the old.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of legacy and succession, mastery through repetition, technique vs. raw power, and whether the new generation can surpass the old. It asks: What does it mean to be a master? Can humble work lead to greatness? Should you chase your parents' shadows or forge your own path? The central conflict pits the party's natural talent and fresh innovation against decades of established mastery.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Drift Mastery System**
*   Multiple drift types to learn: basic drift, feint drift, inertia drift, Scandinavian flick
*   Each type suited for different situations—hairpins, sweepers, entries, exits
*   Mastery shown through: maintaining speed through corners, tire preservation, racing line perfection
*   Weight transfer management—understanding how car balance affects traction
*   Ultimate mastery: "the zone" where drifting becomes instinctive

### 2. **Course Knowledge**
*   Intimately knowing a course provides massive advantage
*   Party's delivery routes give them unconscious mastery of home mountain
*   Must learn new mountains through reconnaissance and practice runs
*   Hidden lines, grip variations, dangerous sections memorized
*   Can attempt "blind attack"—racing without headlights using pure course knowledge

### 3. **Vehicle Handicap System**
*   Party starts with ordinary cars (like the legendary AE86 Trueno)
*   Face opponents with objectively superior vehicles—more power, better tires, newer technology
*   Must overcome performance gaps through superior technique
*   Teaches that driver skill matters more than specifications
*   Late game: upgrade opportunities create choice between beloved starter or superior machine

### 4. **Technique Inheritance**
*   Parents and mentors teach specific techniques through demonstration
*   Each technique learned opens new tactical options in races
*   Some techniques discovered through experimentation during desperate moments
*   Creating your own technique shows true mastery
*   Passing techniques to others solidifies your own understanding

### 5. **Environmental Conditions**
*   Time of day affects racing: dawn (coolest tires), day (worst visibility), night (traditional time)
*   Weather dramatically changes physics: rain (reduced grip), fog (visibility), dry (optimal)
*   Must adapt all techniques to conditions
*   Some racers specialize in specific conditions
*   Party's delivery experience in all weather provides adaptability advantage

### 6. **The Zone State**
*   Ultimate mastery state where conscious thought disappears
*   Driver, machine, and mountain merge into flowing perfection
*   Triggered by: perfect familiarity, extreme focus, emotional breakthrough
*   In the zone: reactions become predictive, lines become perfect, car feels like extension of body
*   Final challenge requires achieving this state against White Comet

### 7. **Uphill vs. Downhill**
*   Two distinct racing styles requiring different skillsets
*   Downhill: momentum preservation, precise braking, corner exit focus
*   Uphill: power management, corner entry focus, maintaining speed against gravity
*   Some racers specialize in one; masters must excel at both
*   Different mountains favor different styles

### 8. **Honor and Respect System**
*   Mountain racing has unspoken rules and etiquette
*   Winning honorably matters more than winning through cheap tactics
*   Reputation spreads through racing community
*   Former rivals become friends through mutual respect
*   Ultimate goal: earning respect of legendary generation and right to continue legacy
