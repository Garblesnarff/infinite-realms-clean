# Mind of the Monster - Creative Brief

**Overall Aesthetic**: Clinical procedural meets psychological thriller. Sterile institutional environments contrasted with intimate horror of crime scenes and prison interviews. *Mindhunter*, *Zodiac*, *Silence of the Lambs* aesthetic.

### Color Palette

- **Shadow Blue** (#2F4F4F) - Night work, psychological darkness

### Lighting
- Harsh fluorescent in institutions
- Dim, controlled in interview rooms
- Crime scene flashbulbs and evidence photography
- Car headlights on dark roads
- Warm home lighting (fading as campaign progresses)
- Psychological darkness represented through desaturation

- Hotels: Impersonal, transitional spaces

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme**: Minimalist, building tension. Solo piano or strings with subtle electronic elements.

**Interview Music**: Silence broken by breathing, occasional movement. Music only in emotional peaks.

**Investigation Theme**: Methodical, analytical. Repetitive motifs suggesting obsession.

**The Apex Theme**: Elegant, classical music corrupted by dissonance. Intelligence and madness combined.

**Sounds**: Tape recorder clicks, pen on paper, footsteps in halls, prison doors, car engines, rain on windshields.

## Voice Direction

**Ed Kemper Analogue**: Friendly, articulate, disarmingly personable. Intelligence obvious. Occasional chilling detachment.

**Investigators**: Professional demeanor eroding over campaign. Exhaustion, stress, obsession creeping into voices.

**The Apex**: Cultured, educated, charming. Never raises voice. Perfect control hiding perfect evil.
