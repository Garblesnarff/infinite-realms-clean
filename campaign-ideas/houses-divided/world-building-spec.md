# World-Building Specification: Houses Divided

## Pre-War History

**Age of Unity (500-20 years ago):**
- Thirteen houses governed cooperatively
- Thirteenth House (Unity) coordinated others
- Each house managed its domain
- Council of Thirteen maintained balance

**The Fracturing (20 years ago):**
- Philosophical dispute over governance
- Accusations of favoritism and corruption
- Unity House attempted to maintain peace
- Eleven houses united against Unity House
- Destroyed Thirteenth House believing it centralized power
- War began immediately after

## Current State

**Twelve separate territories at war:**
Each controls aspect of life but needs others to function. Independence impossible but cooperation broken.

**The House War:**
- Fought over resources, ideology, territory
- Alliances shift constantly
- Civilians suffer most
- No end in sight without intervention

## The Astrological Houses

Each house governs life aspect per astrology:
1. **First:** Self, identity, individual rights
2. **Second:** Possessions, wealth, resources
3. **Third:** Communication, travel, commerce
4. **Fourth:** Home, family, foundations
5. **Fifth:** Creativity, pleasure, expression
6. **Sixth:** Service, work, health
7. **Seventh:** Partnership, contracts, others
8. **Eighth:** Death, transformation, shared resources
9. **Ninth:** Philosophy, education, truth
10. **Tenth:** Authority, structure, public life
11. **Eleventh:** Community, friendship, society
12. **Twelfth:** Secrets, subconscious, hidden things

**Thirteenth House (Destroyed):** Unity, integration, balance - coordinated all others

## House Philosophies

Each believes its principle should dominate:
- First: Individual freedom creates best society
- Second: Economic power determines rights
- Third: Communication and trade bring peace
- Fourth: Family structures provide stability
- Fifth: Creativity and joy are society's purpose
- Sixth: Service and discipline create order
- Seventh: Partnership and cooperation work best
- Eighth: Transformation through crisis necessary
- Ninth: Philosophy and education elevate all
- Tenth: Hierarchical authority prevents chaos
- Eleventh: Collective action solves problems
- Twelfth: Hidden wisdom guides properly

All have merit. All taken to extreme become tyranny.

## House-Walkers

Born between houses (rare astrological placement):
- Can access any house's territory and powers
- Trusted by none, needed by all
- Can see value in all philosophies
- Natural mediators and spies

**Role:** Only ones capable of ending war through understanding all perspectives.

## The Thirteenth House Ruins

Located geographically at center of twelve territories:
- Destroyed 20 years ago
- Contains evidence of orchestrated destruction
- Hidden chambers reveal unity was possible
- Restoration requires all twelve houses cooperating

## Magic System

**House Magic:** Each territory grants powers related to its domain
**Walker Magic:** Party can channel any house they've visited
**Unity Magic:** Combining house powers creates greater effects
**Restoration Magic:** Could rebuild Thirteenth House

## Path to Peace

Three approaches:
1. **Diplomatic:** Convince all houses to negotiate
2. **Revelation:** Prove Unity House destruction was conspiracy
3. **Restoration:** Rebuild Thirteenth House as unifying principle

Campaign explores whether cooperation possible after deep division or if conquest only solution.

## Philosophical Core

Examines political philosophy and governance:
- Value and danger of specialization
- Need for cooperation despite differences
- How to govern diverse population fairly
- Whether unity or diversity should dominate
- Can former enemies reconcile?

No single answer. Party's choices shape outcome.
