# The Tree of Life - Creative Brief

## Art Style
The Fountain meets Terrence Malick. Cosmic scale intimate moments. Macro photography of nature alongside vast space. Golden hour lighting. Everything beautiful even in decay. Spiritual without specific religion. Visual poetry.

## Color Palettes
- **Dying World**: Golden, sepia, warm ending tones, beautiful decay, autumn eternal
- **Living World**: Full spectrum, vibrant greens, alive and dying simultaneously, honest
- **Transcendent World**: Beyond color, white light containing all colors, forms without substance
- **The Tree**: Bark like universe, roots like galaxies, leaves like stars, impossible to scale

## Music and Sound
- **Dying World**: Clint Mansell's "Death is the Road to Awe" style, tragic beauty
- **Living World**: Primal, drums, life sounds amplified, heartbeat of existence
- **Transcendent World**: Ethereal, wordless vocals, transcending music into sound-light
- **The Tree**: All sounds harmonizing, cosmic music, everything resolving

## Voice Direction
- **Loved Ones**: Personal to each player, speak with love and regret
- **Tomas the Eternal**: Empty, tired beyond measure, warning through exhaustion
- **Xibalba**: Gentle, patient, neither alive nor dead in voice quality, guide not god
- **Tree Keeper**: Like wind through leaves, like water over stone, not quite words

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Death Scene**: Loved one dying, party helpless, desperation driving quest
- **Meeting Eternal Man**: Seeing someone who won but lost, horror of success
- **The Journey Montage**: Traveling through lifetimes, witnessing cycle, death and rebirth everywhere
- **Confronting Tree**: Cosmic scale, feeling tiny, understanding enormity
- **Letting Go**: Loved one's spirit saying "it's okay, you can let me go," hardest scene
- **Transcendence**: If chosen, showing death as transformation, end as beginning
