# Creative Brief: The Deep Hunters

## Art Style: Nautical Thriller Realism

Inspired by *Jaws*, emphasizing maritime tension, the terror of the unseen beneath, and man vs. nature.

### Core Principles:
*   **Water as Threat:** The ocean is beautiful but deadly. Deep blue water hides the Maw.
*   **Scale and Terror:** Show the Maw's size against boats and humans. Rarely show it fully—a fin, jaws, shadow.
*   **Nautical Atmosphere:** Salt-weathered boats, fishing gear, small coastal towns, endless horizon.
*   **Economic Desperation:** Show crowded beaches vs. empty docks—the town's dilemma visualized.

### Style Guide:

**Colors:** Deep blues and greens of the ocean. Weathered browns and grays of boats. Bright beach colors contrast with dark water. Blood red for attacks.

**Characters:** Fishermen, tourists, hunters in practical gear. Captain Quade: scarred, grizzled, carries harpoons. The Maw: massive, scarred megalodon with unnatural intelligence in its eyes.

**Environments:** Coastal town, docks, crowded beaches, open ocean. The Maw's lair: dark, submerged cave full of bones.

**Lighting:** Bright, sunny beach scenes vs. dark, threatening ocean. Underwater scenes lit by bioluminescence or murky light.

**Composition:** Wide ocean shots showing isolation. Underwater shots looking up at the boat's underside (vulnerable). The Maw as a massive shadow or partially seen horror.

## Voice

A weathered, gravelly male voice with salty language and grim humor. Nautical terminology. Emotion: determination mixed with fear of the deep. Role: A seasoned sailor warning about the dangers below.
