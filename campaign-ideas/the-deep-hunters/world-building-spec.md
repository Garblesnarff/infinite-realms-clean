# World-Building Specification Brief: The Deep Hunters

**Core Concept:** A magically-enhanced megalodon terrorizes a coastal town. Party must hunt it while overcoming political obstruction from a profit-driven mayor.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Saltmere: fishing town of 2,000, economy depends on summer tourism.
*   The Maw: created by rogue mage Valdris as bioweapon experiment, escaped 3 years ago.
*   Previous attacks: 7 deaths in past month, escalating in boldness.
*   Captain Quade's history: survived previous encounter, lost his crew and leg.

**Factions:**
*   **Town of Saltmere** (Major): Split between safety advocates and profit-focused merchants.
*   **The Hunters** (Major): Party and Captain Quade.
*   **Mayor Corvin's Allies** (Minor): Merchants pressuring him to keep beaches open.

**NPCs (Tier 1):**
*   The Maw: Intelligent megalodon, 30 feet long, magically enhanced.
*   Mayor Corvin: Greedy politician, prioritizes profit over safety.
*   Captain Quade: Obsessed hunter, dying from old wounds, wants revenge.
*   Elira Saltwind: Grieving sister seeking justice.
*   Valdris (Hidden): Rogue mage who created the Maw, watching from afar.

**Locations:**
*   **Saltmere:** Coastal town with docks, beaches, festival grounds.
*   **The Docks:** Hub of fishing and hunting operations.
*   **Open Ocean:** Where final hunt occurs.
*   **The Maw's Lair:** Submerged cave system, bone-filled.

**Causality Chains:**
*   IF party kills Maw: Saltmere saved but economy ruined, may discover Valdris's involvement.
*   IF beaches stay open: More deaths, Tourism Morale drops faster.
*   IF party exposes Mayor Corvin: He's removed from office, beaches closed immediately.
*   IF Captain Quade sacrifices himself: Heroic death helps kill Maw.
*   IF party discovers Valdris: Leads to follow-up adventure hunting the mage.
