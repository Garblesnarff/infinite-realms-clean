# The Rivers of Hades

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Greek Mythology / Underworld Exploration / Epic Journey / Moral Choice
- **Estimated Length**: 22-28 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 3-16
- **Tone**: Classical, Epic, Melancholic, Philosophical, Grand

### Core Premise
The players died and must navigate the Greek underworld, crossing the five rivers (Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, Cocytus) to reach their final destination. But they discover they're not ordinary dead - they're heroes with unfinished business in the mortal world. They must petition the three judges of the dead for a chance at resurrection while navigating the complex politics of Hades's realm. Along the way, they'll visit Elysium's paradise, brave Tartarus's horrors, avoid the Asphodel Meadows' endless tedium, and ultimately face a choice: accept death peacefully, fight for resurrection, or make a deal that changes the balance between life and death itself.

### Difficulty Context: **Medium**
This campaign balances exploration, social interaction, and combat. Success requires understanding Greek mythology, navigating underworld politics, solving puzzles, and making difficult moral choices. Combat can often be avoided through clever negotiation or heroic persuasion. The underworld tests different virtues and vices in different regions.

### Major NPCs

- **Hades**: God of the underworld. **Role**: Ultimate Authority / Judge / Reluctant Villain. **Personality**: Stern but fair, tired of being vilified, lonely, devoted to cosmic order, actually compassionate beneath cold exterior. **Flaw/Secret**: Desperately lonely despite Persephone; envies the living; maintains law rigidly because it's all he has; might allow resurrection if convinced it serves justice.

- **Persephone**: Queen of the underworld (part-time). **Role**: Mediator / Potential Ally / Complex Figure. **Personality**: Changes seasonally - cold and regal in underworld months, warm and hopeful when spring approaches. Understands both life and death. **Flaw/Secret**: Her dual nature causes constant internal conflict; she can help players but only during certain times; her absence or presence affects Hades's mood dramatically.

- **Charon**: Ferryman of the Styx. **Role**: Guardian / Information Broker / Neutral Force. **Personality**: Ancient, laconic, knows everything happening in his realm, demands his obol (coin), surprisingly philosophical. **Flaw/Secret**: Has ferried every dead soul for millennia, knows shortcuts and secrets, might help heroes if properly compensated or impressed; secretly romantic about heroism.

- **Cerberus**: Three-headed hound. **Role**: Guardian / Obstacle / Potential Ally. **Personality**: Loyal, fierce, but ultimately a dog who wants affection. Each head has slightly different personality. **Flaw/Secret**: Can be befriended through genuine kindness (Orpheus did it with music); lonely as most fear him; Hades's most loyal companion and possible route to his sympathy.

- **The Three Judges (Minos, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus)**: Judge the dead. **Role**: Obstacles / Quest Givers / Moral Arbiters. **Personality**: Stern but ultimately just, each specializes in different types of souls. **Flaw/Secret**: Bound by ancient laws, but laws have loopholes; if players prove their deaths were unjust or their purpose noble enough, the judges might advocate for them.

- **Sisyphus**: Eternally pushing boulder. **Role**: Tragic Figure / Information Source / Cautionary Tale. **Personality**: Clever, bitter, surprisingly helpful, sees patterns in punishment. **Flaw/Secret**: His cleverness got him here; knows how to cheat death (did it twice before); might share knowledge if players promise to deliver messages to the living.

- **Orpheus**: The legendary musician. **Role**: Potential Ally / Tragic Hero / Guide. **Personality**: Grieving, talented, has been to the underworld and back, understands the paths. **Flaw/Secret**: Failed to bring Eurydice back; haunted by his failure; might help players succeed where he failed; his music can open doors and soften hearts.

- **Thanatos**: Death personified. **Role**: Antagonist / Philosophical Opponent / Force of Nature. **Personality**: Implacable, neither cruel nor kind, embodies inevitability, respects those who face him with courage. **Flaw/Secret**: Sisyphus once chained him; death can be bound or delayed but never defeated; might respect players enough to grant delays if they prove worthy.

### Key Locations

- **The River Styx**: Boundary between life and death. Charon ferries souls across. Water contains power to make unbreakable oaths. Dark, misty, endless. The first major obstacle. Those without coin wait on shores eternally.

- **The Asphodel Meadows**: Where average souls spend eternity. Gray, colorless, endless tedium. Not punishment, not reward - just existence. Most souls end up here. Shows that the Greek afterlife is mostly boring, which might be worse than torment.

- **Elysium (The Elysian Fields)**: Paradise for heroes and the virtuous. Beautiful meadows, perfect weather, games and feasts eternal. Players visit to understand what they're fighting for. But even paradise has politics and problems.

- **Tartarus**: The deepest pit, prison for the wicked and titans. Home to eternal punishment - Sisyphus with his boulder, Tantalus eternally hungry and thirsty, Ixion on his wheel. Horror and torment. Players must venture here for a key item or information.

- **The Palace of Hades**: Where Hades and Persephone rule. Grand, dark, beautiful in a somber way. The throne room where final judgment occurs. Cerberus guards the entrance.

- **The River Lethe**: Waters of forgetfulness. Souls drink to forget their lives before reincarnation. Contains power and danger. Remembering vs. forgetting is a key choice.

- **The Phlegethon**: River of fire separating regions. Must be crossed to reach Tartarus. Painful but necessary passage.

- **The Fields of Punishment**: Where those who wronged the gods suffer eternal torment. Not as deep as Tartarus but still horrific. Shows divine cruelty and justice intermingled.

### Central Conflict
The players must navigate underworld politics and geography to petition for resurrection. However, they discover the cosmos's balance is delicate - resurrection is rare because it disrupts the natural order. They must prove their case is exceptional while dealing with the reality that everyone believes their death was unjust or premature. The central tension is between accepting death with dignity (the Greek ideal) and fighting for another chance at life (the heroic impulse). Meanwhile, something threatens the underworld's stability - souls escaping, rivers changing course, the judges disagreeing. Players must solve this crisis to prove they deserve resurrection.

### Unique Mechanics

- **The Five Rivers**: Each river crossed grants powers or curses. Styx (oath power), Acheron (sorrow resistance), Lethe (memory loss/gain), Phlegethon (fire resistance), Cocytus (cold resistance). Creates strategic choices about which to cross and when.

- **Obol Currency**: The dead use coins (obols) as currency. Players must earn or find coins to pay passage, bribe officials, or buy goods. Creates economy and resource management in the afterlife.

- **Favor of the Gods**: Track reputation with various Olympians. Some want players resurrected, others oppose it. Divine favor affects judgment and opens opportunities. Must balance competing divine interests.

- **Memory vs. Forgetfulness**: Proximity to Lethe causes memory degradation. Players must choose what to remember and what to forget. Some puzzles require forgetting, others require remembering. Creates psychological gameplay.

- **Heroic Echoes**: Players can invoke their past heroic deeds (from life) to impress NPCs or gain advantages. But using them exhausts the memory. Heroism is finite resource in death.

- **The Judges' Tests**: Each judge administers different tests - Minos tests leadership, Rhadamanthus tests justice, Aeacus tests piety. Must pass at least two of three to petition Hades directly.

### Plot Twists and Complications

- **Persephone's Absence**: Campaign begins during Persephone's time in the mortal world. Hades is more rigid, colder, less likely to grant mercy. Her return midway changes everything, providing opportunity.

- **Sisyphus's Deal**: He offers to teach players how he cheated death twice, but accepting his help means cursing themselves if they fail - they'll share his punishment. Tempting shortcut with terrible cost.

- **The Escaped Souls**: The threat to the underworld is that heroic souls are escaping back to life. Sounds positive until revealed they're possessing living people, causing chaos. Players might be suspected of being part of this conspiracy.

- **Orpheus's Test**: The legendary bard offers to help but only if players can succeed at his failed task - retrieve someone from death without looking back. Shows that even those who've done it before can't always help.

- **The Judges Disagree**: The three judges reach different verdicts about the players. This creates political complexity - they must convince at least two, meaning someone will oppose them.

- **Hades's Offer**: Instead of resurrection, Hades offers to make them permanent residents with positions of authority. Eternal comfort vs. mortal struggle. Some players might accept while others refuse, splitting the party.

- **The Lethe Temptation**: Drinking from Lethe and forgetting their mortal lives would end their suffering and allow peaceful existence. But they'd forget why they wanted to live. The ultimate acceptance vs. fighting question.

- **Furies' Interest**: The Erinyes (Furies) believe the players escaped justice in life. They pursue relentlessly, forcing players to face whether they truly deserve resurrection.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players solve the escaped souls crisis, prove their worth to all three judges, gain Hades's rare permission for resurrection, and return to life with divine favor and a noble quest to complete. They've earned their second chance.

**Partial Victory**: Hades grants resurrection but with conditions - a quest must be completed, a price must be paid (sacrifice something precious), or only some party members can return. Bittersweet success.

**Elysium Ending**: Players accept death but earn placement in Elysium rather than the Meadows. They live in paradise eternally, finding peace rather than fighting for impossible resurrection. Noble acceptance of mortality.

**Defeat**: The judges find players unworthy. Condemned to the Asphodel Meadows (if neutral) or Fields of Punishment (if they behaved badly in the underworld). They remain dead, aware they failed, suffering Greek afterlife tedium or torment.

**Heroic Sacrifice**: Players solve the crisis threatening the underworld but die permanently in the process. They become legendary figures remembered in both realms. Death has ultimate meaning - they saved death itself.

**The Lethe Choice**: Players drink from Lethe willingly, forgetting their mortal lives and their quest. They exist peacefully in the underworld, free from the pain of loss and desire. Not defeat, not victory - acceptance through forgetting.
