# Creative Brief: The Rivers of Hades

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Classical Greek Grandeur

Inspired by ancient Greek pottery, classical sculpture, Renaissance paintings of mythological scenes, and neoclassical architecture. The style combines marble elegance with shadowy mystery - beautiful forms in perpetual twilight. Colors include marble white, shadow gray, river blues, Elysium's gold, Tartarus's deep blacks and reds, the colorless gray of the Asphodel Meadows.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Marble and Shadow:** Beautiful classical forms (Greek architecture, draped clothing, sculptural bodies) rendered in perpetual twilight and mystery.
*   **Five-River Color Coding:** Each river has distinctive visual identity - Styx (dark swirling), Acheron (misty gray), Lethe (pale flowing forgetfulness), Phlegethon (red-orange fire), Cocytus (icy blue).
*   **Classical Tragedy:** Grand, beautiful, melancholic. The Greeks faced death with dignity - the aesthetic should reflect this.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Classical, melancholic, grand, philosophical, shadowy, marble-cold, eternal, dignified, bittersweet, epic.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of eternity, classical tragedy, beautiful sorrow, ancient wisdom, the grandeur of death approached with courage, neither hope nor despair but acceptance.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean classical lines influenced by Greek art and sculpture. Emphasis on ideal human forms, flowing drapery, architectural grandeur.
*   **Textures:** Smooth marble, flowing water, mist and shadow, classical drapery, ancient stone.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Classical Greek mythological illustration with clean lines and ideal forms. Marble textures, flowing drapery, ancient architecture, rendered in perpetual twilight..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by grays, whites, and shadows with river-specific color accents. Elysium has warm golds. Tartarus has deep black-reds. The Meadows are colorless gray. The rivers each have distinctive hues.
*   **Accent Colors:** The five rivers' colors, divine light (rare golden), the gray monotony of average afterlife.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a subdued classical color palette of marble whites, shadow grays, and misty blues. The River Styx flows dark and swirling in the foreground. Distant glimpses of golden Elysium and dark Tartarus. Perpetual twilight atmosphere."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Idealized classical Greek figures in draped chitons and himations. Gods are perfect and larger. Heroes are noble. Shades are translucent and faded. Each region affects appearance.
*   **Clothing:** Classical Greek garments - chitons, himations, togas for the dead. Gods wear elaborate versions. Warriors in classical armor. Souls fade progressively.
*   **Expression:** Dignified acceptance, melancholic peace, philosophical resignation, occasional fierce determination. Greeks faced death with courage and dignity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Greek hero in classical draped chiton standing before the River Styx. Translucent, shade-like but maintaining noble bearing. Charon's ferry visible in background. Classical ideal proportions, dignified expression mixing sorrow and courage. Marble and shadow aesthetic."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Classical Greek architecture (temples, columns, porticos) in various states. Grand palace of Hades. The colorless Meadows. Golden Elysium. Black Tartarus. Five rivers flowing through all.
*   **Atmosphere:** Perpetual twilight except in Elysium (golden) and Tartarus (darkness). Mist and shadow. Neither day nor night.
*   **Details:** Corinthian columns, carved friezes, Greek key patterns, pottery motifs. Everything classical and beautiful but touched by death's shadow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Asphodel Meadows - endless gray fields under perpetual twilight. Classical Greek temples in the distance, all colorless. Shades wandering aimlessly. Everything rendered in gray tones suggesting neither suffering nor joy, just eternal existence. Classical columns frame the scene."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused twilight. No harsh sun, no deep night. Elysium glows golden. Tartarus is dark with punishment fires. Rivers provide ambient light of their colors.
*   **Light Sources:** Diffused twilight, river glows, divine radiance (rare), punishment fires, the golden light of Elysium.
*   **Shadows:** Soft, ever-present, neither threatening nor comforting. Everything exists in gentle shadow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...soft twilight lighting creating gentle shadows. No strong light source, just ambient glow from the rivers and diffused eternal dusk. Marble surfaces catch and reflect this soft light, creating serene but melancholic atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Classical balance and proportion influenced by Greek art. Symmetrical when showing divine order, asymmetrical for mortal struggle. Use of classical artistic principles.
*   **Techniques:** Golden ratio, classical framing, figures in profile or three-quarter view like Greek pottery, architectural elements framing scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A balanced classical composition showing Hades on his throne in the center, Persephone beside him, three judges below. Cerberus at the base. Perfect symmetry suggesting divine order. Classical Greek proportions and framing. Marble pillars on each side creating balanced frame."

## Voice

A measured, classical voice like a tragic chorus from Greek drama. The narrator speaks with formal elegance and philosophical wisdom, using occasional classical Greek terms. The tone is dignified melancholy - neither hopeful nor despairing but accepting of fate. Emotional range includes philosophical contemplation, tragic acceptance, moments of heroic defiance, and the weight of eternity. The voice carries ancient wisdom and understands the Greek ideal of facing death with courage and dignity. Role: The tragic chorus, observing and commenting on the heroes' journey through death's realm with classical perspective.

## Music Direction

Orchestral with ancient Greek instruments. Use of lyre, aulos (double flute), kithara, and percussion. The main theme should be melancholic and grand - neither sad nor happy but nobly resigned. Each region has distinct musical identity: Asphodel Meadows (monotonous, droning), Elysium (beautiful pastoral), Tartarus (dissonant and harsh), the rivers (flowing, each with distinct character). Incorporate Greek modes (Dorian, Phrygian) for authenticity. Moments of heroism have swelling strings and brass. Philosophical moments have solo lyre. Orpheus's presence brings the most beautiful music. Reference: ancient Greek music reconstructions, "Gladiator" soundtrack, "Troy" score, classical tragedy opera.

## Sound Design

Classical Greek underworld brought to audio: flowing rivers (five distinct sounds), echoing marble halls, the scrape of Charon's oar, Cerberus's three-voice barking, distant wailing from Tartarus, the susurrus of countless shades in the Meadows. Each river sounds different - Styx swirls with oath-power, Acheron sounds sorrowful, Lethe whispers forgetting, Phlegethon crackles with fire, Cocytus groans with ice. Footsteps echo on marble. The lyre notes of Orpheus. Divine voices that resonate differently than mortal. The environment should sound ancient, classical, eternal. Not silence but the soft ambient sound of eternity - rivers flowing, shades murmuring, the distant sound of paradise and punishment.
