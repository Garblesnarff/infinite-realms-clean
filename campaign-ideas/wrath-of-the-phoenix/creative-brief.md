# Creative Brief: Wrath of the Phoenix

Art Style: Historical Chinese Fantasy with War Brutality. Inspired by Chinese historical military art, shamanic imagery, and unflinching depictions of war. Rich traditional aesthetics corrupted by violence and divine madness.

**Color Palette:** Imperial reds and golds (before corruption), ash gray and blood red (during war), phoenix fire orange/gold, opium smoke purple, divine madness colors shifting unnaturally.

**Character Design:** Students in academy uniforms transitioning to war-torn soldiers, shamans with god-touched features (eyes aflame for Phoenix shamans, scaled skin for Dragon, etc.), Federation enemies in gas masks and utilitarian military gear representing industrial horror.

**Backgrounds:** Ornate Chinese palaces and academies, devastated war zones, poppy fields, shamanic meditation chambers, battlefields where divine fire has melted reality itself.

**Mood:** Brutal, unforgiving, beautiful culture destroyed by war, shamanic power as both salvation and damnation, the descent from student to monster.

Voice: A military chronicler's voice, matter-of-fact about atrocities because they've seen too much. Measured pacing that can snap to horror or action. Emotion shows buried trauma, the weight of what was done in the name of survival. Role: The survivor recording what must not be forgotten, no matter how terrible.
