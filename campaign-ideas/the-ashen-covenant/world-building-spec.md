### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Ashen Covenant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the fading Kingdom of Lothria, where the First Flame dims and the Undead Curse spreads, the party awakens as Undead—branded with the Darksign and unable to die permanently. They must ring the Bells of Awakening, gather Lord Souls from tragic beings, and decide whether to Link the Fire to preserve the Age of Light or let it fade into the Age of Dark. Each death brings them closer to Hollowing unless they find meaning in their cursed existence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Age of Ancients, when immortal dragons ruled and the world was gray and unchanging.
    *   Write the history of Gwyn's discovery of the First Flame and the birth of Light, Dark, Life, and Death.
    *   Describe the War with the Dragons and how Gwyn established the Age of Fire.
    *   Explain how the First Flame began to fade and the Undead Curse appeared.
    *   Detail previous "Chosen Undead" who linked the fire and the cyclical nature of the prophecy.
