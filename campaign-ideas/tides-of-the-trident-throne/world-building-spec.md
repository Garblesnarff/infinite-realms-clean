**Scylla the Many**: Multiple heads, each different magic type, most cunning

### Kraken Forces
- Lesser krakens (kaiju-size creatures)
- Sahuagin armies (corrupted by Kraken Lords)
- Deep sea aberrations
- Controlled leviathans

## Factions and Politics

### Reformist Coalition (Pro-Democracy)

- Wants to abolish monarchy, create elected council
- Sees assassination as opportunity for change

### Traditionalist Bloc (Pro-Monarchy)
- Led by Atlantis loyalists
- Supported by Dragonborn, some Tritons
- Princess Naia as rightful heir
- Maintain status quo with reforms

### Militarist Faction (Pro-Conquest)
- Led by Duke Kaelan and Typhon's Gate
- Some Dragonborn support
- Unify by force under military rule
- "Strength is only language everyone understands"

### Isolationists (Withdrawal)
- Led by Sea Elves

- Cannot be stolen, only claimed by worthy or given freely

### Worthiness Criteria (Options)
- Pure of heart (Princess Naia route)
- Strongest warrior (Duke Kaelan route)
- Most intelligent (Sage route)
- Chosen by kingdoms (Party mediates vote)
- Party member proves worthy (Player as ruler)

## Surface World Threat

### United Surface Kingdoms
**Motivation**: Ocean kingdoms appear weak, opportunity for expansion
**Forces**: 200 warships, 100,000 marines
**Leader**: Admiral Grimfin (sympathetic, can be negotiated with)
**Technology**: Surface ships, arcane cannons, anti-water magic

**Diplomacy Options**:
- Prove ocean kingdoms united and strong (deters invasion)
- Ally with surface against Kraken Lords (temporary alliance)
- Defeat surface fleet (creates lasting enmity)
- Negotiate treaty (requires strong position)

## Environmental Mechanics

### Ocean Health System
- Kingdoms' political stability affects ocean environment

- Peace = thriving ecosystem, magical bounty
- Party can see direct consequences of their diplomatic failures

### The Coral Blight
- Mysterious disease killing Corallia's reefs
- Investigation reveals: Aboleth bio-weapon
- Cure requires cooperation from multiple kingdoms
- If uncured: Merfolk kingdom collapses, refugees flood others

## Causality Chains

### Assassination Conspiracy
1. Deep Sage wants Kraken Lords freed (promised power as reward)
2. Needs kingdoms weakened and divided
3. Manipulates extremists in multiple kingdoms
4. Provides poison to Twilight Reaches assassin
5. Assassin kills Thalassor during public summit
6. Kingdoms immediately suspect each other
7. While they fight, prison weakens

3. Ancient threat forces cooperation
4. Old prejudices challenged by necessity
5. Heroes from each kingdom work together
6. Success against Krakens proves unity works
7. New government structure reflects cooperation
8. Ocean enters new golden age or fragments again based on choices
