**Rivers of London**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** London Metropolitan Police officers are recruited into The Folly—Britain's last official wizarding institution—to investigate supernatural crimes. They learn Newtonian magic while navigating river god politics, genius loci, and rogue practitioners. A conspiracy involving the Faceless Man threatens to weaponize London's architecture and kill millions. Magic follows scientific laws, and the city itself has memory.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail The Folly's founding as Britain's official magical institution and its near-destruction in WWII.
    *   Write the history of magical practitioners in Britain from pre-Roman times through modern day.
    *   Describe the conflict between Father Thames (traditional river god) and Mother Thames (modern goddess with many children).
    *   Explain the existence of genius loci—how places develop sentience and personality through human interaction.
    *   Detail the German magical corps' attack in WWII that killed almost all British practitioners.
    *   Describe the different magical traditions: Isaac Newton's scientific approach vs. older folkloric methods.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Magic is used near technology → **THEN:** Electronics fail proportional to magical power expended.
*   **IF:** A river is polluted or disrespected → **THEN:** The river god withdraws blessing, supernatural consequences follow.
*   **IF:** Architectural magic is improperly contained → **THEN:** Building becomes dangerous, may develop malevolent genius loci.
*   **IF:** The Faceless Man's plan succeeds → **THEN:** London's genius loci fully manifests, millions die, reality reshapes.
*   **IF:** Father Thames and Mother Thames go to war → **THEN:** London's waterways become battleground, flooding and supernatural chaos.
