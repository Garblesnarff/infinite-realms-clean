## Causality Chains and Galactic Conflicts

### The Fragmentation Wars (350-300 Years Ago)

**Causes**
- Old Republic collapsed (corruption, overextension)
- No central authority
- Warlords seized systems
- Economic collapse, trade routes severed
- Refugee crisis, mass starvation

**Key Players**
- Dozens of warlord factions
- Corporate states (profit from chaos)
- Pirate kingdoms
- Religious movements
- Tyrannus (minor warlord initially)

**Tyrannus's Rise**
- United several factions through military genius
- Offered stability vs. chaos
- Genuine improvement at first
- Consolidated power over 50 years
- Declared himself Emperor
- Those who resisted were crushed

**Legacy**
- Galaxy remembers chaos, fears return
- Empire's propaganda uses this
- Older generation supports Empire (they remember)
- Younger generation resents it (they don't)

### The Technological Arms Race

**Pre-Empire Technology**
- Standard: lasers, shields, hyperdrives
- FTL communication limited
- Weapons destructive but not planet-killing

**Imperial Innovation**
- Apocalypse Cannons (system destroyers)
- Advanced surveillance
- Thought-crime prediction algorithms
- Life extension for Emperor

**Rebellion Innovation**
- Can't match Empire tech-for-tech
- Instead: tactics, improvisation, morale
- Ghost Fleet provides temporary advantage
- Syndicate black market tech

**Extra-Galactic Threat** (Foreshadowed)
- Tyrannus knows something
- Apocalypse Cannons originally defensive
- Threat from beyond galaxy
- Empire's tyranny partially justified (barely)

### The Prophecy of Starfire

**Origin**
- Ancient text from unknown civilization
- Discovered 500 years ago
- Predicts "Starfire" liberator

**Prophecy Text**
*"When stars are extinguished and hope fades to ember,*
*The Starfire shall rise from the ashes of the fallen,*
*Neither one nor many, but light itself made manifest,*
*To kindle rebellion in hearts long darkened,*
*And burn away the shadows of tyranny."*

**Interpretations**
- **Literalists**: Specific person will be chosen
- **Metaphorists**: Symbol, not individual
- **Skeptics**: Coincidence, seeing patterns
- **Rebellion**: Propaganda tool, true or not

**Campaign Use**
- People think party member is Starfire
- Alternatively, entire party collectively
- Or symbol they represent
- Prophecy self-fulfilling through belief

### Key Historical Events Referenced
