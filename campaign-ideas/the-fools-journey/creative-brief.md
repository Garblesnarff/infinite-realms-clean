### Character Design Direction
- Party members physically transform as they journey
- Early game: Simple, "default" fantasy appearances
- Mid game: Mix of archetypal features from multiple realms
- Late game: Increasingly abstract, iconic, symbolic
- Reversed corruption shows as shadowy distortions and cracked appearance
- Memory fragments appear as ghost-like echoes of original forms

### Environmental Art Notes
- Transitions between realms should feel like walking through a tarot card
- Architecture becomes more metaphorical and less literal as Journey progresses
- Heavy use of symbolic motifs from traditional tarot
- Each realm's sky reflects its nature (The Fool has dawn, The Moon has twilight, etc.)
- Paths made of light, cards, or pure symbolism

## Music and Sound Design

### Overall Audio Aesthetic
- Orchestral foundation with electronic/synth elements for reality-warping
- Leitmotifs for each Major Arcana that evolve and combine
