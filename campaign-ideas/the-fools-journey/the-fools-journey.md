# The Fool's Journey
## "Step into the Unknown, Become Everything"

### Campaign Overview

The multiverse has fractured into twenty-two separate reality-planes, each one a living manifestation of the Major Arcana. The party awakens in the Realm of the Fool - a world of endless cliffs, floating platforms, and impossible leaps where gravity itself is a suggestion and death merely a lesson. They have no memories of who they were before, only a shared Dream of the World card - the final realm where all souls achieve completion and enlightenment.

But the journey through the Arcana is not meant to be traveled by mortals. Each realm fundamentally changes those who enter it, imprinting its archetypal energy upon their souls. The Fool makes them naive and reckless. The Magician grants them power but fills them with hubris. The High Priestess drowns them in secrets they cannot share. To reach the World, they must survive twenty-one transformations without losing themselves entirely.

A mysterious entity known as the Reversed One hunts those who attempt the Journey, corrupting the realms into their shadow aspects. The Tower becomes an eternal prison of paranoia. The Sun turns into burning madness. Death becomes undeath. The party must navigate both the upright and reversed aspects of each Arcana, making choices that determine not just their survival, but what kind of beings they will become when - if - they reach the World.

### Core Themes

- **Personal Transformation**: Each realm fundamentally changes who the party is
- **Journey as Destination**: The process of growth matters more than the goal
- **Duality and Balance**: Every archetype has light and shadow aspects
- **Loss of Self vs. Finding Self**: How much can you change before you're no longer you?
- **Fate and Free Will**: Are they walking a destined path or making their own?
- **The Hero's Journey**: Classic monomyth through archetypal realms
