### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Adventure, freedom, treasure, camaraderie, dreams, tropical, legendary, outrageous, emotional, boundless
*   **Feeling:** The thrill of adventure and discovery mixed with deep bonds of friendship. A world of endless possibility where dreams come true through determination and loyalty. Both lighthearted comedy and heart-wrenching tragedy.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Bold, confident linework with exaggerated proportions and distinctive character silhouettes. Clean action lines with cartoonish expressiveness.
*   **Forms:** Characters range from realistically proportioned to wildly exaggerated (extremely tall, muscular, thin, or round). Ships are grand and ornate with unique figureheads. Islands have impossible geography.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vibrant anime-style digital painting of a pirate crew on their ship's deck. The captain stands at the bow with arms spread wide, wearing a signature straw hat and red vest. Behind them, crew members of wildly different proportions—one extremely tall, one short and round—strike dynamic poses. Bold linework defines each character's unique silhouette."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Highly saturated tropical colors—azure blues, golden sunshine, lush greens, vibrant reds and oranges
*   **Ocean Themes:** Deep blue seas, white foam on waves, golden sunsets, storm clouds with purple and gray
*   **Character Schemes:** Each character has signature color schemes that become iconic (straw hat + red vest + blue shorts, green hair + white shirt, orange hair + blue tattoo)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant tropical color palette with deep azure seas and golden sunlight. The ship's red sails billow in the wind. Characters wear their signature colors—the captain in red and blue, the swordsman in green and white, the navigator in orange and blue. Puffy white clouds dot a brilliant blue sky."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Highly distinctive designs with exaggerated features that make each character instantly recognizable from silhouette alone
*   **Pirate Aesthetic:** Mix of classic pirate elements (bandanas, eye patches, boots, tattoos) with unique personal flair
*   **Devil Fruit Users:** Visual indicators of powers (stretchy limbs, elemental auras, animal features, weapon transformations)
*   **Body Language:** Extremely expressive with exaggerated reactions—crying rivers, fire eyes when angry, stars in eyes when amazed
*   **Prompt Example:** "A flamboyant pirate captain with a lean build and theatrical pose. Their body is made of rubber, one arm stretched impossibly long toward treasure. They wear a straw hat with red ribbon, open red vest showing a scar, blue cropped pants, and sandals. Wide grin with exaggerated joy. Behind them, crew members with equally distinctive designs—a muscular swordsman with green hair and three swords, a navigator with orange hair and a bo staff."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Islands with dramatic, impossible geography—massive mountains growing from tiny islands, forests of enormous trees, cities built on giants' backs
*   **Nautical Elements:** Ships of all designs from tiny dinghies to floating fortresses, weathered docks, treasure chests, naval bases
*   **Cultural Diversity:** Each island has distinct architecture—desert kingdoms with domed palaces, winter islands with mountain villages, sky islands with cloud architecture
*   **Details:** Jolly roger flags, treasure maps, barrels, rope rigging, wooden ship decks, compass roses, sea creatures
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tropical island with impossible geography—a massive mountain shaped like a fist erupts from the center, surrounded by lush jungle and white sand beaches. In the harbor, a magnificent pirate ship with a lion figurehead and skull-and-crossbones flag floats among smaller vessels. The azure sea stretches to the horizon where more islands dot the distance."

**6. Devil Fruit Powers and Combat:**
*   **Style:** Powers visualized with bold, impossible effects—stretching limbs that wrap around buildings, bodies turning into living fire, weapons materializing from thin air
*   **Elemental Displays:** Logia users become their element (living fire, ice, light, smoke) with particles and energy trailing
*   **Creative Applications:** Characters use powers in creative, unexpected ways that defy logic but feel earned
*   **Impact Moments:** Powerful attacks create exaggerated destruction—shockwaves level buildings, punches create craters, slashes cut mountains
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pirate with glowing fists pulls back for a punch, their arms coated in black Armament Haki with red lightning crackling around them. Their rubber body is stretched back impossibly far. The opponent's eyes widen in shock. Impact frame shows the punch connecting with explosive force—shockwaves radiating outward, the ground cracking beneath them, debris flying."

**7. Ships and Naval Combat:**
*   **Style:** Ships with personality and character, each design unique and expressive with figureheads that match crew personality
*   **Scale:** Vessels range from tiny one-person boats to massive warships with dozens of cannons
*   **Naval Battles:** Ships maneuvering dramatically with waves crashing, cannons firing, crew members swinging between vessels
*   **Damage and Repair:** Ships show battle damage—splintered wood, torn sails, but held together through will and skill
*   **Prompt Example:** "A magnificent pirate ship with a lion figurehead and red sails cuts through massive waves. The ship's hull is weather-worn but proud, showing battle scars. Crew members work the rigging as cannons fire at an enemy vessel. The captain stands at the helm, steering into a massive wave with a grin. Behind them, the setting sun paints everything gold and orange."

**8. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Bold cel-shading with strong value contrasts. Dramatic lighting from sun, fire, or explosions
*   **Tropical Atmosphere:** Bright sunshine creates strong shadows, golden hour lighting, moonlit seas with reflected light
*   **Dramatic Moments:** Backlighting for heroic poses, rim lighting on characters against storm clouds, lens flare effects
*   **Purpose:** Create mood shifts from lighthearted adventure to epic confrontation to emotional catharsis
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically backlit by the golden sunset. Strong cel-shaded style with deep shadows on characters' faces showing determination. The ocean reflects the orange and pink sky. Spray from waves catches the light like diamonds. The captain stands in silhouette at the bow, hat brim shadowing their eyes, with only their smile visible."

**9. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide cinematic shots emphasizing the vastness of the sea and sky, dynamic angles showing movement and scale
*   **Techniques:** Low angles to make characters look heroic, high angles for vast naval battles, Dutch angles for chaos, centered compositions for iconic moments
*   **Crew Dynamics:** Group shots that show relationships through positioning—captain in front, crew fanned behind or side-by-side facing adversity
*   **Horizon Focus:** Many compositions emphasize the distant horizon as a symbol of adventure and dreams
*   **Prompt Example:** "Ultra-wide cinematic shot from a low angle. The pirate crew stands on their ship's bow facing an enormous enemy fleet on the horizon. The crew is arranged with their captain at the center-front, arms crossed confidently. Each crew member strikes their signature pose. Their jolly roger flag flies proudly above. The vast azure sea stretches between them and their enemies. The sky is dramatic with storm clouds parting to show sunlight—representing hope against impossible odds."

## Voice

An enthusiastic, adventurous voice full of boundless energy and optimism, like a young dreamer who believes anything is possible. The pacing varies wildly—fast and excited during adventure moments, slow and emotional during heartfelt scenes, building to triumphant crescendos during victories. The tone shifts from goofy comedy to determined battle cries to tearful declarations of friendship. There's an underlying theme of never giving up on your dreams and protecting your crew no matter what. Slightly hoarse from shouting at the sea. Role: The voice of adventure itself—the call of the open ocean and the promise of freedom.
