### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In a world dominated by vast seas and scattered islands, pirate crews sail the treacherous Grand Line seeking the One Treasure left by the previous Pirate King.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

    *   Write the history of the previous Pirate King, Gold Roger, and how his execution started the Great Pirate Era.
    *   Describe the origin of Devil Fruits—mysterious fruits that grant powers and why they make users unable to swim.
    *   Explain the World Government's formation and how they maintain control through the Navy, Warlords, and Cipher Pol.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A party member consumes a Devil Fruit.
    *   **THEN:** They permanently lose ability to swim (auto-fail swim checks, sink in water, helpless if submerged). Generate scene of them discovering their new power and its creative applications. NPCs react based on fruit type—fear Logia users, respect rare Mythical Zoans.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats a Warlord or major villain.
    *   **THEN:** Their bounties increase dramatically. Generate wanted posters with new amounts. Navy dispatches stronger forces. Rival pirates seek alliance or combat. Public opinion shifts—some see them as heroes, others as dangerous criminals.
    *   **IF:** The party participates in the Summit War.
    *   **THEN:** Major world-state changes occur: Navy relocates headquarters, an Emperor dies, power vacuum creates chaos, party gains legendary reputation. Time skip option offered for training arc.
    *   **IF:** The party acquires a Road Poneglyph.
    *   **THEN:** Emperors target the party directly. Generate confrontation with Emperor or their commanders. Navy intelligence tracks party movements. Other crews seek to steal the Poneglyph copy.
    *   **IF:** A party member learns advanced Haki.
    *   **THEN:** They can now damage Logia users, sense attacks in advance, or dominate weak-willed foes. Generate training montage scene with legendary master. NPCs recognize them as Emperor-level threat.
    *   **IF:** The party's ship is destroyed.
    *   **THEN:** Generate emotional scene of mourning—ship was a crew member. Must commission new vessel, potentially recruiting legendary shipwright. Can incorporate upgrades but lose sentimental connection.
    *   **IF:** The party attacks a Celestial Dragon (World Noble).
    *   **THEN:** An Admiral arrives within one session to capture them. Generate immediate evacuation scenario. Bounties skyrocket. Some applaud their courage; Navy marks them for execution priority.
    *   **IF:** The party reaches Laugh Tale and discovers the One Treasure.
    *   **THEN:** Generate revelation of world's true history and Joy Boy's message. Each crew member's dream comes true in the aftermath. Final choice: reveal truth to world (causing revolution) or keep secret (personal freedom). Epilogue shows new era beginning.
