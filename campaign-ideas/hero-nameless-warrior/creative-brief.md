# Creative Brief: Hero: The Nameless Warrior

## Art Style: Color-Coded Stylized Realism (Zhang Yimou-inspired)

Breathtaking visual poetry with each narrative layer having its own color palette. Emphasizes massive scale, symmetry, and the beauty of martial arts as dance.

### Core Principles:
*   **Color Symbolism:** Red=passion/deception, Blue=melancholy/deeper truth, White=purity/ultimate truth, Black=authority/Qin.
*   **Massive Scale:** Hundreds of extras, vast landscapes, overwhelming architecture.
*   **Symmetry & Composition:** Formal, balanced shots emphasizing order vs. chaos.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palettes by Arc:**
*   **Red Story:** Vibrant reds, oranges, yellows. Passionate, energetic, slightly false.
*   **Blue Story:** Deep blues, grays, muted tones. Melancholic, reflective, emotional.
*   **White Story:** Whites, silvers, pale colors. Pure, stark, revealing truth.
*   **Palace Scenes:** Black, gold, deep reds of imperial authority.

**Character Design:**
*   Flowing robes in arc-specific colors.
*   Weapons as art objects—elaborately designed but deadly.
*   Hair and fabric movement emphasize graceful motion.

**Combat Aesthetics:**
*   Vast numbers of participants in formation.
*   Natural elements involved—leaves falling, water droplets, sand clouds.
*   Slow-motion moments emphasizing philosophy over violence.

## Voice

Measured, philosophical, with the weight of historical importance. Speaking in poetic language about sacrifice, duty, and the cost of peace. Role: The narrative voice reflecting on the stories within stories, or the King's philosophical musings.

## Sound Design

*   Silence used as powerfully as sound.
*   Traditional Chinese orchestra for emotional scenes.
*   The *whoosh* of thousands of arrows, the rustling of fabric, water droplets.
*   Calligraphy brushes on paper synchronized with combat movements.
