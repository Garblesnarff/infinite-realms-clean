9. **Execution**: Raids and arrests
10. **Outcome**: Usually incomplete

### The Stat Game
**Pressure**: Make numbers look good
**Methods**:
- Downgrade crimes (felony to misdemeanor)
- Inflate clearances (wrongful arrests)
- Ignore certain crimes (homeless murders)
- Focus on easy arrests
- "Juking the stats"

**Consequences**:
- Real problems ignored
- Good police frustrated
- Career advancement rewards lying
- Community trust eroded

### Multi-Perspective Structure

**Session Types**:
- **Police Sessions**: Investigation work
- **Street Sessions**: Play dealers, see other side
- **Political Sessions**: City Hall machinations
- **School Sessions**: Watch kids navigate system
- **Dock Sessions**: Working class struggles

**Purpose**: No simple villains, understand all perspectives, see systemic nature of problems

## Character Arcs

### The Hopeful Idealist
Starts wanting to change system. Learns system changes you. Choice: Maintain integrity or succeed in institution.

**Examples**: Carcetti (fails), Daniels (succeeds), Prez (escapes)

### The Corner Kid
Smart, potential, trapped by circumstances. System fails them repeatedly. Some make it out, most don't.

**Examples**: Wallace (killed), D'Angelo (killed), Randy (destroyed), Dukie (lost)

### The Good Police

**Examples**: Freamon (persists), McNulty (burns out), Greggs (survives)

### The Criminal Businessman

**Examples**: Stringer (killed for trying), Prop Joe (killed for trust), Omar (killed randomly)

## The Lessons

1. **"All the pieces matter"**: Details and patience win cases
2. **"The king stay the king"**: System preserves itself
3. **"The game is the game"**: Rules don't change, only players
4. **"Deserve got nothing to do with it"**: Justice is random
5. **"You cannot lose if you do not play"**: But everyone plays
6. **"A man got to have a code"**: Personal integrity in corrupt system

## Ending Notes

This campaign won't have satisfying heroic conclusion. Cases get solved, but problems continue. Good people compromised, bad people replaced. Institutions grind on.

Victory is personal: Maintaining humanity, doing good work, caring when easier not to. The wire goes up, the case gets made, some criminals caught. Then it starts again.

Because the game is the game. Always.

And the pieces? They all matter.
