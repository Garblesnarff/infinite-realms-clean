# Creative Brief: The God's Judgment

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Urban Thriller with Supernatural Elements

Inspired by Death Note's sleek, dramatic aesthetic, this style combines contemporary urban environments with heightened reality—dramatic lighting, intense close-ups on eyes and hands writing, symbolic imagery of justice and death.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Modern Aesthetic:** Contemporary cities, technology, business suits, clean lines.
*   **Dramatic Lighting:** Intense shadows, silhouettes, light vs. dark symbolism.
*   **Close-Ups on Details:** Hands writing in the Ledger, intense eyes, symbolic objects (scales of justice, death imagery).
*   **Supernatural Presence:** Death entities lurking in shadows, otherworldly glow from Ledger.
*   **Symbolism:** Apples (temptation), scales, chess pieces (strategy), light vs. shadow (duality).

## Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**Keywords:** Death Ledger, god complex, cat and mouse, justice, surveillance, intellectual battle, modern urban, supernatural thriller.

**Visual Elements:** Modern city at night with dramatic shadows. Characters in business attire or investigator garb. The Death Ledger as ornate black book with supernatural aura. Death entity as shadowy figure with inhuman features. Intense eye close-ups showing determination/madness. Writing hand illuminated while face in shadow.

**Color Palette:** Dominant blacks and dark grays. Accents of blood red (death, danger), gold (divinity, Kira's "justice"), cold blue (investigation, technology), pure white (highlights, moral clarity or blindness).

**Character Design:** Kira appears perfect—attractive, well-dressed, confident—but with subtle wrongness in eyes (god complex, madness). Investigators appear worn, determined, shadows under eyes. Death entity is impossible to look at directly—shifting form, darkness made solid.

**Composition:** Use strong diagonals and triangular compositions for tension. Frame characters through doorways, surveillance feeds, chess-like arrangements. Emphasize duality—split screens, mirrors, light/shadow contrasts.

## Voice

A measured, intellectual voice with underlying intensity—like a narrator of a psychological thriller. Alternates between calm analysis (explaining strategies) and barely-contained tension (during confrontations). Environmental sounds: pen scratching on paper, heartbeats stopping, keyboard typing, surveillance footage static, the inhuman laughter of the death entity. The voice carries the question: "What is justice—law, or outcome?"
