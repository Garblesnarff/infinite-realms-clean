# The God's Judgment

*A Supernatural Thriller / Cat and Mouse campaign — Medium Campaign (10–13 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The God's Judgment
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Supernatural Thriller / Detective vs. Vigilante / Moral Philosophy / Mind Games
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** God complex, moral ambiguity, cat and mouse, justice vs. law, supernatural artifact, intellectual battle, surveillance, paranoia
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A mysterious artifact called the Death Ledger appears in the city—anyone whose true name is written in it dies of heart failure within 60 seconds. A vigilante calling themselves "Kira" begins using it to execute criminals, creating a cult following who believe Kira is divine judgment. The party, working as investigators or royal inquisitors, must hunt Kira in a battle of wits where one wrong move means death by their own names being written. The campaign explores whether killing criminals creates justice or tyranny, if absolute power corrupts absolutely, and how far investigators will go to stop someone who might be making the world safer—even if they're becoming monsters themselves.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Intellectual Battle:** Victory requires outsmarting Kira through investigation, deduction, and psychological profiling.
*   **Instant Death Threat:** If Kira learns party members' true names, they can die instantly. Anonymity is survival.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Kira is killing criminals—is that wrong? The world IS becoming safer. Are the party heroes or obstacles to justice?
*   **Paranoia & Surveillance:** Trust no one. Anyone could be Kira. The party may be monitored.
*   **No Combat Solution:** Kira has moderate combat ability but that's irrelevant—the Death Ledger is the real weapon.
*   **Escalation:** As the hunt progresses, both sides use increasingly extreme methods. The party risks becoming what they hunt.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions)

A progression from investigation through escalation to final confrontation across three acts.

*   **Act I — The God Emerges (Sessions 1–4):** Criminals begin dying of mysterious heart failures. The party investigates, discovering the supernatural artifact. Kira makes public proclamations: criminals will be judged, the world will be cleansed. Public opinion splits—is Kira a hero or a tyrant? The party must work in secret to avoid being killed.
*   **Act II — The Mind Games (Sessions 5–9):** The hunt intensifies. Kira deduces the party is investigating and begins targeting them indirectly. Both sides employ elaborate strategies—fake deaths, misinformation, surveillance, double agents. Moral complexity deepens: Kira kills innocents who oppose them, but crime rates have plummeted. The party may gain their own supernatural ally or artifact.
*   **Act III — The Confrontation (Sessions 10–13):** The final intellectual battle. The party narrows down Kira's identity through brilliant deduction. Kira tries to kill them before being exposed. Multiple endings based on whether the party maintains moral integrity, how they use power, and if they can prove Kira wrong without becoming like them.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Sessions 1-4: **Divine Judgment**
*   Series of criminals die of heart failures—no common cause, seemingly impossible.
*   Pattern discovered: all were criminals, all died at specific times, suggesting single actor.
*   Kira's first message: "I am justice. Criminals will be punished. The world will know fear, and perfection."
*   Party discovers the Death Ledger's existence through arcane/divine investigation.
*   Public reaction: cult of Kira forms; some see them as god, others as murderer.
*   Party must investigate while keeping identities secret—if Kira learns their names, they die.
*   First suspect profiling: Kira has access to criminal records, works during specific hours, likely young and idealistic.

### Sessions 5-9: **Escalation**
*   Party closes in; Kira deduces they're being hunted and begins counter-moves.
*   Kira kills people opposing them—investigators, journalists—claiming they aid criminals.
*   Mind games: Party plants fake investigators to test Kira; Kira predicts this and kills the fakes.
*   Supernatural ally appears: a death god/fey entity that owned the Ledger, now bound to Kira but potentially helpful to party.
*   Kira acquires additional power—second Ledger or eyes that see true names, making them more dangerous.
*   Party must make moral choice: use questionable methods (surveillance on innocents, coercion) or stay clean but disadvantaged.
*   Major twist: Kira transfers the Ledger temporarily to an accomplice, throwing off investigation.

### Sessions 10-13: **Checkmate**
*   Party narrows suspects to final candidates through brilliantly executed plans.
*   Kira and party both set traps for each other simultaneously.
*   Climactic confrontation where Kira's identity is revealed.
*   Multiple endings:
    *   **Legal Justice:** Capture Kira, destroy Ledger, restore rule of law—but world becomes less safe without Kira's deterrent.
    *   **Vigilante Stopped:** Kill Kira to prevent escape; morally gray, proves power corrupts.
    *   **Ledger Temptation:** A party member takes the Ledger "to use it correctly"—becomes new Kira.
    *   **Pyrrhic Victory:** Stop Kira but methods were so extreme the party is prosecuted too.
    *   **Kira Wins:** Kira kills party before being exposed; new world order of fear-based peace.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **justice versus law**. Kira is achieving results—crime has plummeted, the world is objectively safer. But they do so through fear, execution without trial, and killing anyone who opposes them including innocents. The party represents the rule of law: everyone deserves fair trial, killing criminals is murder, power concentrated in one person inevitably corrupts. The campaign questions: is a safe world built on fear better than a dangerous one built on freedom? Does absolute power to punish evil make someone good or evil? Can the party stop Kira without becoming tyrants themselves (surveillance, manipulation, questionable methods)? And most critically: if you could kill evil people with no consequences, should you?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Death Ledger**
*   Writing someone's true name while picturing their face causes death in 60 seconds (heart failure default).
*   Can specify method and time of death with more detail.
*   Each Ledger has rules that can be exploited (e.g., if owner doesn't kill within 13 days, they die).

### 2. **True Name Protection**
*   Party members use aliases and disguises. If Kira learns true names, instant death threat.
*   Track exposure level—has Kira seen your face? Learned your name? Both = death possible.

### 3. **Investigation System**
*   Gather clues through surveillance, profiling, logic, deduction.
*   Success requires player cleverness, not just dice rolls.
*   Kira leaves patterns that can be analyzed—timing, victim selection, methods.

### 4. **Public Opinion Tracker**
*   Track whether public supports Kira or the party.
*   High Kira support makes investigation harder (witnesses won't help, political pressure).
*   Proving Kira kills innocents can shift opinion.

### 5. **The Moral Spectrum**
*   Track party's methods from lawful to tyrannical.
*   Using illegal surveillance, torture, or killing shifts toward tyranny.
*   Affects ending—can only achieve "true justice" ending if party stayed lawful.

### 6. **Mind Games & Gambits**
*   Both sides can execute elaborate plans (fake deaths, double agents, traps).
*   System for planning multi-step strategies and counter-strategies.

### 7. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Justice Restored:** Stop Kira legally, destroy Ledger, maintain integrity—but world less safe.
*   **New Kira:** Party member takes Ledger believing they'll use it better—cycle continues.
*   **Pyrrhic Victory:** Stop Kira through illegal means; party prosecuted; hollow win.
*   **Kira's Victory:** Fail to stop Kira; new world order of fear; tyranny wins.
*   **Mutual Destruction:** Both Kira and party destroy each other; Ledger lost but so is justice.
