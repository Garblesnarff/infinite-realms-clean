# The Consulting Detective
## *"When the impossible is eliminated, whatever remains must be the truth"*

### Campaign Overview

In the fog-shrouded metropolis of Thornhaven, a city of brass and cobblestones where magic and industry intertwine, crime has evolved beyond the mundane. The party serves as elite consulting investigators for the City Watch, called upon when cases prove too bizarre, too dangerous, or too politically sensitive for ordinary constables. Led by a brilliant but eccentric detective (either a PC or prominent NPC), the investigators must solve a series of interconnected mysteries that gradually reveal a grand conspiracy threatening the very foundations of civilization.

What begins as isolated cases—a nobleman's impossible murder in a locked room, a series of thefts from magically-warded vaults, mysterious disappearances in the Undercity—slowly coalesce into a pattern. Someone with intimate knowledge of both arcane arts and criminal methodology is orchestrating events from the shadows. The investigators must use deduction, forensic magic, interrogation, and old-fashioned legwork to unravel the web before the mastermind's ultimate plan comes to fruition. Every clue matters. Every witness may be lying. And the truth, when finally revealed, will shake Thornhaven to its core.

The campaign balances episodic "case-of-the-week" adventures with an overarching mystery arc, allowing for both satisfying one-shot investigations and long-term character development. Players must think critically, gather evidence, and piece together clues rather than simply fighting their way through challenges.

### Major Locations

**221B Brewery Street**
The party's headquarters, a cramped apartment above a tavern in the Theatre District. Features a chemistry lab, extensive library, shooting range in the basement, and Mrs. Hudson as the long-suffering landlady. Crime scene evidence and case files cover every surface.

**Scotland Yard (The Brass Tower)**
Headquarters of the City Watch, a imposing fortress of brass and stone. Contains the evidence vaults, interrogation rooms, City Morgue, and Commissioner's office. Bureaucracy and corruption war with genuine heroism.

**The Diogenes Club**
Exclusive gentlemen's club where speaking is forbidden. Mycroft's base of operations. Houses the most comprehensive intelligence network in the kingdom. Members include industrialists, nobles, and government officials.

**Whitechapel District**
The Undercity slums where the desperate and criminal congregate. Narrow alleys, fog-shrouded streets, and hidden entrances to the underground. Home to both the innocent poor and predatory gangs.

**Thornhaven University**
Gothic campus where Professor Whitmore once taught. Contains laboratories, forbidden libraries, and secret societies. Students and faculty become both victims and suspects.

**The Thornhaven Falls**
Massive waterfall at the city's edge where the river plunges into the chasm. Site of the final confrontation. Beautiful, terrible, and symbolically appropriate.

**The Violet Rose Theatre**
Front for criminal activities and information exchange. Secret passages, hidden compartments, and a stage where everyone performs. Irene Shadowveil's base of operations.

**The Rookery**
Vertical slum built into the city walls. King of Beggars' territory. Interconnected buildings create a three-dimensional maze only locals can navigate.

### Unique Mechanics

**Deduction System**
- Players collect clues (physical evidence, testimony, observations)
- Each clue is a card/token with partial information
- Making connections between clues reveals insights
- Three connected clues = Minor Revelation
- Five connected clues = Major Revelation
- Wrong connections may lead to false conclusions

**Evidence Analysis**
- Physical Evidence: Can be examined with Investigation checks
- Magical Evidence: Requires Arcana or specific detection spells
- Testimonial Evidence: Insight checks to detect lies
- Documentary Evidence: Research and cross-referencing
- Quality of analysis determines information gained

**The Mind Palace**
- Lead detective can enter mental space to organize thoughts
- Allows retcon of earlier observations ("I noticed three sessions ago...")
- Limited uses per arc, represents brilliant deductive leaps
- Risk: Wrong deduction causes mental stress

**Interrogation Mechanics**
- Three approaches: Aggressive (Intimidation), Sympathetic (Persuasion), Analytical (Insight)
- NPCs have preferred approaches and resistance to others
- Building rapport over multiple interactions yields better results
- Catching someone in a lie provides leverage

**Case Board**
- Physical/digital representation of evidence and connections
- Players can reorganize between sessions
- DM can add clues the party missed (representing background investigation)
- Visual aid enhances problem-solving

**Reputation System**
- Success builds fame and access to resources
- Failure damages credibility and closes doors
- Different factions have different opinion scores
- High reputation attracts both allies and enemies

### Plot Twists and Complications

**The Mole**
One of the party's trusted allies is feeding information to Whitmore. Could be Lestrade, Molly, or even Dr. Stoneheart. Reveal happens at the worst possible moment.

**The Justified Villain**
Whitmore's targets genuinely are corrupt monsters. Stopping her means protecting the guilty. Does justice require working within a broken system?

**The Fake Whitmore**
The "professor" they've been chasing is actually a decoy. The real Whitmore has been hiding in plain sight as someone they trust.

**The Bigger Picture**
Whitmore is actually fighting against something worse: a demon cult, elder god worshippers, or dimensional invaders. She's the anti-hero, not the villain.

**Personal Connections**
One PC has a hidden connection to Whitmore: former student, estranged relative, or old colleague. This creates conflict within the party.

**The Impossible Choice**
Final confrontation requires choosing between saving innocent lives and capturing Whitmore. She engineers this specifically to escape.

**The Suicide Mission**
Stopping Whitmore's plan requires someone to sacrifice themselves. Who will take the fall at Thornhaven Falls?

**The System is the Enemy**
Even after defeating Whitmore, the corruption remains. The party must decide whether to work within the system or burn it down themselves.
