# Murder on the Astral Express - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
Art Deco elegance, 1920s-1930s Golden Age aesthetic. Luxury trains, ocean liners, country estates. Rich period detail, sophisticated color palette, glamorous yet ominous.

**Colors**: Art Deco gold, Orient Express blue, vintage sepia, blood red (sparingly), champagne ivory

## Music
Period-appropriate orchestral. Jazz age for social scenes. Tense strings for investigation. Triumphant reveal music. "Poirot Theme" - sophisticated, slightly comical, distinctly Belgian.

## Voice Direction
**Poirot**: Belgian accent, precise diction, slightly affected. Vain but charming. "The little grey cells, they are magnifique!"
**Hastings**: Upper-class British, earnest, romantically inclined
**Suspects**: Various period-appropriate accents based on class and origin
**Murderers**: Shift from composed to shattered when exposed
