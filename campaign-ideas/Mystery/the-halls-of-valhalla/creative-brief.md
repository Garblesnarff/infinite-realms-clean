# Creative Brief: The Halls of Valhalla

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Epic Norse Mythology

Inspired by Viking Age art, Norse sagas, and modern interpretations like God of War and Vikings TV series. The aesthetic combines brutal realism with mythological grandeur - weathered warriors, towering divine architecture, and the constant interplay between mortal grit and cosmic scale. Colors are rich but grounded: gold, blood-red, ice-blue, ash-gray, and the deep green of ancient forests.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Weathered and Battle-Worn:** Everything shows age, use, and combat. Scars, worn leather, notched blades, and time-tested armor.
*   **Monumental Scale:** The Nine Realms are vast. Halls stretch beyond sight, mountains touch the sky, the World Tree dwarfs everything.
*   **Mythic Realism:** Grounded, gritty realism for warriors and equipment, but gods and realms are impossibly magnificent. The contrast creates awe.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, brutal, honorable, apocalyptic, bittersweet, majestic, primal, fate-bound, legendary, eternal.
*   **Feeling:** The glory of combat, the weight of destiny, the beauty of doomed nobility. Every moment is significant. Death approaches but warriors face it with courage. Gold halls shine in darkness. Winter comes.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed, textured realism with emphasis on wear and history. Deep shadows and dramatic lighting. Inspired by historical Viking artifacts and modern epic fantasy.
*   **Textures:** Rough-hewn wood, beaten metal, fur and leather, ancient stone covered in runes, the shimmer of divine power.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Highly detailed Nordic fantasy illustration with weathered textures and dramatic lighting. Battle-worn materials showing history and use, combined with mythological elements of divine grandeur..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, saturated earth tones for mortal elements. Brilliant gold, silver, and divine light for Asgard. Ice blues for frost giants. Ash gray for approaching doom. Blood red for battle.
*   **Accent Colors:** The Bifrost's rainbow shimmer. Yggdrasil's deep green. Fire and ice in eternal opposition. The golden glow of Valhalla's halls.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of rich golds and deep shadows, blood red accents, ice blue highlights, and weathered earth tones. Divine elements shine with otherworldly light against dark, textured backgrounds."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, battle-hardened warriors with historically-inspired Viking gear. Gods are taller, more perfect, radiating power. Each has distinctive visual identity tied to their domain.
*   **Clothing:** Authentic Viking Age equipment - chainmail, layered wool, fur cloaks, iron helms, decorated shields. Gods wear impossibly fine versions with magical elements.
*   **Expression:** Pride, determination, resignation to fate, fierce joy in battle, sorrow for coming doom. Eyes that have seen too much. Scars that tell stories.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Norse warrior in authentic Viking Age gear - chainmail, leather, fur cloak, iron helm with nose guard. Battle-scarred face showing pride and determination. Weathered equipment covered in runes. Holding a notched sword with blood-groove. Standing in Valhalla's golden light."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, imposing landscapes. Valhalla's golden halls are impossibly massive. Yggdrasil towers above all. Mountains, frozen wastes, and battlefields stretch to the horizon.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often overcast or lit by dramatic shafts of light. The approach of Fimbulwinter makes everything gradually darker and colder as the campaign progresses.
*   **Details:** Carved runes, hanging shields, mounted weapons, evidence of age and use. The weight of history visible everywhere.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The interior of Valhalla - a vast hall with golden pillars stretching into darkness above. Shields line the walls, weapons hang ready. Long tables filled with warriors feasting. Smoke from central fires. Carved runes on every surface. The scale is impossible, monumental."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro - deep shadows and brilliant highlights. Light sources are fires, divine radiance, or cold daylight through clouds.
*   **Light Sources:** Torch and firelight dominate interiors. The golden glow of Asgard. The cold light of Nordic sky. The rainbow shimmer of Bifrost. As Ragnarok approaches, light becomes scarcer.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and mysterious, hiding threats and adding drama. Shadows lengthen as doom approaches.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatic lighting with deep shadows and bright highlights. Illuminated by firelight and divine radiance, creating strong contrast and epic atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Heroic, low-angle shots that emphasize scale and power. Dramatic framing that shows both the individual and the vast cosmos beyond.
*   **Techniques:** Use negative space to emphasize isolation or doomed grandeur. Frame warriors against impossible odds. Show the weight of fate through composition.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle heroic composition of einherjar warriors standing before the Bifrost Bridge, silhouetted against the shimmering rainbow light. Behind them, the vast golden halls of Valhalla rise into storm clouds. Their weapons are ready but their posture shows they face inevitable doom with courage."

## Voice

A deep, resonant voice like a skald (Norse bard) telling an epic saga around a fire. The narrator speaks with gravitas and poetry, using alliteration and kennings (poetic metaphors) in the Norse tradition. The tone is respectful of doom and death, finding beauty in tragic heroism. Emotional range includes fierce pride, sorrowful acceptance, grim determination, and occasional dark humor. The voice carries the weight of ages, knowing this tale ends in fire but telling it anyway. Audio quality is warm and intimate despite the epic subject matter. Role: The last survivor of Ragnarok, telling the saga of those who faced the twilight with courage.

## Music Direction

Orchestral Nordic folk with modern cinematic epic elements. Heavy use of tagelharpa (Viking bowed instrument), war horns, drums, and male choirs singing in Norse. The main theme should evoke both glory and doom - triumphant melody with underlying darkness. Battle music is percussion-heavy, primal, with tribal rhythms and warrior chants. Emotional moments use solo instruments (the mournful sound of a single horn). The Bifrost has shimmering, otherworldly tones. Yggdrasil's theme is ancient and vast. As Ragnarok approaches, the music becomes darker, more dissonant, building to apocalyptic crescendo. The final rebirth scene should be quiet, hopeful, and new. Reference: Wardruna, Danheim, God of War (2018) soundtrack, The Last Kingdom score.

## Sound Design

Authentic Viking Age sounds: the ring of steel on steel, crackle of longfires, rustle of chainmail, the heavy thud of shields. The Bifrost hums with rainbow light. Yggdrasil creaks and groans like an ancient forest. Valhalla echoes with distant combat and feasting. As Ragnarok begins: wolf howls, serpent hisses, the crack of breaking chains, the roar of giants, and the final flames consuming the world. Footsteps on wooden floors, snow crunching underfoot, the splash of mead. The environment should feel lived-in, ancient, and increasingly threatened. The sound of doom approaching - ice cracking, distant thunder, the groan of fate itself bending.
