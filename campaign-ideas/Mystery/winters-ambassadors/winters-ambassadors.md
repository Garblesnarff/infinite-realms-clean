**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party arrives as envoys from the Ekumen (a confederation of human worlds) to the frozen planet of Winter, where the ambisexual Gethenians (who shift between male and female during monthly cycles) have built unique cultures isolated from the broader cosmos. Tasked with convincing Winter's feuding nations to join the Ekumen, the party navigates complex political intrigue between the monarchist Karhide and totalitarian Orgoreyn while confronting their own assumptions about gender, loyalty, and what it means to be human. When betrayal forces them to flee across Winter's deadly ice with a Gethenian ally, they discover that first contact is about understanding, not conquest.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Focus on social challenges, political maneuvering, and survival against Winter's environment rather than combat.
*   **Investigation:** Understanding Gethenian culture, navigating political factions, uncovering conspiracies.
*   **Consequences:** Failure means exile, death from cold, or political disaster that closes Winter to contact for generations.

### 2. **Kemmer Cycle**
*   Gethenian NPCs enter monthly mating phase, shifting gender, affecting social dynamics.

### 3. **Cold Survival**
*   Exposure to Winter's climate requires resource management (food, shelter, warmth).
