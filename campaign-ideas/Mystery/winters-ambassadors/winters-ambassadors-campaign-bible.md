# Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Hand That Sowed
In the time before the ice cemented the oceans, the Hainish Progenitors descended not as conquerors, but as gardeners of the genome. They sought to solve the equation of War. Their hypothesis: Permanent gender creates permanent duality—Self and Other, Conqueror and Conquered. They engineered the Gethenian prototype: a humanity locked in androgyne stasis, only manifesting sexuality (Kemmer) for three days a month. But the experiment warped. Without the release of constant duality, the culture turned inward, inventing *Shifgrethor*—a web of pride and shadow so dense it suffocates the truth. The Progenitors left, ashamed or perhaps bored, leaving their children to freeze in the dark, clutching honor like a burning coal.

### Timeline of the Ice
1.  **Year 1 - The Seeding:** The Progenitors deposit 20,000 subjects and depart.
2.  **Year 400 - The Great Cooling:** Atmospheric scrubbers fail; the glaciers advance. The culture shifts from agricultural to survivalist.
3.  **Year 950 - The Invention of Shifgrethor:** First recorded duel fought not with swords, but with implications.
4.  **Year 1,200 - The Silence of the Weavers:** *[Weird/Rare]* A plague of laryngitis sweeps the planet; sign language becomes a sacred art form, later evolving into the "Hand-Speech" of the Assassin Guilds.
5.  **Year 1,800 - The Split:** The Orgota breakaway. They reject the chaotic honor of Karhide for the brutal comfort of bureaucracy.
6.  **Year 2,200 - The Year of the Black Snow:** A volcanic eruption chokes the sky. The Foretellers predict the arrival of "The Star-Children" (The Ekumen). They are executed for heresy.
7.  **Year 2,450 - The Machine-Eaters:** *[Weird/Rare]* A cult in Orgoreyn attempts to eat primitive technology to "internalize the logic." They die, but their philosophy births the secret police’s interrogation methods.
8.  **Year 2,900 - The Border Wars:** Skirmishes over the Sinoth Valley.
9.  **Year 3,001 - The Dream-Leak:** *[Weird/Rare]* A shared psychic event where 10% of the population dreams the exact same dream of a green world. Mass suicides follow.
10. **Year 3,002 (Current) - The Arrival:** The Envoy (Player Party) lands.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The struggle is not Good vs. Evil, but **Shadow vs. Clarity**. The Ekumen represents total clarity (information sharing), which threatens the Gethenian way of life built on *Shifgrethor* (power through ambiguity and withholding).
