# Creative Brief: The Forest Giant

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Pacific Northwest Naturalism

Inspired by the majestic beauty of old-growth forests and cryptozoological documentation, blending realistic wilderness with mythic creature design. This style captures the awe of ancient forests and the mystery of the unknown.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Majesty:** Show massive trees and the giant as part of the natural order.
*   **Blend Mystery and Realism:** The creature should look plausible—ape-like but distinctly different.
*   **Focus on Environmental Beauty:** The forest is a character itself, beautiful and worth protecting.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Mysterious, forest, territorial, elusive, environmental, gentle giant, ancient, protective.
*   **Feeling:** Wonder and respect for the natural world. The sense of being in the presence of something rare and magnificent.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich greens, browns, and earth tones. Dappled sunlight through canopy. Mist and fog creating atmosphere.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of rich forest greens, deep browns, and golden sunlight filtering through a massive redwood canopy. Mist clings to the forest floor, creating an atmosphere of mystery and ancient peace."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Forest Giant:** 10-12 feet tall, covered in reddish-brown or dark brown hair, broad shoulders, long arms, human-like face with intelligent eyes, bipedal stance with slightly stooped posture. Appears as a massive, gentle hominid perfectly adapted to forest life.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive bipedal creature, 11 feet tall, standing among ancient redwood trees. It has reddish-brown hair covering its body, broad shoulders, long arms that reach past its knees, and a face that is almost human but distinctly ape-like. Its eyes are intelligent and watchful. It moves with surprising grace for its size, clearly at home in this forest environment."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Old-growth Pacific Northwest forests—massive trees, fern-covered floors, streams, hidden groves.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hidden grove deep in an old-growth forest. Massive cedars and redwoods tower overhead, their trunks wider than cars. The floor is covered in ferns and moss. Sunlight streams through gaps in the canopy, creating columns of light in the mist. The scene is breathtakingly beautiful and feels timeless."

## Voice

A deep, calm voice with a slight rural Pacific Northwest accent, speaking in measured, thoughtful tones. The pacing is slow and deliberate, showing respect for both nature and the unknown. The emotion is one of wonder mixed with protectiveness. Audio quality is clear with natural forest sounds (birds, wind through trees) in the background. Role: A forest ranger or indigenous elder who knows the old ways and respects the Forest Giant.
