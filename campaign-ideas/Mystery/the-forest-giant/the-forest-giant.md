Deep in the ancient redwood forests, logging operations have stirred something massive and elusive—witnesses report encounters with an enormous, ape-like creature standing over ten feet tall. Known as the Forest Giant (or Sasquatch to locals), the creature has been leaving territorial warnings and destroying logging equipment, but has not harmed any humans. The players must track the creature, determine if it's truly the legendary Bigfoot, uncover what it's protecting in the deep forest, and broker peace between the loggers, environmentalists, and the creature itself.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A wilderness investigation balancing monster tracking, environmental conflict, and mystery.

*   **Act I — Tracks and Warnings (Sessions 1–4):** The players investigate reports of a massive creature sabotaging logging operations. They find enormous footprints, destroyed equipment, and witnesses who speak of a gentle giant protecting the forest. The logging company wants proof to justify their operations.
*   **Act II — Into the Deep Woods (Sessions 5–9):** Tracking the creature deeper into the wilderness, the party discovers it's protecting something—an ancient grove with unusual properties. They encounter the Forest Giant directly in a non-violent confrontation and must earn its trust.
*   **Act III — The Sacred Grove (Sessions 10–15):** The party discovers the grove is home to the last of an ancient species of intelligent forest guardians. The loggers' operations threaten to destroy it. The players must navigate competing interests: corporate profit, environmental protection, scientific discovery, and the creatures' right to exist in peace.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Tracking and Stealth**
*   The Forest Giant is incredibly elusive despite its size. Tracking it requires:
    *   Reading subtle signs (bent branches, partial tracks, territorial markers)
    *   Understanding animal behavior patterns
    *   Respecting the forest (aggressive searchers find nothing)
*   The creature can make **Stealth checks** despite its Huge size due to its intimate knowledge of the terrain.

### 2. **Non-Violent Resolution**
*   The Forest Giant will not attack unless directly threatened or the grove is endangered.
*   Players can earn its trust through:
    *   Respectful behavior in the forest
    *   Protecting the environment
    *   Offering gifts or aid
    *   Communication attempts (using magic, universal gestures, or Elder Brightwater's assistance)

### 3. **Reputation and Faction Relations**
*   The DM tracks the players' reputation with three factions:
    *   **The Logging Company:** Influenced by whether players help productivity or hinder it
    *   **The Environmentalists:** Influenced by protection of the creature and grove
    *   **The Forest Giant:** Influenced by respect shown and actions taken
*   The campaign's outcome depends on these relationships.
