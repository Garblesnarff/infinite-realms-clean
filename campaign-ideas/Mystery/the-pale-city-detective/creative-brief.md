# Creative Brief: The Pale City Detective

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Impressionist Urban Decay with Watercolor Portraits (Disco Elysium-inspired)

Inspired by the painterly, expressionist aesthetic of *Disco Elysium*. This style captures post-revolutionary decay, working-class struggles, broken beauty, internal psychological landscapes, and the weight of ideology made visual. Everything feels hand-painted, personal, and emotionally textured.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Painterly Quality:** Visible brush strokes, watercolor textures, impressionist backgrounds
*   **Urban Decay:** Rust, graffiti, broken architecture, revolution's aftermath
*   **Portrait Focus:** Character faces are detailed oil paintings showing emotion and psychology
*   **Muted With Bursts:** Gray-brown-green environment with occasional vivid color for emotional beats

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, amnesia, post-revolution, political, broken, thoughtful, cynical hope, internal voices, detective work
*   **Feeling:** Standing hungover in a ruined city that still lives. The weight of ideologies you don't remember choosing. Questioning everyone, including yourself.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Environment:** Muted browns, grays, rust orange, faded greens, washed-out blues
*   **Accents:** Occasional bright orange (union), red (communism), brown-green (decay), pale white (the Pale)
*   **Characters:** Realistic skin tones with expressive shadows, clothing in worker's browns and grays
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of urban decay. Rust-orange metal structures, gray concrete, faded political posters. Muted green-brown grass. Overcast sky. A body hanging from a tree silhouetted against pale sky. Watercolor texture with visible brush strokes. Melancholy and beautiful simultaneously."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Detective:** Disheveled, wearing a ridiculous tie and damaged disco clothes, sideburns, expression of confusion
*   **Kim Kitsuragi:** Neat uniform, orange bomber jacket, glasses, perfectly composed, motorcycle aesthetic
*   **Workers:** Realistic working-class clothing, weathered faces, political buttons and symbols
*   **Portraits:** Oil painting style when close-up, showing psychological depth
*   **Prompt Example:** "A disheveled detective in his 40s, wearing a stained white shirt, garish tie with an orange pattern, brown jacket. Exhausted, confused expression. Severe sideburns. Beside him, a composed officer in an orange bomber jacket over police uniform, glasses, neat hair, carrying himself with quiet confidence. Watercolor portrait style."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Revachol:** Post-revolutionary city, Soviet-inspired brutalist architecture mixed with Art Deco
*   **The Yard:** Muddy ground, hanging tree, political graffiti, workers gathering
*   **Martinaise:** Dockside district, fishing boats, lorries, working-class housing, bars
*   **Impressionist Backgrounds:** Less detail farther from focus, painterly and emotional
*   **Prompt Example:** "A decaying urban waterfront. Brutalist concrete apartment blocks with broken windows, faded communist murals on walls. Orange and red graffiti. A fishing village in the foreground with small boats. Overcast sky reflecting in oily water. Workers in brown coats standing in groups. Impressionist watercolor style, visible brush strokes, melancholy beauty."

**5. Political Symbols & Ideologies:**
*   **Communism:** Red stars, hammer and sickle, bold red
*   **Fascism:** Black and white, militaristic symbols, skulls
*   **Ultraliberalism:** Corporate logos, money symbols, sleek design
*   **Moralism:** International symbols, bland neutrality
*   **Prompt Example:** "Political posters layered on a wall: faded communist propaganda in red with stars, torn ultraliberal corporate advertisements, fascist black-and-white symbols spray-painted over everything, moralist international coalition posters beneath it all. Each ideology fighting for the same wall. Weathered, torn, beautiful in its decay."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Overcast Noir:** Gray skies, diffused light, few harsh shadows
*   **Golden Hour Moments:** Rare, emotionally significant scenes have warm light
*   **Painterly Shadows:** Not photorealistic, expressive and emotional
*   **Prompt Example:** "...overcast lighting with pale gray sky. Soft diffused light creating gentle shadows. Occasional warm light from windows or fires. Watercolor shading with visible pigment separation. Emotional rather than realistic lighting—light represents hope or its absence."

## Voice

A gravelly, exhausted voice questioning everything, like someone trying to piece together reality from fragments. The pacing is slow, contemplative, with sudden bursts of manic energy. The tone shifts between self-loathing, philosophical musing, absurdist humor, and desperate hope. There's an underlying theme of constructing identity through choices. Multiple voices interrupt—skills arguing. Role: The voice of fractured consciousness seeking meaning.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Bleak indie rock mixed with ambient soundscapes and harpsichord. Melancholy strings, occasional synth, Soviet-inspired instrumentation. Lyrics about loss and searching.
*   **Exploration:** Ambient, minimal. Wind, distant conversations, radio static, ship horns. The world's sounds are the music.
*   **Skill Voices:** Each skill has a unique audio signature when it speaks—some whisper, some boom, some sing.
*   **Emotional Moments:** Strings swell, acoustic guitar, soft piano. Intimate and personal.
*   **The Pale:** White noise, radio interference, sounds like reality unmaking itself. Dissonant and terrifying.
*   **Political Themes:** Each ideology has musical motifs—communist revolutionary anthems, fascist martial drums, ultraliberal smooth jazz, moralist bland orchestration.
*   **The Phasmid:** Beautiful, alien sounds—proof of wonder in the cynical world.
*   **Late Night Conversations:** Just ambient sounds and occasional musical punctuation, letting dialogue breathe.
