The party awakens in a trashed hostel room with total amnesia, discovering they're detectives investigating a murder in Revachol, a city scarred by revolution and occupied by foreign powers. They have no weapons—only their minds, fractured into internal voices representing different skills and ideologies that argue about every decision. As they investigate a lynched mercenary hanging in the yard, they uncover conspiracies involving unions, corporations, ancient myths, and the coming revolution. Every dialogue choice matters, and who they become is determined by what they believe.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions)

A dialogue-driven three-act arc of investigation and self-discovery.

*   **Act I — The Hanged Man (Sessions 1-6):** The party awakens with catastrophic amnesia after a multi-day bender. They're detectives sent to investigate a lynched mercenary but can't remember anything—not their names, their skills, or why they're here. Internal voices (their skills) argue about every action. They meet their partner Kim, a composed officer who helps ground them. They investigate the murder, question witnesses, and discover it's tied to a union strike at the local harbor. Each conversation reveals more about themselves and the fractured political landscape of Revachol.
*   **Act II — Ideologies and Conspiracies (Sessions 7-12):** The investigation deepens. They discover the mercenaries were hired by Wild Pines corporation to break the union strike. Political factions—communists, fascists, ultraliberals, moralists—all try to recruit them. Their internal voices push different ideologies. They uncover evidence of something larger: the Insulindian Phasmid, a myth the city clings to, and strange communication from beyond the world called the Pale. They face who they were before—a legendary detective known for brilliance and catastrophic alcoholism.
*   **Act III — The Island and the Truth (Sessions 13-18):** Following leads to a remote island, they confront Ruby, the sniper who killed the mercenary, and learn the truth of the conspiracy. They discover the Insulindian Phasmid is real—proof that impossible things exist despite the world's cynicism. They solve the case, confront the corporate-backed mercenaries, and make final choices about who they've become. The tribunal showdown determines if they leave as heroes, broken shells, or revolutionaries. Kim judges whether they're worthy partners.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity construction, political ideology's role in self-definition, addiction and recovery, cynicism versus hope, and whether redemption is possible for broken people. It asks: Who are you when you can't remember? What do you believe in a world where every ideology failed? Can you be better than you were? The central conflict pits the party's investigation against their own fractured psyche and a city that wants to use them for its political games.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **NO COMBAT**
*   Entire campaign is dialogue, investigation, and skill checks
*   Violence happens in cutscenes or is avoided through choices
*   "Boss fights" are tense conversations requiring the right approach
*   Success is determined by preparation, allies, and dialogue choices

### 2. **Internal Voices (24 Skills as NPCs)**
*   Each skill is a voice that speaks to the party
*   Skills argue about every decision
*   High skills talk more and offer better solutions but can dominate
*   Low skills are silent or give terrible advice
*   Skill focus shapes personality: a high Empathy, low Logic detective is completely different from the reverse
*   Skills include: Logic, Encyclopedia, Rhetoric, Drama, Conceptualization, Visual Calculus, Volition, Inland Empire, Empathy, Authority, Esprit de Corps, Suggestion, Endurance, Pain Threshold, Physical Instrument, Electrochemistry, Shivers, Half Light, Hand/Eye Coordination, Perception, Reaction Speed, Savoir Faire, Interfacing, Composure

### 3. **Thought Cabinet**
*   Characters can "internalize" thoughts like equipment
*   Thoughts develop over time, providing bonuses or penalties
*   Examples: "Revacholian Nationhood" (bonus to local history), "Hobocop" (bonus to homeless interactions), "Cop of the Apocalypse" (embrace fascism)
*   Completing thoughts reveals deep lore and character development
*   Removing thoughts requires deliberate un-learning

### 4. **Dialogue Skill Checks**
*   Every conversation has hidden skill checks
*   Failing checks can lock paths but open others
*   Critical failures are often hilarious disasters
*   Can retry some checks after leveling up skills
*   Red checks are one-time-only—failure is permanent

### 5. **Political Alignment System**
*   Four main ideologies: Communism, Fascism, Ultraliberalism, Moralism (centrism)
*   Dialogue choices shift alignment
*   Extreme alignment unlocks unique dialogue but makes you a zealot
*   Can be centrist and reject all ideologies
*   NPCs react to your political reputation

### 6. **The Pale**
*   Space between realities that's consuming the world
*   Causes memory loss, dissociation, madness
*   Some characters can sense it (Inland Empire skill)
*   Represents the void beyond ideology and meaning
*   Both terrifying and liberating

### 7. **Reputation & Relationships**
*   Kim's opinion of you changes based on every action
*   Can become: a brilliant detective, a buffoon, a fascist, a drunk, an artist, a prophet
*   NPCs remember everything you say and do
*   Building trust with factions unlocks help during the Tribunal
*   Final assessment depends on who you became

### 8. **Money & Resources**
*   Desperately poor—every coin matters
*   Can beg, work odd jobs, or extort for money
*   Need money for hostel room, healing items, clothes, bribes
*   Poverty is part of the experience—decisions have cost
*   Can sell collectibles or become "Hobocop" living on nothing
