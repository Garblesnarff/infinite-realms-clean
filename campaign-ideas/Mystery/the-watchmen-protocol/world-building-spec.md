### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Watchmen Protocol**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In a world where legendary adventurers—the Paragons—once saved kingdoms from existential threats using god-like artifacts, those same heroes are now aging, retired, and under government scrutiny. When one of them is assassinated, the remaining Paragons must investigate a conspiracy that reaches into the highest levels of power. As they uncover the truth, they must grapple with the question: who watches the watchers? The mastermind reveals he engineered a catastrophe to prevent an even greater one—forcing the party to choose between terrible options.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Cataclysm Wars—the existential threat that made the Paragons necessary, and how they ended it using legendary artifacts.
    *   Write the history of how the Paragons transitioned from beloved heroes to controversial figures under government oversight.
    *   Describe the political landscape: the Western Alliance, the Eastern Empire, and the neutral city-states caught between them.
    *   Explain the Watchmen Protocol—the secret government contingency plan for neutralizing Paragons if they go rogue.
    *   Detail the philosophical movements that emerged questioning the Paragons' unchecked power: The Accountability Movement and The New Age of Heroes.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Paragons (Retired Heroes)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Protect their legacy, maintain their independence, prevent their artifacts from being seized.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure—each Paragon is independent, but old alliances remain.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Retired heroes who served their time and deserve peace.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Several harbor guilt over compromises they made; others secretly prepare for threats they still foresee.
        *   **Assets:** Legendary artifacts granting god-like powers, hidden fortresses, loyal followers from their heroic days.
        *   **Relationships:** Fractured among themselves, distrusted by governments, revered by the public.
    *   **The Bureau of Heroic Affairs** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Ensure Paragons never threaten civilian populations; maintain government control over legendary artifacts.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Bureaucratic intelligence agency led by Director Kaine.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Oversee and support retired heroes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Watchmen Protocol—detailed plans to neutralize each Paragon if necessary.
        *   **Assets:** Surveillance networks, special operatives, captured magical artifacts, political leverage.
        *   **Relationships:** Adversarial with Paragons, backed by Western Alliance governments.
    *   **The Vex Institute** (Major - Secret Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** Prevent global war through a controlled catastrophe that unites the world against a common enemy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Aurelius Vex, staffed by brilliant scientists and strategists who believe in utilitarian ethics.
        *   **Public Agenda:** A think tank focused on conflict resolution and global cooperation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Engineering a fake interdimensional invasion that will kill millions but prevent billions of deaths from world war.
        *   **Assets:** Vast wealth, research facilities across multiple nations, manipulated intelligence networks, mercenary forces.
        *   **Relationships:** Vex was once a Paragon; he has allies among other Paragons who agree with his plan.
    *   **The Doomsday Cult (Dreadmaw's Followers)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Accelerate the apocalypse they believe is inevitable.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Chaotic following centered on the mad Paragon Dreadmaw.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Religious extremists predicting end times.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know more truth than they should—Dreadmaw's madness grants him genuine prophetic insight.
        *   **Assets:** Fanatical followers, knowledge of coming events, unpredictability.
        *   **Relationships:** Feared by all, tolerated because Dreadmaw was once a hero.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players move the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight through aggressive or violent actions.
    *   **THEN:** Nations mobilize troops, civilian panic increases, Vex's plan becomes easier to execute, diplomatic solutions become harder.
    *   **IF:** The players move the Doomsday Clock away from midnight through diplomacy and de-escalation.
    *   **THEN:** Vex must accelerate his timeline and take riskier actions, making his plan more detectable but also more desperate.
    *   **IF:** The players expose the Watchmen Protocol to the public.
    *   **THEN:** Massive protests erupt, governments are embarrassed, Paragons gain public support, but some Paragons feel betrayed and become less cooperative.
    *   **IF:** The players ally with Aurelius Vex and agree to help his plan.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to his resources but must participate in the catastrophe, leading to a radically different ending where they become the villains history remembers.
    *   **IF:** The players consult Dr. Chronomancer about a major decision.
    *   **THEN:** They see visions of 2-3 possible outcomes, gaining insight but also the burden of knowing what they're choosing between.
    *   **IF:** The players free or ally with Dreadmaw.
    *   **THEN:** His cult grows rapidly, adding chaos to an already volatile situation, but he also provides genuine prophetic warnings about threats.
    *   **IF:** The players discover evidence of which Paragon is secretly working with Vex.
    *   **THEN:** That Paragon either tries to recruit them to Vex's cause or becomes an enemy, splitting the Paragons further.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to destroy all legendary artifacts to end the cycle of power.
    *   **THEN:** They lose their greatest weapons against Vex, but also prove that no one should have that much power, potentially inspiring a new era.
    *   **IF:** The players let the catastrophe happen but minimize casualties.
    *   **THEN:** They must live with complicity in mass murder, but the world does unite and war is prevented—the "compromise ending."
    *   **IF:** The players stop Vex's plan completely without a substitute solution.
    *   **THEN:** The campaign continues for additional sessions as war breaks out and they must find another way to achieve peace.
