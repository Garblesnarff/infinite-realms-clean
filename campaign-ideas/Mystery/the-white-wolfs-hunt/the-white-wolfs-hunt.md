## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-35 sessions)

A journey through war-torn lands, hunting monsters while searching for a prophesied child.

*   **Act I — The Contracts & The Search (Sessions 1-12):** The party takes monster-hunting contracts across war-torn kingdoms, earning coin and gathering information about Ciri's whereabouts. They encounter political factions vying for power: the Empire of Nilfgaard invading the Northern Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Temeria resisting, and various factions with their own agendas. Each contract reveals shades of gray—monsters aren't always evil, humans aren't always good. They track Ciri's trail, learning she possesses world-crossing powers and is fleeing the Wild Hunt.
*   **Act II — The Isle of Mists & Family Bonds (Sessions 13-24):** Following leads, they discover Ciri's location but must first deal with political entanglements and earn the trust of powerful allies. They recruit help from old friends: the sorceress Yennefer, the bard Dandelion, the dwarf Zoltan, and others. They learn the Wild Hunt are elves from another world seeking to use Ciri's power to save their dying dimension. After assembling their crew, they assault the Isle of Mists and find Ciri, but she's pursued by both the Wild Hunt and forces who want to use her prophecy for conquest.
*   **Act III — The Battle of Kaer Morhen & The White Frost (Sessions 25-35):** With Ciri found, they fortify the ancient Witcher fortress of Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt's assault. An epic siege ensues with allies from across their journey. After defeating the Hunt's generals, they learn the true threat: the White Frost, an ice age that will consume all worlds. Ciri must enter a portal to stop it, likely sacrificing herself. The party faces impossible choices: let her go and save the worlds, or keep her safe and doom everything. The ending varies based on their treatment of Ciri throughout—did they let her make her own choices, or try to protect/control her?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of moral ambiguity, the concept of the "lesser evil," destiny versus free will, and found family. It asks: Can you be a hero when there are no good choices? Is it better to let someone you love risk themselves or protect them from their destiny? Are monsters always evil and humans always good? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect Ciri against her need to fulfill her destiny and save the world.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Witcher Mutations & Signs**
*   All party members are Witchers with enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing
*   Can cast Signs—simple combat spells: Igni (fire), Quen (shield), Aard (force), Yrden (trap), Axii (mind control)
*   Immune to diseases, age slowly, sterile from mutations
*   Yellow cat-like eyes, enhanced night vision
*   Mutations make them outsiders—feared and needed by society

### 2. **Alchemy & Preparation**
*   Brew potions, oils, and bombs using monster parts and herbs
*   Oils enhance damage against specific monster types
*   Potions grant temporary abilities but are toxic—too many = poisoning
*   Meditation restores potions (like Estus refilling at bonfires)
*   Monster research via bestiary grants preparation bonuses

### 3. **Monster Contracts & Investigation**
*   Each contract starts with investigation—interview witnesses, examine clues, use Witcher Senses
*   Identify monster type via tracks, kills, behaviors
*   Prepare appropriate oils, potions, and tactics
*   Contracts have moral complexity—sometimes the "monster" isn't the real villain

### 4. **Moral Choice System**
*   Frequent choices with no clear right answer—"lesser evil" situations
*   Consequences appear sessions later, creating narrative weight
*   Choices affect which allies survive, ending received, political landscape
*   Track Ciri's fate based on how party treats her—trust or control?

### 5. **Witcher Senses**
*   Enhanced perception ability to highlight clues, tracks, and hidden objects
*   Used extensively in investigations and finding secrets
*   Can follow scent trails, see recent events, detect magic

### 6. **Gwent (Optional Mini-Game)**
*   In-world card game that NPCs play
*   Collect cards from vendors and defeated opponents
*   Can gamble on matches
*   Completely optional but adds flavor

### 7. **Gear Crafting & Witcher Schools**
*   Find diagrams for Witcher gear from different schools (Cat, Bear, Wolf, Griffin)
*   Each set has unique bonuses matching playstyles
*   Must gather rare materials and commission master craftsmen
*   Gear can be upgraded through multiple tiers

### 8. **Relationship Dynamics**
*   Party's interactions with Ciri affect the ending
*   Choices that show trust and respect → Good ending
*   Choices that control or dismiss her → Bad ending
*   Romance options have consequences—choosing both leads to disaster
