### **World-Building Specification Brief: Tales of Deception**

**1. Core Concept:**
Investigating the disappearance of Amy Dunne reveals a web of lies, media manipulation, and the ultimate unreliable narrator—the "victim" herself who orchestrated everything to frame her unfaithful husband, forcing investigators to navigate truth versus performance in the court of public opinion.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the Elliott family legacy—famous adventuring authors who created "Amazing Amy" book series
*   Explain how Amy grew up always compared to her fictional, perfect counterpart
*   Describe the economic downturn that cost Nick and Amy their careers and moved them to Nick's hometown
*   Write about the media landscape—celebrity investigators, trial-by-television culture
*   Detail previous cases where media destroyed innocent people or protected guilty ones
*   Explain the cultural obsession with missing attractive women (media bias themes)
*   Describe Amy's previous relationships and how she destroyed men who wronged her

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Investigation Team** (Major) - The party and Detective Boney, seeking truth
*   **The Dunne Family** (Major) - Nick and Go, fighting for Nick's innocence
*   **The Elliott Family** (Major) - Amy's parents, image-obsessed, complicit in Amy's damage
*   **The Media Circus** (Major) - Ellen Abbott and press, trying case in public opinion
*   **The Defense Team** (Major) - Tanner Bolt and lawyers, managing Nick's image
*   **Amy's Pawns** (Minor) - People she's manipulated (Desi, Noelle, ex-boyfriends)
*   **Public Opinion** (Minor) - The masses swayed by narrative

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Amy Elliott Dunne, Nick Dunne, Margo "Go" Dunne, Detective Rhonda Boney, Desi Collings
*   **Tier 2:** Tanner Bolt, Ellen Abbott, Rand & Marybeth Elliott, Andie Hardy, Noelle Hawthorne
*   **Tier 3:** "Suspicious Neighbor," "Former Boyfriend," "Media Reporter," "Police Officer," "Bar Regular," "Amy's Friend," "Nick's Student"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Dunne House** - Staged crime scene, evidence of "struggle," memorial shrine
*   **The Bar** - Nick and Go's failing business, Nick's alibi location
*   **Police Station** - Interrogation rooms, evidence storage, Detective Boney's frustration
*   **Television Studios** - Media circus headquarters, Ellen Abbott's show
*   **The Ozark Cabins** - Amy's hideout while "missing"
*   **Desi's Lake House** - Gilded cage, final phase of Amy's plan
*   **The Elliott Home** - Perfect, museum-like, shrine to Amazing Amy
*   **Public Spaces** - Where media frenzy plays out, press conferences

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party believes Nick is guilty THEN Amy's plan succeeds, investigation stalls
*   IF party discovers Amy's diary inconsistencies THEN begin to suspect the truth
*   IF party goes public with suspicions THEN Amy accelerates her timeline
*   IF media turns against Nick THEN his cooperation with party decreases (desperation)
*   IF party finds Amy before she completes plan THEN she must improvise (dangerous)
*   IF party exposes Amy publicly THEN she has contingency (Desi frame-up ready)
*   IF party helps Nick escape THEN become fugitives themselves, Amy "wins" narrative
*   IF party accepts the lie THEN Amy and Nick's toxic marriage continues, party is complicit
*   IF Desi helps Amy THEN she uses him and frames him for kidnapping/rape
*   IF party maintains public opinion THEN gain access to evidence and witnesses
