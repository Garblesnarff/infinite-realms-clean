# Creative Brief: Tales of Deception

## Art Style: Modern Psychological Thriller (Gone Girl Aesthetic)

Inspired by contemporary psychological thrillers—cold color palettes, suburban uncanniness, media glare, dual perspectives shown through contrasting visual styles.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Cold, desaturated colors—clinical whites, cool grays, washed-out blues. Nick's perspective is warmer but faded (dishonest memory). Amy's true perspective is sharp, saturated, and deliberately composed (controlled reality). Media scenes are oversaturated, garish, artificial.

**Character Design:** Contemporary fashion—Amy appears perfect (blonde, composed, designer clothes) but with uncanny valley perfection. Nick is conventionally handsome but increasingly haggard as pressure mounts. Media figures are overdressed, theatrical. Visual cues should make viewers question what they're seeing.

**Environments:** Suburban homes that look perfect but feel wrong. Police stations with harsh fluorescent lighting. Television studios with artificial brightness. Amy's hideout is deliberately ordinary (motel rooms, anonymous spaces). Desi's lake house is beautiful but oppressive—gilded cage aesthetic.

**Dual Perspective Visual Language:**
- Nick's POV: Slightly unreliable, warmer tones, details he doesn't notice
- Amy's Diary POV (fake): Romantic, soft-focus, idealized (revealed as performance)
- Amy's True POV: Sharp, calculated, cold precision
- Media POV: Sensationalized, unflattering angles, sound-bite emphasis

## Voice

Two distinct voices for the dual perspective:

**Nick's Voice:** Defensive, charming but evasive, increasingly desperate. Midwest American accent. Speaks like he's trying to convince you of his innocence even in casual conversation. Genuine confusion mixed with guilty conscience (about the affair, not murder).

**Amy's Voice (Public):** Perfectly modulated, warm, vulnerable, the ideal victim. Every word calculated for effect.

**Amy's Voice (Private):** Cold, analytical, quietly furious. Speaks in calm, measured tones that make threats sound like observations. Think Rosamund Pike's controlled menace.

## Music Style

Contemporary thriller score—unsettling, building tension. Minimalist piano themes that sound beautiful but wrong (slightly out of tune, unexpected dissonances). Amy's theme is deceptively lovely but with underlying darkness—music box melody over disturbing drones. Nick's theme is confused, anxious strings. Media scenes have upbeat, artificial news jingles that clash with dark content. The score should make players uncomfortable even during mundane scenes. Key moments use sudden silence to devastating effect. Post-twist, Amy's theme should recontextualize from sad to sinister when players rehear it.
