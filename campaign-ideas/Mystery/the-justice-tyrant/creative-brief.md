# Creative Brief: The Justice Tyrant

Inspired by the dark, conflicted aesthetic of *Injustice: Gods Among Us*. This style captures fallen heroism, regime oppression, and the visual weight of impossible moral choices.

## Art Style: Dark Heroic Realism (Injustice Game Style)

### Core Principles:
*   **Corrupted Symbols:** Show heroic symbols twisted for tyranny—the Guardian's emblem on regime banners, statues of the fallen hero.
*   **Oppressive Authority:** Military aesthetics, execution platforms, propaganda art, dystopian order.
*   **Grief Made Visible:** The Guardian shown with visual reminders of Luna—her colors in his costume, her memorial, his haunted eyes.

### Color Palette:
Desaturated with harsh reds and blacks for the Regime. Muted blues and grays for the Resistance. The Guardian's colors darkened from bright to grim.

### Character Design:
*   **The Guardian (Regime):** Darker costume, authoritarian bearing, cold eyes, military aesthetics.
*   **Resistance Heroes:** Battle-worn, improvised armor, symbols of defiance.

## Voice

A tragic, mournful voice speaking of heroes fallen, friends fighting friends, and the terrible cost of grief unchecked. Carries the weight of watching hope die. Role: A survivor chronicling when the greatest hero became the greatest monster.
