## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

When the greatest hero becomes the greatest threat.

*   **Act I — The Fall (Sessions 1–5):** The campaign opens with tragedy. The players witness or participate in stopping the Laughing Assassin's plot—too late to prevent him from tricking the Guardian into killing Luna. The Guardian executes the villain live on broadcast. In the aftermath, the Guardian declares: "No more. No more death. No more crime. No more war." He forms the Regime, recruiting powerful heroes and crushing criminal organizations. Some heroes join him; others form a Resistance. The players must choose sides as the realm transforms overnight.
*   **Act II — The Regime (Sessions 6–11):** If the players joined the Regime, they enforce the Guardian's peace, executing supervillains and suppressing dissent—wondering when they became the villains. If they joined the Resistance, they fight guerrilla warfare against impossible odds, watching friends captured and executed. Both sides commit atrocities. The party witnesses the Guardian becoming more ruthless, convinced his tyranny is just. They must decide whether redemption is possible or if the Guardian must be stopped permanently.
*   **Act III — The Reckoning (Sessions 12–15+):** The conflict reaches its breaking point when the Guardian threatens to destroy entire cities to enforce compliance. The Resistance plans a desperate assault, and the Regime prepares to purge all opposition. The players must navigate this final confrontation: kill the Guardian and risk destroying the symbol of hope itself, redeem him through reaching what remains of his humanity, or find a middle path that neither side expects. Their choice determines what kind of world emerges from the ashes of heroism.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of grief, the corruption of power, when heroes become villains, and whether redemption is possible after unforgivable acts. The central conflict is between order through tyranny and freedom through chaos—and whether there's a third option. Can a hero who has fallen so far be redeemed? Or must he be destroyed to save what he once stood for?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Moral Compromise**
*   Both sides require morally questionable actions to win.
*   Players track "Lines Crossed"—each major moral compromise (executing surrendering enemies, bombing civilian areas, torture) is recorded.
*   High Lines Crossed affects character development and how NPCs react. Some allies become disgusted; others respect the "necessary" choices.

### 2. **The Guardian's Humanity**
*   A hidden meter tracks whether the Guardian can be redeemed.
*   Player actions that show compassion, remind him of Luna, or demonstrate that hope still exists raise this meter.
*   At the climax, a high meter allows for redemption; a low meter means he must be killed.

### 3. **Regime vs Resistance Missions**
*   Depending on the side chosen, players get different mission types:
    *   **Regime:** Enforcement, execution, suppression, dealing with internal dissent.
    *   **Resistance:** Guerrilla strikes, rescues, propaganda, securing resources.
*   Success/failure affects the war's progress and which side gains advantage for the final confrontation.
