## Art Style: Rural Noir & True Crime Documentary (In Cold Blood Aesthetic)

Inspired by Truman Capote's pioneering true crime work and rural American Gothic—black and white photography aesthetic, documentary realism, Kansas plains desolation, 1950s Americana with darkness beneath.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Desaturated almost to black-and-white—wheat field golds, dust bowl browns, Kansas sky blues, washed-out colors of 1950s small-town America. Crime scene: harsh whites and shadows. Prison: institutional grays and greens. Blood is the only vivid color—stark and horrific against muted backgrounds.

**Character Design:**
- **Alvin Dewey:** Classic 1950s detective—fedora, suit, tie, weathered face, smoking. Tired but determined.
- **Truman Capote:** Small, precise, expensive but eccentric clothes, observant eyes, outsider in Kansas.
- **Perry Smith:** Short, muscular, damaged (motorcycle accident left him with twisted legs). Tattoos, sensitive eyes, contradiction of dreamer and killer.
- **Dick Hickock:** Taller, charming smile, ordinary-looking. Face damaged in car accident. Sociopath hiding behind normalcy.
- **The Clutters:** 1950s American ideal—clean-cut, well-dressed, wholesome. Their ordinariness is crucial.

**Environments:**
- Clutter Farmhouse: Isolated, prosperous, wholesome—1950s American Dream made tangible
- Holcomb, Kansas: Flat plains, grain elevators, main street, church, diner—middle America
- Crime Scenes: Forensic photography style, clinical documentation of horror
- Kansas Prison: Institutional, cold, where killers await death
- The Courtroom: Wood paneling, American flags, small-town justice
- Death Row: Stark cells, the gallows looming

**Photographic Style:** Everything should feel like documentary photography—Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, crime scene photos. Real, unflinching, not dramatized.

## Voice

**Investigator's Voice:** Flat, factual, Kansas accent. "We found the bodies at 10:14 AM." Professional detachment over deep upset. Methodical reporting of horror.

**Capote's Voice:** Cultured, precise, Southern lilt, outsider perspective. Describing Kansas life with anthropological distance but growing emotional involvement.

**Perry's Voice:** Sensitive, educated (self-taught), wounded. Speaks in dreams and fantasies, then confession of brutal reality. Contradiction between poetic self-image and violent actions.

**Dick's Voice:** Charming, casual, manipulative. Speaks like friendly guy next door. Lacks emotional depth—everything's a con.

**Narrative Voice:** Like documentary narration or true crime podcast—factual, detailed, letting events speak for themselves without moralizing. Truman Capote's "non-fiction novel" style.

## Music Style

Sparse, haunting Americana—guitar, harmonica, strings. Not traditional thriller score but American Gothic. 1950s period music (church hymns, radio pop) juxtaposed with crime horror. Main theme is lonely guitar on Kansas plains—desolation, isolation. The Clutters' theme is warm Americana—hymns, community, family dinner music—making their deaths more tragic. Perry's theme is mournful harmonica and strings—damaged dreamer. Dick's theme is unsettling emptiness—absence where empathy should be. Crime scene music is single sustained note or silence—horror needs no score. Trial scenes have courtroom ambient sound—no music, just reality. Execution scene: nothing, or single piano note—solemn, no triumph. The score should feel like Ken Burns documentary meets Coen Brothers' Midwest noir.
