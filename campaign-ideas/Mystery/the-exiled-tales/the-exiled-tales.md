## Key Locations

1.  **The Woodland:** Luxury apartment building housing wealthy Fables in New York City.
2.  **Fabletown:** Hidden neighborhood in Manhattan where Fables live in disguise.

## Central Conflict

The campaign explores identity, exile, class struggle, and the cost of war. Immortal beings must adapt to modernity while hiding their true selves. Class divisions between wealthy and poor Fables mirror real-world inequality. The Adversary represents both external threat and the danger of former allies turned enemies. Ultimately, it asks: can you go home again, and should you?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Glamour Management**

*   Fables must maintain magical disguises to appear human. Breaking glamour attracts mortal attention and puts the community at risk.

### 2. **The Compact**

*   Fables are bound by magical laws. Breaking them has severe consequences tracked through a reputation system.

### 3. **Immortality & Resurrection**

*   Fables are very hard to kill permanently. Death and return mechanics reflect fairy tale logic.

### 4. **Fairy Tale Powers**

*   Each character has abilities from their original tale (Big Bad Wolf's breath, Cinderella's charm, etc.) but also the burdens of those stories.

### 5. **The Farm Restrictions**

*   Non-human characters face additional challenges and restrictions, creating built-in conflict and moral dilemmas.
