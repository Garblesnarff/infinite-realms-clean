What begins as a simple case of stolen goods spirals into encounters with nihilist cultists, eccentric crime lords, bowling tournament intrigue, and philosophical debates about whether anything really matters. Through absurd coincidences and barely competent investigation, they must navigate a world where everyone seems insane except them—or maybe they're the crazy ones.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A meandering journey through absurdist crime where nothing is as it seems and everything matters less than you think.

*   **Act I — The Rug That Tied the Room Together (Sessions 1-7):** When thugs break into the party's tavern looking for ransom money, they realize they've been mistaken for the "Big Lebowski" adventuring party—a famous group working for a wealthy merchant. Their simple attempt to get compensation for their ruined rug draws them into a kidnapping plot involving the merchant's spouse, leading to encounters with avant-garde artists, aggressive nihilists, and a mysterious stranger who seems to narrate their adventures.
*   **Act II — The Bowling League Conspiracy (Sessions 8-13):** As the party investigates deeper, they discover the city's bowling league is a front for various criminal enterprises. Each team represents a different faction, and tournament games are actually negotiations and shows of force. The kidnapping connects to unpaid debts, stolen tournament winnings, and a pornographic art collective. The party must compete in the league championship while untangling who actually has the ransom money.
*   **Act III — Strikes, Gutters, and the Occasional Spare (Sessions 14-20):** The truth emerges: there never was a kidnapping, the ransom money was embezzled, and everyone involved is either a liar or an idiot. The party faces off against nihilists who believe in nothing and will cut off your toe for it, recovers stolen tournament winnings from a crime lord who just wanted his rug back, and ultimately learns that sometimes the journey matters more than the destination—especially when the destination was meaningless all along.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of meaning in a meaningless world, the absurdity of social conventions, and how we create significance in everyday rituals. It asks: Does anything really matter? Is it better to care too much or not at all? Can you find peace in chaos? The central conflict pits the party's desire for simple compensation against a world where everyone is either lying or crazy, where the truth changes depending on who's telling the story, and where the most important question might be: who's buying the next round?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Abiding System**
*   Characters gain "Abiding Points" for staying calm during absurd situations
*   Spend points to: auto-succeed social checks through pure apathy, ignore fear effects, find comfort items in unlikely places
*   Losing your cool resets Abiding Points but grants temporary combat bonuses
*   The calmer you remain, the more reality bends in your favor

### 2. **Bowling Challenges**
*   Major negotiations happen during bowling games
*   Each frame represents a stage of the negotiation or conflict
*   Strikes grant advantage on next social check, gutterballs impose disadvantage
*   Spares allow re-rolling failed checks
*   Bowling skill directly translates to criminal underworld respect

### 3. **Mistaken Identity Table**
*   NPCs regularly mistake the party for other people
*   Roll on table to determine who they think you are
*   Playing along grants information but creates complications later
*   Eventually all cases of mistaken identity converge in chaotic confrontations

### 4. **The Rug Economy**
*   Rugs are status symbols and criminal currency
*   Quality, size, and provenance determine a rug's value
*   The quest for "a rug that ties the room together" drives many subplots
*   Rugs can be traded, stolen, damaged, and recovered

### 5. **Narrative Inconsistency**
*   NPCs tell contradictory versions of events
*   Party must determine truth from multiple unreliable narrators
*   Some "facts" change between sessions as people revise their stories
*   The Stranger occasionally corrects or reframes events

### 6. **Beverage Bonus**
*   Characters performing actions while drinking gain unique benefits
*   Different drinks provide different bonuses (coffee = alertness, alcohol = social)
*   Over-indulging imposes penalties but unlocks special dialogue options
*   Important plot revelations often happen during drinks

### 7. **Over the Line Rules**
*   Certain boundaries must not be crossed (often arbitrarily defined)
*   When someone goes "over the line," immediate consequences occur
*   Party can invoke rules to stop enemy actions
*   Arguments about what constitutes "over the line" become recurring bits
