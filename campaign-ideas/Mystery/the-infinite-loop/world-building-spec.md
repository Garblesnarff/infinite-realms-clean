# The Infinite Loop - World-Building Spec

## The Military Camp

### Layout (Memorized After Many Loops)
- **Command Tent:** Center, Thrace's location
- **Armory:** East side, key weapons stored
- **Mess Hall:** West, social hub
- **Barracks:** North, where party wakes
- **Perimeter:** Defensive walls, breach points known

### NPCs and Their Fates

**Commander Thrace:**
- **Loop 1-5:** Dies in first wave
- **Loop 6-15:** Survives with protection
- **Loop 16+:** Crucial leadership, major force multiplier

**Private Chen:**
- **Most Loops:** Comedic deaths
- **Saving Him:** Requires specific actions hours before battle
- **Alive:** Surprising combat skill emerges

**The Traitor:**
- **Sabotages:** Food, weapons, walls
- **Identity:** DM chooses based on party investigation
- **Caught:** Prevents major disadvantages
- **Killed:** Moral question each loop

### The 24-Hour Timeline

**Hour 0 (Dawn):** Party wakes, loop begins
**Hours 1-6:** Preparation, investigation, social
**Hours 7-12:** Training, fortification, gathering intelligence
**Hours 13-17:** Final preparations, critical choice points
**Hour 18:** First wave begins
**Hour 19:** Second wave
**Hour 20:** Third wave, heaviest assault
**Hour 21:** Boss monster appears
**Hour 22-24:** Survival or death, loop resets

## Monster Invasion Patterns

### Wave One (Hour 18)
- Goblinoid scouts, weak but numerous
- Tests defenses
- Easy to handle once known
- Deaths here only in earliest loops

### Wave Two (Hour 19)
- Trolls and ogres, heavy hitters
- Specific tactics required
- Early loops: devastate defenders
- Late loops: party handles with ease

### Wave Three (Hour 20)
- Mixed forces, coordinated assault
- Multiple breach points
- Requires strategic positioning
- Commander Thrace crucial here

### The Omega (Hour 21)
- Massive unique monster
- Cannot be killed by normal means
- Must discover environmental kill method
- Or negotiation/banishment
- Represents final examination

## Loop Mechanics Deep Dive

### What Resets
- All NPC positions and states
- Damaged structures
- Used resources
- NPC memories
- Weather and time

### What Persists
- Party memories
- Party levels/experience
- Learned information
- Relationships (in party's minds)
- Certain magical effects on party

### Loop Variations
- Subtle changes party didn't cause
- Suggests external interference
- Foreshadows greater mystery
- Keeps party uncertain
- Prevents perfect prediction

## The Artifact's Purpose

### True Function
- **Not:** Trap or curse
- **Actually:** Training simulation
- **Purpose:** Prepare party for role as chosen heroes
- **Creator:** Ancient guardian seeing future threat
- **Method:** Loop until worthy

### Mastery Requirements
- Survive battle with minimal casualties
- Prevent assassination
- Identify and stop traitor
- Defeat Omega creatively
- Demonstrate growth and learning

### Breakthrough Conditions
- All objectives met in single loop
- Display strategic thinking
- Show compassion for NPCs despite resets
- Solve hidden puzzles throughout camp
- Prove worthy of greater quest

## The Greater Threat

### Foreshadowing
- Oracle's cryptic warnings
- Artifact's origin visions
- Monster invasion's true purpose
- Assassination target's importance
- Party's destiny

### Reality
- Far worse invasion coming in months
- Current loop is training ground
- Party being forged into heroes needed
- Breaking free means accepting responsibility
- No more retries in real world

## Psychological Elements

### Loop Fatigue
- Party exhaustion from repetition
- NPC relationships feel hollow
- Temptation to give up
- Finding meaning in repetition
- Maintaining humanity

### Ethical Questions
- Is it okay to use NPCs since they reset?
- Do NPC lives matter if forgotten?
- When is sacrifice acceptable?
- Can you care about people who don't remember you?

### Mastery vs. Madness
- Fine line between learning and obsession
- Perfection as trap
- Accepting good enough
- Moving forward vs. endless refinement

## Victory Scenarios Detail

### The Perfect Loop
- Zero casualties (nearly impossible)
- All objectives achieved
- Every NPC saved
- Elegant execution
- Mastery demonstrated
- Best possible outcome

### The Acceptable Loop
- Major objectives achieved
- Significant casualties but not critical NPCs
- Traitor stopped
- Omega defeated
- Proves party ready
- Good enough to break free

### The Desperate Breakthrough
- Victory but heavy cost
- Commander may die but mission succeeds
- Barely meet minimum requirements
- Freedom earned through blood
- Questionable readiness

This loop structure creates unique gameplay where players become expert at specific scenario while uncovering deeper narrative.
