### **World-Building Specification Brief: Symbols of the Divine**

**1. Core Concept:**
A murder in the realm's greatest museum launches a symbology expert and cryptographer into a conspiracy spanning millennia, uncovering suppressed religious history about divine bloodlines and sacred feminine worship that could shatter the foundations of the realm's dominant faith.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the Divine Figure's true history (fantasy equivalent of Jesus)—taught equality, married Mary Magdalene, had a child
*   Explain the Great Suppression—early church erasing the sacred feminine after the Divine's death
*   Write about the Priory of Sion—secret society founded to protect the bloodline and truth, operating for 1000+ years
*   Describe the Knights Templar connection—discovered proof during crusades, were destroyed by church to suppress it
*   Detail the sacred feminine tradition—goddess worship, Mary Magdalene as equal disciple, feminine divine wisdom
*   Explain how sacred art encoded the truth—Leonardo equivalent and other artists hiding symbols
*   Write about the Holy Grail's true meaning—not cup but womb (sang real = royal blood)
*   Describe the Rose Line—magical ley line marking locations of sacred feminine power
*   Detail Opus Dei equivalent—ultra-conservative religious sect practicing mortification, zealously protecting orthodox faith

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Priory of Sion** (Major) - Secret society protecting the divine bloodline and sacred truth
*   **Opus Dei Equivalent** (Major) - Fanatical religious sect, believes they're protecting true faith
*   **The Church Hierarchy** (Major) - Mainstream religious institution, built on suppressing the truth
*   **The Bloodline Protectors** (Major) - Families descended from the divine, living in secret
*   **The Symbologists** (Minor) - Academics studying hidden meanings in sacred art
*   **The City Watch** (Minor) - Investigating the murder, pursuing the party
*   **The Teacher's Network** (Minor) - Teabing's manipulated agents

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Robert Langdon, Sophie Neveu, Jacques Saunière (dead), Leigh Teabing, Bishop Aringarosa, Silas
*   **Tier 2:** Bezu Fache, Andre Vernet (banker), Remy Jean (Teabing's servant), Sister Sandrine
*   **Tier 3:** "Museum Guard," "Opus Dei Member," "Priory Member," "Art Historian," "Church Official," "Swiss Guard"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Louvre Equivalent** - Greatest museum, murder scene, sacred art galleries
*   **The American Embassy** - Sanctuary from pursuit
*   **Zurich Depository Bank** - Where Saunière kept the Keystone cryptex
*   **Temple Church** - Knight Templar round church with tomb puzzles
*   **Château Villette** - Teabing's estate and library of forbidden history
*   **Westminster Abbey Equivalent** - Site of famous tombs and clues
*   **Rosslyn Chapel** - Gothic chapel with coded architecture
*   **Opus Dei Headquarters** - Austere religious fortress
*   **The Final Vault** - Hidden chamber beneath Rosslyn containing Mary's tomb and proof

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party decodes Saunière's initial clues THEN discover Priory of Sion connection
*   IF party retrieves the Keystone THEN Silas and Opus Dei intensify pursuit
*   IF party trusts Teabing THEN he gains access to clues but will betray them later
*   IF party solves Temple Church puzzle THEN leads to Rosslyn Chapel location
*   IF Silas captures party THEN Teabing (as "Teacher") will orchestrate their "rescue"
*   IF party reaches Rosslyn Chapel THEN Teabing's betrayal is revealed
*   IF party opens cryptex correctly THEN reveals map to final vault
*   IF party forces cryptex open THEN acid destroys clues, major setback
*   IF Sophie discovers bloodline truth THEN must decide whether to accept her heritage
*   IF party exposes conspiracy publicly THEN church power collapses but social chaos ensues
*   IF party protects the secret THEN honor Saunière's legacy but truth remains hidden
*   IF Silas learns he's been manipulated THEN might turn against Teabing
*   IF Fache learns the truth THEN stops pursuing party and helps them
