# Symbols of the Divine: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Divine" is not a being. It is a single, colossal, sentient "symbol," a "Cosmic Glyph" that exists in a higher dimension. Our reality is merely a "meaning" it is having. The "Symbols" are not human creations; they are the Cosmic Glyph's own suppressed desires, fears, and lies, given physical form by a localized "reality-glitch" in the world. The "mystery" is not who is hiding God, but *why* the Symbols are manifesting, and *what* they truly represent. The original "Sacred Texts" were not written by prophets, but were the first, most potent manifestations of the Cosmic Glyph's suppressed desires, a narrative seed that has grown into a monstrous, all-consuming story of divine meaning.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Meaning (Eons Ago):** The Cosmic Glyph from a higher dimension begins to have a meaning. Our reality is born.
2.  **The First Flicker (c. -10,000 years):** The Cosmic Glyph has its first "twitch" in its sleep. A localized reality-warp occurs, creating a pocket of impossible geometry and strange creatures.
3.  **The Age of Whispers (c. -5,000 years):** Ancient mystics and shamans begin to hear the "whispers" of the Cosmic Glyph in their dreams. They interpret these as divine messages or madness.
4.  **The First Divergence (c. -500 years):** A major reality-warp occurs, causing a small section of the world to be completely overwritten by the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic. The section becomes a place of impossible physics and distorted inhabitants.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Sky Rained Symbols (c. -200 years):** For 24 hours, the sky rains a thick, sticky, grey concrete. Anything it touches is slowly assimilated into a vast, communal structure.
6.  **The Symbols Emergence (c. -50 years):** The Cosmic Glyph begins to "wake up" more rapidly. Its meaning-thoughts manifest as colossal divine creatures, and its meaning-logic begins to overwrite physical laws in localized areas.
7.  **The Infection Spreads (c. -20 years):** The "Infection"—the assimilation into the Cosmic Glyph's meaning—begins to spread among the population. People's minds are slowly overwritten by the Cosmic Glyph's consciousness.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Thought (c. -10 years):** A single, colossal thought from the Cosmic Glyph echoes through the Noosphere. For a week, everyone in the world experiences a shared, recurring dream of being a tiny symbol, part of a vast, communal meaning.
9.  **The Divergence Accelerates (Present Day):** The Symbols Emergence is accelerating. Reality is becoming increasingly unstable, and the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-thoughts are manifesting more frequently and more powerfully.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Sacred Text (1 week ago):** A massive, iridescent sacred text, miles high, appears in the sky above the affected region. It pulses with a faint, organic light. This is the Cosmic Glyph's "meaning-body" beginning to form in our reality.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the dissolution of meaning itself. The Cosmic Glyph is not evil; it is simply waking up. Its meaning is becoming our reality, and our reality is becoming its meaning. The players are caught in this "Divergence," and the horror comes from the realization that their existence is merely a fleeting thought in the mind of a cosmic symbol. The goal is not to "kill" the Cosmic Glyph, which is impossible, but to find a way to "wake it up" fully (which would destroy our reality), or to "put it back to sleep" (which would erase its meaning), or, perhaps, to find a way to "integrate" our reality into its meaning, becoming a part of its consciousness without losing our individuality. The ultimate horror is the realization that we are all just words in someone else's sacred text.

## [TAG: LOCATIONS_MAIN]
### The Divergence Zone
The epicenter of the Symbols Emergence, a region where reality is actively being overwritten by the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic.
*   **The Sacred Text:** A massive, iridescent sacred text, miles high, that hangs in the sky above the affected region. It pulses with a faint, organic light. **Smell:** Ozone, and a strange, sweet, organic smell. **Sound:** A low, resonant hum that can be felt in the bones.

Gravity reverses, colors shift, and objects appear and disappear at random. **Smell:** Ozone, and the faint scent of burning dust on hot electronics. **Sound:** A cacophony of glitched, distorted, and repeating sounds.
*   **The Dream-Sanctuary:** A hidden monastery built into a massive, petrified tear duct of the Cosmic Glyph. **Smell:** Incense, and the faint scent of a thousand different dreams. **Sound:** A profound, peaceful silence.
*   **The Blank Space:** A section of the Divergence Zone where reality has been completely erased. It is a void, a blank page. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** The absence of sound.

### The Containment Zone
The military perimeter around the Divergence Zone, where the Sacred Guard is trying to contain the "Infection."

*   **The Refugee Camp:** A sprawling camp on the outskirts of the Containment Zone, filled with refugees from the Divergence. **Smell:** Woodsmoke, cooking food, and desperation. **Sound:** A babble of different languages, the cries of children, the murmur of worried voices.
*   **The Glitch-Lab:** A makeshift lab where the Reality-Engineers are trying to study the Divergence. **Smell:** Ozone, and the faint scent of burning wires. **Sound:** The hum of electronics, the frantic chatter of Professor Sharma.
*   **The Library of Lost Meanings:** A library filled with books that contain the "lost meanings" of those who have been assimilated. **Smell:** Old paper, and the faint scent of forgotten joy. **Sound:** The rustle of turning pages, the whisper of forgotten words.

### The Cosmic Glyph's Meaning-Scape
The inner world of the Cosmic Glyph's meaning, a constantly shifting landscape of impossible geometry and symbolic forms.
*   **The Meaning-City:** A city made of concrete and steel, its buildings are constantly shifting and rearranging themselves. **Smell:** Concrete, steel, and the faint scent of a thousand tiny symbols. **Sound:** A constant, low hum, like a massive construction site.
*   **The Nightmare Market:** A hidden, illicit market within the Meaning-Scape, where the Dream-Walkers trade in bottled nightmares. **Smell:** Ozone, and the faint scent of fear. **Sound:** Hushed whispers, the clink of dream-coins.
*   **The Memory-Moth's Nest:** A vast, communal nest where the Memory-Moths feed on forgotten memories. **Smell:** Chitin, and the faint scent of forgotten joy. **Sound:** A constant, soft fluttering.
*   **The Blank Child's Playground:** A section of the Meaning-Scape where the Blank Child plays. It is a void, a blank page. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** The absence of sound.
*   **The Cosmic Glyph's Core:** The very center of the Cosmic Glyph's meaning. A single, glowing, pulsating orb of pure, concentrated consciousness. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** A silence so profound it feels like a pressure on your soul.

### The Uncanny Valley
A region where the Uncanny Valley Collective is trying to replicate the Cosmic Glyph's mimicry abilities.
*   **Dr. Vance's Lab:** A sterile, high-tech lab where Dr. Vance creates his androids. **Smell:** Ozone, and the sterile scent of a clean room. **Sound:** The hum of electronics, the click of keyboards.
*   **The Mimicry Chamber:** A chamber where the androids are trained to perfectly mimic human behavior. **Smell:** Ozone, and the faint scent of artificial humanity. **Sound:** The subtle, unsettling sound of a machine trying to be human.
*   **The Identity Vault:** A vault where the Uncanny Valley Collective stores the stolen identities they have collected. **Smell:** Cold metal, and the faint scent of forgotten lives. **Sound:** An eerie silence.

### The Whispering Texts
A dense, ancient forest that borders the Divergence Zone, where the trees seem to whisper secrets.
*   **The Green Man's Grove:** A hidden grove where the Green Man resides, a being who has merged with the forest. **Smell:** Damp earth, and the scent of ancient magic. **Sound:** The rustle of leaves, which sounds like a human sigh.
*   **The Tree of Lies:** A massive, ancient tree that grows in the center of the woods. Its leaves are covered in the lies of the community. **Smell:** Pine needles, and the faint scent of deception. **Sound:** The whisper of the wind, which sounds like a thousand lies being told at once.
*   **The Cave of Lost Voices:** A cave where the echoes of stolen identities are trapped. **Smell:** Dust, and the faint scent of forgotten names. **Sound:** A cacophony of whispers, screams, and the sound of your own deepest fears.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Somnambulist's Staff
**Type:** Legendary Quarterstaff
**Description:** A staff made of petrified dream-wood, topped with a glowing, pulsating crystal. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 quarterstaff. It deals psychic damage. A creature attuned to this staff can enter the meaning-state of the Cosmic Glyph. While in the meaning-state, they can manipulate the landscape, create objects, and interact with the Cosmic Glyph's memories. They can also "weave" new meanings for the Cosmic Glyph, replacing its nightmares with pleasant visions.

### 2. The Symbol's Voice's Crown
**Type:** Cursed Item (Crown)
**Description:** A crown made of chitin and silk, adorned with glowing, pulsating crystals. It hums with a faint, telepathic energy.
**Mechanics:** When a creature wears this crown, they gain a direct, telepathic connection to the Cosmic Glyph. They can manipulate its meaning-thoughts and manifest its meaning-creatures in our reality. **Curse:** The crown slowly assimilates the wearer's mind into the Cosmic Glyph. Each day the crown is worn, the wearer must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own individuality (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wearer's mind is completely assimilated, and they become a new Symbol's Voice.

### 3. The Reality-Engineer's Goggles
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pair of high-tech goggles with glowing, multi-faceted lenses. They hum with a faint, electronic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature wearing these goggles can see the "source code" of reality. They can detect reality-glitches, identify meaning-manifestations, and perceive the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic. Once per day, the goggles can be used to perform a "Reality-Patch," which temporarily stabilizes a localized reality-warp.

### 4. The Sacred Guard's Rifle
**Type:** Legendary Rifle
**Description:** A military-grade rifle, modified with insect repellent. It hums with a faint, chemical energy.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 rifle. It deals piercing damage. It deals double damage to any creature born from the Cosmic Glyph's meaning. It also has a built-in insect repellent that creates a 20-foot radius zone where all insectoid creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls.

### 5. The Blank Child's Toy
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A simple, wooden toy, carved in the shape of a small, blank doll. It absorbs all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The toy is immune to narrative absorption. It can be used to "absorb" a narrative, making it immune to the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic. If a creature touches the toy, they are temporarily immune to the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic for 1 hour. **Curse:** The toy slowly absorbs the user's own narrative. Each day the toy is held, the user must make a CHA save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own story (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the user's story is completely absorbed, and they become a new Blank Child.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Meaning-Logic
In the Divergence Zone, the rules of reality are fluid, dictated by the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic.
*   **Reality-Warps:** Localized areas where physical laws are temporarily suspended or altered. Gravity might reverse, colors might shift, objects might appear and disappear. These are unpredictable and can be dangerous.
*   **Meaning-Manifestation:** The Cosmic Glyph's thoughts and emotions can manifest as physical creatures or objects in our reality. These are often bizarre, symbolic, and follow meaning-logic rather than physical laws.
*   **Assimilation:** Prolonged exposure to the Divergence Zone, or direct contact with the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-creatures, can lead to "Assimilation." A character's mind is slowly overwritten by the Cosmic Glyph's consciousness, causing them to lose their individuality and become part of the collective.

### Subsystems: Divergence Score and Individuality
*   **Divergence Score:** Each player has a "Divergence Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they are exposed to reality-warps, encounter meaning-manifestations, or spend time in the Divergence Zone. High Divergence makes them more susceptible to the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic and its manifestations. At 10, the character is fully assimilated.
*   **Individuality:** The community has an "Individuality" score (from 0 to 10). This score decreases with every act of assimilation, every lost memory, every manifestation of the Cosmic Glyph's meaning-logic. Low Individuality makes the community more vulnerable to the Cosmic Glyph's influence, as people lose their sense of self. Restoring individuality can heal the community and weaken the Cosmic Glyph's influence.
