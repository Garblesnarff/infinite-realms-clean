# World-Building Specification: The Scales of Ma'at

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Scales of Ma'at**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players have died and entered the Duat, the Egyptian underworld. They must journey through the twelve gates of night to reach the Hall of Two Truths where their hearts will be weighed against Ma'at's feather. However, the judgment system is corrupted - innocent hearts are devoured while guilty ones pass. The players must solve this mystery while navigating the dangers of the Duat, confronting their own morality, and ultimately deciding whether to preserve, destroy, or reform the ancient system of divine judgment. This campaign explores justice versus law, the flaws in sacred systems, and whether imperfect order is better than chaos.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Egyptian creation myth: the primordial waters of Nun, the emergence of Atum/Ra, the creation of Shu and Tefnut, and the birth of the cosmos.
    *   Write the story of Osiris, Set, Isis, and Nephthys: Osiris's rule, Set's jealousy and murder, Isis's resurrection of Osiris, and Horus's revenge.
    *   Explain the daily journey of Ra through the sky and his nightly battle with Apophis in the Duat.
    *   Describe the 42 Negative Confessions and the sins they address, explaining Egyptian moral law.
    *   Detail the process of mummification, burial rites, and their importance for the afterlife.
    *   Explain the concept of Ka (life force), Ba (personality/soul), Akh (transformed spirit), and their roles in the afterlife.
    *   Write the history of Ma'at as both goddess and cosmic concept (truth, justice, harmony, balance).
    *   Describe the Book of the Dead (Pert Em Heru - Coming Forth by Day) and its spells for navigating the afterlife.
    *   Explain the role of wealth and knowledge in Egyptian judgment - how proper burial and magical knowledge affect outcomes.
    *   Detail Set's traditional role as necessary chaos, protector of Ra, and god of foreigners, contrasting with his vilification after Osiris's murder.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Court of Osiris** (Major - Traditional Authority)
        *   **Goals:** Judge souls fairly, maintain cosmic order, uphold Ma'at, preserve the Egyptian afterlife, protect the Duat from chaos.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Osiris as supreme judge, Ma'at as embodiment of law, the 42 divine assessor judges, Anubis as executor, Thoth as recorder.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Fair judgment of all souls based on Ma'at's principles.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Maintain power and order even when the system produces injustice; afraid reform would undermine divine authority; some members know the system is flawed but fear change.
        *   **Assets:** The Scales of Ma'at, the Hall of Two Truths, Ammit the Devourer, power over all souls, divine authority.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed to Set and chaos; served by Anubis and psychopomps; supported by most gods; respected but increasingly questioned by souls.

    *   **Set's Revolution** (Major - Chaotic Reform)
        *   **Goals:** Overthrow the corrupt judgment system, expose Ma'at's flaws, bring true justice rather than ritualistic law, gain revenge on Osiris.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Set as leader, corrupted souls as agents, damned spirits as army, chaos demons as shock troops.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None - operates secretly until strong enough.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Destroy the Scales of Ma'at, free Apophis to consume the unjust order, rule the reformed Duat with might-makes-right philosophy.
        *   **Assets:** Corruption magic, the Cave of Apophis, legitimate grievances that recruit followers, chaos as a weapon, intimate knowledge of the system's flaws.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed to Osiris personally and systemically; manipulates the damned and wrongly judged; allies with Apophis and chaos; avoided by most gods; compelling arguments attract some sympathizers.

    *   **The Souls of the Wealthy** (Minor - Privileged Class)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain afterlife privileges, avoid labor through shabti servants, preserve their paradise in the Field of Reeds, protect their status.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Pharaohs and high nobility at top, wealthy merchants and priests below, those with expensive burials as lower tier.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Enjoy earned paradise as reward for piety and proper burial.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many passed judgment through ritual knowledge rather than virtue; fear exposure of unworthiness; use wealth and influence even in death.
        *   **Assets:** Shabti servants, elaborate tombs, magical knowledge from expensive Book of the Dead copies, divine connections through temple donations.
        *   **Relationships:** Comfortable with Osiris's court; look down on poor souls; threatened by Set's populism; Anubis's mercy undermines their privilege.

    *   **The Common Dead** (Minor - Underclass Victims)
        *   **Goals:** Achieve rest and peace, reunite with families, avoid punishment, gain recognition of their worth despite humble lives.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy - just individuals struggling.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Pass judgment honestly and find peace.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Resent the wealthy souls who passed through ritual knowledge; some sympathize with Set's revolution; desire reform but fear chaos.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers, sympathy from some gods (especially Anubis), moral high ground, nothing to lose.
        *   **Relationships:** Judged more harshly than the wealthy despite equal virtue; helped secretly by Anubis; exploited by Set's revolution; represent the system's core injustice.

    *   **The Guardians of Balance** (Minor - Neutral Faction)
        *   **Goals:** Preserve Ma'at not as a system but as a concept, maintain cosmic balance between order and chaos, prevent total victory by either side.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Thoth as leader, Isis as powerful member, various minor deities who value balance, the Bennu bird.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Record and observe, maintain neutrality, preserve knowledge.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Seek reform but fear both Osiris's rigidity and Set's chaos; waiting for the right moment to act; gathering evidence and allies; might support the players if they offer a third path.
        *   **Assets:** All knowledge, powerful magic, respect from both sides, ability to remain neutral, connections throughout the Duat.
        *   **Relationships:** Technically loyal to Osiris but increasingly distant; not allied with Set but understand his grievances; willing to help the players find middle ground.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**

    *   **IF:** Players act virtuously (truth, justice, compassion) throughout the campaign.
    *   **THEN:** Reduce heart-weight stat. NPCs respond more positively. Anubis becomes ally. Final judgment more likely to be favorable. Generate scenes of moral impact.

    *   **IF:** Players act selfishly or cruelly.
    *   **THEN:** Increase heart-weight. Harder to pass judgment. Some NPCs hostile. Ma'at disapproves. Generate consequences and moral challenges.

    *   **IF:** Players expose evidence of judgment corruption.
    *   **THEN:** Osiris's court becomes defensive. Set gains followers. The corruption accelerates as it's threatened. Generate political upheaval and increased tension.

    *   **IF:** Players side with Set's revolution.
    *   **THEN:** Gain access to chaos magic and Set's knowledge. Opposed by Osiris's court. The Duat becomes more chaotic. Generate revolutionary plotline.

    *   **IF:** Players defend Ma'at's judgment despite its flaws.
    *   **THEN:** Gain favor with Osiris and gods. Opposed by Set and the wrongly judged. Preserve stability but perpetuate injustice. Generate conservative plotline.

    *   **IF:** Players propose reform rather than preservation or destruction.
    *   **THEN:** Interest from Thoth, Isis, and moderates. Opposition from both extremes. Difficult path requiring diplomacy. Generate reform plotline with coalition-building.

    *   **IF:** Corruption meter reaches critical levels.
    *   **THEN:** Apophis begins breaking free. The Duat becomes increasingly chaotic. Safe areas vanish. Urgency increases dramatically. Generate apocalyptic escalation.

    *   **IF:** Players pass through all twelve gates successfully.
    *   **THEN:** Gain authority and respect. Access to Hall of Two Truths. Major story milestone. Generate recognition and new abilities.

    *   **IF:** Players help the common dead or shabti.
    *   **THEN:** Gain populist support. Highlighted the system's injustice. Set tries to recruit them. Generate grassroots movement.

    *   **IF:** Players' hearts are weighed at campaign's climax.
    *   **THEN:** Results based on cumulative moral choices throughout. Possible outcomes: pass gloriously, pass marginally, fail but argue successfully for appeal, fail and face Ammit, transcend judgment entirely. Generate appropriate ending based on player path.

**7. Mechanics & Systems**
*   **Heart-Weight Tracking:** Measure moral choices. Lighter hearts pass judgment easier. Creates mechanical consequences for ethics.
*   **Negative Confession Challenges:** Must honestly recite or deceive about sins. Tests player character consistency.
*   **Hieroglyphic Puzzles:** Knowledge-based challenges highlighting ritual vs. virtue divide.
*   **Shabti Servants:** Wealthy characters have advantages showing systemic injustice.
*   **Divine Ka Points:** Spiritual energy for magic and resistance. Earned through virtuous acts.
*   **Corruption Meter:** World state tracking urgency and consequences.

**8. Theme & Tone Consistency**
*   **Core Themes:** Justice vs. law, truth vs. tradition, the flaws in sacred systems, whether imperfect order beats chaos, privilege and inequality even in the afterlife, moral complexity without easy answers.
*   **Tone Guidance:** Solemn and mystical but philosophically engaged. Not grimdark but not light - serious moral questions. Beautiful but ominous. Ancient wisdom but flawed application.
*   **Avoid:** Making Egyptian mythology seem primitive or simple, reducing complex moral questions to good vs. evil, ignoring the real historical inequality in Egyptian burial practices, treating the gods as purely symbolic rather than characters.
