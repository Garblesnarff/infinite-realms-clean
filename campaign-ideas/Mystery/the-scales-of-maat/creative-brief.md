# Creative Brief: The Scales of Ma'at

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Ancient Egyptian Mysticism

Inspired by authentic Egyptian tomb paintings, hieroglyphics, and the grandeur of pharaonic art, combined with darker underworld aesthetics. The style blends flat, profile-view Egyptian artistic conventions with more dimensional, atmospheric environments. Colors are rich and symbolic: gold for divinity, lapis blue for the heavens, ochre and terracotta for earth, black for the fertile Nile and death, green for rebirth. Everything is decorated with hieroglyphics and symbolic imagery.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Hieroglyphic Richness:** Every surface carries meaning - walls covered in hieroglyphics, symbolic imagery, cartouches, and religious iconography.
*   **Profile and Frontality:** Mix authentic Egyptian artistic conventions (profile faces with frontal torsos) with dimensional environments.
*   **Symbolic Colors:** Gold for gods, lapis blue for sky and truth, black for death and fertility, red for chaos, green for rebirth and Osiris.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Mystical, ancient, solemn, majestic, ominous, philosophical, ritualistic, symbolic, eternal, judgment.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of millennia, cosmic justice, mysteries of death, the majesty of the gods, moral reckoning. Everything is significant, ritualized, and bound by divine law. Beauty and terror coexist.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, stylized lines influenced by Egyptian tomb art but with dimensional depth. Hieroglyphic borders. Symbolic rather than purely realistic proportions.
*   **Textures:** Smooth painted stone, polished gold, lapis lazuli, weathered sandstone, the strange non-physical quality of the Duat itself.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Ancient Egyptian style illustration with hieroglyphic details and symbolic imagery. Clean stylized lines influenced by tomb art, dimensional environments with flat artistic elements, rich symbolic textures..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, symbolic colors with deep blacks, brilliant golds, lapis blues, ochre earth tones, malachite green, carnelian red.
*   **Accent Colors:** Gold leaf effects for divine elements. The strange twilight of the Duat - neither day nor night. Corrupted areas show sickly colors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich color palette of deep lapis blue, brilliant gold, black, ochre, and malachite green. Symbolic use of color following Egyptian conventions, with gold highlighting divine elements and rich earth tones grounding the composition."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Gods have animal heads or symbolic forms. Humans wear traditional Egyptian clothing - white linen, gold jewelry, elaborate headdresses. Mix profile and three-quarter views.
*   **Clothing:** Linen kilts and dresses, broad collars, golden jewelry, ceremonial headdresses. Gods wear divine regalia. Wealthy souls have elaborate funeral equipment.
*   **Expression:** Solemn, ritualized expressions in profile view. Gods are serene and eternal. Souls show fear or hope regarding judgment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ancient Egyptian scene showing Anubis, the jackal-headed god of death, standing in profile beside the Scales of Ma'at. Wearing golden collar and white linen kilt, hieroglyphics covering the walls behind him. Rich colors: black for Anubis, gold for the scales, lapis blue for the background."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Grand columned halls with hieroglyphic-covered walls, the surreal landscapes of the Duat, the Field of Reeds with perfect vegetation, the Lake of Fire with stylized flames.
*   **Atmosphere:** Neither day nor night in the underworld - eternal twilight. Lit by torches, divine radiance, and the mysterious glow of the Duat itself.
*   **Details:** Everything is covered in hieroglyphics, religious scenes, cartouches of pharaohs. Columns like lotus and papyrus. Gods and symbols everywhere.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Hall of Two Truths - a vast Egyptian temple interior with massive lotus-topped columns covered in hieroglyphics. The Scales of Ma'at in the center, Osiris on his throne at the end. Forty-two divine judges line the walls. Lit by braziers and divine light. Rich colors and symbolic imagery everywhere."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Mix flat Egyptian conventions with atmospheric lighting. Divine beings emit their own light. The Duat has strange twilight quality.
*   **Light Sources:** Braziers, torches, the glow of gods, Ra's barque in the distance, bioluminescent elements in the underworld.
*   **Shadows:** Stylized, sometimes following Egyptian flat conventions, other times atmospheric and dimensional.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lighting that mixes ancient Egyptian artistic flatness with dimensional atmosphere. Divine figures glow with inner light. Shadows are present but stylized. The eternal twilight of the Duat creates neither day nor night."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Symmetrical and balanced, following Egyptian artistic principles. Hierarchical scaling (important figures larger). Profile views mixed with three-quarter views.
*   **Techniques:** Use registers (horizontal bands) for storytelling. Symbolic placement. The Scales of Ma'at as central focal point in judgment scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A symmetrical composition in ancient Egyptian style showing the weighing of the heart. The Scales of Ma'at in the center, with the heart on one side and the feather on the other. Anubis adjusts the scales on the left, Thoth records on the right, Ammit waits below. Osiris watches from his throne above. Hierarchical scaling shows divine importance."

## Voice

A resonant, measured voice like an ancient Egyptian priest conducting sacred rituals. The narrator speaks with reverence and gravitas, using formal language that reflects the religious nature of the journey. Pronunciation includes authentic Egyptian names and terms. The tone is philosophical and solemn, pondering questions of justice and morality. Emotional range includes solemnity, wonder at divine majesty, tension during judgment, and moral weight. The voice carries millennia of wisdom and the seriousness of eternal judgment. Role: The high priest guiding souls through the mysteries of death and judgment.

## Music Direction

Orchestral with Egyptian ethnic instruments. Heavy use of ney flutes, sistrums, hand drums, and frame drums. Male and female vocals chanting in ancient Egyptian. The main theme should be mysterious and majestic, with the weight of eternal judgment. The Hall of Two Truths has solemn, ritualistic music. The Field of Reeds has peaceful, pastoral tones. The Lake of Fire has ominous, threatening sounds. Combat music uses percussion and brass with Egyptian modal scales. Moments of moral choice have spare, contemplative music. The corruption spreading has dissonant, unsettling tones. Reference: Philip Glass's "Akhnaten," Egyptian traditional music, "The Mummy" soundtrack, Natacha Atlas.

## Sound Design

Authentic ancient Egyptian ambience: the echo of sandals on stone floors, the rustle of linen, the clink of gold jewelry, the splash of the Nile. The Duat has otherworldly sounds - whispers of the dead, the slither of serpents, the crackle of divine fire. The Scales of Ma'at creak with cosmic significance. Ammit's growls mix crocodile, lion, and hippo. Ra's barque has the splash of oars and the hiss of serpent Apophis. Hieroglyphics emit soft glowing sounds. The corruption makes reality sound wrong - distorted, breaking. Hearts beat louder as judgment approaches. The sound of papyrus scrolls unfurling. Footsteps echo in massive stone halls. The environment should feel ancient, sacred, and slightly unreal - this is the afterlife, not the mortal world.
