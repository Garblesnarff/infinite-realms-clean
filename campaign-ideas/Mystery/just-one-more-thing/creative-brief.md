# Just One More Thing - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
1970s Los Angeles aesthetic meets fantasy setting. Warm colors, relaxed atmosphere contrasting with tense investigation. Focus on character rather than spectacle.

**Colors**: Raincoat beige, wealthy gold, LA sunset orange, cigar smoke grey, justice blue

## Music
"Columbo Theme" equivalent: Jaunty, quirky, memorable. Character-driven music. Tense moments with subtle strings. Resolution with triumphant but gentle theme.

## Voice Direction
**Columbo**: Working-class accent, rambling speech pattern, self-deprecating, sudden sharpness when springing trap. "Oh, my wife says the funniest thing about that..."

**Killers**: Variety based on character. All share: Initial condescension, growing concern, final respect or anger.

## Cinematic Moments
- Columbo's arrival: Rumpled, apologetic
- The murder: Executed perfectly (we watch it happen)
- The first "just one more thing..."
- The moment killer realizes they're caught
- Final confrontation: Polite destruction
- The arrest: Mutual respect, justice served
