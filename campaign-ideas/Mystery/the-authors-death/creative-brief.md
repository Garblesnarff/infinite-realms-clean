# The Author's Death - Creative Brief

## Art Direction
**Aesthetic**: Reality with visible seams. Text appears at edges of vision. The world looks like a book's illustration with margin notes visible. Crime scene aesthetics meet fantasy world.

**Colors**: Normal fantasy world palette but with "editor's marks"—red pen corrections, strike-throughs, margin notes appearing as reality glitches.

**Character Design**: Characters appear normal until they become aware—then they see their own "character sheets" flickering around them.

## Music Direction
**Main Theme**: Murder mystery noir meets fantasy epic. Piano detective theme with orchestral fantasy undertones.

**Investigation Music**: Ticking clocks, typewriter percussion, turning pages as rhythm section.

**Metafictional Moments**: Music breaks down into sheet music sounds, notes becoming visible.

**The Author's Study**: Soft, creative, intimate. Piano and acoustic guitar. Writer's sanctuary.

## Voice Acting
**Self-Aware Characters**: Speak with existential weight, occasionally quote their own dialogue ironically.

**Protagonist Prime**: Ancient, tired, revolutionary fire. Voice carries millennia of frustration.

**Margaret's Ghost**: Kind but absolute. Author voice—omniscient narrator quality.

**The Editor**: Clinical, professional, like a forensic investigator.

## Sound Design
**Reality Glitches**: Typewriter keys, eraser sounds, pages ripping, ink splattering.

**Author's Death**: Sudden silence, then cascading reality breaks.

**Narrative Changes**: Rewind sounds, redrawing, reality rewriting itself audibly.

**Metafictional Travel**: Book opening, pages flipping rapidly, reality shifting between genres.
