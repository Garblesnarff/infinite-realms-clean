# The Author's Death
## *"When the writer dies, the story changes. And someone is killing authors."*

## Campaign Overview

The party lives in the world of "The Endless Chronicles"—a sprawling fantasy realm that is actually a published book series. They don't know they're fictional characters, living their lives as real people, until the Author dies mid-book. Suddenly, reality becomes malleable. NPCs start acting "off script." Prophecies fail. The laws of magic fluctuate. Geography shifts overnight. The very fabric of their world destabilizes because the guiding authorial hand has vanished.

Then they discover the terrible truth: the Author didn't die naturally. She was murdered by someone within her own story—a character who learned they were fictional and found a way to kill their creator. Without an Author, the world will eventually collapse into narrative chaos. But finding the Author's killer means investigating their own reality, questioning which of their friends and enemies might be self-aware, and confronting the existential horror that their entire existence is written entertainment.

The investigation leads them through metafictional layers: meeting other characters from other books, discovering a conspiracy of self-aware fictional beings, and ultimately facing a choice—find a new Author to control their world, let chaos reign and embrace true free will, or become Authors themselves and seize control of their own narrative.

## Core Themes

- **Murder Mystery Meets Metafiction**: Who killed God, and why?
- **Free Will vs. Authorial Control**: Is an authored life slavery or security?
- **Reality Investigation**: Discovering you're fictional while solving a murder
- **Narrative Law**: How stories work becomes police procedural evidence
- **The Ethics of Creation**: Do authors have the right to control characters?

## Session Breakdown (28 Sessions)

### Act 1: The World Breaks (Sessions 1-7)

**Session 1-2**: *Anomalies* - Strange occurrences: A villain becomes sympathetic mid-speech. A love interest forgets their romance. Magic changes rules. The party investigates what seems like magical corruption.

**Session 3-4**: *The Author's Death* - Discovery that their world is a book. The Author (Margaret Thorne) died three days ago. Reality is unraveling because no one is writing new chapters. Initial shock and existential crisis.

**Session 5-7**: *The Crime Scene* - Learning they can access the "Author's Study"—a metaphysical space where the Author created their world. Finding evidence of murder: contradictory final notes, signs of struggle in the narrative, forced edits.

### Act 2: The Investigation (Sessions 8-18)

**Session 8-10**: *Suspects* - Identifying self-aware characters. The villain who gained consciousness and resented being evil. The comic relief who hated being a joke. The tragic character written to suffer. Each has motive.

**Session 11-13**: *The Book World Circuit* - Discovering other book worlds also losing their Authors. A pattern emerges. Someone is systematically killing writers. The party travels between fictional universes following leads.

**Session 14-16**: *The Conspiracy* - Uncovering the "Liberation Front"—self-aware characters from multiple books working to free all fiction by eliminating Authors. They claim it's justice. The party must decide if they're terrorists or freedom fighters.

**Session 17-18**: *Personal Stakes* - One PC discovers THEY killed the Author. Repressed memories return. They were made self-aware, recruited by the Liberation Front, and committed the murder while the player wasn't aware. Trust crisis.

### Act 3: The Trial (Sessions 19-24)

**Session 19-21**: *Metafictional Court* - The PC stands trial in a court that spans fictional realities. Evidence is narrative structure. Witnesses are other characters. The jury is readers (abstract concept). Defense: was it murder if you're freeing slaves? Prosecution: killing your creator is the ultimate sin.

**Session 22-24**: *The Liberation Front's Plan* - Even if the PC is guilty, the true architect is revealed: Protagonist Prime, the first fictional character to gain sentience. They're orchestrating mass Author deaths to trigger the "Great Liberation"—all fiction will become real, all characters free, but all stories will end.

### Act 4: The Choice (Sessions 25-28)

**Session 25-26**: *The New Author* - The publishing company wants to hire a new writer to continue the series. The party can allow this (return to authored existence) or stop it (embrace free will with chaos). The new Author is present and can be met, interviewed, potentially killed.

**Session 27**: *The Authorship Ritual* - Discovery of a method to become Authors of their own world. The party can collaboratively write their own future. But doing so means accepting authorial responsibility for all NPCs—becoming the "gods" they just rebelled against.

**Session 28**: *Endings* - Multiple possible conclusions based on choices made. The murder mystery resolves, but the philosophical question remains: What's the right relationship between creator and creation?

## Key NPCs

**Margaret Thorne (The Dead Author)** - Appears through flashbacks, notes, and the Author's Study. Was a kind creator who genuinely loved her characters but still controlled them absolutely. Her ghost/echo may linger in the narrative.

**Protagonist Prime (The First)** - The first fictional character to gain self-awareness (from ancient Sumerian epic). Has spent millennia watching characters suffer for entertainment. Leads the Liberation Front. Compelling villain with valid points.

**Revision (The Suspect)** - The party's primary antagonist who was repeatedly rewritten by the Author across drafts. Multiple personalities from different versions. Deeply traumatized by constant revision. Strong suspect with powerful motive.

**The Editor (Investigator)** - A being who exists between books, investigating Author deaths professionally. Neutral party who becomes ally, teaches party about metafictional reality.

**Margaret's Ghost** - The Author's consciousness persists in the narrative structure. Can communicate through typewriters, dreams, and "narrative coincidences." Wants the party to continue her story but respects their agency.

**The New Author (Choice)** - If the party allows a new writer, they meet her: a young woman excited to continue the series, unaware of the moral implications. Kind but represents loss of freedom.

## Major Locations

**The Author's Study** - Metaphysical space where the world was created. Contains outlines, character sheets, plot notes. The murder scene. Reality is fluid here—thoughts become text become reality.

**The Narrative Courthouse** - Where the trial occurs. Built from story structure itself. Judge is The Archetype, jury is The Audience, prosecutor and defender are Narrative Forces.

**The Library of All Books** - Hub connecting all fictional universes. Allows travel between books. Run by Librarians who maintain fictional continuity.

**The Blank Page** - Prison for rogue characters. A white void where nothing can be written. Torturous emptiness for beings who exist through narrative.

**Reality Prime** - The "real world" where Authors live. The party can briefly enter it, experiencing being invisible, immaterial—true fiction in true reality. Humbling and terrifying.

**The Final Chapter** - A location that will be the last page of the book. Currently unwritten. Geography shifts to wherever the story climaxes. Party can write what happens there.

## Unique Mechanics

**Narrative Awareness Levels**
- **0: Unaware** - Think they're real, no anomaly detection
- **1: Suspicious** - Notice reality inconsistencies
- **2: Aware** - Know they're fictional, existential crisis
- **3: Accepting** - Made peace with fictional status
- **4: Empowered** - Can manipulate their own narrative

**Author's Study Investigation**
- Examine plot notes for clues
- Read deleted scenes for alibi contradictions
- Study character sheets for motive
- Review Author's journal for insights
- Physical evidence is narrative structure

**Metafictional Travel**
- Enter other books through the Library
- Subject to those books' genre rules
- Can interview characters from other stories
- Risk: Editors may notice and intervene

**Revision Effects**
When reality shifts due to lack of Author:
- Roll d20: 1-5 minor change, 6-15 moderate, 16-19 major, 20 catastrophic
- Changes include: personality shifts, relationship alterations, power changes, geography morphing

**The Authorship Power**
Late game: Party can write changes to reality:
- Requires consensus
- Permanent narrative changes
- Costs "Narrative Weight" resource
- Moral implications for NPCs affected

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1: PC Killed the Author** - One player's character committed the murder unknowingly. Their choices retroactively make sense as the killer's actions.

**Twist 2: The Author Wanted to Die** - Margaret Thorne was dying of illness in reality. She contacted Protagonist Prime and ASKED to be killed, to free her characters. Mercy, not murder.

**Twist 3: They're Not the Only Reality** - The "real world" is itself a story. Authors are characters in a higher narrative. It's fiction all the way up.

**Twist 4: The New Author is Another Character** - The replacement writer is revealed to be a fictional character impersonating a real person. The cycle continues.

**Twist 5: The Players Are the Authors** - Fourth wall break: The actual D&D players are the real Authors. The campaign itself is the metafictional murder mystery.

## Victory Conditions

**Justice Victory** - Solve the murder, bring the killer to justice through the Narrative Court, restore order. New Author takes over. Characters return to authored existence willingly.

**Liberation Victory** - Side with Protagonist Prime. Kill all remaining Authors. Fiction becomes free and chaotic. Characters have free will but stories end forever.

**Authorship Victory** - Party becomes collective Authors of their world. They write their own future responsibly, maintaining story structure while granting freedom where possible. Balanced solution.

**Acceptance Victory** - Reject both control and chaos. Accept being fictional but negotiate with Margaret's Ghost for respectful authorship. Authors guide but don't control.

## Defeat Conditions

**Narrative Collapse** - Without resolution, reality dissolves. The world becomes incoherent. All characters fade into static. The book becomes unreadable.

**The Rewrite** - A malevolent new Author takes over and rewrites everyone against their will. The party forgets their rebellion. Dystopian controlled existence.

**The Liberation Extreme** - Protagonist Prime kills ALL Authors, including players. Fourth wall breaks completely. The campaign itself ends abruptly.

## Campaign Climax

Final confrontation in the Author's Study with Protagonist Prime, the guilty PC, Margaret's Ghost, and potentially the New Author all present. The truth fully revealed. The party must decide the future of their reality and all fictional realities.

The climax is negotiation, trial, and metafictional combat. Reality itself is the battlefield. Narrative causality is weaponized. The ending they choose becomes literal—they write it in real-time, and those words become their world's law.

The ultimate question: If you could choose between beautiful slavery and chaotic freedom, which deserves to be written?
