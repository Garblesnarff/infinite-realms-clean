# The Nine-Nine Precinct - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
Bright, colorful, energetic. Modern precinct aesthetic. Brooklyn neighborhood vibes. Warm lighting for found family moments. Dynamic camera work (in description) for physical comedy.

**Colors**: NYPD blue, warm yellows (friendship), vibrant primaries, Amy's binder colors, Rosa's black leather

## Music
Upbeat opening theme. Funk and soul for cool moments. Romantic comedy music for Jake/Amy. Epic orchestral for heist reveals. '80s/'90s nostalgia for Jake's references.

## Voice Direction
**Jake**: Enthusiastic, quick-witted, pop culture references, "Cool cool cool"
**Amy**: Slightly higher pitch when stressed, perfectionist precise speech, "Oh my god" variations
**Holt**: Monotone deadpan, perfect enunciation, devastating timing
**Terry**: Third person reference, gentle giant energy, "Terry needs..."
**Rosa**: Low, threatening, occasional warmth breaking through
**Charles**: Eager, food descriptions, Jake worship
**Gina**: Confident, dismissive, surprising wisdom
