Beginning as a child with their adventuring father, they witness his death and endure slavery, escape to build a family with a chosen spouse, and ultimately see their twin children continue the legacy. The Zenithian bloodline makes the family targets of a cult seeking to resurrect the Demon Lord, culminating in a multi-generational battle to break the cycle.
