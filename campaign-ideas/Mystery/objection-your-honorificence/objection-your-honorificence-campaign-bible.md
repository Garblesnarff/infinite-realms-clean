# Objection, Your Honorificence!: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Law" is not a set of rules. It is a sentient, self-perpetuating "narrative construct," a living story of justice, truth, and deception that has existed for centuries. Each "case" is not a trial; it is a "narrative thread" that binds reality together, preventing it from unraveling into chaos. The "Court" itself is a manifestation of humanity's collective desire for order, a cosmic stage that categorizes and controls all disputes, all crimes, all things that defy explanation. The "objections" are not just legal maneuvers; they are spells, rituals, and narrative commands that enforce the Court's will. The "Honorificence" is not a title; it is the deliberate act of making things "un-real," of erasing them from the collective consciousness, to maintain the illusion of a just world. The Court's "Chief Justice" is not a person, but the original, foundational precedent, a narrative seed that has grown into a monstrous, all-consuming story of legal control.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Dispute (Ancient History):** A powerful, inexplicable conflict occurs, threatening to unravel the fabric of society. Humanity's collective desire for order manifests as the first, faint whisper of a "precedent."
2.  **The Birth of the Law (c. -500 years):** The narrative seed achieves sentience, becoming the "Law." Its first "agents" are individuals whose lives are subtly shaped by the Law's narrative.
3.  **The Age of Justice (c. -400 to -100 years):** The Law grows, its narrative consuming more and more lives. It becomes a powerful, shadowy organization, manipulating history and erasing anomalies from behind the scenes.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day the Verdicts Wept (c. -100 years):** For 24 hours, all legal documents begin to weep tears of blood, turning the courtrooms into red rivers and causing many lawyers to question their ethics.
5.  **The Great Glitch (c. -50 years):** A powerful anomaly tries to "re-write" the Law's protocols, leading to a brutal internal conflict. The "Glitch-Weavers" are born from this schism.
6.  **The Rise of the Chief Justice (c. -20 years):** The original, foundational precedent, now fully sentient, becomes the "Chief Justice," the living embodiment of the Law's narrative.
7.  **Objection, Your Honorificence! (Present Day):** The Law initiates its most ambitious narrative yet: a global protocol designed to erase all injustice, all crimes, all things that defy legal control from the collective consciousness. The players are caught in the middle of this operation.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Glitch (1 week ago):** A single, powerful glitch in the global network echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original glitch.
9.  **The Narrative Collapse (Present Day):** The Law's narrative is becoming too complex, too contradictory. It is on the verge of collapsing, threatening to unravel the very fabric of reality.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Courtroom (1 day ago):** The entire world begins to manifest as a courtroom. People's lives become cases, their actions legal arguments. The horror of narrative control becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the dissolution of truth itself. The Law is not evil; it is a necessary evil. It forces people to conform to a mundane reality, preventing the world from unraveling into chaos. The players are caught in this web of protocols, and the horror comes from the realization that the enemy they are fighting is a reflection of their own desire for order. The goal is not to "win" against the Law, which is impossible, but to find a way to "re-write" its protocols, to introduce a new narrative of controlled chaos, or, perhaps, to find a way to accept the inherent chaos of existence without manifesting it into a global breakdown. The ultimate horror is the realization that you are just a defendant in someone else's trial.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Chief Justice's Gavel
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A polished, black gavel that hums with a faint, psychic energy. It is the symbol of the Chief Justice's authority.
**Mechanics:** The gavel cannot be moved by any physical means. A courtroom within a 1-mile radius of it is considered "in session." All legal arguments made within this radius are magically enforced, and all legal proceedings are immune to natural decay. Once per year, the courtroom's leader can perform the "Rite of Verdict," allowing them to ask the Gavel a single question about legal strategy, precedents, or jurisprudence, which it will answer by implanting a "blueprint" directly into their mind.

### 2. The Code-Breaker's Eraser
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, white eraser that seems to absorb all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this eraser to "un-write" a single, non-magical word from existence. If used on a creature, the creature must make a CHA save or have a single, minor memory erased. **Curse:** The eraser slowly consumes the wielder's own memories. Each day the eraser is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own memory. At 5 failures, the wielder's memory is completely erased, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 3. The Red Pen of Narrative Control
**Type:** Legendary Pen
**Description:** A simple, red pen that seems to hum with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this pen to subtly "edit" the Law's narrative. They can change minor details of the past or present, alter a character's personality, or introduce a new plot point. **Curse:** The pen slowly consumes the wielder's own identity. Each day the pen is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wielder's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Red Pen.

### 4. The MacGuffin of Ultimate Power
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A strange, glowing, and intricately-carved object. It hums with a faint, alluring energy.
**Mechanics:** The MacGuffin is a pure plot device. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. But everyone *thinks* it's incredibly important, and will try to steal it from you. Its presence subtly manipulates the Law's narrative, creating new plot points and driving the story forward.

### 5. The Deus Ex Machina's Watch
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pocket watch that seems to run backwards. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this watch to subtly manipulate time. They can rewind time by a few seconds, or fast-forward it by a few seconds. Once per day, the watch can be used to perform a "Deus Ex Machina" intervention, resolving an impossible situation, but at a cost. **Curse:** The watch slowly consumes the wielder's own sense of time. Each day the watch is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose their sense of time for 1 hour.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Code
In this world, the story dictates reality. Plot points are physical forces.
*   **Narrative Control:** Powerful Court agents can subtly manipulate reality by "re-writing" the narrative. A minor edit to a document might change a historical event. A well-placed rumor might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*   **Plot Armor:** Protagonists have "plot armor." They are impossibly lucky, surviving certain death because the story demands it. This manifests as a pool of "Story Points" that can be spent to avoid damage, succeed on impossible checks, or introduce a convenient plot twist.
*   **Deus Ex Machina:** When the narrative reaches an impossible impasse, a "Deus Ex Machina" will appear, resolving the situation in a sudden, unexpected, and often absurd way. This is not always benevolent.

### Subsystems: Narrative Score and Identity Score
*   **Narrative Score:** Each player has a "Narrative Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they perform actions that are "story-worthy" (heroic deeds, dramatic betrayals, witty banter). High Narrative makes them more susceptible to the Law's narrative control, but also grants them more "plot armor."
*   **Identity Score:** Each player has an "Identity Score" (from 0 to 10). This score decreases when they lie, pretend to be someone they're not, or keep secrets. Low Identity makes them more susceptible to the Law's narrative manipulation, as they lose their sense of self. Restoring trust and being honest can increase their Identity Score.
