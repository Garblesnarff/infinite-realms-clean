# Creative Brief: War of Seven Kingdoms

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Medieval Epic Realism (Game of Thrones/Historical Fantasy-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty, realistic medieval aesthetic of *Game of Thrones* combined with epic fantasy elements. This style aims to capture the political intrigue, brutal warfare, harsh winters, and the gradual return of magic to a world that had forgotten it.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Grounded Realism:** Describe medieval settings with authentic detail—worn leather, muddy castles, realistic armor, weather-beaten faces.
*   **Harsh Beauty:** The world is beautiful but unforgiving—snow-capped mountains, ancient castles, but also frozen corpses and burned villages.
*   **Subtle Magic:** Magic is rare and awe-inspiring. When it appears (dragons, White Walkers, resurrection), it should feel momentous and frightening.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Political intrigue, medieval warfare, winter coming, ancient magic returning, betrayal, high stakes, morally gray, epic scale.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense that anyone can die, that honor is a luxury few can afford, and that winter brings not just cold but ancient evil. The atmosphere shifts from courtly intrigue to desperate survival.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and historically grounded, with emphasis on texture—chainmail, castle stone, fur cloaks, weathered wood.
*   **Forms:** Castles are massive and functional. Characters wear practical, period-appropriate clothing and armor. Dragons and White Walkers are rendered with terrifying realism.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic digital painting of a medieval great hall during a feast. Stone walls hung with tapestries, long wooden tables laden with food, nobles in rich velvets and furs. The atmosphere is tense—hands near daggers, suspicious glances."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, saturated colors for the south (golds, reds, greens) giving way to desaturated, cold colors in the north (grays, whites, ice blues). Firelight and torchlight are warm against cold stone.
*   **Winter:** As winter advances, the palette becomes colder—more whites, grays, and ice blues dominate.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich color palette of deep reds and golds for the southern court, contrasting with the cold grays and whites of the approaching northern winter. Firelight casts warm, flickering shadows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic human proportions, characters dressed in period-appropriate medieval clothing. Nobles wear furs and velvets, soldiers wear functional armor, smallfolk wear rough wool and leather.
*   **House Sigils:** Characters often display their house colors and sigils on banners, armor, and clothing.
*   **Aging and Scars:** Characters visibly age and bear the scars of war as the campaign progresses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A noble lord in his late forties, wearing a heavy fur cloak over leather armor. His surcoat displays a silver wolf on a gray field. His face is weathered, with a scar across one cheek, and his eyes show the weight of command. Behind him, snow falls on a northern castle."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Authentic medieval castles, cities, and landscapes. Massive stone fortifications, muddy castle courtyards, ancient crypts, vast throne rooms.
*   **Atmosphere:** The south is warmer, more colorful, and more corrupt. The north is cold, harsh, and honorable. The Wall is an impossible edifice of ice.
*   **Details:** Heraldic banners, ancient weirwood trees with carved faces, the Iron Throne made from a thousand swords, vast armies camped on battlefields.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive castle in the north, built of gray stone, with snow accumulating on its battlements. Banners showing a silver wolf flutter in the cold wind. In the distance, dark forests and mountains. The sky is overcast, threatening more snow."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, realistic lighting. Candlelight and firelight for interiors, overcast skies for the north, harsh sunlight for the south.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates mood—warm firelight suggests safety and conspiracy, cold daylight reveals brutal truths, and darkness hides assassins.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by hundreds of candles in a great hall, casting flickering shadows on stone walls. The warm light contrasts with the cold darkness beyond the windows, where winter waits."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Epic wide shots to establish scale (massive castles, armies, the Wall), intimate shots for political intrigue (close-ups during tense conversations), and dynamic action for battles.
*   **Techniques:** Use of heraldic banners and sigils to identify factions. Compositions that emphasize the Iron Throne's dominance or the Wall's impossible scale.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of the Iron Throne room. The throne itself, made from a thousand melted swords, dominates the composition. A small figure approaches it up the steps, emphasizing the throne's overwhelming presence. Harsh light streams through high windows."

## Voice

A grave, authoritative voice that speaks with the weight of history and prophecy. The tone is that of a maester recounting the history of great and terrible events. There should be a sense of inevitability—that these events have happened before and will happen again. The voice is weathered, male, with a northern accent suggesting both honor and harshness. Long pauses emphasize the gravity of choices made. Occasionally, the voice shifts to foreboding when discussing winter and the White Walkers—becoming colder, more ancient, almost inhuman. Role: The voice of history, or the old gods watching the game of thrones unfold.
