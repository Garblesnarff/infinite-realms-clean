# Death Descent
## *When the mountain calls, only the fearless answer. And the mountain is screaming.*

### Campaign Overview

The Shattered Peaks are no ordinary mountain range—they're the corpse of a fallen titan whose death created the geography itself. For centuries, the mountains have been dormant, but recently they've begun to wake. Cracks in reality open along the slopes, revealing impossible trails that shift and reconfigure, testing riders who dare to descend. The indigenous Mountain Watchers discovered that extreme downhill runs—BMX and mountain biking at death-defying speeds—can reseal these reality rifts by "completing the veins," following the titan's fossilized circulatory system through the rock.

Players are members of the Descenders—an international coalition of extreme riders who compete in the Blood Runs, legendary trails that lead through pocket dimensions, time loops, and geological impossibilities. But a corporate entity called Summit Industries has militarized the mountains, installing ski resorts and "adventure parks" that damage the titan's remains and accelerate its awakening. If the titan fully resurrects, it will tear itself free from the earth's crust, causing a global catastrophe. The only way to prevent this is to complete the Thirteen Blood Runs before Summit finishes their drilling operation that will "wake the sleeper."

This is Descenders meets Mad Max: Fury Road meets Shadow of the Colossus, where every downhill run is a race against time, gravity, and the literal end of the world.

### Plot Twists & Complications

1. **The Titan Isn't Evil**: It's suffering and confused, not malevolent. Killing it feels like murder.

2. **Crash's Identity**: One PC will become Crash through time loop—they must die and travel back to help their past selves.

3. **Elder Kahale's Guilt**: His ancestors didn't kill the titan justly—they murdered it in its sleep for power.

4. **Dr. Summit's Possession**: She's partially merged with titan's consciousness, thinks she IS the mountain.

5. **The Thirteenth Run Has No Exit**: Completing it seals the titan forever but traps the riders inside.

6. **Axel's Sister**: The "accident" victim was his twin; he blames the mountain and wants it dead.

7. **Some Rifts Are Portals**: Leading to other titan corpses around the world—this is global.

8. **Summit Industries Is Right**: Waking the titan might be better than eternal imprisonment—moral ambiguity.

9. **Player Bike Is Titan Bone**: One PC's bike is forged from sacred remains; the titan wants it back.

10. **The Mountain Chooses**: Only riders the titan's subconscious approves can complete Blood Runs—worthiness tests throughout.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Complete all Thirteen Blood Runs, reseal the titan, destroy Summit's drilling operation, and ensure mountain's sanctity.

**Secondary Victories**:

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: Fail to complete Blood Runs in time; titan fully awakens and tears free from earth's crust. Continental devastation. Everyone dies.

**Partial Defeats**:
- Too many rifts open; mountain becomes uninhabitable
- Summit completes drilling; titan weaponized
- All Mountain Watchers killed or displaced
- Key riders die, making some Blood Runs impossible
- Player characters lose nerve and quit

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Seal titan but at cost of destroying the mountains themselves, rendering area lifeless.

### Campaign Tone

This campaign captures the raw terror and pure joy of downhill mountain biking—the moment you commit to a drop and there's no going back, gravity has you, and all you can do is hold on and trust your skill. Every session should feel like:

- **Watching Red Bull Rampage**: Impossible lines, massive consequences
- **Playing Descenders**: Procedural chaos, split-second decisions
- **Reading indigenous mythology**: Respect for nature and ancient power
- **Environmental thriller**: Racing against corporate destruction
- **Epic fantasy**: Titan-scale stakes
- **Found family**: Riders who become brothers/sisters through shared danger

DMs should emphasize:
- Detailed descriptions of speed and terrain
- Real fear before dangerous runs
- Camaraderie between riders (even rivals)
- Weight of fallen riders' memory
- Sensation of flow state when everything clicks
- Environmental beauty contrasted with industrial scarring

Make players feel every meter of elevation drop, every near-miss with death, every perfect landing after a massive jump. Make them respect the mountain and fear what they're riding on. Make them understand why someone would risk everything for one perfect run.

This is about confronting mortality at 60mph while the world literally falls apart around you.
