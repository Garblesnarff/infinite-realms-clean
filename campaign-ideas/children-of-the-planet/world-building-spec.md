### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Children of the Planet**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Eco-terrorists bomb Mako reactors draining the planet's Lifestream, then discover Sephiroth—a legendary SOLDIER—plans to become a god by summoning Meteor to wound the planet. They chase him across the world, confronting corporate greed, genetic experiments, false memories, and the question of whether humanity deserves the world it's destroying. The planet itself will judge if they're worth saving.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Cetra (Ancients)—the planet's original caretakers who could hear its voice, now extinct except one.
    *   Write about Jenova—the alien "Calamity from the Skies" that nearly destroyed the planet 2000 years ago.
    *   Describe Shinra Corporation's rise to power through Mako energy and the creation of SOLDIER program.
    *   Explain the Jenova Project—experiments to create human-Jenova hybrids, resulting in Sephiroth and failures.
    *   Detail the Nibelheim Incident five years ago when Sephiroth learned the truth and went insane.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Shinra Corporation** (Major): Megacorp controlling the world through Mako energy, has private army, owns everything.
    *   **Avalanche** (Major): Eco-terrorist group bombing reactors to save the planet, initially the party's faction.
    *   **The Turks** (Minor): Shinra's special forces—assassins, kidnappers, and fixers with twisted honor code.
    *   **Sephiroth's Remnants** (Major): Black-robed figures with Jenova cells compelled to reunite with him.

*   **Sector 7 Slums:** Working-class area, Avalanche's base, destroyed by plate collapse.
*   **Shinra Tower:** 70-floor headquarters with labs, prisons, and president's office on top.
*   **Nibelheim:** Mountain village where Sephiroth went insane, mysteriously "intact" despite burning.
*   **City of the Ancients:** Underwater crystal city, where Aerith prays and dies.
*   **Northern Crater:** Massive wound where Jenova landed, Sephiroth's final location in planet's core.

*   **IF:** Meteor is summoned → **THEN:** Seven days until apocalypse, Weapons attack everything, Shinra collapses.
*   **IF:** Party member confronts false memories → **THEN:** Identity crisis leads to temporary loss, eventual growth.
*   **IF:** Holy and Lifestream combine → **THEN:** Meteor is stopped barely, civilization nearly destroyed, planet judges humanity worthy.
