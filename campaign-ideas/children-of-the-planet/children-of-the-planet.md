**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party begins as eco-terrorists bombing Mako reactors operated by Shinra Corporation, which drains the planet's Lifestream—its literal soul—for energy. What starts as a mission to save the planet becomes a chase across the world when they encounter Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER who went insane and plans to wound the planet so deeply he becomes a god. They must confront corporate greed, genetic experiments, personal trauma, and the question of whether humanity deserves a world they're destroying. The planet itself will judge whether they're worth saving.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-30 sessions)

An epic three-act arc from eco-terrorism to saving the planet from godhood.

*   **Act I — Avalanche's Rebellion (Sessions 1-10):** The party are members of Avalanche, an eco-terrorist group bombing Mako reactors in Midgar, the corporate megacity. After a successful bombing, they meet a flower seller—the last Ancient, descendant of the planet's caretakers. Shinra captures her to find the Promised Land. The party stages a rescue from Shinra Tower, but during their escape, Sephiroth appears and massacres everyone. They flee Midgar as fugitives while Sephiroth hunts the Ancient to complete his plan.
*   **Act II — The World and the Past (Sessions 11-20):** Pursuing Sephiroth across the world, they learn the truth: he was created in experiments using cells from an alien entity called Jenova that nearly destroyed the planet 2000 years ago. Sephiroth believes he's an Ancient and wants to summon Meteor to wound the planet, absorbing the Lifestream to become a god. The party confronts their own pasts—false memories, corporate experiments, and identity crises. They discover Weapon creatures awakening—the planet's antibodies—that will destroy everything if not stopped.
*   **Act III — The Northern Crater (Sessions 21-30):** The race to the Northern Crater where Sephiroth waits. The Ancient sacrifices herself to summon Holy, the planet's defense, but Sephiroth kills her before it activates. Meteor is summoned; the planet begins to die. The party descends into the Lifestream itself to face Sephiroth in his perfect form. After his defeat, Holy activates, but the Lifestream itself surges to help—the planet chooses humanity, barely. The party disappears into the Lifestream, their fate uncertain.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of environmentalism versus progress, corporate power unchecked, identity and false memories, sacrifice for the greater good, and whether humanity deserves salvation. It asks: Can you save a world you're destroying? Are you who you remember being? Is it okay to sacrifice one person for everyone else? The central conflict pits the party's desire to save the planet against Sephiroth's plan to become a god and the planet's potential decision that humanity isn't worth saving.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Materia System**
*   Crystallized Mako contains abilities, magic, and summons
*   Slot Materia into equipment to gain powers
*   Materia levels up with use, becoming more powerful
*   Linked Materia slots create combinations (Fire + All = Firaga hits all enemies)
*   Some Materia has downsides (boost magic but lower HP)

### 2. **Limit Breaks**
*   When near death, characters can unleash ultimate attacks
*   Each character has unique Limit progression
*   Taking damage fills Limit gauge
*   Limits range from powerful attacks to healing to summons
*   Ultimate Limits require finding special items

### 3. **Lifestream and the Planet**
*   The planet is alive—Mako is its blood, Lifestream its soul
*   Draining Mako weakens the planet and angers it
*   Can communicate with the planet through Aerith or when near death
*   Planet sends Weapons to defend itself when threatened
*   Final battle happens inside the Lifestream itself

### 4. **Identity and Memory**
*   One party member has false memories implanted
*   Flashbacks contradict current knowledge
*   Jenova cells allow mimicry and mental manipulation

*   Character development tied to accepting painful truths

### 5. **Eco-Terrorism Morality**
*   Early missions involve bombing reactors—killing people
*   Collateral damage is significant and visible
*   The party must wrestle with necessary evil
*   Shinra retaliates by killing thousands—escalation spiral
*   No clear moral high ground, just choosing the lesser evil

### 6. **Weapon Encounters**
*   Planet's defense creatures are raid-boss level encounters
*   Can be fought or avoided depending on party strength
*   Each Weapon represents an element or aspect of nature
