# World-Building Specification Brief: The Humanoid Typhoon

**Core Concept:** Players travel with Vash the Stampede—a pacifist gunslinger with a $$60 billion bounty. He's not human but a Plant, bio-tech sustaining humanity on a desert planet. His twin brother Knives wants to exterminate humanity for exploiting Plants. Vash must choose between his species and his adopted family. The campaign is space western philosophy—can pacifism survive in a violent world?

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The SEEDS Project—generation ships that brought humanity to this desert planet 150 years ago.
*   Plants—bio-engineered beings that produce water, power, and food, but humans exploit them like batteries.
*   The Fall—how the ships crashed, stranding humanity in desert with only Plants sustaining them.
*   Independent Plants—Vash and Knives, the only Plants with humanoid form and free will.

**Factions:**
*   **Humanity:** Desperate frontier survivors, clustered around Plant bulbs, suspicious and violent.
*   **Knives's Cult:** Fanatics who believe Plants should rule, led by Legato, hunting Vash.
*   **Gung-Ho Guns:** Superhuman assassins sent to break Vash's pacifism.
*   **The Party:** Vash's traveling companions, learning whether idealism can survive reality.

**Locations:**
*   **Desert Planet:** Endless dunes, twin suns, hostile environment with scattered human settlements.
*   **July City Crater:** Massive impact site where Vash's Angel Arm killed 230,000 people.
*   **The Ark:** Floating SEEDS ship where Knives merges Plants into doomsday weapon.
*   **Desert Towns:** Frontier settlements built around Plant bulbs, harsh and desperate.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF Vash kills anyone, THEN his Guilt track increases, imposing mental penalties and nightmares.
*   IF the party doesn't stop Knives, THEN he activates merged Plants and genocides humanity.
*   IF Vash kills Knives, THEN he breaks his vow to Rem and becomes hollow forever.
*   IF Vash convinces Knives, THEN human-Plant coexistence becomes possible.
