# Above the Cloudline - World Building Specification

## World History and Cosmology

### The United Age (5000+ Years Ago)
Humans and giants lived together on the surface world. Giants were rare but integrated—farming, building, protecting. Cooperation was norm. Mixed settlements existed. Scale differences created specialization, not conflict.

### The Betrayal (3500 Years Ago)
Human mages, envious of giants' natural strength and longevity (giants live 500+ years), attempted mass poisoning using magical plague. Thousands of giants died before cure found. Giants retaliated with genocidal fury, nearly exterminating humans.

### The Separation (3000 Years Ago)
Archdruid Sylvanus, witnessing mutual extinction approaching, cast world-altering spell: raised clouds into solid landmass, lifted all surviving giants upward, erased memories of both species, transformed self into living seal (became first proto-beanstalk). Cost: own life and eternal duty.

### The Isolation Era (3000 Years of Separation)
- **Above**: Giants rebuilt civilization in clouds, legends of "below-void" where nothing exists
- **Below**: Humans rebuilt, giants became myths and fairy tales
- **The Spell**: Maintained by Sylvanus's will through plant-form existence
- **Slow Failure**: Over millennia, spell weakens, cloud magic falters

### Current Era
Spell finally failing. Beanstalks growing globally (campaign focuses on first major one). Contact inevitable. History about to repeat or be redeemed.

## Geography and Cosmology

### The Mortal World (Below)
Standard D&D world, medieval-renaissance tech level, magic common. Many kingdoms, diverse peoples. Giants are myth from fairy tales (Jack and the Beanstalk, etc.).

### The Cloudline (Boundary)
- Altitude: ~40,000 feet (where clouds solidify)
- Nature: Magical barrier, sustained by Sylvanus's spell
- Effect: Clouds below are vapor, above are terrain
- Weather: Giants shape weather that falls to mortal world
- Breach: Beanstalk penetrates barrier, weakening locally

### The Cloud Kingdoms (Above)
- **Size**: Equivalent to continent
- **Terrain**: Solidified clouds (soft like moss, solid like earth), crystal formations, weather-gardens
- **Climate**: Controlled by giants, always temperate in settlements
- **Danger Zones**: Storm fronts, falling cloud sections, void edges where clouds end
- **Population**: ~500,000 giants across multiple kingdoms

### Sky Geopolitics
- **Kingdom of Nimbus**: Agricultural, traditional, King Cumulus rules
- **Storm Peaks**: Military state, Lady Tempest's faction
- **Crystal Spires**: Scholarly, Seeker Nimbus's home
- **Trade Winds**: Merchant confederacy
- **Wild Clouds**: Untamed regions, dangerous sky-beasts

### The Beanstalk Network
- First major beanstalk in campaign focus
- Others growing across world (dozens appearing)
- Each connects to different cloud kingdom region
- Sylvanus is network—distributed consciousness
- Could become permanent connection between worlds or be destroyed entirely

## Magic System

### Cloud Magic (Giant Specialty)
- Solidifies vapor into terrain
- Shapes weather
- Crystal growth and manipulation
- Requires altitude—doesn't work in mortal world
- Giants innately magical (like dragons—old age increases power)

### The Separation Spell
- Grand ritual magic, impossible to replicate
- Maintains cloudline solidity
- Memory alteration component
- Self-sustaining through Sylvanus's transformed existence
- Breaking requires consent or destruction of all beanstalk network

### Giant Racial Magic
- Storm Giants: Lightning, wind control, weather mastery
- Cloud Giants: Fog, solid cloud creation, flight
- All giants: Natural magic resistance, strength enhancement, longevity

### Human Magic
- Standard D&D magic
- Giants have advantage on saves (magic resistance)
- Anti-giant magic: specifically developed spells (historical—from genocide attempts)
- Scale-adjustment magic: Enlarge/Reduce critical for interaction

## Inhabitants and Factions

### Giant Society

**Class Structure**:
- **Royalty**: Ancient bloodlines, weather-shaping abilities
- **Nobility**: Warriors, scholars, wealthy merchants
- **Commoners**: Farmers, crafters, laborers (most giants)
- **Outcasts**: Too small, too weak, criminals, heretics

**Culture**:
- Honor-based, value strength and longevity
- Family units, slow reproduction (centuries between generations)
- Art focuses on grand scale, weather-sculpture, crystal-shaping
- History taught through oral tradition (books too durable—never decay)

**Life Cycle**:
- Childhood: 50 years (Grimble is ~40, still child)
- Adulthood: 100-500 years
- Elders: 500+ (Nimbus is ~600)
- Death: Usually from falling, accidents, or rare illness

### Political Factions

**Isolationists** (Traditional): Keep separation, destroy beanstalks, risk extinction alone
**Warmongers** (Storm Peaks): Invade mortal world preemptively, conquer before cloud-fall
**Traders** (Merchant Confederacy): Establish commerce, peaceful coexistence, profit motive
**Scholars** (Crystal Spires): Study mortals, seek knowledge, preserve history

### Human Factions

**Royal Court**: Bureaucratic response, unsure how to handle giants
**Military**: Preparing for war, developing anti-giant tactics
**Merchants**: See opportunity for trade (giant goods worth fortunes)
**Peasants**: Terrified of legends coming true
**Adventurers**: See climbing beanstalk as glory opportunity

## Cultural Details

### Giant Daily Life
- Farming cloud-crops (unique flora growing in solid clouds)
- Weather-shaping as public works (rain scheduled for mortal world below)
- Crystal crafting (giant artisan goods)
- Sky-sailing (cloud ships for travel)
- Slow-paced compared to humans (conversations take hours)

### Inter-Giant Relations
- Different giant types (storm, cloud, stone) have political tensions
- Marriage alliances between kingdoms
- Coming-of-age rituals involve weather challenges
- Death ceremonies: bodies placed on dissolving clouds, descend as rain

### Human-Giant Interaction Challenges
- **Communication**: Volume, speed of speech, understanding
- **Safety**: Giants can accidentally crush humans
- **Perception**: Giants struggle to see human-sized beings
- **Time**: Giants think and act slower
- **Culture**: Vastly different values and customs

## Plot Secrets

**Secret 1**: Sylvanus is in constant agony, maintaining spell through suffering
**Secret 2**: Giants remember the genocide in cultural myths (accurately)
**Secret 3**: Humans have anti-giant weapons hidden in ancient armories (from genocide era)
**Secret 4**: The cloud-fall is accelerating—20 years until total collapse, not centuries
**Secret 5**: Jack's theft caused diplomatic incident that nearly restarted war 30 years ago
**Secret 6**: Some giants want cloud-fall to happen (see death as joining mortal world finally)
**Secret 7**: Ancient artifact exists that could expand cloud magic to cover mortal world (everyone could live above)
**Secret 8**: Other beanstalks connecting to other kingdoms—campaign's events influence global politics
**Secret 9**: Giant children and human children can understand each other innately (magic recognizes shared ancestry)
**Secret 10**: Sylvanus wants to die and will support whoever gives compelling vision for future

### Key Locations Details
- **Nimbus Village**: 200 giants, agricultural, first contact site

This world emphasizes **perspective over power**—giants are stronger but not evil, humans are smaller but not helpless. Coexistence requires understanding, compromise, and overcoming historical trauma. The campaign asks: Can two peoples who tried to genocide each other find peace? And if not, who deserves the world—those who were here first, or those who need it now?
