# Campaign Bible: Above the Cloudline

## **1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY**
`[TAG: LORE_CORE]`

### **Origin Myth: The Breath of the Sleeping Titan**
Before gods, there was only the Titan known as **Aethos**, who held the sky upon his shoulders. When the First Betrayal occurred—the moment mortality was invented by a jealous star—Aethos did not fight. Instead, he wept, and his grief was so heavy it solidified into the earth, while his final, ragged breath refused to dissipate. This breath became the **Cloud Continents**, held aloft not by physics, but by the Titan's dying wish that some part of him remain untouched by the mud of the world below. The Beanstalks are not merely plants; they are the stitching that accidentally binds the Titan’s corpse (Earth) to his ghost (Sky).

### **Timeline of Events**
1.  **-3,500 The Gray Plague:** Humans attempt to poison the giants using *The Dust of Envy*. The wind shifts unexpectedly, killing 40% of the human population instead, creating the *Wailing Badlands*.
2.  **-3,000 The Great Ascendance (The Separation):** Archdruid Sylvanus weaves the *Verdant Lock*. The clouds solidify. Giants retreat upward. The sun turns green for a decade due to the magical discharge.
3.  **-2,400 The Era of Falling Whales:** A metaphysical glitch causes ocean life to spawn in the sky. For fifty years, it rains blue whales upon human cities. This leads to the invention of "Umbrella Architecture" (reinforced roofs).
4.  **-1,500 The Silence of the Birds:** All avian life in the mortal world stops singing for one year. It is later discovered they were listening to a proclamation from the Cloud King, carried on a subsonic draft.
5.  **-800 The Giant Who Fell:** A cloud-giant adolescent, **Gargantua the Clumsy**, falls from the Nimbus Kingdom. His impact creates *Lake Omen*. His skeleton is now a dungeon inhabited by kobolds who worship his femur.
6.  **-300 The Whispering Fog:** A cloud descends to ground level but doesn't dissipate. Those who walk into it disappear and return speaking a language of pure vowels. They claim to have seen "The Gears of the Sky."
7.  **-30 Jack’s Heist:** Jack Oldtree climbs the first rogue tendon of the Beanstalk. He steals the *Goose of Infinity*. The resulting magical imbalance causes a drought in the Cloud Kingdom that lasts ten years.
8.  **-10 The Roots Stir:** Seismologists report earthquakes that feel "rhythmic," like a heartbeat. The Sylvanus entity begins to wake.
9.  **-1 Day Zero:** The Beanstalk erupts through the capital plaza of Oakhaven. It grows 9 miles in 6 hours. The sonic boom of its growth shatters every window in a 50-mile radius.
10. **Present Day:** The "Sky-Blindness" lifts. Mortals can suddenly see the glimmer of crystal castles in the upper atmosphere, previously cloaked by the Separation Spell.

### **The Metaphysical "Why"**
The conflict is not just biological; it is **Dimensional Friction**. Gravity (The Law of the Earth) seeks to pull everything down. Levity (The Law of the Sky) seeks to untether existence. The Beanstalk acts as a lightning rod grounding Levity into Gravity. If the connection holds, the Earth might float apart; if it snaps, the Sky will crash. The Giants are beings of Levity—their morality is detached, lofty, and abstract. Humans are beings of Gravity—grounded, heavy with desire, and dense with history.
