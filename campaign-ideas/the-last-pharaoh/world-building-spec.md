# The Last Pharaoh - World-Building Specification

## Factions

**Ptolemaic Egypt**
- Hellenistic kingdom ruling Egypt 305-30 BCE
- Greek-Macedonian dynasty, Egyptian subjects
- Wealth from agriculture, trade, taxation
- Decline: Civil wars, Roman dependence, reduced territory

**Roman Republic (Transitioning to Empire)**
- Senate vs. Strongmen (Pompey, Caesar, Antony, Octavian)
- Expanding empire, Mediterranean domination
- Egypt: Wealthy prize, strategic location, grain supply
- Cultural tension: Greek sophistication vs. Roman pragmatism

**Jewish Judea (Herod's Kingdom)**
- Client kingdom, balances Rome and regional powers
- Herod: Switches from Antony to Octavian (political survivor)

**Parthian Empire**
- Eastern rival to Rome
- Antony's failed campaign weakens his position
- Potential ally for Egypt (never materializes)

## Extended NPCs

**Marcus Agrippa**: Octavian's general, actually wins Actium (Octavian gets credit)
**Cornelius Gallus**: Roman prefect of Egypt post-conquest
**Sosigenes**: Astronomer, helped Caesar reform calendar
**The Ptolemaic Court**: Eunuchs, advisors, generals, priests (complex web)

## Locations

**Library of Alexandria**: 700,000 scrolls, greatest ancient knowledge repository, partially burned 48 BCE
**The Lighthouse (Pharos)**: One of Seven Wonders, guides ships, symbol of Alexandria
**Cleopatra's Tomb**: Built before death, where she and Antony buried together
**Actium Bay**: Naval graveyard where Eastern empire dream dies
**Nile Valley**: Agricultural heartland, 3,000-year civilization

## Historical Context

**Ptolemaic Dynasty**: Founded by Ptolemy I (Alexander the Great's general), 300-year rule, intermarriage weakened bloodline

**Roman Civil Wars**:
- First Triumvirate: Caesar, Pompey, Crassus
- Caesar's Dictatorship & Assassination
- Second Triumvirate: Antony, Octavian, Lepidus
- Final War: Octavian vs. Antony & Cleopatra

**Egyptian Religion**: Cleopatra portrayed as Isis incarnate, revived pharaonic traditions, maintained priestly support

**Languages**: Cleopatra first Ptolemy to learn Egyptian (300 years!), also spoke 9 languages total

## Causality Chains

1. **Caesar's Protection**: If Caesar lives longer, Egypt more secure
2. **Actium**: Victory = Eastern empire reality. Defeat = Roman absorption
3. **Octavian's Seduction**: If successful, Egypt might survive as client state
4. **Caesarion's Survival**: If escapes, alternative claimant to Roman empire
5. **Library's Fate**: Preserve or lose ancient knowledge

## Legacy

**Cleopatra's Reputation**: Transformed by Octavian's propaganda from skilled politician to seductress. Modern reclamation of her intelligence and capability.

**Egypt's End**: Last independent pharaonic state. Becomes Roman province, bread basket of empire. Islamic conquest 639 CE ends Greco-Roman period.

**Cultural Preservation**: Ptolemaic synthesis of Greek and Egyptian culture influences Roman world. Alexandria remains intellectual center for centuries.
