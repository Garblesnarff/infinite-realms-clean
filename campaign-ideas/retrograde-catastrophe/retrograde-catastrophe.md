# Retrograde Catastrophe
**Tagline:** *When the stars move backward, the world turns inside out*

## Campaign Overview

In the realm of Stellara, zodiac magic has always been predictable and stable. But three weeks ago, something unprecedented happened: all twelve zodiac constellations began moving backward through the sky simultaneously, an astrological impossibility called the Omniversal Retrograde. The effect on the world has been catastrophic and bizarre - every zodiac sign's nature has inverted, turning their greatest strengths into corrupted opposites.

Brave Aries warriors have become cowardly and paralyzed by indecision. Generous Leo rulers hoard resources and refuse to help citizens. Balanced Libra judges make snap decisions without consideration. Emotional Cancer nurturers have become cold and detached. The entire social order has collapsed as personalities invert and people no longer recognize their friends and family.

The party, mysteriously immune to the retrograde effect (or so they believe initially), must navigate this backwards world to discover what caused the Omniversal Retrograde and how to reverse it before the inversions become permanent in 30 days. They'll journey through twelve inverted kingdoms, each a twisted mirror of what it should be, and discover that the retrograde was caused by something attempting to escape from the celestial machinery itself - a being called the Reversal, born from all the rejected and suppressed traits the zodiac signs denied in themselves.

## Core Themes

- **Shadow Self:** Confronting the parts of ourselves we reject
- **Personality as Destiny:** What happens when who you are fundamentally changes?
- **Acceptance vs. Denial:** Growth requires acknowledging our flaws
- **Balance Through Integration:** Wholeness requires embracing opposites
- **The Cost of Perfection:** Striving to be only our "good" traits creates monsters

## Session Breakdown (18 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Backward World (Sessions 1-2)
- Session 1: The party awakens to find their home city completely transformed. People they know act like strangers. The cowardly are now brave, the kind are now cruel. Investigation reveals all zodiac signs have gone retrograde simultaneously.
- Session 2: They discover they're immune because each party member is a "Cusp Child" - born during the transition between signs, containing aspects of two signs. This makes them anchors against retrograde. They must find the Retrograde Engine, the cosmic mechanism causing this.

### Arc 2: Retrograde Aries - Cowardice Kingdom (Session 3)

**Normal:** Prideful, dramatic, generous, center-stage
**Retrograde:** Self-loathing, subdued, miserly, background

### Arc 7: Retrograde Virgo - Chaos Kingdom (Session 8)
**Normal:** Perfectionist, analytical, critical, service-oriented
**Retrograde:** Chaotic, irrational, accepting, self-serving
- The ordered kingdom has become beautiful chaos. Lady Analytica celebrates imperfection and destroys her own creations for art. Nothing functions, but everyone is happy. The party finds technical information about retrograde mechanics.

### Arc 14: The Celestial Undercroft (Sessions 15-16)
- Session 15: Beneath the world lies the Celestial Undercroft - the cosmic machinery that maintains zodiac magic. Here, the party meets the Reversal, a being formed from all the traits each zodiac sign rejected and suppressed over millennia. It's not evil - it's hurt.
- Session 16: The Reversal explains that zodiac lords forced themselves to be one-dimensional, rejecting their shadow selves. These rejected aspects accumulated until they gained consciousness. The Reversal caused the retrograde to show the zodiac what they'd become by denying their wholeness.

### Arc 15: The Choice (Sessions 17-18)
- Session 17: The party must decide: destroy the Reversal and restore the status quo, or help the Reversal integrate back into the zodiac signs. Integration means each sign becomes more complex and flawed, but whole. The party learns they're not fully immune - they're also retrograde, just balanced by having two signs.
- Session 18: Final confrontation with the zodiac lords, who must each accept their shadow selves. The party facilitates integration or battle, depending on their choice. Victory means a new, more complex zodiac or return to the old, simpler system.

### The Reversal

**Nature:** A composite entity formed from all twelve zodiac signs' rejected shadow aspects
**Appearance:** Constantly shifting between twelve shadow forms, a dark mirror of each sign
**Personality:** Hurt, rejected, but not evil. Wants recognition and integration, not destruction
**Powers:** Can invert any zodiac magic, exists in the cosmic machinery, controls retrograde
**Motivation:** To be acknowledged as part of the whole, not destroyed as "bad"

**The Reversal's Truth:** It represents the idea that perfection requires accepting flaws, strength requires acknowledging weakness, and wholeness requires integrating what we reject.

### The Cusp Children

**The Party:** Each member born during sign transitions (Aries-Taurus cusp, etc.)
**Their Immunity:** They contain both signs, so reversing one doesn't destroy them
**Hidden Truth:** They're also retrograde - they exhibit the shadows of their cusps
**Role:** They can facilitate integration because they already embody duality

## Major Locations

**The Twelve Kingdoms (All Inverted):**
Each kingdom has become a twisted opposite of itself, architecturally and culturally.

**The Celestial Undercroft:**
- Hidden beneath the world
- Vast cosmic machinery of gears, stars, and magic
- The Retrograde Engine at its center
- Where the Reversal was born and dwells
- Reality is fluid; belief shapes surroundings

**The Hall of Mirrors:**
In each inverted kingdom, a location where people can briefly see their true selves reflected, creating temporary sanity

**The Cusp Sanctuary:**
Where people born on sign cusps gather, more resistant to retrograde effects

## Unique Mechanics

### Retrograde Tracking
Each PC has a Retrograde Meter (0-10):
- Normal: 0-2 (slightly inverted, manageable)
- Concerning: 3-5 (personality shifts become noticeable)
- Dangerous: 6-8 (major personality inversion)
- Critical: 9-10 (complete reversal, NPC control)

Actions that align with shadow self increase the meter. Actions that integrate both sides decrease it.

### Shadow Aspects
Each PC has a shadow aspect based on their sun sign:
- Aries Shadow: Cowardice and over-analysis
- Taurus Shadow: Wastefulness and instability
- Gemini Shadow: Single-mindedness and silence
- Cancer Shadow: Cruelty and detachment
- Leo Shadow: Self-hatred and invisibility
- Virgo Shadow: Chaos and self-service
- Libra Shadow: Extremism and isolation
- Scorpio Shadow: Transparency and apathy
- Sagittarius Shadow: Confinement and tact
- Capricorn Shadow: Aimlessness and rule-breaking
- Aquarius Shadow: Conformity and tradition
- Pisces Shadow: Harsh realism and boundaries

Players must roleplay shadow aspects when retrograde increases.

### Inversion Magic
In retrograde kingdoms, all magic works backward:
- Healing spells harm
- Attack spells heal
- Light creates darkness
- Summoning banishes
- Creative experimentation required

### Integration Mechanics
When a zodiac lord accepts their shadow:
- Kingdom begins to normalize
- Lord gains complexity and depth
- Retrograde decreases globally
- New combined powers emerge

### The 30-Day Countdown
- Each day, retrograde becomes harder to reverse
- After 30 days, inversions become permanent
- Creates urgency to move quickly
- Visual changes: sky becomes more backwards, celestial bodies wrong

## Plot Twists and Complications

### Major Revelations

1. **The party is also retrograde:** They're balanced between two signs, not immune. They exhibit shadow aspects too.

2. **Some prefer retrograde:** Certain NPCs like their inverted selves better and resist restoration.

3. **The zodiac lords caused this:** By rejecting their shadows for millennia, they created the Reversal.

4. **Integration makes signs "flawed":** Accepting shadows means zodiac lords become more complex and less archetypal.

5. **The Reversal is necessary:** Without shadow integration, the zodiac is incomplete and unstable.

6. **One lord refuses integration:** Must be forced or convinced, creating final conflict.

7. **The retrograde is spreading beyond Stellara:** Other worlds are beginning to invert.

8. **True immunity doesn't exist:** Everyone has shadows, even cusp children.

### Complications

**Session 3 Complication:** A party member discovers they enjoy being retrograde.

**Session 6 Complication:** Retrograde Cancer captures the party, treating them cruelly.

**Session 9 Complication:** The unfair trial sentences a party member to death.

**Session 12 Complication:** Without ambitious Capricorn, no one guides the party; they must self-direct.

**Session 15 Complication:** The Reversal offers to make party members permanently retrograde if they join it.

**Session 17 Complication:** Half the zodiac lords want to destroy the Reversal; half want integration.

**Session 18 Complication:** Accepting shadows means the zodiac will never be as simple and clean again.
