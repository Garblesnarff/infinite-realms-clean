# Creative Brief: The Bathhouse Beyond

## Art Style: Studio Ghibli Wonder meets Traditional Japanese Architecture

Lush, hand-painted magical realism combining traditional Japanese aesthetics with fantastical spirit designs. Everything feels both ancient and timeless, grounded yet impossible—traditional bathhouse architecture meets creatures from folklore and imagination.

### Core Principles:
*   **Rich Detail:** Every corner is filled with life, texture, and small wonders
*   **Organic Magic:** Supernatural elements feel natural within the world's logic
*   **Emotional Landscapes:** Environments reflect the emotional journey of characters

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Warm nighttime colors—deep indigos and purples for the spirit town sky, golden lantern light, rich browns and reds of wooden architecture. The bathhouse glows with amber light from within. Day scenes use soft watercolor washes. Spirits range from ethereal whites to vibrant, saturated colors.

**Character Design:** Spirits range from beautiful to grotesque to adorable—radish spirits, soot sprites, frog attendants, elegant gods. Yubaba has an enormous head and gaudy jewelry. Haku is beautiful as a boy, majestic as a dragon. No-Face is simple black silhouette with a white mask. Human characters are realistically proportioned but expressively animated.

**Environments:** The bathhouse is impossibly detailed—six stories of wooden architecture with red bridges, paper lanterns, steam rising from baths, gardens on balconies. The spirit town at night is a lantern-lit wonderland. Zeniba's cottage is rural simplicity. The flooded plain crossed by the train is melancholic and beautiful.

**Composition:** Use vertical space to emphasize the bathhouse's grandeur, intimate framing for character moments, wide vistas for the spirit realm's otherworldly beauty. Everything should feel lived-in and functional despite being magical.

## Voice

Gentle, observant narrator with a sense of wonder tinged with melancholy. Like someone recounting a strange dream that changed them—curious rather than frightened, finding beauty in the weird. The emotion balances childlike wonder with mature reflection on identity and growth. Role: A visitor to the spirit world trying to understand and appreciate it while maintaining who they are.

## Music Style

Traditional Japanese instruments (shamisen, taiko drums, shakuhachi flute, koto) blended with orchestral warmth in the style of Joe Hisaishi. The bathhouse theme is bustling and energetic with playful percussion. Haku's theme uses flowing strings and flute suggesting water and flight. No-Face has an unsettling, minimal piano melody. The spirit train sequence is melancholic and contemplative. Yubaba's music is bombastic and slightly grotesque. Zeniba's cottage theme is gentle and domestic. Overall tone is wondrous, mysterious, and emotionally resonant.
