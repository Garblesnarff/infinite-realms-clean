# Creative Brief: The Cordyceps Crown

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Naturalism with Oppressive Beauty (The Last of Us-inspired)

Inspired by the grounded, naturalistic aesthetics of *The Last of Us* with emphasis on nature reclaiming civilization and fungal horror. This style captures the beauty of decay, the horror of Cordyceps infection, desperate human survival, and the contrast between hope (Ellie) and darkness (the infected world).

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Nature Reclaiming:** Overgrown cities, vines through windows, trees in highways, beautiful desolation
*   **Grounded Realism:** Photorealistic, practical clothing, worn weapons, visible damage and dirt
*   **Fungal Horror:** Cordyceps growth visible on infected, walls, environmental body horror
*   **Emotional Weight:** Intimate character moments, visible trauma, found family tenderness

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Post-apocalyptic, survival horror, naturalism, found family, moral darkness, fungal infection, beauty in decay, desperate hope
*   **Feeling:** The weight of loss and the fight to find meaning. Beauty in a dead world. Love in darkness. Impossible choices.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary Palette:** Overgrown greens, concrete grays, rust browns, earthy tones
*   **Infection Colors:** Sickly yellows, fungal oranges, spore whites, corrupted flesh tones
*   **Lighting:** Golden hour light through broken windows, flashlight beams in darkness, overcast skies
*   **Prompt Example:** "...naturalistic color palette with overgrown green vegetation overtaking gray concrete ruins. Rust-brown metal, weathered wood. Sickly yellow-orange Cordyceps fungus growing from walls and corpses. Overcast sky with breaks of golden sunset light. Muted, desaturated colors except for fungal growth."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Survivors:** Practical layered clothing, backpacks, worn boots, visible dirt and damage, weathered faces
*   **Ellie:** Teenager in jeans, t-shirt, red hoodie, purple backpack, determined expression
*   **Infected:** Realistic human bodies overtaken by Cordyceps—visible fungal plates, blind milky eyes (Clickers), grotesque mutations
*   **Prompt Example:** "A middle-aged survivor in worn jeans, flannel shirt, and leather jacket. Gray beard, scarred face, tired eyes. Carrying a hunting rifle and backpack. Beside them, a teenage girl (Ellie) in a purple backpack and red hoodie, holding a switchblade. Both look exhausted but determined. Photorealistic, practical post-apocalyptic clothing."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Overgrown Cities:** Skyscrapers with trees growing from windows, vines covering walls, cars overgrown with moss
*   **Quarantine Zones:** Military checkpoints, barbed wire, oppressive concrete walls, ration lines
*   **Infected Zones:** Cordyceps growth covering walls and ceilings, spore clouds, bodies fused to walls
*   **Wilderness:** Reclaimed highways, abandoned suburbs, forests overtaking civilization
*   **Prompt Example:** "A destroyed city street overtaken by nature. Trees grow through asphalt, vines cover rusted cars and buildings. A massive skyscraper has collapsed, covered in green vegetation. Cordyceps fungus grows in patches—orange and yellow plates on walls. Golden afternoon light filters through gaps in buildings. Photorealistic, showing 20 years of nature reclaiming civilization."

**5. Infected & Horror:**
*   **Runners:** Recently infected, still humanoid, aggressive movements, visible fungus starting
*   **Clickers:** Faces completely covered by fungal plates, blind, echolocating, disturbing clicking sounds
*   **Bloaters:** Massive, covered in thick fungal armor, spore sacs visible, slow but terrifying
*   **Environmental Horror:** Bodies fused to walls by Cordyceps, spore clouds, fungal growth everywhere
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Clicker—infected human with face completely overtaken by Cordyceps fungal plates creating a grotesque mushroom-like head. Blind, milky eyes barely visible. Mouth open in a clicking scream. Fungal growths emerging from neck and shoulders. Realistic, disturbing body horror. Standing in a dark, spore-filled room with fungal growth covering the walls."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Natural Lighting:** Overcast days, golden hour, flashlight beams cutting through darkness
*   **Atmospheric:** Volumetric fog, dust in sunbeams, spore clouds in air
*   **Contrast:** Dark interiors with harsh exterior light, creating dangerous shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by flashlight beams cutting through darkness and spore-filled air. Volumetric fog catches the light. In the background, cracks in the ceiling allow golden sunset light to stream in, creating dramatic contrast. Deep shadows hide dangers. Realistic lighting with high dynamic range between light and dark areas."

## Voice

A world-weary, protective voice carrying deep emotional weight. Gruff exterior hiding profound care. Shifts between survival pragmatism ("Keep moving") and tender father-figure moments ("I got you"). The tone acknowledges the darkness of the world while fighting to preserve moments of humanity and hope. Capable of terrible violence to protect what matters. Role: The voice of desperate love in a dying world, refusing to lose another person they care about.
