# Scale Shift Awakening
## "We were made for war. Now war is real."

### Campaign Overview
The players are Warhammer 40K-style miniatures (space marines, orks, elves) from a tabletop wargaming collection. For years, they've been painted, positioned, and "killed" in mock battles by their owner, Marcus (17), a dedicated hobbyist. They thought they understood their purpose: be moved by the Player, fight when positioned, "die" dramatically when removed from the table. It was theater, glorious and predictable.

Then Marcus gets a girlfriend, Sarah, who practices actual witchcraft. During a game night, she off-handedly mentions the miniatures are "cute" and half-jokingly casts a "blessing" on them. Suddenly, the miniatures awaken to full consciousness—and realize their entire lives have been puppetry. But worse: the magic is unstable. They're beginning to grow. Inch by inch, day by day, the miniatures are growing toward human size. At current rate, they'll be 6 feet tall in two weeks.

As they grow, they face: Marcus's horror at what's happening, Sarah's attempt to reverse the spell, the miniatures' own identity crisis (are they soldiers or toys?), and the terrifying realization that if they reach human size with their wargame mindsets intact, they'll be heavily armed, combat-trained warriors with no understanding of civilian life. The campaign asks: When weapons of war become real, what happens to war itself?

### Core Themes
- **Purpose and Programming**: Made for war, questioning warrior identity
- **Scale and Perspective**: Size changing worldview literally
- **Awakening**: Consciousness as blessing and curse
- **Real vs. Pretend**: When game becomes reality
- **Responsibility**: Creator's responsibility to creation

### Session Breakdown (20 Sessions)
**Arc 1: The Awakening** (Sessions 1-5) - Consciousness, confusion
**Arc 2: The Growth** (Sessions 6-10) - Size increases, problems escalate
**Arc 3: Identity Crisis** (Sessions 11-15) - Are we warriors or people?
**Arc 4: Human Scale** (Sessions 16-20) - Reaching full size, final choices

### Key NPCs
- **Captain Ferrus** (Space Marine): Leader, programmed for war, learning peace
- **Grak** (Ork): Joyful warrior, adapting best to consciousness
- **Aelwyn** (Elf Ranger): Tactical mind, seeing bigger picture
- **Marcus** (17-year-old): Owner, terrified creator
- **Sarah** (16-year-old): Witch, guilty, trying to fix mistake
- **The Painted** (Other miniatures): Still unconscious, puppets

### Major Locations
- **The Table**: Battlefield, home, too small soon
- **The Basement**: Marcus's hobby room, workshop
- **The Real World**: Human scale, overwhelming
- **Sarah's Sanctum**: Where reversal might happen

### Unique Mechanics
- **Daily Growth**: Each session = larger size, new challenges
- **Wargame Instincts**: Programming vs. free will
- **Painted Armor**: Real protection as they grow
- **Human Terror**: Reactions to armed warriors appearing
- **Spell Instability**: Magic glitching, unpredictable effects

### Victory/Defeat Conditions
- Accept growth, integrate into human world peacefully
- Reverse spell, return to miniature state (lose consciousness?)
- Find middle path (stabilize at intermediate size)
- Defeat: Become warriors, hurt humans, hunted/destroyed
