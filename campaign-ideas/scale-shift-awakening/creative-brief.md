# Scale Shift Awakening - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Style**: Grimdark wargaming aesthetic meeting suburban reality
- **Colors**: Painted miniature colors (bold primaries, metallic) vs. real-world muted tones
- **Lighting**: Desk lamp spotlight to natural daylight
- **Scale**: Perspective shifts as characters grow

## Character Design
- Classic wargaming miniature appearance (heroic proportions, detailed armor)
- Paint jobs visible (brush strokes, highlights, washes)
- Gear is real (bolters fire, chainswords cut)
- Growth shown through relative scale to environment
- Painted eyes becoming real eyes (consciousness visible)

## Environment
- **The Table**: Detailed terrain, miniature scale
- **Basement**: Massive from mini perspective, shrinking as they grow
- **Workshop**: Paints, brushes, tools—creation implements
- **Real World**: Overwhelming detail compared to table terrain

## Music Direction
- **Miniature Scale**: Epic wargaming soundtrack (bombastic, heroic)
- **Growing**: Music becoming more complex, nuanced
- **Human Scale**: Real-world sounds replacing game music
- **Identity Crisis**: Clash between epic and mundane
- **Final**: Either triumphant integration or tragic ending

## Voice Acting
- **Captain Ferrus**: Heroic, booming, gradually humanizing
- **Grak**: Cockney ork accent, infectious enthusiasm
- **Aelwyn**: Elvish grace, tactical precision
- **Marcus**: Teen panic, creator's guilt
- **Sarah**: Witch trying to fix mistake, growing attachment
- **The Painted**: Eerie puppetry, no consciousness

## Marketing Tagline
"From tabletop to reality. From miniature to man. From game to war."
