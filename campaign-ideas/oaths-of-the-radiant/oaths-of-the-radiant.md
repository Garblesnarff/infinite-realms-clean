The players are ordinary people who begin manifesting the lost powers of the Radiants, bonding with sentient spren from the cognitive realm and speaking ideals that grant them supernatural abilities. As they grow in power and understanding, they must uncover the truth behind the original betrayal, face the return of the ancient enemy known as the Voidbringers, and decide whether to trust the mysterious Heralds who abandoned humanity millennia ago. The fate of Roshar hangs on whether they can uphold their oaths when tested by impossible choices.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A campaign inspired by Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive, focusing on personal growth through oaths, cosmic-scale conflicts, and the weight of ancient history.

*   **Act I — The First Ideal (Sessions 1–5):** The players, from diverse backgrounds across Roshar, each experience a moment of crisis that causes them to speak the First Ideal: "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination." They bond with spren and begin manifesting nascent Radiant powers. Drawn together by visions sent by the mysterious Stormfather, they must learn to control their abilities while investigating reports of strange red-eyed creatures appearing during Highstorms—the first signs of a new Desolation.

*   **Act II — The Broken Oaths (Sessions 6–11):** As the players speak higher Ideals and unlock greater powers (Shardblades, Shardplate, advanced Surges), they discover the terrible truth: the original Radiants broke their oaths and abandoned their powers because they learned their enemy, the Voidbringers, were actually the original inhabitants of Roshar—and humanity were the invaders. Now the players must navigate this moral complexity while uniting the fractured nations of Roshar against the returning singers (Parshendi) who have bonded with voidspren. They must seek out the immortal Heralds, now broken and mad from millennia of torture, and recover lost fabrials and Shardblades from ancient ruins.

*   **Act III — The Oath Unbroken (Sessions 12–15+):** The true enemy reveals itself: Odium, the Shard of divine hatred, who has been manipulating both humans and singers toward mutual destruction. The players must speak their final Ideals, facing their deepest flaws and personal truths, to achieve their full Radiant potential. In a climactic battle on the Shattered Plains during a catastrophic Everstorm, they must face Odium's champion in a contest of champions that will determine the fate of Roshar, while simultaneously trying to forge peace between humans and singers—proving that the cycle of Desolations can finally be broken not through conquest, but through understanding and unity.

    *   In their darkest moment, they speak the First Ideal and bond with a spren, manifesting the first glimmers of Radiant power.
    *   During the next Highstorm, they share a vision from the Stormfather showing them the Shattered Plains and a warning: "The Return comes."

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Stormfather** — *The Cognitive Shadow of Honor*
    *   **Role:** A divine storm-entity who grants visions and bonds with one player as a Bondsmith. He is the remnant of the Shard Honor, killed by Odium.
    *   **Personality:** Ancient, tempestuous, initially distrustful of humans. He speaks in thunderous pronouncements and tests the players' worthiness constantly.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He carries guilt for Honor's death and fears that humanity is fundamentally incapable of keeping their oaths, which is why he resisted bonding with humans for so long.

2.  **Taln (Talenel'Elin)** — *The Herald Who Never Broke*
    *   **Role:** The most resilient of the Heralds, who endured 4,500 years of torture alone to spare humanity another Desolation. He is now broken and barely lucid.
    *   **Personality:** Speaks in fragments, mixing past and present. In rare moments of clarity, he is the noblest warrior imaginable, but mostly he is lost in trauma.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He knows the exact nature of Odium's plans because he was tortured with visions of them for millennia, but his shattered mind makes extracting this information nearly impossible.

3.  **Shallan** — *Lightweaver and Scholar*
    *   **Role:** An NPC Radiant who serves as ally and mentor in illusion magic and scholarly research. She has already spoken several Ideals.
    *   **Personality:** Brilliant, witty, but haunted by secrets she has killed to protect. She uses humor to deflect from her pain.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She killed her own spren in the past by denying truths about herself, and her current bond is fragile—if she denies truth again, she could break her oaths and fall to Odium.

4.  **El (Odium's Champion)** — *The Fallen Radiant*
    *   **Role:** A former Windrunner who broke his oaths when he was forced to choose between protecting his family and protecting innocents. Odium offered him the power to save both—at the cost of his soul.
    *   **Personality:** Tragic, sympathetic, but utterly devoted to Odium. He believes Passion (Odium's philosophy) is more honest than Honor's impossible ideals.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Deep down, he still loves what he lost. If the players can remind him of his original oaths without condemning him, he might be redeemed—but it would cost him everything.

5.  **The Sibling** — *The Slumbering Spren of Urithiru*
    *   **Role:** The massive spren that IS Urithiru tower. Currently dormant and dying because it was betrayed by the Radiants during the Recreance.
    *   **Personality:** When partially awakened, it is childlike, confused, and deeply wounded by the betrayal. It doesn't understand why its Radiants left.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** To fully awaken the Sibling and restore Urithiru's defenses and fabrials, a Bondsmith must bond with it—but doing so means taking responsibility for the betrayal their order committed.

## Key Locations

1.  **Urithiru:** The ancient tower-city of the Radiants, a massive structure with thousands of rooms, built into a mountain. Contains ancient fabrials, libraries, and the Oathgate network.

2.  **The Shattered Plains:** A vast expanse of plateaus separated by chasms, where chasmfiends nest and armies wage war. Site of the final battle.

3.  **Shadesmar:** The cognitive realm where spren live as sentient beings and the physical world appears as an ocean of beads. Reality is strange and symbolic here.

4.  **Kholinar:** Capital of Alethkar, a city of towering spires and lighteyed palaces, currently under siege by Voidbringers and corrupted spren.

5.  **The Purelake:** A vast, shallow lake where people walk on the water and ancient secrets lie beneath. Home to the mysterious Aimians and Worldsingers.

6.  **Braize:** The planet of Damnation where the Heralds are tortured between Desolations. Entering it requires traveling through the spiritual realm.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the weight of oaths, the complexity of inherited conflict, and the cost of power. The central tension is whether the players can uphold impossible ideals when faced with morally gray situations—and whether breaking an oath for a good reason is wisdom or damnation. The players must decide if they will repeat history's mistakes or forge a new path that transcends the ancient cycle of vengeance between humans and singers. Ultimately, they must prove that honor is not about perfection, but about choosing to stand back up after falling.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Oath Progression System**
*   Instead of traditional leveling, players advance by speaking Ideals (oaths) specific to their Radiant order.
*   **First Ideal** (Level 3): Grants basic Surgebinding (two magical abilities like Gravitation, Adhesion, Division, etc.) and the ability to summon a spren-weapon.
*   **Second Ideal** (Level 6): Stronger Surgebinding, ability to summon weapon in 10 seconds instead of 10 heartbeats.
*   **Third Ideal** (Level 9): Major power boost, can affect others with Surges, begin manifesting Shardplate pieces.
*   **Fourth Ideal** (Level 13): Full Shardplate, weapon becomes a true Shardblade, can use both Surges simultaneously.
*   **Fifth Ideal** (Level 17): Transcendent power, can reshape reality with Surges, become a beacon of their Ideal.
*   **Oath Breaking:** If a player acts directly against their spoken Ideals, they risk breaking their bond. This causes their spren immense pain and can kill it. Mechanically, they lose all Radiant powers until they can restore the bond (which requires profound atonement).

### 2. **Highstorm Cycles**
*   Every few sessions, a Highstorm sweeps across the region, a magical hurricane that brings violent winds, lightning, and crem (sediment).
*   During Highstorms, Stormlight (magical energy) is abundant. Radiant powers are enhanced, and the players can "charge" spheres with Stormlight for later use.
*   Highstorms also bring visions from the Stormfather to bonded characters, providing cryptic guidance or warnings.
*   Everstorms (corrupted storms moving the wrong direction) bring enemy forces and drain Stormlight, creating dangerous environmental hazards.

### 3. **Stormlight Economy**
*   Instead of spell slots, Radiants use Stormlight, which is stored in gemstones.
*   Using Surgebinding drains Stormlight from held spheres. Players must manage their reserves carefully.
*   Stormlight also provides: healing (players can heal rapidly if they have Stormlight), enhanced physical abilities, and immunity to exhaustion.
*   Dead or dying characters can be saved if allies transfer Stormlight to them quickly enough.

### 4. **Spren Bonds and Personality**
*   Each player's bonded spren is a full NPC with personality, goals, and the ability to communicate.
*   Spren can provide advice, scout in their cognitive form, and their emotional state affects the player's powers.
*   If a player and their spren fundamentally disagree on a course of action, they must resolve it through roleplay or risk weakening their bond.
*   Different spren types (honorspren, cryptics, cultivationspren, etc.) grant different Surges and have different values.
