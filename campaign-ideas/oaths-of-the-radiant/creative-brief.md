# Creative Brief: Oaths of the Radiant

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Storm-Swept Epic Fantasy

Inspired by the works of Michael Whelan (official Stormlight Archive artist), combining dramatic weather phenomena, Asian-influenced armor designs, and cosmic-scale magical effects. This style captures the grandeur of Roshar's unique ecology, the elegance of Radiant powers, and the raw power of Highstorms.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Elemental Drama:** Highlight wind, lightning, rain, and storm effects in nearly every scene. The world is shaped by storms.
*   **Blend Eastern and Western Fantasy:** Combine flowing silk, elaborate patterns, and curved architecture with plate armor, swords, and medieval hierarchy.
*   **Luminous Energy:** Stormlight should appear as glowing, wispy, electric-blue or white energy that swirls around characters and objects.
*   **Alien Ecology:** Roshar is not Earth. Plants and animals should feel strange—rockbuds that retract, cremlings like crustaceans, chasmfiends that are enormous.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, storm-swept, honorbound, mystical, alien, luminous, ancient-yet-living, dramatic, conflicted.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of struggling against overwhelming forces while holding to ideals. Beauty and terror exist simultaneously. The world feels both ancient and vibrant, wounded but recovering.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Flowing and dynamic for magical effects and cloth, sharp and angular for armor and weapons. Eastern influence in costume design with elaborate patterns.
*   **Forms:** Characters wear distinctive armor with flowing elements (capes, sashes, skirts over plate). Shardplate appears as intricate, glowing plate armor with an otherworldly aesthetic. Architecture features high spires, vaulted halls, and storm-resistant designs.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Knight Radiant in elaborate Shardplate armor with glowing blue Stormlight emanating from the seams, wielding a summoned Shardblade, in the style of Michael Whelan's Stormlight Archive covers. The armor has an Eastern-influenced design with flowing cape elements."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by storm colors—deep grays, electric blues, whites, and purples. Accented with rich jewel tones (emerald, sapphire, ruby) representing different Radiant orders. Natural colors are muted earth tones (crem-brown, stone-gray) contrasted with vibrant Stormlight.
*   **Luminosity:** Stormlight should glow intensely, creating dramatic rim-lighting and casting blue-white radiance. Gemstones containing Stormlight emit soft light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich color palette of storm-gray clouds, electric blue Stormlight crackling around the character's hands, and deep purple shadows. The scene is illuminated by the ethereal glow of gemstones and the distant lightning of an approaching Highstorm."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters wear armor inspired by Eastern and Western fusion—plate armor with silk undergarments, flowing skirts or robes over protective gear. Different eye colors indicate social status (light eyes are nobility, dark eyes are common).
*   **Radiant Armor:** Shardplate appears as seamless, glowing armor that forms from light. Each order has distinctive colors and motifs (Windrunners: blue and honorspren symbols; Lightweavers: red and creative patterns; Bondsmiths: gold and unity imagery).
*   **Spren:** Small glowing entities that orbit their Radiant—honorspren appear as humanoid figures of light, cryptics as geometric patterns, cultivationspren as vines of light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Windrunner Knight Radiant, a young woman with violet light eyes, wearing blue-accented Shardplate with honorspren symbols etched into the glowing armor. Her bonded honorspren appears as a small, luminous figure hovering near her shoulder. She holds a manifested Shardblade, a silver-blue sword crackling with Stormlight."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Alien but beautiful landscapes—rocky plateaus separated by chasms, cities built to withstand storms (buildings like shells or bunkers), lush vegetation that retracts when touched. Perpetual sense of impending or recent storms.
*   **Atmosphere:** Clouds are almost always present. Wind-swept dust, crem deposits on eastern sides of objects, lightning on the horizon. Colors shift toward blue-gray-purple spectrum.
*   **Details:** Gemstones everywhere (currency and light source), fabrials (magical devices), glyphs and scripts, distinctive flora (rockbuds, lavis polyps, shalebark).
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Shattered Plains of Roshar, a vast expanse of rocky plateaus separated by deep chasms under a churning storm-gray sky. Lightning crackles in the distance as an approaching Highstorm looms on the horizon. Strange cremlings scuttle across the rock, and permanent bridges span some chasms while armies clash on the plateaus."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and high-contrast. Light sources are either natural (sun breaking through storm clouds, lightning) or magical (glowing Stormlight, gemstones).
*   **Shadows:** Long shadows from low sun angles, sharp contrasts between light and dark. Stormlight creates ethereal, blue-white illumination that seems to emanate from within objects.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the drama of storms and the supernatural nature of Radiant powers. Rim lighting from Stormlight makes characters appear heroic and otherworldly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically backlit by a massive Highstorm, with lightning creating stark silhouettes of the Knights Radiant standing firm against the wind. Blue Stormlight glows from their armor, creating halos of light in the storm-darkness. Sharp contrasts between the dark storm and the glowing heroes."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide, dramatic shots showcasing the scale of Roshar's landscapes and storms. Dynamic action shots of Radiant combat with flowing capes and energy trails. Intimate moments showing the connection between Radiant and spren.
*   **Techniques:** Use storm clouds and lightning to create dramatic leading lines. Frame characters against vast chasms or approaching Highstorms. Show scale by including distant towers or massive chasmfiends. Capture motion through flowing cloth and Stormlight trails.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic composition showing a Windrunner using Gravitation to soar through the air, blue Stormlight trailing from her form, with the massive spires of Urithiru in the background and an approaching Highstorm filling half the sky. The shot captures her mid-flight with flowing cape and glowing Shardblade extended, emphasizing freedom and power against impossible odds."

## Voice

A resonant, determined voice with a slight weathered quality, like someone who has stood against many storms. The accent is neutral with hints of formality, reflecting the honor-bound culture of the Knights Radiant. Pacing is measured and purposeful, with moments of intensity during battle descriptions and quiet introspection during philosophical moments. The emotion conveys determination tempered with wisdom—the understanding that oaths are difficult but necessary. Audio quality is clear with subtle ambient wind sounds, suggesting the ever-present storms of Roshar. Role: The chronicler of oaths, recording the deeds of those who stand against the Desolation.
