### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Oaths of the Radiant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In a world ravaged by magical Highstorms and locked in an eternal cycle of Desolations, the ancient order of Knights Radiant has long been dead, their powers abandoned after a mysterious betrayal. The players are ordinary people who begin manifesting the lost powers of the Radiants, bonding with sentient spren from the cognitive realm and speaking ideals that grant them supernatural abilities. As they grow in power and understanding, they must uncover the truth behind the original betrayal, face the return of the ancient enemy known as the Voidbringers, and decide whether to trust the mysterious Heralds who abandoned humanity millennia ago.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Heraldic Epochs and the cycle of Desolations that has plagued Roshar for millennia.
    *   Write the history of the Knights Radiant, their ten orders, and the Day of Recreance when they abandoned their oaths.
    *   Describe the nature of spren and their relationship to human emotions and ideals in the cognitive realm.
    *   Explain the magic system of Surgebinding and the ten fundamental Surges that manipulate reality.
    *   Detail the Shards of Adonalsium present on Roshar: Honor (dead), Cultivation (active), and Odium (trapped).
    *   Write about the true history of the Voidbringers and the revelation that humans were the original invaders of Roshar.
    *   Describe Shadesmar, the cognitive realm where thought becomes reality and spren exist as conscious beings.
    *   Explain the Oathpact and how the Heralds endured torture to prevent Desolations.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Nascent Radiants** (Major - Player faction)
        *   **Goals:** Restore the Knights Radiant, defend Roshar from the new Desolation, uncover the truth of the past.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized—each Radiant answers to their own oaths and bonded spren. Guided by the Stormfather and remaining Heralds.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are the return of the Radiants, protectors of the innocent and defenders against the Desolation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prove that the Recreance was wrong, that humans can keep their oaths even when faced with terrible truths.
        *   **Assets:** Growing powers of Surgebinding, access to Urithiru, support from some kingdoms, bonded spren intelligence network.
        *   **Relationships:** Cautious alliance with Alethi and Azish kingdoms; hunted by Skybreakers; seeking to ally with reformed singers.

    *   **The Voidbringers (Singer Revolt)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Reclaim Roshar from human invaders, free their people from slavery (Parshmen), serve the rhythms and their gods.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Fused (ancient singer souls in new bodies) and organized by forms of power (stormform, warform, etc.).
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are reclaiming our homeland from the human invaders who enslaved our people.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many singers don't want war—they want coexistence—but Odium's influence pushes them toward violence.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers (all Parshmen are transforming), forms of power granting supernatural abilities, Everstorms bringing reinforcements, Voidspren bonds.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to most human nations; manipulated by Odium; some factions open to negotiation with Radiants.

    *   **The Skybreakers** (Minor - Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain order through law, prevent the return of the Desolation by eliminating nascent Radiants.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Herald Nale (Nalan), organized as a strict military hierarchy based on oaths spoken.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We uphold the law and prevent chaos by eliminating those who would break the world again.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Nale is insane from millennia of torture and believes killing new Radiants will prevent the Desolation—but he's wrong.
        *   **Assets:** Fully trained Radiants with higher Ideals already spoken, Honorblades, legal authority in some nations.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunt nascent Radiants; serve various human governments; secretly manipulated by Odium through Nale's madness.

    *   **The Diagram Conspiracy** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Save Roshar through calculated manipulation and morally gray tactics based on a dying man's prophetic writings.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Taravangian, the aged king of Kharbranth, and his scholars.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are a peaceful scholarly kingdom focused on hospitals and learning.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Following the Diagram, a complex prophecy, through assassination, manipulation, and calculated atrocities "for the greater good."
        *   **Assets:** Extensive spy network, the Diagram's predictions, trained assassins, Stormlight research.
        *   **Relationships:** Secretly manipulating all sides; officially allied with other kingdoms; willing to work with Radiants if it serves the Diagram.

    *   **The Ghostbloods** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Gather knowledge and power, particularly regarding Shards and Investiture, for their off-world masters.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Secret society with cell structure, led by the mysterious Thaidakar (actually Kelsier from Scadrial).
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they operate entirely in secret.

        *   **Assets:** Cross-world technology, Allomantic powers, extensive spy network, ancient knowledge.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player breaks an oath or acts against their spoken Ideals.
    *   **THEN:** Their spren screams in pain and their bond weakens. Powers diminish. If severe, the spren may die, and the player becomes Radiant-less. Generate a redemption quest to restore the broken bond.

    *   **IF:** The players successfully awaken the Sibling by bonding a Bondsmith to it.
    *   **THEN:** Urithiru's full defenses activate. Oathgates become reliable. Ancient fabrials come online. Generate a mission where this is tested against a major assault.

    *   **IF:** The players reveal the truth about humanity being invaders to a major kingdom.
    *   **THEN:** Political upheaval. Some leaders refuse to believe it. Others begin seeking peace with singers. Generate faction splits and diplomatic challenges.

    *   **IF:** Players successfully negotiate peace with a Singer faction.
    *   **THEN:** Odium intervenes directly, sending Fused to destroy the peace talks. But success creates hope—some singers and humans begin working together. Generate joint missions.

    *   **IF:** A player reaches the Fifth Ideal (final oath) of their order.
    *   **THEN:** They become a beacon of their Ideal, visible across realms. Spren flock to them. Enemies target them specifically. Odium offers them a personal bargain. Generate a unique challenge for that Ideal.

    *   **IF:** The players kill Odium's champion without offering mercy.
    *   **THEN:** They win the battle but prove Odium's point—that honor is a lie. The champion's death hardens hearts on both sides. Generate a darker ending path.

    *   **IF:** The players offer mercy to Odium's champion and remind him of his oaths.
    *   **THEN:** He hesitates, creating an opening. His redemption (or noble death) inspires others. Singers see that humans can choose honor. Generate a path toward true peace.

    *   **IF:** A Highstorm and Everstorm collide while players are present.
    *   **THEN:** Reality tears. Brief access to Spiritual Realm. Powerful but dangerous moment where oaths can be rewritten or Shards can be touched. Generate cosmic-scale consequences.
