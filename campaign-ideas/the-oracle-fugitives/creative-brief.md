# Creative Brief: The Oracle Fugitives

## Art Style: Sleek Surveillance Noir (Minority Report-inspired)

Inspired by *Minority Report*, blending sleek futuristic design with film noir paranoia.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Surveillance:** Cameras, scanners, retinal identification everywhere.
*   **Sleek Futurism:** White corridors, holographic interfaces, magnetic levitation.
*   **Noir Paranoia:** Being hunted, shadows, desperate escapes.

### Color Palette:
*   Sterile whites and grays for the system, dark blues and blacks for underground.
*   Holographic blue interfaces.

### Voice:
A tense, paranoid male voice—American accent, breathless pacing. Someone on the run, questioning reality and free will. Audio has echo of footsteps, distant sirens.
