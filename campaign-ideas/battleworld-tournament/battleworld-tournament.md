## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A cosmic death game where heroes and villains fight for freedom.

*   **Act I — Welcome to Battleworld (Sessions 1–5):** The players wake in a strange patchwork landscape with no memory of how they arrived. They discover they're on Battleworld, where the Beyonder has assembled champions and villains from countless realities. The being announces: "You will fight. The victorious shall have their heart's desire." Factions form quickly—heroes band together, villains scheme, and some seek to unite everyone. The players must choose allies, survive deadly encounters, and discover the rules of this cosmic game.
*   **Act II — The Faction Wars (Sessions 6–11):** As Battleworld descends into chaos, the players realize that fighting each other serves the Beyonder's entertainment. They must navigate complex politics: ally with villains who are surprisingly reasonable, fight heroes who have turned zealous, and seek the mysterious Doom—a brilliant villain who claims to have a plan to defeat the Beyonder. Through battles, betrayals, and unlikely friendships, the party gathers intelligence about the Beyonder's nature and weaknesses.
*   **Act III — Challenging God (Sessions 12–15+):** The players unite the Battleworld factions for an assault on the Beyonder's fortress. They discover the truth: the Beyonder is a cosmic child, and Battleworld is its toy. The champions must either entertain it enough to earn freedom, outwit it through clever manipulation, or attempt the impossible—steal the Beyonder's power and remake Battleworld into something better. Their choice will determine the fate of all kidnapped souls.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of cooperation versus competition, moral flexibility in desperate situations, and challenging seemingly omnipotent power. The central conflict is survival, but also the question of whether the ends justify the means. Can heroes ally with villains? Can villains be trusted? And can mortals ever truly challenge a god?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Territory Control**
*   Battleworld is divided into territories with resources. Factions can control territories through conquest or negotiation.
*   Controlled territories provide benefits: food, equipment, Beyonder tech, strategic advantage.
*   The DM tracks territory control, and players must decide which territories to contest.

### 2. **Faction Reputation**
*   Players have reputation with three major factions: Heroes, Villains, and Doom's Alliance.
*   Actions affecting one faction impact others. Helping villains lowers Hero reputation; refusing Doom's plans loses his support.
*   High reputation unlocks faction-specific support, allies, and resources.

### 3. **Beyonder Attention**
*   The Beyonder watches for "interesting" actions. Particularly clever, brave, or entertaining moves attract its attention.
*   High Beyonder Attention grants temporary boons (reality-warping favors) but makes you a target for other factions jealous of the favor.
*   The Beyonder may "reward" interesting players with challenges designed to see them at their peak.
