# The Labyrinth of Self - Creative Brief

## Art Style
David Lynch meets psychological horror. Inland Empire's fractured narrative, Jodorowsky's surrealism, Zdzisław Beksiński's nightmare paintings. Nothing explained, everything unsettling. Familiar made alien. Reality rotting at edges.

## Color Palettes
- **The Labyrinth**: Sickly fluorescents, harsh shadows, colors slightly wrong
- **Memory Scenes**: Oversaturated then desaturated randomly, unstable reality
- **The Corridor**: Too many faces in frame, flesh tones on everything, unsettling organicness
- **Integration**: Colors bleeding together, boundaries dissolving visually
- **The Void**: Either absolute black or blinding white, depending on interpretation

## Music and Sound
- **Environmental**: Industrial drones, uncomfortable ambience, sounds that shouldn't exist
- **Wrong Music**: Cheerful music in horror context or vice versa, tonal dissonance
- **Whispers**: Multiple voices whispering character's own thoughts back at them
- **The Breathing**: Labyrinth breathes. Everything has pulse. Disgusting organic life
- **Silence**: Used powerfully when something should make noise but doesn't

## Voice Direction
- **The Mask**: How player normally voices character, performative
- **The Shadow**: Same voice but darker, honest, cruel truths
- **The Child**: Higher pitch, vulnerable, traumatized innocence
- **The Ideal**: Same voice but judgmental, perfectionist, never satisfied
- **The Monster**: Same voice but uncanny valley wrong, distorted, yourself but not

## Cinematic Moments
- **Entering Labyrinth**: Normal to surreal transition, reality rules changing, disorientation
- **First Fragmentation**: Seeing yourself from outside, conversation with self, horror of multiplicity
- **Memory Bleed**: Past scene interrupting present, past self speaking to present self, time collapsing
- **Shadow Confrontation**: Meeting repressed self, seeing traits you denied, battle/merger with yourself
- **The Center Revelation**: Whatever is there, should be visceral, personal, disturbing, unforgettable
- **Integration/Dissolution**: Body horror but psychological, selves merging or fracturing, boundaries failing

## Surreal Guidelines

### Make It Wrong
Everything slightly off:
- Doorknobs too high or low
- Corridors tilt imperceptibly
- Proportions incorrect
- Details don't match memories
- Deja vu constant

### Break Continuity
- Jump cuts in narrative
- Start scenes mid-conversation
- Reference events that didn't happen
- Repeat scenes differently
- Time circles back

### Literal Metaphors
- "Falling apart" means literally disassembling
- "Lost myself" means can't find body
- "Two-faced" means actual second face
- Internal states externalized
- Psychological made physical

### Uncomfortable Beauty
- Something lovely but wrong
- Attractive but repulsive
- Peaceful but terrifying
- Safe but dangerous
- Seductive but threatening

## Session Structure

### Open Cold
Start in middle of scene:
"You're already running. Behind you, the sound of your own footsteps, but you're not moving. The corridor breathes."

No context, no setup. Players disoriented = characters disoriented.

### End Ambiguous
Don't resolve cleanly:
"The door opens. Light spills through. You step toward it. Session ends."

Did they escape? Was it exit? Won't say. Next session might continue or jump elsewhere.

### Embrace Confusion
If players confused about what's happening—good. If they're comfortable—make it weirder. They should never feel certain about reality.

## Practical Effects Over CGI
Describe things as if practically created:
- Masks, not face replacements
- Puppetry, not smooth animation
- Practical blood and gore
- Physical impossibility, not digital smoothness
- The artifice should slightly show—makes it creepier

## Sound Design Specifics

**The Labyrinth's Voice**: Deep resonance, felt in chest, words unclear but meaning understood
**Echo Wrong**: Sound reflecting before it's made
**Silence Texture**: Silence that feels heavy, present, oppressive
**Voice Multiplication**: Speaking and hearing yourself from outside simultaneously
**The Hum**: Constant background, source uncertain, maddening

## Color Symbolism

- **Red**: Rage, violence, id unleashed
- **Blue**: Sadness, drowning, depression made physical
- **Yellow**: Sick fluorescence, artificial light, nowhere to hide
- **Green**: Decay, nausea, wrongness in organic
- **Purple**: Bruising, damage, trauma visible
- **White**: Void, absence, ego death
- **Black**: Unconscious, unknown, true self or no self

## The Monster Design

Should look like player but wrong:
- Same features but proportions off
- Moving at wrong speed
- Expressions that don't match emotions
- Speaking with player's voice pitched wrong
- Knowing what player knows
- Being what player fears they are

The horror: Recognizing yourself in something monstrous.
