# Creative Brief: The Weeping Woman's Curse

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Hispanic Horror

Inspired by Mexican Gothic tradition and riverside folklore, blending beautiful waterside settings with tragic supernatural elements. This style captures both the beauty of the legend and the horror of the curse.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Tragedy and Beauty:** La Llorona should evoke both pity and terror.
*   **Contrast Water and Death:** Rivers as both life-giving and deadly.
*   **Focus on Maternal Horror:** The twisted corruption of motherhood.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Weeping, drowning, motherhood, vengeance, tragedy, riverside curse, children, white dress, sorrow.
*   **Feeling:** Deep sadness mixed with terror. The sense of ancient tragedy still playing out.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Deep blues and greens for water, whites for La Llorona's dress, warm golden lights from towns contrasting with cold moonlight on water.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a river at night, deep blues and blacks with moonlight creating silver highlights on the water. A woman in a white dress stands at the water's edge, her dress flowing in an impossible wind. The scene is beautiful but deeply mournful and threatening."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **La Llorona:** A beautiful but tragic woman in a flowing white dress (often depicted as a traditional Mexican wedding dress or burial shroud). Long dark hair, pale skin, eyes that weep constantly (sometimes tears of blood). Her appearance shifts between beautiful and horrific depending on her emotional state.
*   **In Tragic Form:** Beautiful, sorrowful, clearly suffering
*   **In Vengeful Form:** Skeletal fingers, waterlogged appearance, terrifying visage
*   **Prompt Example:** "A woman standing by a moonlit river. She wears a flowing white dress that appears soaked and tattered at the edges. Her long dark hair flows around her. Her face is beautiful but deathly pale, with dark hollows around her eyes from which tears stream constantly. Her hands are outstretched toward the water, skeletal fingers reaching. She appears both heartbreakingly sorrowful and terrifying. Her presence is simultaneously tragic and threatening."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Riverside settings in Hispanic communities—colonial-era architecture, modern border towns, beautiful rivers at twilight, hidden grottos, old haciendas.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A riverside town at twilight, blending colonial Mexican architecture with more modern buildings. The river flows peacefully, beautiful and inviting. Flowers and candles are placed along the bank—a memorial. In the distance, mist rises from the water, and within it, a figure in white can be barely seen. The scene is beautiful but carries an undercurrent of ancient sorrow and danger."

## Voice

A female voice filled with inconsolable grief, speaking in Spanish-accented English (or entirely in Spanish). The pacing is irregular, interrupted by sobs and wails. The emotion is overwhelming sorrow mixed with rage. Audio quality wavers, as if the voice is coming from a great distance or from under water. Role: La Llorona herself, searching for her children, unable to accept what she has done, trapped in an eternal cycle of grief and madness.
