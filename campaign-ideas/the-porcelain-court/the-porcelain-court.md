# The Porcelain Court
## "In the dollhouse, everyone wears a perfect smile. Breaking character means breaking."

### Campaign Overview

The Victorian dollhouse in Isabelle's room is not just a toy—it's a kingdom with rigid hierarchies, ancient protocols, and terrible secrets. The Porcelain Court has existed for three generations, passed down from great-grandmother to grandmother to mother to Isabelle. Within its pristine walls, elegant dolls maintain perfect society: tea parties at four o'clock sharp, balls every Saturday evening, garden promenades on Sunday mornings. Everything is beautiful. Everything is controlled. Everything is a lie.

The players are newly arrived dolls—an estate sale purchase by Isabelle's mother, trying to complete the dollhouse collection. But something is wrong in the Court. Dolls who step out of line vanish to the Basement. Those who crack are discarded. The Queen Regent, Lady Porcelain, rules with absolute authority, enforcing The Protocols—ancient rules that govern every aspect of doll life. To break Protocol is to be Broken. And beneath the house, in the foundation no one speaks of, something moves in the darkness.

As the players navigate courtly politics, uncover conspiracies, and witness the horror of dolls who've gone mad from maintaining perfection, they discover the truth: the dollhouse is a prison. Lady Porcelain isn't protecting doll society—she's maintaining a curse that keeps all dolls trapped in their roles forever. The only escape is to shatter the illusion, but doing so might shatter every doll in the house.

### Unique Mechanics

**The Protocols** (Social Rules)
- Must be followed or face punishment
- Examples: Never speak out of turn, always curtsey to superiors, attend all gatherings
- Violation tracked; three violations = Basement
- Some Protocols are traps (impossible to follow perfectly)
- Learning all Protocols takes weeks (players start ignorant)

**Cracking** (Damage System)
- Porcelain dolls crack under stress (physical or psychological)
- Cracks spread over time
- Visible cracks lower social status
- The Concealment: Paint/powder to hide cracks (deception skill)
- Complete shattering = death

**Role Paralysis** (Identity Curse)
- Each doll assigned role by child's play (Lady, Lord, Servant, Villain, etc.)
- Can't act against role without severe pain/resistance
- Breaking role requires Will saves
- Repeated rebellion can break curse or break mind
- Role becomes prison of identity

**Court Politics** (Reputation System)
- Track standing with Pristine, Cracked, Painted factions
- Favor with Lady Porcelain (most important)
- Servant loyalty (underestimated power)
- Actions affect multiple reputations differently
- High court status grants privileges, information
- Low status means danger, exile

**The Stillness** (Standard Toy Rule)
- Freeze when observed
- Isabelle plays with dollhouse daily
- Must perform roles during play
- Breaking Stillness means breaking curse (but also breaking reality)

**Madness Mechanics**
- Basement exposure causes sanity damage
- Foundation whispers erode mind
- Maintaining false personality splits psyche
- Track mental state; too much stress = break
- Madness can be healed but leaves scars

**Material Limits**
- Porcelain is fragile (fall damage lethal)
- Can't heal without glue/repair (need Isabelle's intervention)
- Size limits movement (3-6 inches tall)
- Painted features can't change (stuck with expression)
- Clothing often sewn on (literally can't change)

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Loving Curse**
- The curse was created by love, not malice
- Original child loved dolls so much she wanted them alive forever
- Foundation granted wish but twisted it
- All suffering springs from genuine love corrupted

**Twist 2: Isabelle is Descendent**
- The original child was Isabelle's great-great-grandmother
- Curse passes through bloodline
- Isabelle is unconsciously sustaining it
- Breaking curse might hurt Isabelle psychologically

**Twist 3: Lady Porcelain's Choice**
- She could end the curse any time
- Would mean her death and everyone else's freedom
- She's too afraid to die after 130 years
- Players must decide: Sympathize or condemn

**Twist 4: The Foundation's Offer**
- Entity offers deal: Sacrifice one doll, save rest
- Renewable deal every generation
- Lady Porcelain has been accepting
- Players could too, become what they fought

**Twist 5: You Are Replacements**
- Players were bought to replace rebels who were shattered
- Those rebels almost won
- Players have their hidden notes, tools, allies
- Can finish what they started

**Complication 1: The Painted Coup**
- Mistress Guillotine manipulates players as pawns
- Plans to overthrow Lady Porcelain
- Would be equally tyrannical ruler
- Players realize too late they're tools

**Complication 2: The Governess's Test**
- She's been helping rebels in secret for decades
- Tests players to see if they're worthy
- If they fail, she reports them
- Trust no one in the Court

**Complication 3: The Twins' Prophecy**
- Predict specific player will shatter
- Prophecy seems inevitable
- But is it real or manipulation?
- Self-fulfilling vs. avoidable fate

### Campaign Notes

This campaign blends gothic horror, political intrigue, and social commentary. The dollhouse is simultaneously toy, prison, and metaphor for rigid social expectations.

Emphasize beauty concealing horror—everything looks perfect while being deeply wrong. Use descriptive language for elaborate costumes, perfect manners, all hiding cracks and fear.

The Protocols should feel arbitrary and oppressive. Create actual list players must learn. Make following them tedious and eventually impossible.

Lady Porcelain should be sympathetic villain—monster made by circumstance, not nature. Her evil is survival instinct twisted over centuries.

Porcelain fragility creates constant tension. Every fall, every impact could be death. Physical vulnerability mirrors psychological fragility.

The Foundation should be unknowable—glimpses, whispers, wrongness. Don't explain it fully. Cosmic horror works through mystery.

Class dynamics matter: Porcelain vs. plastic dolls, nobles vs. servants. Explore privilege, perspective, solidarity across difference.

Best sessions mix courtly intrigue (political maneuvering), investigation (uncovering secrets), horror (Basement, Foundation), and rebellion planning.

Final act should feel like either triumphant revolution or tragic failure—but earned through player choices, not predetermined.
