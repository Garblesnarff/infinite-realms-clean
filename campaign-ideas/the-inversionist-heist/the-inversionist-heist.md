# The Inversionist Heist
**Tagline:** *"Don't try to understand it. Feel it. Forward and backward simultaneously."*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers a magical artifact that allows temporal inversion—moving backward through time while maintaining consciousness and agency. Unlike traditional time travel, inverted individuals experience time in reverse: they see effects before causes, walk backward, and exist in temporal opposition to the normal world. This unique ability makes them perfect for an impossible heist: stealing an artifact before it's even placed in the vault.

The campaign is structured around elaborate heist sequences where half the party moves forward in time while the other half moves backward, coordinating actions that appear impossible. They must steal items that haven't been delivered yet, bypass security by being there before it's installed, and escape before they arrive. The mind-bending temporal mechanics create unique puzzles and spectacular set pieces.

Inspired by Tenet's temporal pincer movements and inverted combat, this campaign emphasizes coordination, planning, and the unique advantages of experiencing time in reverse.
