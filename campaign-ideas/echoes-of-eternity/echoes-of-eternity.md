# Echoes of Eternity
**Tagline:** *"Every message changes everything. Every choice rewrites fate."*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers an ancient artifact called the Chronograph—a magical device that can send messages backward through time. Unlike traditional time travel, users cannot physically journey to the past, but they can communicate with their previous selves through mystical messages that arrive as visions, dreams, or written notes that suddenly appear. This seemingly limited power becomes the key to preventing a catastrophic event that will destroy the kingdom in exactly one month.

As the players send messages to their past selves and receive warnings from their future selves, they begin to understand that changing the past doesn't erase the original timeline—it creates branches, splits, and parallel worlds. The party must navigate an increasingly complex web of causality, where each message creates a new worldline with subtle or dramatic differences. Some changes save lives; others doom different people instead. The moral weight of choosing which timeline to pursue becomes unbearable.

The campaign features a unique "worldline" system where the GM tracks multiple timeline variants, and players experience the consequences of their past selves' decisions. Reality shifts between sessions as messages sent in "previous" versions of events alter the present, forcing players to adapt to changing relationships, different quest outcomes, and even altered character backstories.

## Core Themes

- **Communication Across Time**: The power and limitation of messages
- **Butterfly Effect**: How small changes cascade into massive differences
- **Sacrifice and Choice**: Saving some means dooming others
- **Determinism vs. Free Will**: Can fate truly be changed?
- **Knowledge as Burden**: Sometimes knowing the future makes it worse
- **Parallel Selves**: How different versions of you might make different choices
