# Echoes of Eternity - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: "Fractured Reality"**
- Clean, modern fantasy with glitch effects representing worldline shifts
- Visual "echoes" showing alternate timeline versions overlapping
- Color shifts between worldlines create distinct visual identity for each
- Technology meets magic in the Chronograph's crystalline-clockwork design
- Reality appears slightly unstable—edges blur, shadows don't quite match

**Worldline Visual Coding:**
- **Alpha Worldline (Original)**: Warm colors, stable, natural lighting
- **Beta Worldline (Ideal)**: Cool blues and whites, crisp and clear
- **Epsilon Worldlines (Variables)**: Color shifts based on divergence
- **Dark Worldlines**: Desaturated, harsh shadows, dystopian tone
- **Convergence Moments**: Multiple color schemes overlap

**Visual Effects for Timeline Shifts:**
- Reality ripples like water when worldline changes
- Brief double-vision effect as memories reconcile
- Color palette shift indicates new timeline
- Background details change mid-scene
- NPCs flicker between versions momentarily
