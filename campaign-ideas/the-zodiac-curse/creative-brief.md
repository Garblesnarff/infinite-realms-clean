# Creative Brief: The Zodiac Curse

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gentle Healing Drama (Fruits Basket-inspired)

Inspired by the tender, emotionally nuanced art style of Fruits Basket, this aesthetic captures the delicate balance between lighthearted slice-of-life moments and profound emotional trauma. The style emphasizes soft character expressions, the transformation sequences, and the warmth of healing through acceptance.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Softness and Warmth:** Even in darkness, there should be an underlying warmth suggesting hope and healing.
*   **Transformation as Metaphor:** Depict the zodiac transformations as both whimsical and symbolic of hidden selves.
*   **Expression of Emotion:** Characters should have deeply expressive faces capable of conveying complex, layered emotions.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tender, emotional, hopeful, bittersweet, gentle, healing, accepting, warm, vulnerable, transformative.
*   **Feeling:** A profound sense of emotional safety mixed with acknowledgment of deep pain. The atmosphere suggests that healing is possible through acceptance and love.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Soft, flowing lines with gentle curves. Character designs are approachable and warm. Transformation sequences use flowing, magical energy.
*   **Forms:** Characters have expressive, kind faces even when showing pain. Zodiac animals are cute but symbolic. The environment feels lived-in and safe.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gentle anime-style illustration of a young woman with soft brown eyes and an incredibly kind expression, wearing simple clothes, extending her hand in welcome. The art style is warm and inviting, with soft lines and a feeling of emotional safety."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, gentle pastels for healing moments. Soft oranges, gentle pinks, calming blues, and natural earth tones. Darker, cooler tones for trauma flashbacks but never truly harsh.
*   **Luminosity:** Soft, natural lighting predominates. Warm afternoon sunlight for home scenes, gentle moonlight for vulnerable conversations, darker shadows for painful memories but always with a glimmer of light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...bathed in warm, gentle afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, creating a safe, cozy atmosphere. The color palette features soft oranges, warm browns, and gentle pastels that evoke comfort and healing."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are designed to show their dual nature—their public face and hidden pain. Zodiac members have subtle visual cues to their animals even in human form.
*   **Tohru Honda:** Simple, kind appearance with soft brown hair and large, compassionate eyes. Dresses modestly. Her warmth radiates visually.
*   **Kyo Soma:** Orange hair suggesting his cat nature, sharp eyes hiding vulnerability, athletic build, often defensive posture that softens around Tohru.
*   **Yuki Soma:** Elegant, delicate features, gray hair, refined appearance masking deep insecurity and trauma.
*   **Akito Soma:** Androgynous, sharp features, dark hair, commanding presence mixed with fragility and pain in the eyes.
*   **Zodiac Members:** Each visually distinct, often with hair or eye colors suggesting their animal, bearing their trauma differently.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young man with bright orange hair and sharp amber eyes, wearing casual clothes, arms crossed defensively. Despite his aggressive stance, his expression shows vulnerability. Subtle cat-like mannerisms. Art style emphasizes the contrast between his harsh exterior and gentle interior."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Warm, lived-in spaces that feel like home. Traditional Japanese aesthetics mixed with fantasy elements. Natural settings emphasize seasons and renewal.
*   **Atmosphere:** Shigure's house should feel increasingly warm and safe as the campaign progresses. The Soma estate is beautiful but cold and oppressive. The Cat's prison is the darkest location, representing despair.
*   **Details:** Seasonal changes matter—cherry blossoms for new beginnings, summer sunshine for growth, autumn leaves for change, snow for introspection and transformation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cozy traditional Japanese-style house interior with warm wooden floors, sliding doors open to a garden view. Afternoon sunlight creates warm patches on the floor. The space feels lived-in, safe, and welcoming, like a true home where healing can happen."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused lighting that creates warmth without harsh shadows. Trauma flashbacks use darker tones but maintain some light suggesting hope.
*   **Shadows:** Gentle and supportive, creating depth without threatening atmosphere. Used symbolically—characters emerging from shadow into light as they heal.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting represents emotional state and journey. Characters begin in partial shadow and gradually move into full light as they heal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by gentle, warm lighting that creates a safe, nurturing atmosphere. Soft shadows suggest depth and complexity without darkness. The lighting emphasizes the hopeful, healing nature of the scene."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Intimate, character-focused compositions. Uses close-ups for emotional moments, wider shots to show family gathering together, symbolic imagery of imprisonment and freedom.
*   **Techniques:** Show characters gradually occupying more of the frame as they grow confident. Use visual metaphors—cages, opening doors, transformations. Frame characters together to show connection vs. isolated to show loneliness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A close-up composition of hands reaching out to embrace, with one person beginning to glow and transform into a small orange cat in a puff of magical smoke. The moment captures both the whimsy of the curse and the tenderness of the attempted connection."

## Voice

**Tohru Honda:** A gentle, warm female voice full of genuine kindness and optimism. Even when sad, maintains hopefulness. Speaks with care and consideration for others. Think: the embodiment of unconditional acceptance and compassion.

**Kyo Soma:** A rough, defensive young male voice that occasionally softens to reveal vulnerability. Angry outbursts hide deep pain and self-loathing. Gradually becomes gentler throughout the campaign.

**Akito Soma:** A sharp, commanding androgynous voice that can shift from cruel authority to childlike vulnerability. Complex and layered, revealing the pain beneath the cruelty.

**Narrator Voice:** Tender, maternal, and deeply compassionate. The voice of someone recounting a painful but ultimately hopeful story of healing. Gentle during soft moments, quietly sad during trauma reveals, warmly hopeful during healing. Studio-quality with the warmth of a mother's bedtime story mixed with the wisdom of someone who has survived pain.
