# Sins of the City
## *"Time is a flat circle. We've done this before. We'll do it again."*

### Campaign Overview

In the swamplands of the Bayou Kingdoms, where civilization meets the wild and the old gods never truly died, two investigators from drastically different backgrounds are partnered to solve a ritualistic murder. What begins as a single horrific crime—a young woman found posed in a cypress grove, antlers affixed to her head, covered in spiral symbols—unravels into a decades-spanning conspiracy involving the most powerful families in the region, occult worship, and crimes that echo across generations.

The campaign follows the investigators over multiple timelines: the present-day investigation, flashbacks to earlier cases that connect, and glimpses of an ancient cycle that may be repeating. The duo must navigate corrupt institutions, their own personal demons, and the possibility that reality itself is more flexible than they believed. The swamp holds secrets—ones that don't want to be found—and the investigators will question their sanity, their morality, and whether some truths should remain buried.

This is noir meets cosmic horror meets Southern Gothic. The atmosphere is oppressive, the morality is grey, and the mystery goes deeper than anyone could imagine. Players will need strong stomachs for dark themes, patience for slow-burn investigation, and willingness to explore philosophical questions about time, meaning, and evil.

### Core Themes

- **Cosmic Horror**: Powers beyond human comprehension
- **Class and Power**: The wealthy literally getting away with murder
- **Redemption and Damnation**: Can you save yourself while saving others?

### Major Locations

**Bayou Parish**
Louisiana-inspired swampland setting. Poverty, isolation, secrets festering for generations. Spanish moss, cypress trees, oppressive humidity, and sense of decay.

**Carcosa Foundation Properties**
Abandoned schools, children's homes, camps—all sites of abuse. Dilapidated, haunted by past atrocities. Yellow fabric and spiral symbols hidden in architecture.

**The Tuttle Compound**
Mansion belonging to powerful family. Appears respectable but hides evidence in vaults, servants' quarters, private chapel. Baroque Southern plantation aesthetic.

**Ledoux's Meth Lab**
Ramshackle compound in deep swamp. Booby-trapped, filled with occult symbols and evidence of rituals. Found mid-campaign in dramatic raid.

**The Church of the Shepherd**
Reverend Childress's church. Gothic Southern chapel. Basement contains evidence of true nature: ritual chamber, records of victims, connection to cult network.

**Errol's Fortress**
Final location: sprawling complex built into swamp. Maze-like, deliberately disorienting. Rooms don't connect logically. Covered in symbols. Reality seems unstable here.

**The Police Station**
Small-town law enforcement, underfunded and corrupt. Evidence room is compromised. Officers range from ignorant to complicit. Institutional failure made physical.

**The Bar**
Where investigators meet informants and drown sorrows. Seedy roadside establishment. Information exchanged, relationships fractured, violence erupts.

### Unique Mechanics

**Timeline Investigation**
- Players investigate across multiple time periods
- Clues in one timeline inform the other
- Can "flashback" to gather evidence in past
- Changes in past investigations affect present
- Convergence points where timelines meet

**Sanity and Obsession**
- Exposure to cult materials causes psychological damage
- Obsession with case damages relationships and health
- Mechanical effects: exhaustion, paranoia, disadvantage on social checks
- Can push beyond limits but at increasing cost
- "Flat circle" moments: déjà vu, time loops, philosophical crisis

**Interrogation Depth**
- Extended interrogation scenes, can last entire session
- Multiple approaches: philosophical, aggressive, deceptive
- Breaking a subject requires understanding their psychology
- Information revealed in layers, must push harder for truth
- Risk of legal consequences for methods used

**Cult Lore Discovery**
- Gradual revelation of cult's nature and history
- Pieces found in: journals, symbols, survivor testimony, ritual sites
- Players construct understanding from fragments
- Truth is never certain—cosmic horror thrives on ambiguity
- Different interpretations possible

**Partnership Dynamics**
- Two lead investigators with different approaches
- Tension between them affects investigation
- Must choose whose method to follow in key moments
- Relationship deteriorates and potentially repairs
- Trust mechanics: help or hinder based on relationship

**The Yellow Sign**
- Repeated symbol appearing across investigation
- Recognition of symbol causes unease, eventually damage
- Symbol appears in unexpected places
- May be portal, may be marker, may be nothing
- Player choice whether to obsess over it

### Plot Twists and Complications

**The Scapegoat**
First suspect arrested and killed isn't the mastermind. Just another victim-turned-perpetrator. Real power structure remains intact.

**The Good Ole Boys**
Local police and government actively obstruct investigation. Not all are cult members, but all protect the system.

**The Family Connection**
One investigator discovers family member involved in cult or previous cover-up. Personal stake becomes unbearable.

**The Time Loop**
Evidence suggests this has happened before, exactly like this. Are investigators destined to fail and try again?

**The Corruption Within**
One investigator crosses lines, becomes what they fight. Partner must decide: report them or protect them?

**The Survivor's Truth**
Cult survivor provides crucial information but is unreliable narrator. What's real memory, what's trauma, what's programming?

**The Political Pressure**
State and federal authorities order case closed. Following orders means injustice; defying them means career ending.

**Carcosa Is Real**
The occult elements aren't just delusion. Something genuinely otherworldly exists. This changes everything.

### Victory Conditions

**Truth and Justice**
- Cult exposed and leaders arrested
- Evidence public, cover-up revealed
- Victims remembered and honored
- System forced to change
- Investigators damaged but alive
- Possibility of peace

**Pyrrhic Victory**
- Main cultists stopped but system intact
- Investigators destroyed in process
- Families ruined, careers ended
- Truth known but not believed
- "We did our job, but what did it cost?"

**Breaking the Cycle**
- Not just solving current case but ending pattern
- Destroy cult's foundations, not just members
- Prevent future occurrences
- Ultimate sacrifice may be required
- Cosmic horror defeated (maybe)

### Defeat Conditions

**The Cover-Up Succeeds**
- Investigators silenced through death or discrediting
- Scapegoat blamed, real perpetrators continue
- Cycle continues unbroken
- Carcosa wins

**Consumed by Darkness**
- Investigators become corrupted
- Either join cult or become no better than them
- Means justify ends until nothing justified
- Moral defeat even if case technically solved

**Lost in Time**
- Investigators unable to distinguish past from present
- Reality breaks down completely
- Carcosa consumes them
- Campaign ends in cosmic horror

### Campaign Tone and Experience

This campaign is for mature players comfortable with:
- Dark themes: child abuse (handled carefully), cult activity, corruption
- Slow burn investigation requiring patience
- Philosophical and psychological horror
- Morally ambiguous situations with no clean answers
- Character-driven drama and interpersonal conflict
- Atmosphere over action (though violence when it comes is brutal)

The DM should emphasize:
- Oppressive Southern Gothic atmosphere
- Long, intense dialogue scenes
- Flashback structure keeping players off-balance
- Ambiguity: not all questions answered
- Personal cost of seeking truth
- Beauty and horror of the bayou
- Philosophical underpinnings: time, meaning, evil

This is *True Detective* Season 1 in D&D: slow, dark, brilliant, and unforgettable. The mystery is the journey, and the journey changes everyone who takes it.
