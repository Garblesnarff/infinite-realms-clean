# Sins of the City - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone and Art Direction

### Overall Aesthetic
**Southern Gothic Noir meets Cosmic Horror**: Decaying beauty of the American South meets oppressive dread of unknowable forces. Think *True Detective* Season 1 meets *The King in Yellow* meets Cormac McCarthy's landscapes.

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- Sickly Yellow (#E4C25A) - The Yellow King, corruption, wrongness
- Deep Green (#2D4A2E) - Swamp, decay, hidden things
- Rust Brown (#8B4513) - Decay, blood (dried), earth
- Shadow Black (#1C1C1C) - Night, secrets, the void

**Secondary Colors:**
- Dirty White (#F5F5DC) - Faded paint, old fabric, bone
- Smoke Grey (#696969) - Fog, uncertainty, moral ambiguity
- Blood Red (#8B0000) - Violence (sparingly used)
- Bruise Purple (#4B0082) - Wrongness, cosmic elements

**Environmental Colors:**
- Spanish Moss Grey-Green
- Muddy Water Brown
- Cypress Wood Grey
- Humid Haze White
- Sunset Orange (beautiful but ominous)

### Lighting Design

**Natural Light:**
- Harsh Southern sun creating deep shadows
- Golden hour that feels ominous rather than beautiful
- Oppressive noon heat that bleaches colors
- Storm light: green-tinted, threatening

**Atmospheric Lighting:**
- Constant haze and humidity diffusing light
- Swamp fog creating isolation
- Cigarette smoke in interrogation rooms
- Flashlight beams cutting through darkness

**Symbolic Lighting:**
- Yellow fabric/symbols seem to emit sickly glow
- Cultist locations have wrong shadows (angles don't match)
- Time-shift moments: lighting changes subtly to indicate different era
- Carcosa itself: non-euclidean light sources

**Emotional Lighting:**
- Present day: washed out, overexposed, harsh
- Flashbacks: slightly warmer, more saturated (false nostalgia)
- Cult scenes: darkness with wrongly-placed highlights
- Final confrontation: impossible angles of light and shadow

### Architecture and Environment

**The Bayou:**
- Endless cypress swamps with hanging moss
- Water that reflects sky but hides depths
- Decaying plantation houses
- Poverty: trailer parks, shotgun shacks, abandoned buildings
- Industry: rusted factories, chemical plants, oil refineries

**Institutional Spaces:**
- Police station: fluorescent lights, water-stained ceiling tiles, ancient files
- Churches: Gothic Southern, white paint peeling, hidden basements
- Schools (abandoned): institutional green walls, graffiti, broken windows
- Government buildings: bureaucratic decay, portraits of forgotten officials

**Cult Locations:**
- Seemingly normal exteriors hiding horror
- Yellow fabric in unexpected places
- Spiral symbols worked into architecture
- Spaces that feel wrong: rooms too big, hallways too long
- Errol's fortress: M.C. Escher meets rural decay

**Visual Motifs:**
- Spirals everywhere (natural and carved)
- Antlers and animal skulls
- Yellow fabric (flags, clothing, decorations)
- Barbed wire and chain-link fences
- Crosses (Christian and inverted)
- Mirrors and reflective surfaces (showing different times)

- Beautiful and terrible simultaneously

- Morally comfortable resolution

**Tonal Balance:**
- 40% Slow-burn investigation and dialogue

This campaign is *True Detective* Season 1: slow, dark, philosophical, and cinematically brilliant. Every frame should feel deliberate. Every word should matter. And the truth, when revealed, should be simultaneously satisfying and deeply unsettling.
