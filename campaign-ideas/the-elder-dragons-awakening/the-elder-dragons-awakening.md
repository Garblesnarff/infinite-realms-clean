**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **16**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Every few thousand years, six Elder Dragons awaken to consume the world's magic, creating cataclysms that reshape continents and destroy civilizations. The world of Tyria has already lost one major nation to the undead dragon Zhaitan, and now the others stir. The players are members of the Pact—a desperate alliance of former enemies united against extinction. They must kill or contain each Elder Dragon while discovering a terrible truth: the dragons are part of the world's natural cycle, and destroying them all may doom Tyria to an even worse fate.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16+ sessions)

A tale of desperate survival against forces of nature that transcend good and evil.

*   **Act I — The Pact Forms (Sessions 1–5):** After Zhaitan's death left a magical void causing chaos, the remaining five Elder Dragons grow more aggressive. The players join the reformed Pact to fight Mordremoth, the dragon of plant and mind. They discover each dragon has minions, corruption, and unique world-altering powers.
*   **Act II — The Dragon Hunt (Sessions 6–12):** The party leads campaigns against multiple Elder Dragons: Jormag (ice/persuasion), Primordus (fire/destruction), and Kralkatorrik (crystal/madness). Each victory creates unintended consequences—killing dragons destabilizes the magical ecosystem. They must find new methods beyond simple slaying.
*   **Act III — The Balance (Sessions 13–16+):** The players learn the Elder Dragons regulate magic, preventing it from overwhelming reality. They must forge a new approach: replace the dragons' function with mortal stewardship, transfer dragon power to willing champions, or find a way to put the dragons back to sleep without killing them.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of ecological balance, unintended consequences, and finding solutions beyond violence. The central conflict evolves from "kill the dragons" to "understand the dragons' purpose and forge a sustainable future." It questions whether forces of nature can be truly evil.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dragon Corruption System**
*   Each Elder Dragon has a unique corruption mechanic affecting the environment and characters.
*   Mordremoth: Mind control (Wisdom saves or be charmed).
*   Jormag: Temptation (offered power in exchange for service).
*   Primordus: Destruction (structures and equipment take fire damage over time).
*   Kralkatorrik: Madness (reality becomes unstable, random magical effects).
*   High corruption zones grant dragons awareness of the party's location.

### 2. **Pact Strategy Layer**
*   Before major battles, the party commands Pact forces on a strategic map.
*   Deploy units: Charr war machines, Asura golems, Sylvari scouts, Norn shamans.
*   Success in strategy phase grants advantages: dragon weakened, fewer minions, environmental advantages.
*   Failure means harder personal combat but doesn't make victory impossible.

### 3. **Magic Balance Meter**
*   A campaign tracker monitoring Tyria's magical stability (0-100).
*   Killing dragons drops it. Wild magic surges occur below 50. Reality breaks below 25.
*   Alternative solutions (hibernation, redemption, champion replacement) maintain balance.
*   This meter is revealed partway through the campaign as players learn the truth.

### 4. **Multi-Racial Heritage**
*   Players choose (or roll) a racial sympathy that grants unique abilities.
*   Asura: Tech gadget usage and engineering checks.
*   Charr: Military tactics and intimidation.
*   Sylvari: Plant communication and dream visions.
*   Norn: Animal shapeshifting (bear, wolf, raven, snow leopard).
*   Human: Versatile blessings from Six Human Gods.
*   These abilities grow stronger as the party builds unity.
