# Creative Brief: The Elder Dragons' Awakening

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Vibrant Fantasy Realism (Guild Wars-inspired)

Inspired by Guild Wars 2's colorful, diverse aesthetic—a style that emphasizes cultural diversity, ecological variety, and the awe-inspiring scale of Elder Dragons. This style balances beautiful, painterly environments with the horror of draconic corruption transforming the landscape.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Cultural Diversity:** Show distinct visual identities for each race—Asura tech, Charr industry, Sylvari organics, Norn totems.
*   **Ecological Transformation:** Depict how dragon corruption physically changes environments—ice, plant overgrowth, crystal branded zones, fire wastelands.
*   **Epic Scale:** Elder Dragons are mountain-sized forces of nature, not just big monsters.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Diverse, ecological, apocalyptic-yet-hopeful, vibrant-yet-corrupted, unity-in-crisis.
*   **Feeling:** A world of stunning beauty actively being consumed and transformed by elemental forces, with diverse peoples fighting desperately to preserve it.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, painterly realism with emphasis on natural and architectural diversity.
*   **Forms:** Each race has distinct architecture—Asura cubes and spheres, Charr industrial fortresses, Sylvari organic spirals, Norn carved lodges.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An Asura technological gate made of floating geometric panels with holographic displays, next to a Sylvari organic building grown from living vines and glowing flowers."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and varied by location. Uncorrupted zones are lush and colorful. Corrupted zones show draconic influence.
*   **Dragon Corruption Colors:**
    *   Mordremoth: Sick yellows and dark purples in plant growth.
    *   Jormag: Blues, whites, frozen ice tones.
    *   Primordus: Molten oranges, reds, black char.
    *   Kralkatorrik: Purple-pink branded crystals.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant green jungle suddenly transitioning to Mordremoth corruption—twisted purple vines, sickly yellow flowers, and dark thorns consuming the healthy foliage."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Diverse racial designs, medium-realistic proportions, cultural armor and clothing.
*   **Races:**
    *   Asura: Small, large-eared, wearing tech-integrated gear.
    *   Charr: Large, feline-featured, wearing heavy plated armor.
    *   Sylvari: Plant-like skin, glowing patterns, organic armor.
    *   Norn: Tall, Nordic-inspired, fur and carved armor.
    *   Human: Standard proportions, diverse cultural styles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Charr warrior, a large feline humanoid with horns, wearing heavy iron plate armor with mechanical augments, wielding a massive chainsaw greatsword."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Varied biomes showing both natural beauty and dragon corruption.
*   **Locations:** Multicultural cities, dense jungles, frozen mountains, crystal-branded deserts, volcanic wastes.
*   **Corruption:** Physically transforms terrain—ice spreading, plants mutating, crystals erupting, ground melting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Crystal Desert, a vast landscape of purple-pink crystalline formations erupting from sand dunes, with reality-rifts showing glimpses of other dimensions, under a fractured sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Painterly with vibrant colors and strong atmospheric effects.
*   **Magic:** Glowing elements are common—Asura tech, Sylvari bioluminescence, dragon energy.
*   **Corruption:** Unnatural lighting from dragon magic—cold blue glow, sickly plant phosphorescence, crystal refraction.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the eerie glow of Mordremoth's corruption, with twisted vines emitting sickly yellow-green light, contrasting against the warm torches of defenders."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Emphasize scale and diversity. Show multiple races working together. Frame dragons as massive, landscape-altering entities.
*   **Techniques:** Use environmental storytelling—show progression from healthy to corrupted zones. Include multiple racial perspectives in scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot showing the diverse Pact army—tiny Asura in golems, massive Charr war machines, Sylvari plant-summoners, Norn spirit-warriors—united against a mountain-sized Elder Dragon on the horizon."
