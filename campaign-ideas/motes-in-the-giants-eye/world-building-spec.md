# Motes in the Giant's Eye - World Building Specification

## World History
**The Giant World**: Standard fantasy world but everyone is 60 feet tall. Magic exists. Technology medieval-to-renaissance. Giants are "normal" here.

**The Transportation**: Ancient spell/device allows cross-dimensional travel. Malfunction causes size discrepancy—travelers arrive proportionally tiny (or vice versa, depending on interpretation).

**Previous Arrivals**: Over centuries, others have been transported. Most died. Some survived, built hidden communities. No one successfully returned home.

**Native Smalls**: Indigenous species exists—intelligent tiny beings. Giants never acknowledged them. Entire civilization hidden in walls, underground, margins.

## Cosmology
**Theory 1 - Shrinking**: Party was magically reduced to 1/12th size. World is actually theirs, they're just tiny now.

**Theory 2 - Giant Dimension**: Transported to parallel world where everyone evolved giant-sized. Party is normal, world is huge.

**Theory 3 - Relative**: Both exist simultaneously. Magic created size differential between dimensions. Truth may be unknowable.

## Geography
**The House**: Primary setting. Multiple rooms, each a distinct adventure zone. Owners are middle-class giant family (parents, 2 children, dog, cat).

**The Town**: Fantasy medieval town but giant-scale. Streets 100 feet wide, buildings stories tall even their first floor. Market as impossible marketplace.

**The Wild**: Beyond town. Forest with trees that are already mountain-sized from giant perspective. To party, incomprehensible scale.

**The Walls Between**: Hidden spaces—inside walls, under floorboards, in sewers. Where small community lives. Cozy but makeshift civilization.

## Magic/Technology
**Transportation Magic**: Powerful planar spell. Requires: ancient artifact, significant power source, knowledge lost to time. Party must recover all three.

**Giant Magic**: Standard D&D spells but cast at enormous scale. Fireball from giant mage = nuclear explosion from party perspective.

**Small Community Tech**: Repurposed giant objects—needle swords, button shields, thimble armor, thread rope, etc.

**Native Tiny Magic**: Unique school—stealth magic, giant-avoidance spells, sound dampening, structural sensing (detect giant footsteps).

## Inhabitants
**Giant Family**: Unaware of party initially. Daily routines are natural disasters. Parents work (various professions), children play (dangerous), pets hunt (lethal).

**Small Community**: ~100 transported humans from various times/places. Led by council of elders (been here longest). Factions: militant (wants war on giants), defeatist (gave up), hopeful (seeks return).

**Native Tiny**: ~500 indigenous smalls living in walls. Sophisticated hidden society. Wary of transported humans (draw attention). Own language, culture, history.

**Dangerous Fauna**: From party perspective—insects are monsters (spider = phase spider, beetle = ankheg), pets are kaiju (cat = displacer beast, dog = behir), rodents are dragons (mice = kobolds, rats = dragonborn).

**Other Giants**: Neighbors, authorities, visiting relatives. Each with different attitudes toward smalls if discovered.

## Cultural Details
**Giant Society**: Standard fantasy medieval. Unaware of tiny intelligences at their feet. Some myths of "little folk" but dismissed as superstition.

**Small Survivors**: Developed culture of secrecy, quick relocation, scavenging efficiency. Oral traditions of "the before" (home world). Children born here never knew anything else (tragic).

**Native Tiny**: Entire civilization based on invisibility to giants. Architecture in walls using repurposed giant cast-offs. Complex theology about giants as gods/demons/natural forces.

**Communication**: Between party and giants nearly impossible initially. Requires: shouting (they might hear), giant writing (exhausting), mirrors/fire (catching attention), or magic (Enlarge/Reduce, sending spells).

**Ethics**: Constant questions—is stealing from giants justified (survival)? Is sabotage murder if giant gets hurt? Do giants deserve consideration when they're obliviously lethal?

## Key Secrets
- Giant government knows about smalls (suppressed to prevent ethical crisis)
- Transportation device was created BY a giant (to bring tiny laborers/slaves)
- Native tiny civilization predates giants (were here first, giants are invaders)
- Some giants collect smalls deliberately (market exists, slavery)
- Party's homeworld doesn't exist anymore (centuries passed, apocalypse, or never real)
- A giant child wants to "keep" party as beloved pets (gilded cage)
- Returning home requires sacrificing another life (cruel cost)
- The merging—size differences stabilizing, giants will appear in party's home soon (invasion or integration)

## Appendix
**Scale Reference**:
- Party: 5-6 feet
- Giants: 60 feet
- Ratio: 1:10 to 1:12

**Domestic Locations as Dungeons**:
- Kitchen: Industrial zone, heat, water, chemicals
- Bedroom: Vast plains, soft terrain, dust storms
- Bathroom: Wetlands, flooding, toxic cleaners
- Living Room: Varied terrain, pet encounters
- Attic/Basement: Forgotten wilderness, monsters

**Campaign Timeframe**: Can be as short as 20 sessions (focused rescue) or indefinite (life in giant world becomes new normal).

This world emphasizes **vulnerability, resourcefulness, and forced empathy**. Every moment is dangerous. Every solution requires creativity. Every giant is potentially lethal and potentially sympathetic.
