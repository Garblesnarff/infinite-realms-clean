# The Trickster's Tournament - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Whimsical Horror

**Aesthetic:** Tim Burton meets Willy Wonka meets Alice in Wonderland. Beautiful, colorful, slightly wrong.

**Color Palette:** Oversaturated rainbow, impossible colors (#00FFFF, #FF00FF, #FFFF00), candy pastels, dark shadows, eye-searing contrast.

**Music:** Carnival music (distorted), playful malice, harpsichord and music boxes, chaotic orchestration, audience laughter and applause tracks.

**Voice Direction:**
- Laughing King: Theatrical, manic, Willy Wonka meets Joker
- Contestants: Desperate sincerity turning to madness
- Audience: Inhuman laughter, strange commentary

## Cinematic Moments
- Reality warping mid-challenge
- Cartoonish eliminations
