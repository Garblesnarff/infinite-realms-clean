# The Trickster's Tournament - World-Building Specification

## The Feywild Arena

**The Laughing King's Domain:** Personal demiplane within Feywild. Reality here is King's plaything. Time doesn't flow normally. Escaping nearly impossible. Feeds on entertainment energy.

**Previous Tournaments:** Happening for millennia. Winners either freed (rarely), transformed into Fey creatures (often), or becoming hosts themselves (commonly). All become part of eternal carnival.

**The Audience:** Everything in Feywild can watch. Trees, animals, objects vote. Some are former contestants. Audience is also entertainment. Meta-layers of watching.

**Challenge Types:**
- Physical (defying physics)
- Mental (impossible riddles)
- Talent (subjective judging)
- Luck (rigged)
- Hybrid (all of above simultaneously)

**Fey Logic Principles:**
- Contradictions fine
- Dramatic irony rewarded
- Puns have power
- Clever wordplay might save you
- Laughter grants protection
- Taking it too seriously punished
- Joining the absurdity helps

**The Prize:** "Anything you want" but be specific. Poorly worded wishes backfire. King enjoys ironic fulfillment. Best prize is escaping with lesson learned.

**Deeper Meaning:** King is teaching (through trauma) about nature of reality and acceptance of chaos. Or just bored immortal being cruel. Possibly both.

## Campaign Tone Balance

Mix of dark comedy and real stakes. Death is funny but also tragic. Whimsy with horror underneath. Players should laugh AND be terrified. Monty Python meets Dark Souls meets game shows.
