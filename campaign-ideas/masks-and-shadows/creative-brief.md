## Art Style: Authentic Slice-of-Life Romance (Horimiya-inspired)

Inspired by the gentle, realistic style of Horimiya, this aesthetic captures the intimacy of everyday moments, the contrast between public and private selves, and the warmth of genuine connection.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Duality:** Show the stark contrast between school personas and home identities.
*   **Intimacy in Small Moments:** Focus on domestic scenes and quiet togetherness rather than grand gestures.
*   **Natural Beauty:** Characters are attractive but realistic, not idealized beyond believability.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Sweet, intimate, gentle, authentic, domestic, comfortable, real, warm, honest, slice-of-life.
*   **Feeling:** The cozy comfort of being yourself with someone who truly knows you. Warm domestic scenes mixed with school life.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, natural lines. Realistic proportions and expressions. Softer lines for domestic scenes, slightly sharper for school scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic anime-style illustration showing the contrast between two identities: left panel shows a popular girl in perfect school uniform, right panel shows the same girl in casual home clothes cooking in a kitchen."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Natural, warm colors. School scenes use bright, clean colors. Home scenes use warmer, softer earth tones.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...warm, natural colors emphasizing the domestic comfort of the scene. Soft oranges and browns for the home interior, creating an intimate, genuine atmosphere."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Hori:** Pretty but not impossibly so. Perfect at school, simple and genuine at home. Usually in school uniform or simple home clothes.
*   **Miyamura:** Long dark hair hiding his face at school (later cut short), piercings and tattoos usually hidden. Gentle expression when comfortable.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young man with short dark hair, wearing casual clothes with visible ear piercings. His sleeve is rolled up, showing intricate tattoos on his arm. His expression is gentle and relaxed, very different from his gloomy school persona."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic school and home environments. Emphasis on Hori's kitchen and living room as the primary setting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cozy, modest home kitchen with warm lighting. Two people cooking together, comfortable and domestic. The space feels lived-in and welcoming, emphasizing the intimacy of everyday life."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural lighting throughout. Warm home lighting for domestic scenes, bright school lighting for public scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...warm home lighting creating a cozy, intimate atmosphere perfect for quiet togetherness and domestic comfort."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Character-focused, often showing two people in comfortable proximity. Domestic activities featured prominently.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medium shot of two people sitting close together in a home, comfortable and natural. Their body language shows intimacy and trust, highlighting the authenticity of their connection."

## Voice

**Narrator Voice:** Warm, gentle, and knowing. The voice of someone recounting a sweet, genuine love story. Natural and unforced, like a friend sharing a happy memory. Studio-quality with the warmth of afternoon sunlight.
