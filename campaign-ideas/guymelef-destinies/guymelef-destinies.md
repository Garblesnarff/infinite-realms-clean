The party includes someone from Earth (the Mystic Moon) transported to Gaea—a fantasy world where kingdoms wage war using Guymelefs (magical mecha). They discover their arrival was prophesied by tarot, their fate intertwined with Van Fanel (exiled prince with a dragon transformation) and the Zaibach Empire (seeking to rewrite destiny itself using Fate Alteration machines). The campaign blends fantasy adventure, mecha combat, romance, and the question: can you change destiny, or does fighting fate only fulfill it?

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Guymelef combat combines medieval tactics with magical abilities. Fate Alteration machines create probability manipulation—enemies rewrite causality.
*   **Investigation:** Following tarot prophecies, uncovering Zaibach's Destiny Engine, navigating political intrigue between kingdoms.
*   **Consequences:** Choices fulfill or defy prophecy. The isekai protagonist's presence affects Gaea's fate. Love triangles complicate alliances.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — Arrival on Gaea (Sessions 1–4):** An Earth party member is transported to Gaea, meets Van Fanel, and witnesses his kingdom destroyed by Zaibach. They flee with Van's Guymelef Escaflowne (a legendary transforming dragon-mech).
*   **Act II — The Prophecy (Sessions 5–8):** Tarot readings reveal the party's role in destiny. They journey between kingdoms, fighting Zaibach forces and recruiting allies. Romantic tensions develop.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Guymelef Combat**

*   Medieval-style mech battles using swords, lances, and shields alongside magical abilities.
*   **Energists:** Power cores that channel energy—stronger emotions create more power.

### 2. **Tarot Prophecy**

*   The party uses tarot readings to receive cryptic guidance.
*   **Mechanic:** DM draws tarot cards for major decisions. Interpretations are ambiguous—players choose how to fulfill or defy prophecies.

### 3. **Fate Alteration**

*   Late-game, the party encounters Fate Alteration tech—rerolls, probability manipulation, forced outcomes.
*   **Mechanic:** Enemies can force rerolls of player successes. Players must destroy the machines to restore normal causality.

### 4. **Isekai Protagonist**

*   One party member is from Earth (the Mystic Moon visible in Gaea's sky).

## Key Locations

1.  **Fanelia:** Van's destroyed homeland, a kingdom of dragon-blooded warriors. Now ruins.
2.  **Asturia:** Allied kingdom where the party finds refuge, center of political intrigue.
3.  **Zaibach Empire:** Militaristic state with steampunk aesthetics, building Fate Alteration machines.
4.  **The Mystic Valley:** Hidden location where tarot readers and seers gather.
5.  **Destiny's Engine:** Zaibach's ultimate weapon—a massive machine manipulating Gaea's fate.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is destiny vs. free will. Prophecies predict the future, but do they describe fate or self-fulfilling reactions? Zaibach seeks to perfect destiny by eliminating choice. The party must decide whether uncertainty (free will) is better than guaranteed good outcomes (controlled fate).

---

## Themes

*   **Destiny vs. Free Will:** Can you change fate, or does fighting it ensure its fulfillment?
*   **Isekai Perspective:** The Earth protagonist brings outside perspective, challenging Gaea's traditions.
*   **Love Triangle:** Hitomi's affection for Van vs. Allen creates drama that affects alliances and decisions.
*   **Transformation:** Van's dragon form, Escaflowne's transformations—change as both power and danger.
*   **Perfect Peace vs. Free Chaos:** Zaibach offers a world without war but also without choice. Is that worth it?

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Destroy the Fate Engine:** Restore free will to Gaea. Future is uncertain but chosen.
*   **Use the Engine Wisely:** Reprogram it for limited intervention—prevent disasters without removing all choice. Risky balance.
*   **Fulfill the Prophecy:** Accept destiny, playing the role tarot predicted. Victory predetermined but agency questioned.
*   **Return to Earth:** The isekai protagonist chooses to go home, leaving Gaea to its fate. Personal peace but abandoning new friends.

## DM Guidance

*   **Tarot Integration:** Use actual tarot cards or random tables for prophecies. Keep interpretations ambiguous—players should debate meanings.
*   **Romance Subplot:** Van and Allen's rivalry for Hitomi's affection should create tension but not derail the main plot.
*   **Moral Complexity:** Dornkirk isn't evil—he genuinely seeks peace. The party should question if he's wrong.
*   **Isekai Perspective:** The Earth protagonist should feel like an outsider with unique insights. Use Earth knowledge creatively.
