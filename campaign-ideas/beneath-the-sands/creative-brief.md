# Creative Brief: Beneath the Sands

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Desert Western Horror

Inspired by the practical effects and tense atmosphere of creature features like Tremors, blending Western frontier aesthetics with monster horror. This style emphasizes isolation, resourcefulness, and the terror of an unseen predator lurking just beneath your feet.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Environment Danger:** The desert itself is hostile—endless sand, brutal sun, no escape. The ground is the enemy.
*   **Show Resourcefulness:** Characters use improvised weapons, makeshift defenses, and clever tactics. Nothing is high-tech or pristine.
*   **Vibration and Movement:** Visually suggest the threat beneath—rippling sand, cracks forming, dust settling, the moment before the attack.
*   **Practical Creature Design:** Sandwyrms should look believable, like evolved predators—segmented bodies, rows of teeth, armored hide, covered in sand and slime.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tense, claustrophobic, resourceful, escalating, gritty, isolated, sun-baked, primal fear.
*   **Feeling:** Constant vigilance. Every step could be your last. The monsters are smart and evolving. Humanity's ingenuity vs. nature's ruthlessness.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Gritty realism with visible texture—weathered wood, worn leather, dusty surfaces. Creatures have organic, segmented forms.
*   **Forms:** Buildings are rough-hewn and functional. Sandwyrms are serpentine with bulbous segments, tooth-filled maws, and sensory tendrils.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, gritty illustration of a Sandwyrm erupting from the desert floor. Its body is segmented like a worm, covered in sand-colored chitin and slime. Rows of hooked teeth line its circular maw. Dust and debris explode outward."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desert tones—sandy yellows, dusty browns, bleached whites. Splashes of red (blood, sunset). Cool blues for shade and night.
*   **Contrast:** The Sandwyrms blend with the sand (natural camouflage), but their mouths are dark red/pink interiors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of sun-bleached yellows and browns, with the Sandwyrm's gaping maw revealing a dark, fleshy red interior lined with teeth."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Dusthaven residents wear practical desert attire—leather vests, wide-brimmed hats, bandanas, sturdy boots. They carry improvised weapons (hunting rifles, dynamite, pitchforks).
*   **Sheriff Kord:** Dwarf in dusty sheriff gear, weathered face, carries a shotgun and badge.
*   **Doc Mira:** Elven healer in practical robes with medical satchel, gentle eyes.
*   **Sandwyrms:** Start as 30-foot serpentine predators. Later evolutions add legs (crab-like), acid sacs (visible bulges), or armored plating (thicker chitin).
*   **Prompt Example:** "Sheriff Kord, a grizzled dwarf in a dusty leather vest and wide-brimmed hat, stands on a wooden walkway above the sand. He grips a shotgun, eyes scanning for ripples in the sand below."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Dusthaven:** A small frontier town with wooden buildings, a main street, water tower, and sheriff's office. Everything is coated in dust. Improvised walkways connect buildings.
*   **The Desert:** Endless dunes, cracked earth, scattered rocks, skeletal remains of creatures. Heat shimmer distorts the horizon. No vegetation.
*   **The Mine:** Dark, narrow tunnels with wooden support beams, lantern light, dust floating in the air. Walls scratched by claws. The nest is a massive, organic chamber.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of Dusthaven, a small desert town with wooden buildings connected by rope bridges and wooden planks elevated 10 feet above the sand. In the foreground, ripples form in the sand as a Sandwyrm approaches."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh overhead sunlight during the day, casting deep shadows. Night scenes are lit by flickering lanterns and firelight. Underground, light is scarce—pools of lantern glow in oppressive darkness.
*   **Vibration Effect:** When Sandwyrms approach, show subtle motion—sand grains jumping, dust clouds, visual distortion.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by harsh midday sun, casting stark shadows beneath the elevated walkway. Below, the sand ripples ominously, suggesting something massive just beneath the surface."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use low angles to emphasize the danger below. Frame characters elevated (on walkways, buildings) with the threatening ground below. Show the scale of the Sandwyrms erupting from below.
*   **Techniques:** Use foreground/background contrast—safe elevated space in focus, dangerous ground in soft focus. Show the moment of attack—sand exploding, jaws opening, characters reacting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot from ground level as a Sandwyrm's massive maw erupts from the sand directly at the camera. In the background, a PC dives off the ground onto a rope ladder. Dust and sand fill the air."

## Voice

A gravelly, weathered male voice with a Western drawl, delivering lines with wry humor and grim determination. The standard American accent carries a frontier storyteller's cadence—conversational but with underlying tension. The emotion shifts from dry wit to sudden urgency, reflecting the constant threat. Audio quality is clear, studio-quality, with subtle ambient desert sounds (wind, distant rumbles). Role: A survivor recounting the siege, or a grizzled prospector warning newcomers about the dangers beneath the sands.
