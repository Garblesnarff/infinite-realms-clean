# Creative Brief: Death and Dynasty

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy Realism (Assassin's Creed meets Dark Souls)

Inspired by the tactical, morally complex aesthetic of *Assassin's Creed*, *Dark Souls*, and dark fantasy anime. This style emphasizes realistic medieval settings with dark fantasy elements, tactical combat, and the weight of consequence. Characters are rendered realistically with focus on their tools and technique. Environments range from opulent noble estates to dark alleyways and cursed temples. The overall tone is serious, methodical, and atmospheric.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Realism and Weight:** Depict characters as skilled professionals who understand the cost of their actions. Show realistic weapons, armor, and tactical positioning.
*   **Dark, Atmospheric Lighting:** Use shadows, limited light sources, and dramatic contrast to create tension and atmosphere.
*   **Show Consequence:** Illustrate the moral weight through character expressions, environmental details, and the aftermath of actions.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tactical, dark, methodical, morally complex, strategic, atmospheric, serious, consequential.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of tension and weight. Every action matters, and the cost of failure—or success—is high. Beauty exists but is tinged with danger.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed, with emphasis on accurate anatomy, realistic weapon designs, and architectural precision.
*   **Forms:** Medieval fantasy architecture rendered realistically. Characters have practical, functional designs rather than flashy fantasy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic digital painting of a young noble assassin in practical dark clothing, studying a target from a rooftop. The style emphasizes realism, with detailed period clothing, realistic architecture, and atmospheric lighting. Dark fantasy aesthetic."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, naturalistic colors with deep shadows. Stone grays, leather browns, steel blues, and the occasional rich color of noble fabrics or blood.
*   **Accent Colors:** Gold of nobility, red of blood and danger, the cold blue of moonlight.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of stone gray, dark leather brown, and cold steel blue. The only warm color is the golden candlelight illuminating the target, and the deep red of noble clothing."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic proportions and practical designs. Assassins wear functional clothing that allows movement. Nobles wear rich but historically-grounded garments.
*   **Focus:** Characters' eyes show intelligence, determination, and the weight of their choices.
*   **Expressions:** Serious, calculating, occasionally haunted. This is not a world of easy smiles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young noble with sharp, intelligent eyes and a serious expression. They wear elegant noble clothing that conceals practical weapons. Their posture suggests both aristocratic training and lethal competence. Realistic dark fantasy style."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic medieval fantasy—stone castles, dark alleyways, opulent noble estates, shadowy temples. Architecture is functional and period-appropriate.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often dark or dimly lit, with dramatic lighting creating areas of shadow perfect for concealment.
*   **Details:** Hidden weapons caches, escape routes, observation positions—environments designed for assassination.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval noble estate at night, rendered in realistic dark fantasy style. Stone walls, narrow windows with candlelight, guards patrolling predictable routes. Shadows pool in corners and archways. The atmosphere is tense and atmospheric, emphasizing opportunities for infiltration."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting. Limited light sources (candles, moonlight, firelight) create deep shadows.
*   **Shadows:** Essential to the aesthetic—hiding places, dramatic reveals, the weight of secrecy.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates tension, guides the eye to important elements, and emphasizes the clandestine nature of the work.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by dim candlelight from a window, creating dramatic shadows and highlighting the assassin's focused expression. The lighting is high-contrast and atmospheric, emphasizing the tension of the moment."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Tactical, considered compositions showing planning and positioning. Often from angles that suggest observation or infiltration.
*   **Techniques:** Use of foreground shadowed elements framing the scene, aerial views showing tactical situations, close-ups emphasizing critical details.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition showing an assassination from above—the target in a pool of candlelight, the assassin approaching through shadows, escape routes visible. The framing emphasizes the tactical nature of the moment and the weight of the action about to occur."

## Voice

A measured, deep male voice with a serious, contemplative tone and slight European accent. The pacing is deliberate and thoughtful, with meaningful pauses that emphasize the weight of each word. The emotion is controlled but present—conveying the moral complexity and gravity of the subject matter. Audio quality is pristine and intimate, as if sharing dark truths in confidence. Role: A master assassin reflecting on their craft and the cost of their choices, or a tactician explaining the necessary evils of their work.
