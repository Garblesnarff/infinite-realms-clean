## Causality Chains

### The Chain of Hubris

1. Captain commits hubris (varies: desecrates temple, boasts to gods, murders innocents in Troy)
2. Divine attention turns negative
3. Storms blow ship off course
4. Each island tests party differently
5. Crew's failures compound (opening bag, eating cattle)
6. Individual suffering becomes collective
7. Eventually only those who didn't sin survive
8. Final return requires ritual appeasement

### The Prophecy Chain

1. Tiresias prophesies full future in Underworld
2. Each prediction comes true despite attempts to avoid
3. Party realizes prophecy isn't commands but observations of what will be
4. Attempting to change prophecy creates it (self-fulfilling)
5. Final prophecy (journey inland) is test: accept fate or rebel
6. Peace comes only through accepting what must be

### The Loyalty Chain

1. Crew starts united, loyal
2. First major loss creates doubt
3. Captain makes decision that costs lives
4. Crew fractures into factions
5. Mutiny becomes viable option
6. Some stay loyal despite everything
7. Survivors are those who thread needle between blind loyalty and rebellious death
8. Homecoming requires both leader and followers to have endured

### The Identity Chain

1. Captain leaves as young warrior
2. War changes him (Troy's atrocities)
3. Journey transforms him further (survivor's guilt, divine encounters)
4. Years pass—physical aging, spiritual exhaustion
5. Disguise by Athena mirrors internal change
6. Must prove identity to family who knew different person
7. Question: is he still the same person who left?
8. Resolution: he's not, but that's acceptable growth

## Additional Lore

### The Sacred Laws of Xenia (Guest-Friendship)

**Host Obligations:**
- Provide food, shelter, and safety to guests
- Don't ask identity until after hospitality shown
- Give gifts when guest departs
- Protect guest from all harm

**Guest Obligations:**
- Accept hospitality graciously
- Don't abuse host's generosity
- Don't sleep with host's spouse or pursue children
- Leave before wearing out welcome
- Reciprocate if roles reverse

**Consequences of Breaking Xenia:**
- Zeus Xenios (Zeus as protector of guests) punishes violators
- Breaking xenia is worse than murder in divine judgment
- Cyclops violates it (eats guests), earning extra condemnation
- Suitors violate it (abuse household), justifying their slaughter
- Party must honor it even when difficult

### The Nature of Nostos

**Nostos** is more than physical journey home—it's spiritual completion of hero's arc:
- Must return changed but recognizable
- Bringing gifts and glory from journey
- Reasserting place in community
- Completing obligations left undone
- Closing circle: home-adventure-home

**Failed Nostos:**
- Agamemnon: returned home only to be murdered
- Ajax: blasphemed, died in storm
- Many heroes: cursed to wander, never arriving
- Successful nostos requires divine approval and personal growth

### The Mediterranean World

**Geography:** Islands scattered across wine-dark sea, each day's sailing brings different cultures

**Known World:**
- Greek mainland and islands (party's origin)
- Asia Minor (Troy's region)
- Sicily and Italy (where some islands may be)
- Beyond Pillars of Heracles: mythic realm where normal rules don't apply

**Unknown World:**
- Where gods still walk openly
- Where monsters dwell
- Where time flows differently
- Where mortal and divine overlap

### Divine Politics Context

**Why Gods Care:**
- Mortals provide worship (power source)
- Heroes' deeds reflect on patron deities
- Divine pride requires punishing slights
- Prophecies must be fulfilled or cosmic order cracks
- Gods bored, mortals are entertainment

**Why Athena Helps:**
- Recognizes intelligence and cunning (her domains)
- Revenge on Poseidon (ancient rivalry)
- Genuinely fond of clever mortals
- Wants her favorites to succeed

**Why Poseidon Opposes:**
- Son blinded (legitimate grievance)
- Pride wounded (mocked by mortal)
- Nature as storm god makes him erratic and vengeful
- Only ritual appeasement ends grudge

### The Role of Bards

**Why Tale-Telling Matters:**
- Oral tradition preserves heroes
- Good tale = immortality through song
- Phaeacian bards already singing party's deeds before hearing them
- The journey itself becoming legend in real-time
- Party's retellings shape how they're remembered

**Power of Names:**
- "Nobody" trick works because names have power
- True name gives others power over you
- Disguise involves literal name change
- Recognition scenes involve speaking true names
- Fame means your name echoes forever

### Homecoming Complexity

**What Party Finds:**
- Home degraded but not destroyed
- Some loyal, some betrayed
- Heir grown beyond recognition
- Spouse tested by decade alone
- Political situation complex
- Not everyone wants them back

**The Test:**
- Can they reclaim without becoming monsters?
- Is violence justice or revenge?
- How much has home changed?
- How much have they changed?
- Is reconciliation possible?

### Campaign Philosophy

This campaign asks: **What price for glory? What cost for homecoming?**

Every choice has consequences:
- Kill monsters, anger their divine parents
- Be clever, risk hubris
- Trust crew, risk mutiny
- Maintain honor, starve
- Survive, lose humanity

The journey home is longer than journey out because:
- Return requires growing, not just traveling
- Must become worthy of homecoming
- Both party and home must be ready
- The journey is the destination
- Home is internal as much as external

Victory isn't reaching destination—it's who you become along the way.
