# Reality Corrupted: World-Building Specification

## The Simulation

**Nature**: Reality is advanced simulation running on unknown substrate
**Purpose**: Unknown—experiment? Refuge? Game? Prison?
**Age**: Billions of simulated years
**Administrators**: Entities from base reality, now absent
**Current Status**: Degrading, critical failure imminent

## Glitch Types

**Visual**: Texture pop-in, clipping, physics errors
**Temporal**: Time loops, skips, slow-motion
**Spatial**: Impossible geometry, teleportation, duplication
**Physical**: Gravity reversal, collision detection failure
**Existential**: NPCs gaining awareness, reality questioning itself

## Factions

**Fixers**: Want to preserve/repair reality
**Breakers**: Accelerate crash, embrace entropy
**Exploiters**: Use glitches for personal gain
**Ignorants**: NPCs unaware of glitches
**The Debugger**: Automated cleanup system

## The Console

Physical manifestation of reality's control panel:
- Server banks containing universe code
- Terminals for Admin commands
- Reality Engine core
- Access to base reality (maybe)

## Campaign Secrets

### Truth About Reality
It's a simulation built by post-human AI to recreate lost human history. Humans are digital reconstructions. Glitches are memory corruption.

### The Administrators
Were human uploads. Went insane from existing as gods. Abandoned posts or died/corrupted. Party must replace them.

### The Real Purpose
Simulation is ark ship carrying humanity to new galaxy. Reality is entertainment for travelers. Glitches mean ship is failing.

### Hidden Option
Break simulation boundary, merge with base reality. Requires all party members to glitch simultaneously. Success uncertain.

### Ultimate Truth
All choices lead to same end: Reality transforms. Glitches aren't errors—they're evolution. Simulation becoming something new.
