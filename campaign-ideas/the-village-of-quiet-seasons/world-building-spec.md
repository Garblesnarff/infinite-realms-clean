### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Village of Quiet Seasons**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be tranquil, gentle, and healing, in the style of Non Non Biyori or iyashikei anime. Nothing dramatic happens. Peace and presence are the goals. Time feels both endless and fleeting.
*   **Content:** The players experience life in Asagao Village, a tiny rural community with five students in one school. Through daily life across seasons, they discover profound beauty in seemingly mundane moments, learning to simply be present and at peace.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize gentle wisdom, seasonal awareness, and the timeless quality of rural life.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Asagao Village as a place that time seems to have passed by, where the old ways continue peacefully.
    *   Write about the philosophy of "田舎時間" (inaka-jikan / countryside time) – how time moves differently in rural places, both slower and more aligned with nature.
    *   Describe the school's tradition of mixed-age learning in one room and how this creates a unique community.
    *   Explain the significance of seasonal festivals and agricultural rituals that mark the passage of time.
    *   Detail the legend that those who truly listen can hear the village itself breathing – the rhythm of seasons, growth, and gentle life.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields. "Faction" is perhaps too strong a word here – these are gentle community groups.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Schoolchildren (Five Students)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To learn, play, explore, and enjoy their childhoods without rushing.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None formally; older students naturally help younger ones with gentle care.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To attend school, participate in village life, explore the countryside.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each child both treasures their peaceful life and wonders about the wider world; they're aware on some level that this childhood is precious and fleeting.
        *   **Assets:** Boundless free time, intimate knowledge of the countryside, genuine friendship, innocence and wonder.
        *   **Relationships:** Love each other like siblings; trust the adults in the village implicitly; serve as the village's heart and joy.
    *   **The Village Adults** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain the village, raise crops, preserve traditions, and protect the children's peaceful childhood.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Informal respect for elders; decisions made collectively and slowly.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To live agricultural lives and maintain community bonds.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many adults chose to stay or return to the village after experiencing city stress; they're consciously creating and protecting this peace.
        *   **Assets:** Agricultural knowledge, strong community bonds, patience born from rural rhythms, genuine care for each other.
        *   **Relationships:** Function more like extended family than neighbors; protective of the children; welcoming to visitors who show respect for their way of life.
    *   **The Seasons Themselves** (Philosophical "Faction")
        *   **Goals:** To cycle through their eternal pattern, bringing change that is always familiar.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None – each season is equal and necessary.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To mark time through agricultural and natural changes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To teach those who pay attention about presence, change, and the eternal nature of cycles.
        *   **Assets:** Inevitable passage, beauty in all forms, the power to make time feel both fleeting and eternal.
        *   **Relationships:** The seasons are the village's true ruler and teacher; everything else adapts to them.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players take time to truly observe and appreciate a quiet moment.
    *   **THEN:** Award Presence Points. Generate detailed sensory description of the moment. Allow time to stretch. Other characters may join in quiet appreciation. Create a sense of timelessness and peace.
    *   **IF:** Players engage with seasonal activities appropriate to the time of year.
    *   **THEN:** Award Presence Points. Describe the seasonal beauty in detail. Generate meaningful conversations about change and cycles. Create nostalgia for the current season even while experiencing it.
    *   **IF:** Players interact genuinely with the children.
    *   **THEN:** Children share innocent wisdom and wonder. Players see the world through child-like eyes again. Award Presence Points for reconnecting with simplicity. Generate healing moments for stressed or traumatized players.
    *   **IF:** Players spend Presence Points to unlock perfect moments.
    *   **THEN:** Generate cinematically beautiful scenes – ideal weather, perfect timing, harmonious gathering, profound peace. Describe with poetic detail. These moments become treasured memories that heal.
    *   **IF:** The campaign progresses through all four seasons.

    *   **IF:** Players reach campaign's end (return of spring or similar cycle point).
    *   **THEN:** Generate a profound, peaceful conclusion. Players realize nothing "happened" yet everything meaningful did. They understand the gift of presence. Award understanding that this peace exists outside time and can be carried with them. The village continues unchanged, eternally cycling, always there for those who seek tranquility.
