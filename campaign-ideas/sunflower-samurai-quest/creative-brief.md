# Creative Brief: Sunflower Samurai Quest

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Hip-Hop Edo (Modern Urban meets Feudal Japan)

Inspired by Nujabes album covers, street art aesthetics, and classic samurai films. This style blends graffiti with ukiyo-e woodblock prints, breakdancing with sword fights, and turntables with shamisen. Colors are warm and nostalgic—sunset oranges, earthy browns, spray paint vibrancy. Character designs mix feudal and modern—samurai with bandanas, kimonos with street fashion flair. Everything feels anachronistic and intentional—hip-hop soul in historical setting.

### Core Principles:

*   **Anachronistic Cool:** Modern culture existing impossibly in Edo period for pure style.
*   **Journey Energy:** Motion, roads, constant travel through diverse landscapes.
*   **Found Family:** Bickering companions who become inseparable.

## Voice

A laid-back, rhythmic voice—male, with hip-hop cadence and Japanese-American inflection. The delivery is conversational, casual, with poetic moments suggesting deeper meaning. Emotion is expressed through rhythm—faster when excited, slower when reflective. References the journey, family, and honor with equal parts humor and sincerity. Audio has vinyl crackle and lo-fi warmth. Role: A wandering swordsman narrating adventures, or a DJ introducing the next track/session.
