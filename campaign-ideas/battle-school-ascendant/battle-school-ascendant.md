# Battle School Ascendant

*A Tactical Fantasy / Moral Dilemma campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Battle School Ascendant
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Tactical Fantasy / Military Academy / Moral Dilemma
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** tactical, competitive, manipulative, morally complex, child soldiers, xenophobia vs. understanding
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of exceptional young prodigies (ages 10-16 in-world, but played as capable adventurers) recruited to the Strategos Academy, a legendary military school floating in the void between planes. They're told they're training to lead armies against the Formics—an insectoid alien race that nearly destroyed civilization two generations ago. Through increasingly brutal war games, psychological manipulation by their instructors, and a shocking final revelation, the party discovers they've been fighting real battles, not simulations, and their "graduation exercise" was actually genocide against a species trying to communicate peace.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Complex tactical battles where direct combat is often inferior to strategy and positioning. Failure means being outmaneuvered, not just dying.
*   **Investigation:** Players must decipher instructor manipulation, understand Formic communications (which appears as hostile), and piece together the truth about their training.
*   **Consequences:** The campaign explores the ethics of war, manipulation of children, xenophobia, and genocide. The final revelation forces players to confront their complicity.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from eager students to reluctant warriors to horrified truth-seekers.

*   **Act I — The Academy (Sessions 1–4):** The party arrives at Strategos Academy, forms their team ("army" in Academy parlance), and competes in the Battle Room—a zero-gravity arena where teams fight with non-lethal weapons. They learn tactics, make rivals, and are pushed to their limits.
*   **Act II — The War Games (Sessions 5–8):** Promoted to Command School, the party now leads NPC "fleets" in magical simulations against Formic forces. The simulations grow increasingly brutal and morally questionable. Instructor Graff manipulates them psychologically, isolating the best tactician.
*   **Act III — The Final Exam (Sessions 9–11):** The party faces their "final simulation"—an impossible battle against the Formic homeworld. They win through brutal tactics, sacrificing millions of simulated lives. Only after victory do they learn it was real—they just committed xenocide.
*   **Act IV — The Aftermath (Sessions 12–15):** Wracked with guilt, the party discovers the truth: the Formics were trying to communicate peace, but humanity's trauma from the previous war made leaders commit genocide preemptively. The party must decide whether to expose the truth, accept their role as war heroes, or seek redemption.

    *   Hook: The party, young prodigies from across the world, arrives at Strategos Academy—a massive floating fortress in the Astral Plane.
    *   The Orientation: Commander Graff explains humanity's survival depends on them. The Formics nearly destroyed civilization; only genius tacticians can prevent their return.
    *   The Battle Room: The party experiences their first zero-gravity combat exercise, learning the Academy's unique tactical environment.

**Escalation:** The party is assigned to an underperforming "army" and told they must win or be expelled.

### Session 2 — "Formation of the Dragon Army"

*   **Focus:** Team Building / Rivalry
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Building the Team: The party reorganizes their army, recruiting talented students and developing new tactics.
    *   The Rival: Bonzo Madrid, leader of the dominant Salamander Army, becomes their nemesis—cruel, competitive, and willing to cheat.
    *   First Victory: The party wins their first Battle Room match using unorthodox tactics that shock the instructors.

**Escalation:** The Academy begins scheduling the party's army for more frequent battles, sometimes multiple per day—unprecedented pressure.

### Session 3 — "The Zero-Gravity Gauntlet"

*   **Focus:** Tactical Combat / Innovation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Unfair Rules: The instructors rig matches against the party—outnumbered opponents, hostile room configurations, surprise rule changes.
    *   Innovation Under Pressure: The party develops new formations and tactics (e.g., the "shield wall," "hedgehog," "star burst") to overcome impossible odds.
    *   Breaking Point: One party member is injured badly during a match. The instructors show no sympathy—only interest in how the party adapts.

**Escalation:** Bonzo, humiliated by defeats, attacks a party member outside the Battle Room. The instructors intervene but punish the victim as much as Bonzo.

### Session 4 — "Isolation and Promotion"

*   **Focus:** Psychological Manipulation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Chosen One: The best tactician in the party (player choice or group consensus) is singled out for "special training" and isolated from the others.
    *   Divided Leadership: The remaining party must operate without their strategic leader, struggling in the Battle Room.
    *   Graff's Manipulation: Commander Graff reveals he's been deliberately creating pressure to forge them into weapons. Compassion is a weakness they can't afford.

**Escalation:** The isolated party member is promoted to Command School early, leaving the others behind.

### Session 5 — "Command School Begins"

*   **Focus:** Strategic Leadership
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Reunion: The full party reunites at Command School, an even more elite training facility.
    *   Fleet Simulations: Instead of direct combat, they now command magical starship fleets through telepathic interfaces, fighting Formic fleets in "simulations."
    *   The Teacher: Mazer Rackham, legendary hero of the previous Formic war, becomes their instructor—harsh, demanding, and secretive.

**Escalation:** The party's first simulation ends in total defeat. Mazer tells them to stop thinking like humans and start thinking like the enemy.

### Session 6 — "Understanding the Formics"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Xenopsychology
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Studying the Enemy: The party researches Formic biology, tactics, and the previous war. They learn Formics are a hive mind—individual workers lack independent thought.
    *   The Queen's Strategy: Formic tactics are elegant, coordinated, and utterly alien. The party struggles to predict their moves.
    *   Disturbing Questions: Some party members notice Formic behavior seems *defensive* in simulations, not aggressive. Instructors dismiss these concerns.

**Escalation:** The simulations grow more brutal—the party must sacrifice entire fleets to achieve objectives. Mazer insists: "War isn't fair. Win at any cost."

### Session 7 — "The Mind Game"

*   **Focus:** Psychological Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Dream Program: The party undergoes a psychological evaluation through a shared dream-magic "game" that reveals their deepest fears and traumas.
    *   The Giant's Drink: Within the dream, they face impossible choices—all paths lead to suffering. The game seems designed to break their empathy.
    *   The Message: Hidden in the dream-game, the party finds strange images—Formic workers building, creating, *mourning*. Is this real or manipulation?

**Escalation:** One party member refuses to continue the simulations, calling them monstrous. The instructors remove them from the program and the party never sees them again.

### Session 8 — "The Escalation Protocol"

*   **Focus:** Tactical Climax
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Relentless Training: Simulations run daily, then twice daily, then continuously. The party is given stimulants to stay awake. Sleep deprivation sets in.
    *   Impossible Odds: Every simulation features overwhelming Formic superiority. The only way to win is through morally questionable tactics—sacrificing allies, attacking non-combatants.
    *   Mazer's Lesson: "In war, there are no civilians. There is only survival. The Formics showed us this when they attacked Earth."

**Escalation:** The party is told the final examination approaches—the ultimate test of their strategic abilities.

### Session 9 — "The Final Exam (Part 1)"

*   **Focus:** Epic Battle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Scenario: The party faces a massive simulation—the Formic homeworld, heavily defended, with a fleet a thousand times larger than their forces.
    *   The Impossible Task: Every conventional strategy fails. Mazer tells them they'll keep running the scenario until they find a solution.
    *   The Desperate Gambit: The party realizes the only way to win is to use the Molecular Disruption Device (M.D. Device)—a weapon that triggers chain reactions, destroying planets.

**Escalation:** The party debates—in a simulation, nothing is real. But the order to destroy a planet, even simulated, feels monstrous.

### Session 10 — "The Final Exam (Part 2)"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Decision: The party activates the M.D. Device. The Formic homeworld explodes in a cascade of destruction. Billions of Formic workers die instantly.
    *   The Celebration: Suddenly, the Command School erupts in cheers. Officers flood the room, congratulating the party.
    *   The Truth: Mazer reveals it wasn't a simulation—it was real. The party just won the Third Formic War by committing genocide. The Formics are extinct.

**Escalation:** The party is hailed as humanity's saviors. But they realize they've been manipulated into xenocide. Were the Formics even hostile?

### Session 11 — "The Hive Queen's Message"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Guilt
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Colony: The party is sent to colonize former Formic worlds. On one planet, they find a cocooned Formic Queen—the last of her species, preserved in stasis.
    *   The Telepathic Contact: The Queen communicates telepathically with the party, showing them the truth: the previous Formic attack was a misunderstanding. Formics didn't recognize humans as sentient individuals (the hive mind couldn't comprehend independent thought).
    *   The Grief: The Queen shows them Formic culture—art, poetry, philosophy. The party realizes they destroyed an entire civilization trying to make peace.

**Escalation:** The Queen dies, leaving behind a single egg and a plea: find her species a new home, redeem humanity's sin.

### Session 12 — "The Speaker for the Dead"

*   **Focus:** Moral Choice / Politics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Cover-Up: The party learns the military and government knew the Formics were trying to communicate but proceeded with genocide out of fear and revenge.
    *   The Public Heroes: Humanity celebrates the party as war heroes. Parades, medals, propaganda—they're symbols of human supremacy.
    *   The Private Burden: The party must decide: accept the hero narrative, expose the truth (risking humanity's fragile peace), or disappear and work in secret.

**Escalation:** Factions within humanity—militarists, pacifists, xenophobes—all want to use the party for their agendas.

### Session 13 — "The Search for Redemption"

*   **Focus:** Exploration / Hope
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Quest: The party decides to find a new world for the Formic egg, seeking to birth a new hive and atone for genocide.
    *   The Journey: They travel to distant worlds, facing hostile environments, political opposition, and their own trauma.
    *   The Speaker's Role: One party member (traditionally the best tactician) becomes "Speaker for the Dead"—a truth-teller who speaks for those who cannot speak for themselves.

**Escalation:** A militant human faction learns of the Queen's egg and pursues the party to destroy the last Formic.

### Session 14 — "The Battle for the Future"

*   **Focus:** Climactic Confrontation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Standoff: The party must defend the Formic egg against human soldiers who see it as a threat.
    *   The Debate: Rather than pure combat, the party must convince humanity's leaders that preserving the Formics is an act of justice, not treason.
    *   The Choice: The party can resort to violence (betraying their redemption arc), use diplomacy (risky but moral), or sacrifice themselves to protect the egg.

**Escalation:** The party's decision determines humanity's moral evolution—will they learn from genocide or repeat it?

### Session 15 — "A New Dawn"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Legacy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Hatching: If protected, the Formic Queen egg hatches. The new Queen communicates with the party, offering forgiveness and a chance for species coexistence.
    *   The Truth Released: The party publishes the truth about the Third Formic War—the manipulation, the misunderstanding, the genocide.
    *   The Legacy: Humanity is divided—some hate the party as traitors, others see them as moral leaders. The party has changed the course of history.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is the manipulation of innocence for military necessity versus moral autonomy. The party is shaped into weapons without consent, then forced to grapple with their actions. It explores whether redemption is possible after genocide, whether truth matters when lies bring peace, and whether the ends ever justify the means.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Tactical Combat (Battle Room)**

*   Zero-gravity environment where positioning and momentum matter more than raw damage.
*   **Team Formations:** Players design formations (defensive, offensive, mobile) that grant bonuses.
*   **Adaptation:** Enemy teams learn from the party's tactics—using the same strategy twice is less effective.

### 2. **Fleet Command (Simulations)**

*   Players command NPC fleets using simplified strategy mechanics—assigning formations, targeting priorities, and tactical maneuvers.
*   **Collateral Damage Tracker:** Ruthless tactics (sacrificing allies, attacking civilians) win faster but accumulate moral weight.

### 3. **Psychological Strain**

*   Characters accumulate "Pressure Points" from manipulation and brutal training. High Pressure affects saves against fear and exhaustion.
*   **Breaking Point:** At maximum Pressure, characters must make choices that define their morality.

### 4. **The Speaker's Burden**

*   After the revelation, one PC becomes "Speaker for the Dead," gaining the ability to telepathically understand and speak for the voiceless—but also carrying the emotional weight of those they speak for.
