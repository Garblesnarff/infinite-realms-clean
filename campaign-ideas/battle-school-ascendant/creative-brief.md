# Creative Brief: Battle School Ascendant

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Sterile Military Futurism with Alien Elegance (Ender's Game meets Arrival)

Inspired by the clinical, institutional aesthetic of military academies and the elegant, organic beauty of misunderstood alien civilizations, this style contrasts cold human pragmatism with warm Formic artistry. It aims to capture the psychological pressure of child soldiers, the tactical beauty of zero-gravity combat, and the tragedy of xenocide.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Institutional Sterility:** Human environments should feel controlled, efficient, and emotionally cold—all function, no warmth.
*   **Contrast Human and Formic:** Human design is angular, metallic, and militaristic. Formic design is organic, flowing, and artistic.
*   **Youth Under Pressure:** Characters are children or young teens carrying adult burdens—show this in their eyes and posture.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tactical, competitive, sterile, manipulative, morally complex, youthful brilliance, institutional pressure, alien beauty, tragic misunderstanding.
*   **Feeling:** The loneliness of being chosen. The weight of expectations. The horror of discovering your heroism was atrocity.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Human Tech:** Sharp, angular lines, geometric precision, military efficiency. Everything is standardized and functional.
*   **Formic Tech:** Organic curves, biomechanical elegance, natural patterns suggesting hive intelligence.
*   **Textures:** Brushed steel, seamless plastics, holographic displays for humans. Chitin, resin, bioluminescent structures for Formics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in clean, futuristic military style. The Battle Room is a perfect white sphere with geometric patterns on the walls. Young cadets in form-fitting uniforms float in zero gravity, holding sleek, non-lethal weapons."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Strategos Academy:** Sterile whites, cool grays, institutional blues, with harsh white lighting. Minimal color to emphasize discipline.
*   **Battle Room:** Pure white environments with colored team uniforms (Dragon Army in gray and orange, Salamander Army in red and black, etc.).
*   **Command School:** Dark blues and blacks with glowing holographic displays in cyan and amber.
*   **Formic Worlds:** Rich, organic colors—deep purples, warm ambers, bioluminescent blues and greens, suggesting natural beauty.
*   **The Queen's Chamber:** Soft, mournful colors—lavenders, pale golds, gentle greens—beautiful and tragic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a sterile color palette of institutional white and cool gray, with harsh overhead lighting casting minimal shadows. The young cadets wear gray jumpsuits with orange accents. The only warmth comes from a distant window showing stars."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Cadets:** Ages 10-16, but drawn with intelligence and determination in their eyes. Diverse ethnicities. Wearing standardized uniforms—form-fitting jumpsuits with academy insignia.
*   **Instructors:** Adult military officers in formal uniforms, stern expressions, often shown from low angles to emphasize authority.
*   **Formics (Workers):** Insectoid but elegant—six-limbed, with iridescent chitin, large compound eyes, moving in perfect synchronization.
*   **The Formic Queen:** Massive, graceful, with translucent wings and gentle features despite alien appearance. Her eyes convey deep intelligence and sorrow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young cadet, age 12-13, with sharp, intelligent eyes showing both brilliance and exhaustion. Short dark hair, lean build from zero-G training. Wearing a gray and orange jumpsuit with the Dragon Army patch. Floating in zero gravity, holding a sleek weapon, expression determined but weary."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Battle Room:** A perfect white sphere, 100 feet in diameter, with scattered geometric obstacles (cubes, boxes, gates) floating in zero gravity. Walls show subtle grid patterns.
*   **Academy Corridors:** Pristine white hallways with harsh lighting, minimal decoration, students walking in ordered groups.
*   **Command School:** Dark rooms dominated by massive holographic displays showing fleet battles, glowing with tactical data.
*   **Formic Hive Cities:** Organic architecture—flowing tunnels, cathedral-like chambers, structures that look grown rather than built, bioluminescent lighting.
*   **The Queen's Chamber:** A peaceful cocoon of resin and silk, decorated with Formic art—geometric patterns that tell stories, preserved memories.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the Battle Room from the entrance—a vast white sphere stretching into the distance. Geometric obstacles (white cubes and cylinders) float scattered throughout. Two teams of young cadets in different colored uniforms engage in zero-gravity combat, their trajectories creating elegant arcs through the space."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Academy:** Harsh, omnidirectional white lighting with minimal shadows, creating a sterile, clinical atmosphere.
*   **Battle Room:** Even brighter lighting that makes everything crystal clear—no place to hide, perfect visibility for tactical analysis.
*   **Command School:** Dim ambient lighting with bright holographic projections casting colored light on faces.
*   **Formic Worlds:** Soft, bioluminescent glows in organic colors, creating warm, gentle lighting despite the alien environment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh, omnidirectional white light with almost no shadows, creating a sterile, exposed feeling. Every detail of the cadets' exhausted faces is visible. The only color comes from team uniform accents and distant stars through windows."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use symmetry and geometric precision for human environments. Use organic, flowing compositions for Formic environments. Show characters dwarfed by institutional spaces.
*   **Techniques:** Low-angle shots of authority figures. Isolated individuals in vast spaces to show loneliness. Zero-gravity combat in dynamic, three-dimensional compositions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, three-dimensional composition showing zero-gravity combat in the Battle Room. Cadets float at various angles—some upside-down, others sideways—creating a disorienting but tactical arrangement. The camera angle is tilted, emphasizing the absence of up or down. White geometric obstacles frame the action."

## Voice

A young voice—early teens, bright and articulate but carrying a weariness beyond their years. Neutral accent (General American or Received Pronunciation) suggesting institutional education that erases regional identity. The pacing is measured and thoughtful, as if every word is tactical. The emotion shifts between determined confidence (during tactical moments) and quiet horror (during moral realizations). Audio quality is crisp and clear, like a military briefing recording. Role: A cadet addressing their journal, a tactical commander giving orders, or a Speaker for the Dead bearing witness to truth.
