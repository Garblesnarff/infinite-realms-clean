### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Road to Heaven's Gate**

**1. Core Concept**
*   A fallen cleric possesses the Word of Creation and embarks on a road trip to find the absent God and demand answers, battling angels, demons, and an unstoppable hunter while uncovering a cosmic conspiracy.

**2. Lore & History**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Word of Creation—divine power of absolute command, why God created it, why it's now loose.
    *   Explain why God abandoned Creation—hiding from responsibility, fear, or something worse.
    *   Describe Heaven's hierarchy—angels as bureaucrats more concerned with procedure than righteousness.
    *   Chronicle Hell's organization—demons actually more honest than angels about what they are.
    *   Detail the Grail—secret society protecting Christ's bloodline, controlling Christianity from shadows.

**3. Factions**
*   **Heaven** (Major): Bureaucratic angels wanting the Word returned.
*   **Hell** (Major): Demons who see opportunity in God's absence.
*   **The Grail** (Major): Secret society wanting to control the Word.
*   **The Saint of Killers** (Unique): Unstoppable hunter sent to retrieve the Word.

**4. NPCs**
*   **Tier 1:** Jesse, Tulip, Cassidy, Saint of Killers, Starr, God, various archangels and demon lords.

**5. Locations**
*   **Texas Frontier:** Dusty towns hiding supernatural secrets.
*   **Heaven:** Sterile, bureaucratic nightmare.
*   **Hell:** Organized underworld with clear rules.
*   **God's Hideout:** Pathetic bar at edge of Creation.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party uses the Word selfishly.
*   **THEN:** Power corrupts; allies abandon them; Saint gets closer.
*   **IF:** Party makes deal with Hell.
*   **THEN:** Effective but at cost of soul debt.
*   **IF:** Party confronts God.
*   **THEN:** Multiple endings based on choice—destroy, redeem, or replace God.
