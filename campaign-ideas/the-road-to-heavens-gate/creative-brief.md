# Creative Brief: The Road to Heaven's Gate

## Art Style: Texas Gothic Meets Religious Horror

Dark fantasy American frontier with religious imagery twisted into horror. Think wide Texas vistas, dusty roads, dive bars, alongside angels with too many eyes and demons in business suits.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:** Dusty browns, blood reds, holy golds turned tarnish, deep shadows.

**Character Design:**
- Jesse: Worn preacher attire, hard eyes.
- Saint of Killers: Cowboy silhouette, guns that glow with unholy light.
- Angels: Beautiful and terrifying, wrong proportions, too many wings.

**Environments:** Texas landscapes, dive bars, Heaven as sterile office building, Hell as surprisingly organized.

## Voice

**Jesse:** Texas drawl, world-weary but passionate.
**Saint:** Silent—his guns do the talking.
**God:** Surprisingly weak and pathetic voice when finally encountered.

## Music

*   Americana, blues, gospel twisted dark.
*   Twangy guitar for road trip sections.
*   Ominous organ for religious horror.
*   Silence when the Saint appears.
