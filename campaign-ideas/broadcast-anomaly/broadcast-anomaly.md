# Broadcast Anomaly
**"You are on the fastest available route. Rejoice."**

## Campaign Overview

In 1987, a local TV station called WVNL-58 went off the air permanently after broadcasting increasingly disturbing content. Thirty-five years later, the party—whether paranormal investigators, journalists, or curious explorers—discovers that Channel 58 has resumed broadcasting. But the signal carries something wrong. The weatherman speaks in coded warnings. Educational programming teaches forbidden knowledge. Emergency alerts announce events that haven't happened yet—or describe a world slightly different from our own.

As the party investigates, they uncover a conspiracy spanning decades. WVNL was never just a TV station—it was a front for a government program studying "tuned" reality: the ability to alter consensus through broadcast media. The experiments went catastrophically wrong, creating a sentient signal entity that exists in the electromagnetic spectrum. Now it's broadcasting again, and reality itself is starting to change. Street names shift. Historical facts alter. People who never existed appear in family photos.

The deeper the party investigates, the more they question what's real. Did the moon landing actually happen? Is the president who they remember? Was there always a 33rd state? The signal is rewriting reality one broadcast at a time, and the party must stop it before the changes become permanent. But to fight an entity that exists in every television, radio, and screen requires entering the Broadcast Dimension—a realm of pure signal where human consciousness becomes vulnerable to editing.

## Core Themes

- **Media as Reality Control**: Broadcasts shaping collective consciousness
- **Nostalgia Horror**: Corrupted wholesome 1950s-80s aesthetics
- **Institutional Conspiracy**: Government experiments gone wrong
- **Unreliable Reality**: Cannot trust memories or senses
- **Analog Technology as Mysticism**: VHS tapes and CRT screens as magical tools
- **The Signal Never Dies**: Digital horror meets analog decay
