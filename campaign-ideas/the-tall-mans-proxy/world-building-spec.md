# The Tall Man's Proxy: World-Building Specification

## The Slender Man: Entity Analysis

### Nature and Origin
**Tulpa Theory**: Created by collective human fear and internet proliferation
**First Manifestation**: Unknown, but documented encounters date to 16th century German woodcuts
**Modern Form**: Solidified by Something Awful forums (2009) and Marble Hornets series
**Current Status**: Self-sustaining thoughtform, no longer requires active belief

### Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 8-15 feet (varies based on observer)
- **Build**: Impossibly thin, elongated limbs
- **Face**: Blank, pale, featureless (or many faces seen peripherally)
- **Clothing**: Black suit, anachronistic
- **Tentacles/Appendages**: Sometimes manifests additional limbs from back
- **Can't Be Directly Observed**: Disappears when looked at, only visible peripherally or in recordings

### Abilities
- **Proxification**: Mental domination, gradual conversion to servitude
- **Teleportation**: Appears/disappears at will
- **Memory Manipulation**: Erases or alters memories of encounters
- **Static Field**: Disrupts electronics, creates visual/audio distortion
- **Dimensional Access**: Can access "Operator's Forest" pocket dimension
- **Memetic Presence**: Thinking about him makes you vulnerable
- **Compulsion**: Forces actions on exposed individuals

### Weaknesses (Theoretical)
- **Narrative Dependence**: As tulpa, vulnerable to redefinition
- **Operator Symbols**: Provide temporary protection
- **Forgetting**: Complete amnesia starves him of power
- **Contradictory Information**: Confuses entity's self-definition
- **White Noise**: Disrupts static field
- **Collective Disbelief**: Mockery and comedy weaken manifestation

## Proxies: Psychology and Conversion

### Conversion Stages
**Stage 1: Marked (Exposure Points 1-10)**
- The Tall Man has noticed the individual
- Symptoms: Headaches, deja vu, brief memory gaps
- Behavioral: Mild paranoia, drawing Operator symbols unconsciously
- Reversible: Yes, with complete avoidance

**Stage 2: Haunted (Exposure Points 11-25)**
- Active stalking by Tall Man
- Symptoms: Nosebleeds, coughing, nightmares
- Behavioral: Compulsive behavior, hearing whispers
- Reversible: Difficult, requires ritual intervention

**Stage 3: Breaking (Exposure Points 26-40)**
- Will begins to erode
- Symptoms: Hallucinations, lost time (hours/days), physical weakness
- Behavioral: Following commands from "the Operator," violent outbursts
- Reversible: Very rare, requires powerful intervention

**Stage 4: Proxified (Exposure Points 41+)**
- Complete subjugation to Tall Man
- Symptoms: Permanent memory damage, physical changes (pale, twitching)
- Behavioral: Total obedience to Tall Man, hunting new victims
- Reversible: Unknown, no confirmed cases

### Proxy Categories
**Sleepers**: Don't know they're Proxied, activated by triggers
**Runners**: Trying to resist, oscillating between control and servitude
**Masks**: Fully Proxied, wear masks to "hide from Operator" (actually symbol of submission)
**Alphas**: Lead Proxy groups, retain more personality but fully loyal

### Famous Proxies (Can Be Adapted)
- **Masky (Timothy Wright)**: White mask, aggressive, partially resistant
- **Hoody (Brian Thomas)**: Silent, hooded, ambiguous loyalty
- **The Rake**: Feral Proxy, bestial behavior
- **Totheark**: Hacker Proxy, spreads memetic hazards online

## The Collective: Resistance Organization

### Structure
**Leadership Council**: 5 members, locations unknown to each other
**Regional Cells**: 20+ across North America, Europe
**Communication**: Encrypted, dead drops, face-to-face only
**Funding**: Donations from saved individuals, some wealthy benefactors who lost family

### Methodology
**Operator Symbol Network**: Marked safe houses and routes
**White Noise Defense**: Generators disrupt Tall Man's static field
**Memory Preservation**: Extensive documentation, redundant backups
**Extraction Teams**: Rescue marked individuals before Proxification
**Information Warfare**: Suppress Tall Man info online (ironic given his origin)

### The Ark Compound
- **Location**: Rural Montana, underground bunker complex
- **Capacity**: 50 individuals
- **Defenses**: No windows, white noise, Operator symbols, 24/7 monitoring
- **Life**: Regimented, isolated, safe but psychologically damaging
- **Cost**: Residents can never leave (exposure risk)

### Key Collective Members
**Overseer (Jacob Mercer)**: Lost wife and daughter, founded Collective
**Dr. Sarah Chen**: Psychologist specializing in deprogramming Proxies
**Marcus Webb**: Hacker, monitors internet for Tall Man spread
**Father Dominguez**: Priest who performs "Forgetting Rituals"
**The Remnant**: Former Proxy who broke free, now helps others

## Ashgrove Crossing: Town Deep-Dive

### History
- **Founded**: 1887 as logging town
- **First Disappearance**: 1889, child named Samuel Graves
- **The Compact**: 1890, town elders made deal with Tall Man
- **Modern Day**: Population 3,000, economically depressed

### The Compact (Secret)
Elder Thornton Ashgrove performed ritual in 1890:
- Sacrifice children periodically to Tall Man
- In exchange, he stays in forest, doesn't spread
- Knowledge passed to each generation's leaders
- Current keepers: Sheriff Torres, Principal Hayes, Mayor Blackwood

### Town Factions
**The Keepers**: Know about Compact, enforce it (population ~12)
**The Ignorant**: Normal townspeople, unaware (population ~2,980)
**The Marked**: Individuals selected for sacrifice, don't know yet (population ~8)
**The Escaped**: Former Marked who fled, never return (unknown number)

### Key Locations
**Sheriff's Office**: Contains classified files on disappearances dating to 1889
**Elementary School**: Where children are selected via Principal Hayes
**Abandoned Mill**: Proxy nest, hidden entrance to Operator's Forest
**Rosswood Forest**: 50 square miles, Tall Man's territory
**Old Ashgrove Cemetery**: Graves of sacrificed children, Operator symbols on headstones

## The Operator's Forest: Pocket Dimension

### Nature
- **Type**: Dimensional pocket, accessible from Rosswood at specific times
- **Geography**: Impossible—paths loop, distances variable, trees move
- **Time**: Flows differently, hours outside can be minutes inside or vice versa
- **Population**: The Taken (absorbed victims), Proxies, manifestations

### Regions
**The Edge**: Still resembles normal forest, closest to reality
**The Deep Woods**: Physics breaking down, trees breathe, whispers everywhere
**The Nest**: Central area, Tall Man's "home" (if such concept applies)
**The Graveyard of Memory**: Where absorbed victims exist as echoes

### The Taken
- Victims fully absorbed by Tall Man
- Appear as ghostly figures repeating final moments
- Not hostile, but terrifying
- Can sometimes communicate warnings
- Permanent: Cannot be saved, only laid to rest

### Escape Methods
1. **The White Path**: Following Operator symbols backwards
2. **Sunrise**: Forest sometimes ejects occupants at dawn
3. **Blood Anchor**: Having someone in real world perform ritual
4. **Death**: Dying in forest may return soul to body (risky)
5. **Becoming**: Accepting Proxification (not really escape)

## Slender Man Mythology: Cross-Cultural

### Historical Analogues
- **Der Großmann** (Germany, 16th c.): Tall figure in woods taking children
- **Fear Dubh** (Scotland): "The Black Man" of forests
- **The Pied Piper**: Possible Tall Man manifestation
- **The Stilt-Walker** (Romania): Elongated figure in folk tales

### Modern Manifestations
**Marble Hornets** (Alabama): Film student investigation, archetypal documentation
**EverymanHYBRID**: Fitness channel becomes Proxy documentation
**TribeTwelve**: Administrator investigation of cousin's death
**DarkHarvest00**: Similar pattern, different region

### Global Spread
- **2009**: Something Awful forums, Slender Man created
- **2010**: Marble Hornets popularizes, tulpa solidifies
- **2012**: Global reports begin, entity becomes "real"
- **2014**: Waukesha stabbing incident increases belief/fear
- **2020s**: Established entity, hundreds of active Proxy groups

## The Operator Symbol

### Design
Circle with X through it, additional marks vary

### Functions
- **Protection**: Creates ward against Tall Man (temporary)
- **Navigation**: Marks paths in Operator's Forest
- **Communication**: Proxies use as calling card
- **Memetic Hazard**: Drawing it increases exposure
- **Power Source**: Can be used in rituals

### Variations
Different branches of Proxies use different variants:
- **Classic**: Simple circle-X
- **Adorned**: Additional runes, Proxy signatures
- **Corrupted**: Drawn wrong, attracts instead of repels
- **Layered**: Multiple symbols, more powerful but dangerous

## Combating the Tall Man: Methods and Theories

### Dr. Kast's Research
**Hypothesis**: As tulpa, Tall Man can be weakened by redefining narrative
**Method 1**: Spread counter-narrative (comedy, weakness, defeat)
**Method 2**: Create contradictory tulpas forcing paradox
**Method 3**: Weaponize memetic hazards back at source

### Collective's Methods
**Defense**: Operator symbols, white noise, mutual surveillance
**Offense**: Extracting victims before conversion, destroying Proxy nests
**Long-term**: Containing spread of information, reducing belief

### The Forgetting Ritual
- Performed by Father Dominguez
- Requires: Sanctified water, Operator symbols, subject's consent
- Effect: Erases all memory of Tall Man
- Cost: Also erases surrounding memories, potential identity damage
- Success Rate: 70%
- Risk: If incomplete, accelerates Proxification

### Untested Theories
**The Burning**: Destroying all information might kill tulpa
**The Rewrite**: Global synchronized meditation redefining entity
**The Confrontation**: Direct challenge in Operator's Forest
**The Sacrifice**: One person taking all Proxification to draw him out
**The Awakening**: Accepting him makes you immune (dubious)

## Campaign Secrets (DM Only)

### The Truth About the Tall Man
He is exactly what people believe him to be—which means he's multiple things simultaneously. Every theory is partially correct:
- Tulpa created by internet (yes)
- Ancient entity using modern form (yes)
- Dimensional predator (yes)
- Collective manifestation of child abduction fears (yes)
- Meaningless force of nature (yes)

This paradox is his strength and weakness.

### Emma's Secret
She's not victim—she's the next step in his evolution. A child born partially in both worlds, hybrid of human and Operator's Forest. She doesn't know. Neither does he, yet.

### The Collective's Dark Secret
They've kept some Proxies alive in the Ark—studying them, learning to weaponize Proxification. Overseer wants to create controlled Proxies to fight Tall Man with his own methods.

### Ashgrove's Deeper Secret
The Compact is a lie. Tall Man doesn't honor deals. He's been slowly expanding despite sacrifices. The town's leaders know but maintain the lie to preserve order and their power.

### What Victory Really Means
**Information Campaign**: Weakens this manifestation but others will rise
**Memetic Weapon**: Success creates new horror potentially worse
**Forgetting**: Works but makes humanity vulnerable to next entity
**Acceptance**: He wins, but is that bad for Proxies who find peace?

The campaign questions whether some horrors must be endured because the cure is worse than the disease.
