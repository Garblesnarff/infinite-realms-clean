# The Oneironauts' Network - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Neural network visualization meets Tron meets collaborative art installation. Dreams appear as interconnected nodes, thoughts as flowing data streams, consciousness as living light.

**Color Palettes:**
- **Chaos Gardens:** Rainbow spectrum, clashing colors, impossible hues
- **Consensus Zones:** Monochromatic grey-silver, clinical sterility
- **Nexus Commons:** Dynamic—shifts based on collective mood
- **Core Node:** Pure white light fracturing into all colors
- **Personal Dreams:** Unique to each character

## Art Direction
- Oneironauts: Translucent figures showing swirling thoughts inside
- Null Dreamer: Perfect silver symmetry, unsettling beauty
- Guardian: Appears different to each viewer simultaneously
- Consensus Choir: Identical beings moving in perfect sync
- Shared spaces: Multiple art styles blending/clashing

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Overlapping melodies representing multiple minds
**Consensus Theme:** Single perfect note, no variation, beautiful but lifeless
**Chaos Theme:** Jazz improvisation, controlled chaos
**Network Theme:** Electronic pulses, data streams as rhythm
**Voice Direction:**
- Null Dreamer: Perfect harmony, multilayered voices
- Guardian: Familiar voice but can't place it
- Consensus Choir: One voice from many throats
- Prism: Multiple personalities, shifting tones

## Cinematic Moments
- First shared dream: Multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Consensus conversion: Individual melting into collective
- Network navigation: Traveling through neural pathways
- Final confrontation: Thought-battle in abstract space
