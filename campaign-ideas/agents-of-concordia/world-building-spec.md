## The Torsion Device

**Function**: Magical WMD causing reality disruption. Could devastate entire regions. Mutually assured destruction equivalent.

**Significance**: Whoever controls it controls balance of power. Both nations want it. HYDRA uses it as leverage.

**Resolution**: Must be destroyed or both sides get partial access (maintaining balance).

## Partnership Evolution

**Phase 1**: Enemies forced to cooperate, constant bickering, professional respect.
**Phase 2**: Developing teamwork, still distrustful but effective.
**Phase 3**: Genuine friendship forming, choosing partner over orders.
**Phase 4**: Deep bond, romantic possibility, true partnership.
**Phase 5**: Choose each other permanently, nations be damned.

## The Future

**Post-Campaign**: UNCLE becomes official with agents from both sides. Cold War détente begins. Players prove cooperation possible. Maybe even end Cold War through example.

**Romance**: Solo/Kuryakin relationship (player choice) or Solo-Gaby & Kuryakin-friendship. Found family of spies.

This supports buddy-cop spy campaign about enemies becoming partners, found family, and proving cooperation stronger than division.
