# Daemon Revolution - World-Building Specification

## Daemon Mechanics Detailed

**What Daemons Are**: External soul. Manifestation of inner self as animal companion. Telepathically linked. Physically connected until Intercision.

**Children vs. Adults**:
- **Children**: Daemon changes form based on emotions/needs. Settling (puberty) fixes form permanently
- **Adults**: Single fixed form reflecting personality. Change impossible naturally
- **Settling**: Traumatic coming-of-age moment. What you are becomes what you'll always be

**Daemon Forms Meaning**:
- **Predators**: Aggressive personalities (Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey)
- **Birds**: Freedom-loving, intellectual (witches' daemons)
- **Dogs**: Loyal servants (many working-class daemons)
- **Cats**: Independent spirits
- **Form Reflects Society**: Poor often have practical daemons, rich have exotic

**Physical Connection**:
- **Range**: Few yards normally. Pain increases with distance
- **Death**: Daemon dies, person dies. Person dies, daemon dies
- **Separation**: Witches can separate through training. Spectres force separation

**Social Taboo**: Touching another's daemon is intimate violation. Social rules around daemon interaction as strict as physical contact.

## The Magisterium

**Structure**: Authoritarian church controlling Lyra's world. Equivalent to Vatican but with state power.

**Branches**:
- **Consistorial Court of Discipline**: Secret police, inquisition
- **General Oblation Board**: "Gobblers" kidnapping children for experiments
- **College of Bishops**: Theological authority
- **Magisterial Guard**: Military arm

**Ideology**: Dust is Original Sin made physical. Collects on adults, especially those who question. Children pure until adolescence. Solution: Intercision before Dust attraction.

**Control Methods**: Censorship, surveillance, torture, execution, child experiments. Totalitarian religious state.

**Truth**: Authority isn't God. First angel who lied. Magisterium maintains lie to preserve power.

## Dust Physics

**Scientific Properties**:
- Conscious particles
- Attracted to consciousness
- Visible in photographic emulsions
- Interacts with electromagnetic fields
- Forms patterns around aware beings
- Children gather little, adults much more

**What It Actually Is**: Physical manifestation of consciousness, wisdom, experience. Not sin but awareness. Adult knowledge frightens authority.

**Measurement**: Mary Malone's work in Will's world. Uses computers to communicate with Dust. Proves it's intelligent.

**Uses**:
- Powers alethiometer
- Facilitates world-walking
- Enables communication across universes
- Could revolutionize understanding of consciousness

**Magisterium's Fear**: Self-aware humans question dogma. Dust = free will = threat to control.

## Parallel Worlds

**Lyra's World**: Daemons exist. Magisterium rules. Technology lower (no computers but zeppelins).

**Will's World**: Our Earth. No visible daemons (internal). Modern technology. Rational but soulless.

**Cittàgazze**: Mediterranean world. Spectres consume adult daemons. Children rule anarchically. Subtle knife's origin.

**World of the Dead**: Underworld. Trapped souls. Harpies as jailers. Possible to free or reform.

**Others**: Infinite possibilities. Limited by DM creativity and campaign balance.

**Windows**: Subtle knife cuts between worlds. Invisible from most angles. Lets Spectres through. Each cut damages reality.

## Armored Bears

**Species**: Intelligent polar bears (Panserbjørne). Wear crafted armor. Warrior culture.

**Honor Code**:
- Never lie (incapable)
- Armor is soul (daemon equivalent)
- Combat determines truth
- Kingship through strength
- Simplicity in logic

**Iorek Byrnison**: Exiled for killing bear (who cheated). Stripped of armor. Worked as human mercenary. Reclaims throne by defeating Iofur Raknison.

**Corruption Story**: Iofur wanted daemon (imitating humans). Mrs. Coulter promised him one if he took throne. Shows human concepts corrupting bear simplicity.

## Witches

**Nature**: Female only. Live centuries. Separated from daemons through training (can fly while daemon stays grounded).

**Abilities**:
- Cloud-pine branch flight
- Weather magic
- Healing
- Archery
- Seeing Dust
- Understanding prophecy

**Culture**: Clan-based. Queens lead. Separate from human politics but intervening in Dust crisis.

**Serafina Pekkala**: Loves Farder Coram (human). Outlived him in youth. Tragic romance driving alliance with Gyptians.

## Gyptians

**Identity**: Nomadic boat people. Our world's Roma/Traveler analog. Distinct culture within Magisterium's world.

**Society**: Family-based. Elected leaders (John Faa). Strong internal justice system.

**Role**: Outside mainstream society. First to notice missing children. Organize rescue. Working-class heroes.

**Relationship with Party**: Natural allies. Provide boats, information, muscle.

## The Alethiometer

**Construction**: Brass compass with 36 symbols. Three needles (question hands). One needle (answer hand).

**Reading**: Concentrate on symbols forming question. Watch answer needle. Interpret meaning from symbol combinations.

**Symbols Include**: Anchor (hope), Camel (Asia), Hourglass (time), Madonna (mother), Alpha/Omega (beginning/end), etc. Each has multiple meanings.

**Child vs. Adult**: Children read intuitively (Lyra). Adults must study for years. Losing innocence loses easy reading.

**Dust-Powered**: Conscious particles move needle. Answering based on universal awareness.

## Intercision Process

**Official Name**: "Intercision" or "The Maystadt Process"

**Procedure**:
1. Child anesthetized
2. Daemon separated forcibly
3. Energy beam (Dust-based) severs connection
4. Child wakes without daemon
5. Daemon caged separately

**Results**:
- **Physical**: Child survives, appears normal
- **Psychological**: Hollow, compliant, no curiosity
- **Spiritual**: Soul damaged irreparably
- **Daemon**: Separate consciousness, broken
- **Permanent**: No known cure

**Magisterium Justification**: Prevents Dust attraction. Keeps children pure. Eliminates questioning.

**Reality**: Creates obedient servants. Totalitarian dream—population incapable of dissent.

## Spectres

**Nature**: Beings from void between worlds. Consume consciousness (daemons in Lyra's world).

**Attack**: Touch daemon. Daemon dissolves. Person becomes hollow shell. Worse than Intercision—no survival.

**Origin**: Created by subtle knife cuts. Each window lets more through.

**Vulnerability**: Only attack adults (consciousness). Children safe.

**Solution**: Stop cutting between worlds or find way to close all windows permanently.

## The Authority & Metatron

**The Authority**: First angel. Claimed to create universe. Actually created by earlier forces. Decrepit, senile, kept alive by Metatron.

**Metatron**: Powerful angel. Regent. Actually runs Kingdom of Heaven. Enforces dogma. Became corrupted by power.

**Heaven**: Not paradise but bureaucratic tyranny. Angels enforcing meaningless rules. Order without joy.

**Defeat Possibility**: Mortal intervention could overthrow. Angels vulnerable to determination and subtle knife.

## Philosophical Questions

**Free Will vs. Control**: Dust enables choice. Magisterium wants compliance.

**Truth vs. Comfort**: Reality is harsh. Lies easier to accept.

**Mortality vs. Immortality**: Death gives meaning. Eternal life breeds stagnation (Authority's problem).

**Republic of Heaven vs. Kingdom**: Build paradise on Earth through work vs. promised afterlife through obedience.

## Campaign Integration

**Character Daemon Design**: Player chooses animal reflecting personality. Form affects roleplay and NPC reactions.

**Settling Moment**: If party includes children, daemon settling is major character development. What animal they become permanently.

**Intercision Threat**: Horror element. Worse than death. Stakes for protecting children.

**World-Walking Adventures**: Each universe offers different challenges and opportunities.

**Moral Complexity**: No clear villains. Mrs. Coulter believes she's helping. Asriel willing to sacrifice anyone. Authority senile more than evil.

## Endings Detailed

**Republic of Heaven**: Overthrow Authority. Build paradise through human effort. No external salvation—only what we create.

**Scientific Triumph**: Prove Dust's nature. Remove religious stigma. Integrate consciousness into physics.

**Bittersweet Victory**: Win but costs enormous. Allies dead. Worlds damaged. Truth known but painful.

**Tragic Defeat**: Magisterium wins. Dust suppressed. Free will eliminated. Humanity docile.

**Personal Victory**: Save specific children/allies even if larger war lost. Small mercies in darkness.
