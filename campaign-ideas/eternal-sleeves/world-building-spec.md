# Eternal Sleeves - World-Building Specification

## Timeline
- 22nd Century: Stack technology invented
- 23rd Century: Immortality becomes commercial
- 24th Century: Quellcrist Falconer's Revolution crushed
- 25th Century: CAMPAIGN PRESENT—250 years after revolution

## Society Structure

### Meths (Methuselahs)
- Lived 200-500 years
- Control 99% of wealth
- Own multiple bodies (clones and sleeves)
- Psychologically alien from living so long
- Many have lost empathy entirely

### Grounders
- Everyone else, mortality between sleeves
- Poor take random sleeves when available
- Middle class save for specific sleeves
- Death still real—if stack destroyed or can't afford re-sleeving

### AIs
- Sentient but legally property
- Some hiding true intelligence to survive
- Sympathize with revolution (they understand immortality's burden)

## Technology
- **Stacks**: Cortical stack, spine implant recording consciousness
- **Sleeves**: Bodies, biological or synthetic
- **DHF**: Digital Human Freight—consciousness as data
- **Needlecast**: Transmitting consciousness across light-years instantly
- **VR Prisons**: Virtual reality where time can be accelerated

## Worlds
- **Earth**: Overpopulated, heavily stratified, party's main location
- **Harlan's World**: Falconer's home, now memorial/warning
- **Orbital Stations**: Meth playgrounds, anything goes

## The Envoy Corps
Elite soldiers trained by Falconer with unique abilities:
- Intuitive pattern recognition (notice clues others miss)
- Rapid sleeve adjustment (no disorientation from body changes)
- Resistance to psychic manipulation and VR control
- Combat training effective in any body type

## Philosophical Framework
Campaign explores: If consciousness is data, where is "you"? Does immortality cheapen life? Can humanity survive unlimited lifespans? At what age does psychology break from experiencing too much? Is death enemy or friend?

## Crime in Immortal Society
- Stack theft (stealing consciousness)
- Sleeve trafficking (kidnapping for bodies)
- Virtual torture (profitable entertainment for psychopaths)
- Memory editing (erasing crimes)
- Illegal backups (resurrection without consent)

## The Real Conspiracy
The Eternals aren't just evil—they're terrified. Living centuries, watching friends die or go mad, fearing their own stack destruction. Project Ouroboros attempts to merge consciousnesses, eliminate individual vulnerability. From their perspective, it's survival. From everyone else's, it's horror.

## Endgame Scenarios
1. **Destroy Stacks**: Billions die within decades, society collapses, humanity returns to mortality
2. **Reform System**: Democratize access, regulate Meths, uncertain success
3. **Stack Virus**: Genocide of ancient humans, questionable ethics
4. **Status Quo**: Evil continues, party complicit or defeated

Each choice has genuine arguments and terrible costs. No clean solution exists.
