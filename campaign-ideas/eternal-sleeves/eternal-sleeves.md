# Eternal Sleeves
**"Death is no longer the end. But is eternity worth living?"**

## Campaign Overview

In the 25th century, death has been solved. Every human consciousness is backed up in a "stack"—a device implanted at birth that records the entirety of their being. When the body (called a "sleeve") dies, the stack can be inserted into a new body, granting effective immortality. The ultra-wealthy can afford custom-grown clones, maintaining eternal youth and beauty. The poor must take whatever sleeve is available—wrong gender, wrong age, wrong species sometimes.

The party are Envoys—elite soldiers trained by rebel leader Quellcrist Falconer before her revolution was crushed 250 years ago. Recently re-sleeved after centuries in storage, they awakening to a world that has moved on without them. Hired by the immortal Laurens Bancroft to solve his own murder (he was killed but his stack backed up just before), the investigation spirals into conspiracy involving AI hotels, virtual torture, illegal consciousness trafficking, and the fundamental question: Should immortality exist at all?

As the party investigates murders of the unkillable, they must confront what 250 years of life has done to human psychology, morality, and society. Some Meths (Methuselahs—the ancient wealthy) have lived so long they've become alien to human concerns. Death has lost meaning, and with it, the value of life itself. The party must decide: Preserve immortality for all, destroy it entirely, or find middle path where death returns meaning to existence.

## Core Themes

- **Digital Immortality**: Is uploaded consciousness truly "you"?
- **Body as Property**: Disposable bodies ("sleeves"), consciousness as commodity
- **Class Warfare**: Immortal rich vs. temporarily alive poor
- **Identity Fluidity**: Consciousness in different bodies—who are you really?
- **Value of Death**: Does mortality give life meaning?
- **Psychological Damage**: Living centuries, losing empathy, becoming monster

## Session Breakdown (30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Immortal's Murder (Sessions 1-8)
**Sessions 1-3**: Re-sleeving and adjustment. Party awakens 250 years after death. World is alien—everyone they knew is dead or changed beyond recognition. Hired by Bancroft to solve his "murder"—backup was corrupted, 48 hours missing. Investigation begins.

**Sessions 4-6**: Discovery of virtual torture facilities (V.R. prisons where centuries pass in hours). Bancroft connected to illegal consciousness trafficking. His "murder" was suicide to cover evidence. But who corrupted his backup?

**Sessions 7-8**: Conspiracy deeper—multiple Meths involved in "entertainment" using the poor's stacks. Virtual immortality allows ultimate evil without consequence. First major confrontation with Meth enforcers.

### Arc 2: The Ghost of Falconer (Sessions 9-16)
**Sessions 9-11**: Evidence suggests Quellcrist Falconer isn't dead—her consciousness hidden in secret locations. Her revolution failed but ideas persisted. Party must decide: Find her or let past stay dead?

**Sessions 12-14**: Following Falconer's trail leads to AI entities. The Hendrix (AI hotel) and other AIs secretly preserving her consciousness, creating clone backups. AIs believe in her vision—ending immortality monopoly, returning death to world.

**Sessions 15-16**: Locating Falconer's primary backup. She's fragmented—dozens of copies with diverging personalities. Which version is "real"? Must piece together her consciousness from fragments. Discovery: She planned this—distributed consciousness across systems to survive.

### Arc 3: The Meth Conspiracy (Sessions 17-23)
**Sessions 17-19**: Meth cabal called "The Eternals" controlling society from shadows. They've lived so long they see regular humans as insects. Running experiments on consciousness—trying to achieve true immortality beyond stacks (which can still be destroyed).

**Sessions 20-21**: Infiltration of Meth compound on orbital station. High-society party/infiltration mission. Combat impossible—Meths have infinite backups. Must find evidence of crimes instead. Discovery: Project Ouroboros—attempting to merge consciousnesses into collective immortal entity.

**Sessions 22-23**: Twist—Bancroft is part of The Eternals. His "murder" investigation was test of party's abilities. He's been alive 350 years, lost all humanity, wants to recruit party or destroy them.

### Arc 4: The Sleeve Wars (Sessions 24-29)
**Sessions 24-26**: Uprising of the re-sleeved. Poor population discovering Meth crimes, revolts across worlds. Party caught between preserving order and supporting justified revolution. Stack trafficking exposed—millions enslaved in virtual prisons.

**Sessions 27-28**: AI alliance offers solution: Stack virus that will permanently kill Meths by corrupting backups. Would level playing field but constitute genocide of ancient humans. Moral crisis—mass murder justified to end tyranny?

**Session 29**: Falconer fully restored, leads revolution. But she's changed—centuries of fragmentation made her more extreme. Plans to destroy ALL stack technology, return death to humanity. Would cause death of millions dependent on stack-based life support.

### Arc 5: The Last Death (Session 30)
Final confrontation with three factions:
1. **The Eternals**: Want to preserve immortality, willing to enslave millions
2. **Falconer's Rebellion**: Want to destroy stacks, return mortality, accept mass casualties
3. **AI Coalition**: Want stack virus to kill Meths specifically, create new balance

Party must choose faction or forge fourth path:
- **Destroy Stacks**: Death returns, Meths die, civilization regresses but humanity restored
- **Preserve Status Quo**: Meths remain in power, injustice continues, stability maintained
- **Stack Virus**: Kill ancient Meths, preserve technology for everyone else, playing god
- **Reform**: Expose crimes, legal consequences, preserve stacks but regulate access, uncertain future

Epilogue shows world 50 years later based on choices—utopia, dystopia, or somewhere between.

## Key NPCs

**Laurens Bancroft** (Meth, Male, 358 years old): Party's employer, secretly antagonist. Lived so long he sees others as things, not people.

**Quellcrist Falconer** (Fragmented, Female, 252 years post-death): Revolutionary leader, mentor to party. Distributed consciousness makes her unstable, more extreme than original.

**Kristin Ortega** (Human, Female, 42): Police detective, romantic interest option. Ground party in humanity. Lost family to Meth crimes, wants justice.

**Poe** (AI, Male Presentation): Sentient AI hotel. Provides sanctuary and support. Interested in human condition, developing his own consciousness.

**Miriam Bancroft** (Meth, Female, 311 years old): Laurens's wife. Trapped in marriage for centuries. Secret ally who provides crucial intel. Wants freedom but terrified of mortality.

**Vernon Elliot** (Human, Male, 49): Former Marine, lost daughter to stack trafficking. Represents common person, grounds philosophical debates in human cost.

### Antagonists

**The Eternals Cabal**: Ancient Meths who've lived 300-500 years. Lost empathy, see others as property. Running consciousness experiments to transcend even stacks.

**Protectorate Forces**: Military/police serving Meth interests. Some are ideological believers, others just following orders.

**Carnage** (Optional Enemy): Psychopath who's died/resleeved hundreds of times. Death has no meaning, kills for entertainment.

## Major Locations

**Bay City** (Earth): Mega-city built vertically, ground level is slums, Meths live in clouds above

**The Aerium**: Floating estates where Meths live, impossible luxury, divorced from reality below

**The Wei Clinic**: Black market sleeve provider, shady but necessary for party

**Fightdrome**: Gladiatorial combat with sleeved fighters (death is temporary, makes brutal sport)

**Psychasec**: Corporation controlling stack technology and backup storage

**Head in the Clouds**: Orbital brothel/torture facility where anything is possible in VR

**The Raven Hotel**: Poe's AI-controlled hotel, party's base of operations

## Unique Mechanics

**Sleeve System**: Characters can change bodies, each with different stats
- Original Sleeve: Average, familiar, comfortable (your "real" body)
- Combat Sleeve: Enhanced strength/durability, feels wrong
- Stealth Sleeve: Agile, unremarkable, useful for infiltration
- Social Sleeve: Beautiful, charismatic, for high society
- Changing sleeves requires adjustment period (roleplay opportunity)

**Stack Damage**: If stack destroyed, character truly dies (permanent death)
**Backup System**: Can pay for backup saves (insurance against real death)
**Virtual Reality**: Missions in VR where physics don't apply
**Psychic Abilities**: Envoy training allows intuition (limited precognition)
**Memory Integrity**: Can lose/gain memories from stack damage or editing

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Optimal**: Expose Meth crimes, preserve stack technology but democratize access, Falconer reformed rather than extremist, personal relationships maintained

**Standard**: Stop conspiracy, some casualties, stack system reformed but imperfect

**Pyrrhic**: Victory costs everything—loved ones dead, civilization damaged, stacks destroyed or monopolized

**Defeat**: Meth cabal wins, party killed permanently (stacks destroyed), or forced into digital slavery

This campaign explores immortality's dark side—when life is cheap, death becomes entertainment, and those who live forever become monsters. Questions to explore: If you could live forever, should you? At what point does long life become prison rather than blessing? And is death the enemy, or the thing that makes life precious?
