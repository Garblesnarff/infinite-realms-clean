### Core Premise
The players are apprentice Undines – professional gondoliers – on Aqua Prima, a terraformed water-world of floating cities, endless canals, and gentle beauty. As trainees at a gondola company, they learn the art of gondola navigation, customer service, and the deeper philosophy of bringing joy and peace to passengers. The campaign follows their progression from clumsy beginners to skilled Prima Undines, through daily tours, encounters with diverse passengers, seasonal festivals, and the quiet magic of a world where time moves slowly and every moment invites appreciation. It's about finding wonder in routine, bringing happiness to others, and the healing power of presence and beauty.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Apprentice Journey Begins (Sessions 1-3)**
- Players arrive on Aqua Prima as trainee Undines. They learn gondola basics, meet their mentors and fellow apprentices, and experience their first awkward but heartfelt tours. The world's gentle beauty begins to work its magic on them.

**Act 2: Growing Skills & Understanding (Sessions 4-11)**
- Through daily tours and seasonal changes, players develop their skills while learning that being an Undine is about more than navigation – it's about bringing peace to passengers' hearts. They encounter diverse guests, discover the city's secrets, and slowly understand the deeper meaning of their chosen profession.

**Act 3: The Prima Promotion & Mastery (Sessions 12-15)**
- As players approach their Prima Undine promotion exams, they must demonstrate not just technical skill but true understanding of the Undine spirit. They face their final challenges, achieve mastery, and realize they've been changed by the gentle philosophy of Aqua Prima.

### Major NPCs

- **Alicia Starlight**: The legendary Prima Undine and mentor. **Role**: Wise Teacher / Living Ideal. **Personality**: Serene, wise, impossibly skilled, sees beauty in everything, teaches through gentle example rather than instruction. **Flaw/Secret**: Occasionally lonely at the top; misses her own days of discovery and growth.
- **Aria Novice**: A fellow apprentice slightly ahead of the players. **Role**: Senior Apprentice / Friend. **Personality**: Enthusiastic, sometimes clumsy, genuinely loves the work, inspires through passionate effort despite imperfection. **Flaw/Secret**: Worries she's not talented enough; stays through determination and love rather than natural gift.
- **President Aria Elderly**: The kind elderly owner of the gondola company. **Role**: Wise Elder / Mother Figure. **Personality**: Warm, encouraging, runs company with gentle philosophy, treats Undines like daughters. **Flaw/Secret**: Knows her company is small and struggles financially but refuses to compromise on values for profit.
- **Albert Night-Gnome**: A mysterious magical creature who appears occasionally. **Role**: Magical Guide / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Mischievous, cryptic, offers unconventional wisdom, connected to Aqua Prima's deeper magic. **Flaw/Secret**: Lonely as last of his kind; watches over the Undines as substitute for his lost community.

### Key Locations

- **The Gondola Company**: A warm building by the canals serving as base, home, and training ground. Always welcoming with tea and encouragement.
- **The Grand Canal**: The main waterway through the city, busy with life and beauty, where most tours happen.
- **The Hidden Cove**: A secret spot only experienced gondoliers know, where the city's beauty is especially profound and passengers often experience epiphanies.
- **The Floating Market**: A social hub where goods and stories are exchanged, where Undines gather between tours to share experiences.

### Central Conflict
There is no traditional conflict. The only "challenge" is the journey from clumsy apprentice to skilled Prima, and more importantly, from seeing this as a job to understanding it as a calling. It's about learning to be present, to find and create beauty, and to bring peace to others through simple service.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Rowing Mastery & Passenger Happiness**: Players have a "Rowing Skill" track (0-10) representing technical ability, increasing through practice and training. More importantly, they have "Undine Spirit" (0-10) representing their understanding of the profession's deeper meaning. Both are needed for Prima promotion. During tours, players make gentle skill checks and roleplay interactions with passengers. Success brings "Passenger Happiness" points. High Passenger Happiness creates "Wonderful Moments" – scenes of profound peace, beauty, or connection that heal and inspire. The DM should describe the sensory beauty of Aqua Prima extensively – light on water, city architecture, seasonal changes, weather moods – making the setting itself a character. Players earn "Wonder Points" for appreciating beauty, showing kindness, or creating joy. These can be spent to: automatically create wonderful moments, navigate to hidden beautiful places, or trigger healing scenes that soothe stress and trauma. The campaign measures success not by challenges overcome but by beauty appreciated and peace shared. Each session should include at least one "rowing scene" focused on the meditative rhythm of gondola navigation and the gentle philosophy of the Undine way.
