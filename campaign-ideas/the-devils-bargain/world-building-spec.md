# The Devil's Bargain - World-Building Specification

## The Nature of the Chains Below

The realm is addiction personified. Everything here feeds desire and creates dependency. The architecture itself is designed to make you comfortable, then necessary. What starts as luxury becomes prison.

## How Chains Work

Chains are manifestations of self-imposed limitations. They appear as physical bonds but represent psychological imprisonment. Each chain link is a choice to prioritize comfort over growth, desire over need, easy over right.

**Chain Formation**:
1. Desire something (harmless)
2. Make a deal to get it (fair)
3. Get exactly what you wanted (satisfying)
4. Want more (inevitable)
5. Make another deal (addiction forming)
6. Chain link appears (bondage manifesting)
7. Repeat until immobilized

## The Chained King's Origin

Once a mortal named Malphas who made his first deal for power. Became so addicted to deals that he merged with the realm itself. Now he IS the Devil's realm, unable to exist outside it. Every visitor's vice strengthens him. He genuinely believes he helps people by giving them what they want.

## The Liberation Door

Always unlocked. Never guarded. Simple wooden door. Leads back to freedom. The only barrier is your own chains—and those can be broken anytime through difficult choices. Most visitors never use it, not because they can't, but because they won't.

## Types of Chains

- **Material Chains**: Attachment to things
- **Pleasure Chains**: Addiction to sensation
- **Pride Chains**: Need for validation
- **Fear Chains**: Comfort avoiding growth
- **Power Chains**: Control addiction
- **Knowledge Chains**: Information hoarding

## The Paradox

The realm operates on one rule: Free will is absolute. Every chain is chosen. Every bondage is consensual. The Devil's only power is making bondage attractive. You imprison yourself.

## Economy

Currency is freedom. You trade pieces of autonomy for desires. Fair exchange. The horror is realizing how cheaply you sell yourself.

## Culture

Visitors fall into categories:
- **The Newcomers**: Still believe they'll leave soon
- **The Regulars**: Admit they're staying but claim control
- **The Voluntary**: Embrace bondage openly
- **The Escapees**: Fight daily to leave
- **The Returned**: Left but came back, most tragic

## The Unchained Philosophy

Breaking chains requires:
1. Acknowledging addiction
2. Accepting withdrawal pain
3. Walking through discomfort
4. Choosing freedom daily
5. Never returning

Staying unchained is harder than breaking chains initially.

## Mysteries

- Is the Chained King actually evil or just a mirror?
- Can the realm exist without visitors' vices?
- What happens if everyone left?
- Is comfortable bondage really worse than painful freedom?
- Where does the Liberation Door actually lead?
