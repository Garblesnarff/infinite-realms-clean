# The Devil's Bargain
## "Every Chain You Forge, You Forge Yourself"

### Campaign Overview

Welcome to the Chains Below, where desire manifests and addiction takes physical form. The party arrives in this dark paradise seeking something they desperately need—a cure for a plague, a lost soul, forbidden knowledge, ultimate power—and the Chained King offers it freely. All bargains in the Devil's realm are fair: you get exactly what you ask for, and you pay exactly what you agree to pay. The problem is understanding what you're truly agreeing to.

The Devil doesn't force anyone into chains. The chains forge themselves from your own desires, fears, and refusals to grow. Every indulgence adds a link. Every excuse strengthens the bonds. The party watches as other visitors arrive free and leave chained, not realizing they're following the same path. The Chained King sits on his throne, horned and terrible, but he wears no chains himself—because he IS the chains, the personification of bondage through desire.

To escape with what they came for and their freedom intact, the party must face their deepest vices, break chains they don't want to acknowledge exist, and ultimately realize that the Devil cannot imprison anyone who won't imprison themselves. But some chains feel so good to wear that freedom seems like the real prison.

### Core Themes

- **Self-Imposed Bondage**: We chain ourselves through our choices
- **Desire vs. Need**: Want versus what's actually good for you
- **The Seduction of Comfort**: Chains that feel like home
- **Materialism and Attachment**: Clinging to things that own you
- **Addiction and Recovery**: Breaking free from destructive patterns
- **Freedom Through Discipline**: True liberty requires self-mastery

### Major Locations

**The Welcoming Hall**: Feast of first temptations, beautiful and inviting

**The Comfort Throne**: Where the Chained King sits, surrounded by the content
**The Chain Forges**: Where deals manifest as bondage, watch yourself being bound
**The Liberation Door**: Always unlocked, always available, rarely used
**The Withdrawal Chambers**: Where those trying to break free suffer
**The Museum of Vices**: Gallery of everyone's personal addictions on display

### Unique Mechanics

**Chain Tracking System**: Each deal, indulgence, or excuse adds a chain link; visible mechanical burden; more chains = less freedom of action; can break chains through difficult choices

**Temptation Resistance**: Willpower checks against customized vices; failures add chains; successes feel hollow; the game is rigged toward bondage

**Withdrawal Mechanics**: Breaking chains causes suffering; mechanical penalties during freedom; temporary but intense; easier to go back than push through

**The Fair Contract System**: All deals are magically binding; exactly what you agreed to; no fine print, no tricks; you deceive yourself

**Comfort Creep**: Chains become mechanically beneficial; bonuses for staying bound; freedom is harder but healthier; addictive power

### Plot Twists

**You Got What You Came For in Session 4**: The quest objective was achieved early; staying longer is pure choice; revelation of self-deception

**The Devil Is You**: Chained King is composite of all visitors; your vices feed him; defeating him means defeating yourself; mirror match

**The Unchained One Is Lying**: They never actually left; perform freedom but are most chained; cautionary tale of self-deception

**Freedom Was Always Available**: The door was never locked; chains don't actually hold you unless you believe they do; mind prison

### Victory Conditions

**True Liberation**: All party members walk through Liberation Door unchained; facing withdrawal and freedom's terror; hard good ending

**Partial Freedom**: Some escape, some stay; realistic mixed outcome; party splits but honestly; bittersweet ending

**Understanding Bondage**: Stay chained but knowingly; eyes open about the choice; at least no self-deception; honest bad ending

**Becoming the King**: Replace the Devil by embodying vice; most chained becomes new ruler; dark power ending

### Defeat Conditions

**Comfortable Chains**: Stay forever, convincing selves it's fine; self-deception complete; trapped in lies

**The Withdrawal Breaks You**: Try to leave but can't handle freedom; return defeated; addiction wins
