# The Devil's Bargain - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
- Opulent darkness, velvet and gold, seductive shadows
- Baroque excess meets addiction aesthetic
- Chains as jewelry, bondage as decoration
- Traditional Devil imagery: horns, throne, inverted pentagram
- Visible chains on characters, multiplying over time
- The Liberation Door: Simple wooden door, always visible, always ignored

## Music and Sound
- **Chained King's Theme**: Seductive strings, tempting harmonies, beautiful trap
- **Temptation Markets**: Carnival music with unsettling undertones
- **Liberation Theme**: Simple, pure notes, frightening in its honesty
- **Withdrawal**: Discordant, painful, desperate sounds
- **Comfort**: Warm, safe, dangerously soothing

## Voice Acting
- **Chained King**: Seductive, reasonable, understanding, "I only want to help"
- **The Unchained One**: Strained freedom, always fighting, victorious but exhausted
- **Comfort**: Maternal, warm, makes bondage feel like love
- **Liberation Guardian**: Silent pointing, more powerful than words

## Key Cinematics
- First deal made, first chain appears
- Character trying to leave, realizing chains are too heavy
- Withdrawal scene: Freedom's painful cost
- The Liberation Door: Walking through or turning back
- Epilogue: Consequences of choices

## Taglines
