**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party includes Mob—a middle schooler with godlike psychic powers who suppresses all emotions to avoid losing control. When his emotions reach 100%, he explodes with reality-warping power. He works for Reigen, a self-proclaimed "Greatest Psychic of the 21st Century" who's actually a con artist with massage skills—but whose life advice is surprisingly wise. Together they exorcise spirits, fight evil psychics, and learn that emotional growth matters more than power. It's a story about self-acceptance, healthy emotions, and that your life is your own to live.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Self-Proclaimed Psychic"
*   The party meets Reigen Arataka, whose "Spirits and Such Consultation Office" handles supernatural problems.
*   His assistant Mob seems ordinary—until spirits attack and he obliterates them with a thought.

### Session 3 — "An Invite to a Meeting"
*   A cult leader tries to recruit Mob using fake psychic displays.
*   Reigen exposes the fraud despite being a con artist himself—his hypocrisy is perfect.

### Session 4 — "Darkness"

### Session 5 — "Collision"
*   Mob's emotions reach 100% RAGE after bullies hurt his brother.
*   He explodes, warping reality around him, nearly killing the bullies before regaining control.

### Session 6 — "Discord"

**Escalation:** Emotions aren't weaknesses—they're tools when expressed healthily.

### Session 8 — "The First Reunion"

*   "You're already special because you're you."
**Escalation:** Identity beyond abilities. Mob starts accepting himself.

### Session 9 — "Master and Disciple"
*   Mob confronts Reigen: "You lied about having powers."
*   Reigen's response: "Powers don't matter. You're already a good person. That's what counts."

### Session 10 — "Confession"
*   Mob finally confesses to Tsubomi, his crush. She rejects him kindly.
*   His emotions reach 100% but instead of exploding, he processes healthily: "That's okay. I'll keep growing."
**Escalation:** Emotional maturity achieved. Rejection doesn't destroy him.

### Session 11 — "Transmission"
*   Mob suppresses too much trying to be "good" and ???% awakens—his true unconscious.
*   ???% has no morality, only instinct to eliminate threats.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **emotional suppression versus healthy expression**. Mob believes emotions cause harm, so he suppresses them until explosive release. The campaign explores that emotions aren't dangerous—suppression is. It's about self-acceptance, finding worth beyond power, and that your life is your own to define. Reigen represents wisdom without credentials; Mob represents power without ego.
