# World-Building Specification Brief: Reaching One Hundred Percent

**Core Concept:** Party includes Mob—middle schooler with godlike psychic powers who suppresses emotions to avoid 100% explosions. He works for Reigen, a charlatan exorcist whose fake credentials hide genuine wisdom. They fight evil psychic organization Claw while Mob learns emotional expression and self-worth beyond power. The campaign is coming-of-age metaphor—suppression causes explosions, healthy expression enables growth, your life is your own to define.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Espers—people with psychic powers (telekinesis, exorcism, barriers), rare but increasing.
*   Claw Organization—evil psychics believing might makes right, recruiting espers for world domination.
*   ???%—Mob's unconscious self, awakens when he over-suppresses, pure instinct without morality.
*   Spirits and Such Consultation Office—Reigen's fake business that accidentally solves real problems.

**Factions:**
*   **Spirits and Such:** Reigen's consultancy, handles spirits/curses, teaches emotional wisdom accidentally.
*   **Claw:** Evil psychic organization, multiple divisions, recruitment and brainwashing tactics.
*   **Body Improvement Club:** Non-psychic school club where Mob finds genuine acceptance.
*   **Awakening Lab:** Cult trying to awaken psychic powers in normal people through meditation.

**Locations:**
*   **Salt Middle School:** Where Mob seeks normal life, joins clubs, navigates social anxiety.
*   **Spirits and Such Office:** Cramped consultation office above ramen shop, base of operations.
*   **Claw Headquarters:** Multiple bases across country, brainwashing facilities, 7th Division base.
*   **Urban Legend Sites:** Possessed schools, haunted tunnels, cursed mansions they exorcise.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF Mob reaches 100% specific emotion, THEN that emotion explosively manifests as psychic power.
*   IF he over-suppresses all emotions, THEN ???% awakens and rampages instinctively.
*   IF Mob joins Claw, THEN he gains belonging but loses morality and becomes weapon.
*   IF he achieves integration, THEN he accepts all emotions and controls power healthily.
