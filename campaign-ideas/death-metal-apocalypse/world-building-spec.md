# Death Metal Apocalypse - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Five Tribes

**Cannibal Corpse (Brutal Death):** ~10,000 members. Pure survival through strength. Literal cannibals (but consensual—the dead are honored by being consumed). Led by War-Chief Molesting. Worship War Horseman unknowingly.

**Calculated Ruin (Technical Death):** ~5,000 members. Everything mathematical. Fortified compound. Advanced (for Wastes) technology. Led by Prime Cynic. Believe apocalypse can be solved like equation.

**Scandinavia Eternal (Melodic Death):** ~8,000 members. Viking-influenced. Honor culture. Beautiful despite brutality. Led by Valkyrie Bloodbath. Mourn lost world, seek restoration.

**Deep Slow (Death-Doom):** ~3,000 members. Underground dwellers. Move slowly, live long. Ancient knowledge. Led by The Watcher. Believe acceptance is only truth.

**Mortality's Progress (Progressive Death):** ~2,000 members. Experimental, evolving. Seek transcendence. Led by Opeth the Transformer. Believe physical form is temporary.

### The Four Horsemen
Cosmic entities maintaining The Wastes. Not evil—performing their cosmic function. Can be reasoned with because they're bored. Want Second Consumption for variety.

**War:** Embodied conflict. Feeds on violence. Strong but respects strength.
**Famine:** Embodied scarcity. Creates desperation. Tests resourcefulness.
**Pestilence:** Embodied decay. Spreads disease. Teaches mortality.
**Death:** Embodied ending. Makes death meaningful. Most powerful, most reasonable.

### The Undead
Not faction but constant presence. Everything killed rises again. Maintained by death metal necromancy. Some retain intelligence. Most are mindless. Dispose of properly (burn, dismember, consume) or they return.

## Historical Causality

### Before The Consumption (Unknown Time Ago)
Dimension was paradise. Multiple advanced civilizations. Created something (unknown what) that attracted the Horsemen. Apocalypse began.

### The Consumption (1,000 Years Ago)
Horsemen arrived. Destroyed everything. Not maliciously—performing cosmic function. Dimension became eternal apocalypse. Survivors adapted.

### Formation of Tribes (500 Years Ago)
Survivors organized around death metal sub-genres. Music became literal power. Tribes formed, warred, adapted. Current status quo established.

### The Boredom (Recent)
Horsemen grew tired of eternal stasis. Planned Second Consumption. Not to end suffering but to experience novelty. Players arrive during preparation.

## Additional Lore

### Death Metal Magic
Music channels apocalyptic power:
- **Growls:** Damage enemies through sonic force
- **Blast Beats:** Accelerate time in small area
- **Breakdowns:** Create earthquakes
- **Solos:** Manifest weapons from sound
- **Harmonies:** Necromancy (raising dead)

### Resource Scarcity
Everything limited: food, water, materials. Must scavenge from ruins. Leads to constant conflict. Tribes raid each other. Alliances temporary.

### Mutation and Adaptation
Exposure to Wastes changes people. Mutations random. Some beneficial (strength, resilience). Some detrimental (madness, decay). Marks how long survived.

### Necromancy as Fact
Death doesn't stick without proper disposal. Everything rises. Creates constant threat and opportunity. Dead can be questioned (if you can control them). Makes warfare complicated.

### Philosophy of Endings
Central theme: Is ending bad? Death argues peace is a kind of strength. Suffering tests worth. But is test necessary? Can meaning exist without suffering? No easy answers.

### The Beautiful Death
Special mechanic: Accepting mortality grants power. Those who rage against death are weak. Those who embrace it transcend. But is acceptance surrender or wisdom?

This world-building creates dimension where death metal's themes—mortality, decay, brutality, and transcendence—are literal reality. Every philosophical question has life-or-death stakes.
