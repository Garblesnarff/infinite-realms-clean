### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Starfall Outcasts**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Twenty years ago, a massive celestial vessel crashed near the city of Ironhaven, carrying thousands of insectoid alien refugees—the Vrynn. Confined to a squalid ghetto called District Twelve and exploited by the ruthless Meridian Corporation, the Vrynn are treated as less than human. When a party member is infected with experimental Vrynn bio-essence and begins transforming into one of them, the party must navigate a city divided by fear and prejudice while uncovering a corporate conspiracy to weaponize Vrynn biology and eradicate the refugees entirely.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Vrynn's arrival twenty years ago—the crash, the initial panic, and the establishment of District Twelve.
    *   Write the story of early human-Vrynn relations and how hope turned to exploitation.
    *   Describe Vrynn culture, biology, and their homeworld (which they can never return to via normal means).
    *   Explain Meridian Corporation's rise to power through Vrynn exploitation and their monopoly on alien biotechnology.
    *   Detail the development of Vrynn bio-essence—its properties, uses, and horrific side effects.
    *   Describe the growth of anti-Vrynn sentiment, propaganda, and systemic discrimination in Ironhaven.
