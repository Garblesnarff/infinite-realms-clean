Twenty years ago, a massive celestial vessel crashed near the city of Ironhaven, carrying thousands of insectoid alien refugees—the Vrynn. Confined to a squalid ghetto called District Twelve and exploited by the ruthless Meridian Corporation, the Vrynn are treated as less than human. When a party member is infected with experimental Vrynn bio-essence and begins transforming into one of them, the party must navigate a city divided by fear and prejudice while uncovering a corporate conspiracy to weaponize Vrynn biology and eradicate the refugees entirely.

## What "Medium-High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Urban combat against corporate mercenaries, desperate fights with infected creatures, moral dilemmas where violence may not be the answer.
*   **Investigation:** The party must uncover corporate secrets, navigate refugee politics, and deal with a transformation that's slowly changing one of their own.
*   **Consequences:** The party's actions determine whether the Vrynn are exterminated, liberated, or something in between. The transforming party member must grapple with their changing identity.

A three-act arc about transformation, prejudice, and revolution.

*   **Act I — The Infection (Sessions 1–4):** A party member is exposed to Vrynn bio-essence during a corporate raid on District Twelve. As they begin transforming, the party investigates the Meridian Corporation and discovers they're weaponizing Vrynn biology.

## Key Locations

1.  **Ironhaven:** An industrial city built around corporate factories and refineries, now with a massive alien refugee camp on its outskirts.
2.  **District Twelve:** A squalid ghetto of makeshift shelters where the Vrynn are confined, surrounded by walls and checkpoints.

## Central Conflict

The external conflict is between the exploited Vrynn refugees and the corrupt Meridian Corporation. The internal conflict is the transforming party member's struggle with identity—are they losing their humanity or gaining a deeper understanding of what it means to be a person? The campaign explores themes of xenophobia, corporate exploitation, bodily autonomy, and whether empathy can overcome fear and prejudice.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Transformation Track**

*   The infected party member has a transformation tracker (1-10).
*   **Progression:** Advances through story beats, exposure to Vrynn bio-essence, or using hybrid abilities.
*   **Effects:** Each level grants new abilities (Vrynn strength, enhanced senses, bio-weapons) but also changes appearance and reduces human social acceptance.

### 2. **Prejudice System**

*   NPCs react based on the hybrid's transformation level.
*   **Low (1-3):** Minor discrimination, suspicious looks.
*   **Medium (4-7):** Open hostility, refused service, violence.
*   **High (8-10):** Treated as Vrynn, attacked on sight by authorities, accepted by Vrynn community.

### 3. **Corporate Reputation**

*   The party's actions affect Meridian's public reputation and power.
*   **Effects:** Low reputation makes them vulnerable to public pressure, investigation, and rebellion.

### 4. **Evacuation Counter**

*   In the finale, a timer tracks how many Vrynn can be evacuated before the portal collapses or Meridian's forces arrive.
