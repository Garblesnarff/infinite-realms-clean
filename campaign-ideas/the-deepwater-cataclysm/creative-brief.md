# The Deepwater Cataclysm - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Deepwater Horizon meets Lovecraftian Horror** - Emphasis on oil spill aesthetics translated to magical corruption. Black water, toxic tides, mutated sea life. Industrial disaster meets cosmic horror. Beautiful ocean corrupted into nightmare.

## Color Palettes
- **The Spill**: Oily black, toxic purple, chemical green, corrupted blue
- **The Ocean**: Beautiful blue corrupted to dead grey, poison tides
- **The Mutations**: Unnatural colors, bioluminescent wrong, flesh-horror pinks
- **The Abyss**: Absolute black, darkness given form, void colors
- **The Leviathan**: Primordial darkness, tentacle black, eye-glow wrong

## Music & Sound
**Main Theme**: "The Black Tide" - Starts with ocean waves, corrupted by industrial sounds, descends into deep bass representing abyss, underwater pressure sounds, tentacles moving through water. **Underwater**: Muffled world, pressure creaks, whale songs twisted, silence punctuated by horror. **Leviathan**: Deep bass beyond hearing, pressure on eardrums, darkness given sound.

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 1**: Black tide washing onto beach, fish dying in thousands, water wrong color
- **Session 9**: First dive—descending into corrupted water, visibility zero, creatures in darkness
- **Session 21**: First view of Leviathan through prison gaps—too large to comprehend, tentacles everywhere
- **Session 32**: Prison sealed, black water clearing, first clean wave hitting shore, life returning
