# The Deepwater Cataclysm - World-Building Specification

## Factions

**The Marine Research Institute**: Dr. Marina Tidecaller and scientists studying corruption, developing countermeasures
**Deepwell Corporation**: Executives who caused disaster, covering up, protecting profits, blocking investigations
**The Coastal Defense Force**: Admiral Stormridge's navy, evacuating populations, considering extreme measures
**The Cult of the Abyss**: Abyss Prophet and followers worshipping Leviathan, want full release
**The Merfolk Kingdoms**: King Pelagius's underwater civilization suffering worst effects, demand justice
**Whistleblower Alliance**: Former employees with evidence, seeking to expose corporate crime
**Environmental Activists**: Demanding corporate accountability, cleanup, systemic change

## NPCs

Dr. Marina Tidecaller (marine biologist), CEO Viktor Deepwell (corrupt executive), Abyss Prophet (mad cultist), Admiral Stormridge (military commander), King Pelagius (merfolk ruler), Whistleblower (evidence holder), The Abyssal Leviathan (primordial darkness)

## The Abyssal Leviathan

Ancient entity from before current world order, embodying deep ocean darkness and hunger. Imprisoned by previous civilization for attempting to drag world into lightless depths. Not evil from its perspective—darkness is its nature, light is aberration. Incomprehensibly vast, tentacled nightmare, speaks through corruption and madness. Intelligent but alien. Can be negotiated with: Offer permanent deep-ocean zone, controlled influence, coexistence. Or must be sealed/destroyed at great cost.

## Corruption Mechanics

**Stages of Exposure**:
1. **Minor**: Skin discoloration, minor mutation
2. **Moderate**: Physical changes, mental effects, hearing whispers
3. **Severe**: Major mutation, Leviathan influence, might become cultist
4. **Terminal**: Complete transformation, become darkness servant

**Environmental Effects**:
- Water poisoned, kills normal life
- Creatures mutated into aggressive abominations
- Dead zones expanding, nothing survives
- Corruption spreads to groundwater, rain, everywhere

## Corporate Conspiracy

Deepwell Corporation:
- Detected anomaly 5 years ago during surveys
- Identified concentrated dark energy (profitable)
- Warnings from geomancers: Imprisoned entity, dangerous
- Executives chose to drill anyway, saw profit potential
- Safety protocols ignored to maximize extraction
- Disaster predicted by whistleblowers, suppressed
- Post-disaster: Executives fled, destroyed evidence, hired mercenaries, propaganda campaign

Evidence to gather:
- Internal memos showing they knew
- Whistleblower testimonies
- Suppressed safety reports
- Executive escape plans
- Proof of negligence for prosecution

## Locations

**Deepwell-7**: Offshore platform, disaster site, abandoned, leaking continuously, evidence repository

**The Black Ocean**: Expanding dead zone, mutated creatures, toxic tides, nightmare ecosystem

**Coastal Evacuation Zones**: Cities abandoned, toxic contamination, economic collapse

**Ancient Underwater City**: Ruins of civilization that imprisoned Leviathan, contains lore and technology

**The Abyssal Trench**: 7+ miles deep, crushing pressure, absolute darkness, prison location

**Leviathan's Prison**: Massive structure, corrupted architecture, entity partially emerged, final confrontation site

## Timeline

**Year -5**: Survey detects anomaly, executives see profit
**Year -2**: Drilling begins despite warnings
**Day -30**: Blowout, disaster, spill begins
**Campaign Start**: 30 days of leaking, catastrophic effects
**Day 30-60**: Investigation, conspiracy exposed, expedition prepared
**Day 60-90**: Deep dive, prison reached, sealing attempted
**Day 90+**: Resolution—sealed or apocalypse

## Solutions

1. **Seal Prison**: Ritual using deep ocean materials, sacrifice required (possibly executive's life/freedom)
2. **Destroy Leviathan**: Nearly impossible, ecological consequences unknown, might make worse
3. **Merge/Control**: Party member becomes living seal, eternal duty in darkness
4. **Negotiate**: Convince Leviathan to accept limited influence, designated deep zones only
5. **Containment**: Stop leak but can't reverse damage, endemic corruption, ongoing management
6. **Nuclear Option**: Military plan, would catastrophically fail, free Leviathan completely

## Endings

**Justice & Salvation**: Prison sealed, executives prosecuted, ocean begins recovery, systemic reform

**The Guardian**: Hero becomes eternal warden, merges with prison, ocean saved at personal cost

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Leviathan sealed but ocean permanently damaged, billions of creatures dead

**Abyssal World**: Total failure, Leviathan emerges, world dragged into darkness, underwater nightmare realm

**Corporate Escape**: Executives flee justice, disaster "managed," corruption becomes endemic, no real solution

**Negotiated Darkness**: Leviathan accepts limited domain, deep ocean zones permanently corrupted but contained
