# Cloverfield Emergence
**Tagline:** *Some things are better left undiscovered*

## Campaign Overview

The party are ordinary people in New Avalon, a coastal metropolis of 8 million. The campaign begins at a celebration—a friend's going-away party, a festival, something joyful and mundane. Then: an explosion in the harbor. Emergency broadcasts. Something massive in the water. The creature emerges—400 feet tall, alien, aggressive. The city descends into chaos.

This is a ground-level survival horror campaign. The party are not heroes, soldiers, or chosen ones. They're civilians trying to survive and escape while a kaiju destroys their city. No special powers, limited information, constant danger. The creature is incomprehensible and unstoppable. Military efforts make things worse. The city becomes a death trap.

As sessions progress, mysteries deepen: What is it? Where did it come from? Why is it attacking? The party discovers evidence of corporate bioengineering, deep sea awakening, or alien origin—different theories, limited proof. They must navigate destroyed infrastructure, avoid parasites the creature sheds, and escape evacuation zones before military orbital bombardment levels the city. Survival is victory. Understanding is optional. The truth may be worse than ignorance.

## Core Themes

- **Civilian Powerlessness:** You can't fight this, only flee
- **Found Footage Horror:** Limited perspective, incomplete information
- **Urban Disaster:** Familiar locations becoming death traps
- **Mystery Without Resolution:** Truth may never be fully known
- **Ordinary People in Crisis:** Character drama amid apocalypse
- **Collateral Damage:** Military response kills as many as monster
- **Existential Dread:** Humanity's insignificance

## Session Breakdown

### Act 1: The Emergence (Sessions 1-10)
**Sessions 1-2:** Party at celebration. Distant explosion. News reports. Evacuation orders. Creature sighting. First glimpse—horrifying. Panic begins. Infrastructure fails. Party decides to flee together.

**Sessions 3-4:** Navigating chaos. Subways packed. Roads gridlocked. First parasite encounter—human-sized creatures falling from main entity. Combat is desperate and clumsy. Reaching temporary shelter. Meeting other survivors. Establishing group dynamics.

**Sessions 5-6:** Military engages creature. Artillery fire destroys buildings. Party in crossfire. Bridge collapse. Separated from group. Must reunite while creature rampages. First civilian casualties from their group—sudden, brutal, unheroic.

**Sessions 7-8:** Attempting evacuation by sea. Harbor destroyed. Boats burning. Creature's origin point investigated—strange tech debris, bioengineering equipment, corporate logos. First hint this wasn't natural disaster. Someone made this.

**Sessions 9-10:** Quarantine established. City being sealed. No one out. Military preparing final solution (orbital strike). Party has 48 hours to escape. Discovery of underground transit system, maintenance tunnels. Plan to reach outer perimeter before bombardment.

### Act 2: The Descent (Sessions 11-20)
**Sessions 11-13:** Into subway tunnels. Darkness. Parasites hunt in confined spaces. Navigation failure. Lost in underground. Encountering other survivors—some helpful, some dangerous. Resources scarce. Must scavenge corpses. Moral degradation begins.

**Sessions 14-16:** Discovery of secret research facility in subway system. Evidence of Tagruato Corporation experiments with deep-sea organisms. Failed containment. This creature was being studied, maybe created. Security footage of initial breach. The horror was preventable.

**Sessions 17-18:** Creature's path predictsable—it's heading somewhere specific. Party follows parallel route underground. Racing against time. Parasites increasing. One party member infected. Mercy kill decision. Trauma.

**Sessions 19-20:** Surface breach for supplies. City unrecognizable. Fires everywhere. Military abandoned ground operations. Aerial bombardment constant. Party must cross open ground during daytime. Stealth impossible. Creature encounter—it notices them briefly, then ignores. They're insignificant.

### Act 3: The Escape (Sessions 21-30)
**Sessions 21-23:** Reaching quarantine perimeter. Militarized zone. Guards shooting anyone trying to cross. Party must infiltrate or negotiate. Discovery that government knows what creature is hunting. They're willing to sacrifice city to prevent it reaching a specific location.

**Sessions 24-26:** Moral choice: warn evacuation centers about impending strike, or stay silent to avoid delay. Either choice has fatal consequences. Character conflicts. Group may split. Some stay to help others escape. Some run.

**Sessions 27-28:** Countdown to orbital strike. Final push to perimeter. Everything that can go wrong does. Injuries. Exhaustion. Parasite swarm. Creature's death throes as military wounds it. It's dying but taking city with it.

**Sessions 29-30:** Crossing perimeter moments before strike. Watching city destroyed from distance. Millions dead. Interrogation by military intelligence. Memory suppression offered (magic erasing trauma but also truth). Party chooses: remember and live with nightmares, or forget and lose themselves. Campaign ends with epilogues showing long-term trauma impact.

## Key NPCs

**Rob (Friend Leaving):** Whose party started this, may die early or become crucial survivor, represents normalcy lost

**Beth (Love Interest):** Trapped in collapsing building, rescue mission optional, emotional anchor

**Hud (Cameraman):** Documents everything, comic relief until he dies horrifically, evidence keeper

**Marlena (Stranger):** Met during crisis, becomes ally, infected by parasite, dies explosively

**Jason (Leadership Figure):** Takes charge initially, makes tough calls, probably dies being heroic

**Lily (Pragmatic Survivor):** Does whatever it takes to live, morally gray, survives through ruthlessness

**Colonel Masterson (Military):** Knows more than says, willing to sacrifice civilians, follows orders, conflicted

**Dr. Yuki Tanaka (Corporate Scientist):** Worked for Tagruato, guilt-ridden, provides exposition, hunted by own company

**The Creature:** No name, incomprehensible, unstoppable, might be victim too

## Major Locations

**New Avalon:** Coastal metropolis, modern architecture, dense population, multiple districts

**The Harbor:** Origin point, massive damage, bioengineering facility ruins visible underwater

**Subway System:** Becomes primary navigation route, dark, parasite-infested, claustrophobic

**Central Park Equivalent:** Temporary refuge, medical triage, evacuee camp, eventually overrun

**Tagruato Facility:** Secret research station underground, holds answers, extremely dangerous

**Quarantine Perimeter:** Military checkpoints, shoot-to-kill orders, heavily fortified, bridge to escape

**The Ruins:** Devastated city sectors, no-man's-land between creature and military, hellscape

## Unique Mechanics

### Ground-Level Perspective
- No tactical overview, no map visibility beyond immediate area
- Information comes from witnesses, broadcasts, rumor—often wrong
- Party makes decisions with incomplete intel
- Mistakes have fatal consequences

### Real-Time Pressure
- Events unfold in real-time (1 session = X hours in-game)
- Orbital strike countdown is literal
- No time for long rests, only brief respites
- Exhaustion accumulates mechanically

### Civilian Combat
- Party not trained warriors, improvised weapons
- Combat should be avoided—usually fatal
- Running is best option
- Cover and stealth vs. direct confrontation

### Resource Scarcity
- Food, water, medicine limited
- Must scavenge from destroyed stores, bodies
- Carrying capacity realistic—can't hoard
- Every item has weight and consequence

### Parasite Infestation
- Small creatures (human-sized) fall from main entity
- Fast, aggressive, hunt in packs
- Bite causes infection—explosive death in hours
- No cure, only prevention
- Creates time pressure on infected characters

### Information Gathering
- Phones still work initially (network congestion)
- News broadcasts provide limited updates
- Found documents, recordings, computers reveal lore
- Conflicting information—determine truth via investigation

### Mental Trauma
- Witnessing horrors accumulates stress
- Failed Wisdom saves cause panic, freezing, irrational actions
- PTSD effects mechanically enforced
- Character personality shifts from trauma

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1:** Creature is deep-sea organism disturbed by deep-sea mining—humans caused this

**Twist 2:** It's a juvenile, calling for its parent which is even larger

**Twist 3:** Parasites are separate species that infected the main creature—it's suffering too

**Twist 4:** Tagruato Corporation knew it was down there, woke it deliberately for weapons research

**Twist 5:** Government's orbital strike won't kill it, will only enrage it and spread parasites globally

**Twist 6:** Creature is heading to a specific location to spawn—city was in the way

**Twist 7:** One party member is Tagruato agent, has been reporting party's discoveries

**Twist 8:** Memory suppression offered at end is actually cover-up, witnesses being neutralized

**Twist 9:** This has happened before in other cities, covered up each time

**Twist 10:** Creature came from portal to another dimension, more will follow

## Victory Conditions

**Survival Victory:** Party escapes alive before bombardment, scarred but breathing

**Truth Victory:** Party preserves evidence exposing corporate responsibility, justice possible

**Heroic Victory:** Party saves significant number of civilians during escape, costly but meaningful

**Bittersweet Victory:** Some party members survive, others die heroically, survivors' guilt

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Party Kill:** All members die in various horrible ways, found footage ends mid-scream

**Missed Deadline:** Caught in orbital strike, vaporized, epilogue shows crater

**Parasite Infection:** Last survivors infected, explosive deaths, footage found later

**Memory Wiped:** Survive but accept memory suppression, victory hollow—they survived but lost themselves

## Campaign Structure Notes

**Session Zero:** Character creation emphasizes mundane backgrounds, relationships, normal lives

**Tone:** Constant tension, brief respites, sudden violence, uncomfortable realism

**Player Agency:** Freedom in how to survive, not in outcome—city will be destroyed

**Mystery:** Clues scattered, full truth never confirmed, multiple theories viable

**Horror:** Body horror from parasites, existential horror from scale, urban horror from familiar turned deadly

**Realism:** No plot armor, beloved NPCs die randomly, heroic actions often fail, survival is luck as much as skill

This campaign is about ordinary people facing incomprehensible horror, making hard choices with no good options, and surviving at tremendous cost. It's Cloverfield meets disaster film meets urban survival horror.
