# Cloverfield Emergence: Creative Brief

## Art Style: Found Footage Realism

**Aesthetic:** Handheld camera shaky, digital grain, darkness punctuated by emergency lights, flashlight beams

**Creature Design:** Glimpsed in fragments—never full clear view, bio-mechanical horror, too alien to comprehend

**Urban Destruction:** Realistic devastation, recognizable landmarks destroyed, emotional impact of familiar ruined

**Parasites:** Albino, insect-like, fast movement, visible internal organs, nightmarish

## Color Palettes

**Early:** Normal city colors (#B0B0B0, #4A90E2, #FFD700)

**Emergency:** Warning Orange (#FF8C00), Siren Red (#DC143C), Smoke Gray (#696969)

**Night:** Deep Black (#000000), Emergency Red lights, Flashlight White beams, Fire Orange

**Creature:** Pale Gray flesh, Bioluminescent Blue veins, Toxic Green blood

## Music and Sound Design

**Sparse Score:** Minimal music, mostly ambient dread, occasional strings building tension

**Sound Priority:** Diegetic sounds—sirens, screams, explosions, creature roars, radio broadcasts

**The Roar:** Low frequency that rattles player, felt not just heard, causes physical unease

**Parasite Sounds:** Chittering, wet movement, breathing, hunting vocalizations

**Silence:** Used for tension, aftermath, before sudden horror

## Voice Direction

**Party Members:** Natural, realistic dialogue, panic authentic, growing exhaustion audible

**NPCs:** Range from hysterical to numb, PTSD affects speech patterns

**Military/Official:** Radio filtered, professional detachment cracking, bureaucratic evil

**Creature:** Incomprehensible vocalizations, whale-song meets industrial noise

## Cinematic Moments

**The Emergence:** Harbor explosion, statue head lands in street (Cloverfield iconic image), first roar

**Parasite Attack:** Sudden, brutal, fast editing, barely visible threats, aftermath gruesome

**Building Collapse:** Reality of scale, dust clouds, debris fields, slow-motion horror

**The Bombing:** Sky turns white, shockwave visible, mushroom cloud, city vaporized

**Final Escape:** Running from expanding destruction, looking back, losing everything
