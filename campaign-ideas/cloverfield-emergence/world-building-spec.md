# Cloverfield Emergence: World-Building Specification

## New Avalon City

**Population:** 8 million
**Layout:** Coastal, multi-district, modern infrastructure
**Economy:** Tech hub, shipping port, tourism
**Notable:** Known for coastal views, historic harbor, downtown density

**Districts:**
- **Downtown:** High-rises, business district, party's starting location
- **Harbor District:** Industrial, shipping, creature's emergence point
- **Midtown:** Residential, subway hub, where most civilian deaths occur
- **University Quarter:** Research institutions, Tagruato's secret facility located here
- **The Heights:** Wealthy hillside neighborhood, evacuation priority
- **Industrial Corridor:** Factories, warehouses, becomes refugee zone

## The Creature Itself

**Designation:** LSA-001 (Large Scale Aberration)

**Origin Theories:**
1. Deep-sea organism awakened by drilling
2. Bioengineered weapons project escaped containment
3. Alien species arriving through ocean portal
4. Ancient creature from Earth's prehistory
(Campaign never confirms which is true)

**Size:** 400+ feet tall

**Characteristics:**
- Pale gray skin, bio-mechanical appearance
- Multiple limbs, unusual proportions
- Seems injured/distressed—attacks may be defensive
- Regenerates damage rapidly
- Sheds parasites constantly

**Behavior:**
- Heading toward specific location (Tagruato main facility)
- Attacks when blocked or threatened
- Ignores small targets (humans beneath notice)
- May be trying to return to ocean
- Intelligence unknown

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Damaged by sustained military bombardment (not killed)
- Orbital strike required for termination
- Parasites vulnerable to fire
- Main creature's weak points unknown

## The Parasites

**Type:** Secondary organisms living on main creature

**Size:** Dog to human-sized

**Appearance:** Pale, eyeless, multi-limbed, tooth-heavy

**Behavior:**
- Fall from main creature during movement
- Hunt in packs
- Extremely aggressive
- Attracted to warmth/movement
- Limited intelligence

**Attack:**
- Bite injects organism
- Victim infected
- 4-24 hour incubation
- Explosive fatal death releasing more parasites
- No known cure

**Ecology:**
- May be parasitizing main creature too
- Reproduce rapidly
- Could become permanent infestation if not contained
- Reason for quarantine beyond main creature

## Tagruato Corporation

**Public Face:** Deep-sea drilling, research, "sustainable ocean resources"

**Reality:** Military-industrial bioweapons research

**Discovered:**
- Creature or its eggs in deep-sea trench
- Brought samples to city facility
- Attempted to weaponize/study
- Containment breach caused emergence

**Cover-Up:**
- Destroying evidence
- Hunting witnesses
- Funding "meteor strike" counter-narrative
- Agents embedded in evacuation efforts

**Key Figures:**
- CEO (never seen, escapes early)
- Dr. Tanaka (whistleblower, helps party)
- Security teams (hunting party for exposure)

## Government/Military Response

**Timeline:**
- Hour 0: Initial emergence, local police respond
- Hour 2: National Guard activated
- Hour 6: Military assumes control
- Hour 12: Evacuation ordered
- Hour 24: Quarantine established
- Hour 48: Orbital strike authorized
- Hour 72: City destroyed

**Strategies:**
- Conventional weapons (ineffective)
- Heavy artillery (damages but doesn't kill)
- Aerial bombardment (drives creature, collateral damage)
- Final option: Orbital strike (total destruction)

**Quarantine:**
- 10-mile perimeter
- Shoot-to-kill orders
- No exceptions (officially)
- Goal: Contain parasites, prevent spread
- Acceptable losses: Entire city population

**Knowledge:**
- Government knows Tagruato's involvement
- Covering up to prevent panic/legal issues
- Willing to sacrifice city to hide truth
- Witnesses being detained/silenced post-crisis

## Survivor Groups

**Evacuation Centers:**
- Temporary safe zones (stadiums, malls)
- Overcrowded, resource-depleted
- Parasite breaches cause massacres
- Eventually abandoned by authorities

**Looters:**
- Opportunists stealing from stores
- Some violent, some just desperate
- Can be allies or threats

**Rescuers:**
- Civilians helping others escape
- Often die heroically
- Provide temporary safety and resources

**Paranoid Bunker Groups:**
- Don't trust official evacuation
- Barricaded in buildings
- May have valuable supplies
- May be hostile to outsiders

## Evidence and Lore

**Found Throughout Campaign:**

- **Corporate Emails:** Discussing containment breach, ordering evidence destruction
- **Security Footage:** Creature's initial emergence from facility
- **Scientific Logs:** Failed attempts to control/communicate with creature
- **News Broadcasts:** Civilian perspective, theories, footage
- **Military Radio:** Partial information about strategies and countdown
- **Survivor Testimonies:** Varying accounts, some accurate, some fantasy
- **Physical Evidence:** Creature tissue samples, parasite specimens, Tagruato equipment

**The Truth Players Can Piece Together:**
- Tagruato found something in ocean trench
- Brought it to city facility
- Lost control during experiment
- Creature trying to return to ocean or reach corporate headquarters
- Government covering up corporate negligence
- Orbital strike will prevent truth from emerging
- Thousands dying to protect corporate interests

## Escape Routes

**Initially Viable:**
- Bridges (collapse early)
- Tunnels (parasite-infested)
- Harbor (destroyed)
- Helicopters (limited, VIP only)

**Party's Options:**
- Subway maintenance tunnels to perimeter
- Sewers (dangerous, disorienting)
- On foot through ruins (exposed)
- Smuggler routes (if they find guides)
- Breach quarantine illegally

## Post-Campaign Implications

**If Party Survives:**
- Interrogated by military intelligence
- Evidence confiscated or suppressed
- Offered payment for silence
- Memory suppression "option" (coerced)
- PTSD and survivor's guilt
- Possible sequel hooks if truth gets out

**Cover Story:**
- "Meteor strike" official narrative
- Parasites classified as "unknown contaminant"
- Death toll minimized in reports
- Tagruato avoids responsibility via shell games
- Compensation to families limited
- Truth movements emerge but dismissed as conspiracy

This world-building supports a campaign where players feel genuinely powerless, information is fragmented and unreliable, and survival is the only achievable goal. The monster is almost secondary to the human response and corporate malfeasance.
