# Creative Brief: The Infinite Repetition

## Art Style: Pop Art (Warhol / Lichtenstein / Oldenburg-inspired)

Bright colors, commercial imagery, mass-produced aesthetic, repetition as composition, flat surface emphasis.

### Core Principles:
- **Repetition Grid**: Same image repeated in grid patterns
- **Commercial Imagery**: Brand logos, celebrity faces, consumer products
- **Bright CMYK Colors**: Primary red, yellow, blue, with black. No subtlety.
- **Flat Surface**: No depth or shading, everything equally on surface
- **Ben-Day Dots**: Comic book printing texture
- **Iconic Simplicity**: Reduce complex to simple recognizable forms

### Visual Style:
Warhol's silk-screen grids, Lichtenstein's comic panels, Oldenburg's giant consumer products. Everything bright, commercial, reproducible.

## Music: Pop / Commercial Jingles / Muzak
1960s pop repetition. Commercial jingles on loop. Muzak elevator music. Catchy, repetitive, becomes maddening through endless repetition.

## Voice Acting:
Bright, commercial-announcer voices. Everyone sounds like they're in advertisement. Cheerful but hollow. Identical inflections for identical NPCs.
