The players awaken in a dimly lit chamber with no memories of who they are or how they arrived.

With nothing but the clothes on their backs and a slip of paper directing them to the Volunteer Soldier's Guild, they must learn to fight, scavenge, and survive in a world that doesn't care if they live or die. As they struggle to earn their daily bread, fragments of their past lives begin to surface, revealing a disturbing truth about why they were brought to this world.

## Difficulty Context

**Hard** - This campaign emphasizes realistic combat consequences, resource scarcity, and the psychological toll of constant struggle. Characters will fail often, and victories will be hard-won. Death is a real possibility, and retreat is often the wisest choice. The focus is on gritty survival, not heroic fantasy.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions)

A tale of lost souls learning to survive in a harsh world while uncovering the mystery of their existence.

*   **Act I — Into the Ash (Sessions 1-3):** The party awakens with no memories in Grimhold, a frontier city constantly threatened by goblin raids. They join the Volunteer Soldier's Guild and take on dangerous jobs for meager pay, learning the brutal reality of combat where a single mistake can be fatal. They slowly bond as a team while struggling with the existential horror of not knowing who they are.
*   **Act II — Fragments of the Past (Sessions 4-6):** As the party completes contracts and survives increasingly dangerous encounters, they begin to experience vivid dreams and flashbacks of their former lives. They discover they are not the first group to awaken in Grimhold with no memories. A mysterious figure called "The Shepherd" seems to be watching them, and they learn that their arrival may be connected to an ancient ritual performed in the ruins beyond the city.
*   **Act III — The Truth in the Ruins (Sessions 7-8):** Following the trail of clues, the party ventures into the dangerous Ashen Wastes to find the source of the summoning ritual. They discover a dark truth: they are souls plucked from another world, brought here to serve as disposable soldiers in an eternal war. They must choose whether to accept their fate, find a way home, or forge a new purpose in this grim world.

## Key Locations

1.  **Grimhold City:** A grimy, medieval frontier city with high walls, cramped streets, and an atmosphere of constant anxiety. The city is divided between the relatively safe inner districts and the dangerous slums near the walls.

2.  **The Volunteer Soldier's Guild:** A fortified building where volunteers receive contracts, basic equipment, and minimal training. The atmosphere is grim and transactional.

3.  **The Riverside Inn:** A rundown but warm tavern where volunteers gather to drink, share stories, and temporarily forget their troubles. Barbara runs a tight ship.

4.  **The Ashen Wastes:** A blighted wilderness surrounding Grimhold, filled with ruins, monsters, and the ghosts of past volunteers. The ash falls like snow here.

5.  **The Forgotten Temple:** Ancient ruins deep in the wastes, covered in murals depicting the ritual that brings volunteers to this world. The air here feels wrong, saturated with old magic.

6.  **The Otherworld Gate:** A massive stone archway in the deepest ruins, crackling with unstable portal energy. This is where volunteers first arrived, though they don't remember it.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity, survival, and finding meaning in suffering. The central conflict is both external (surviving in a hostile world) and internal (coming to terms with being ripped from their past lives). The party must grapple with existential questions: Who are we if we can't remember who we were? Is survival enough, or must we find a greater purpose? Can we forge new identities and relationships in this grim world, or are we forever haunted by fragments of lives we can't fully recall?

The climax forces them to choose between several imperfect options, each with significant moral weight. There is no perfect victory, only the choice that they can live with.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Memory Fragments**
*   After significant emotional moments or near-death experiences, players may trigger a memory fragment.
*   The DM provides a brief scene or image from the character's past life—a face, a place, a feeling.
*   Gradually, players piece together who they were, though the memories are incomplete and sometimes contradictory.
*   Mechanically, recovering certain key memories can grant small bonuses (Inspiration, advantage on specific checks) as the character reconnects with their former skills or personality.

### 2. **Realistic Resting**
*   Short rests require actual downtime in a safe place with food and water, not just a quick breather.
*   Long rests require 8 hours in a secure location (like a paid inn room). Sleeping in the wilderness or dangerous areas provides no hit point recovery and limited spell slot recovery.
*   Failure to eat regularly imposes exhaustion.
*   This emphasizes the importance of managing resources and choosing battles wisely.

### 3. **Volunteer Reputation**
*   The party has a reputation score with the Volunteer Soldier's Guild based on completed contracts and behavior.
*   Higher reputation unlocks better contracts with more pay and less danger.
*   However, too much success draws unwanted attention from The Shepherd and other forces.
*   Low reputation means only the most dangerous, low-paying jobs are available.

### 4. **Brutal Critical Injuries**
*   When a character is reduced to 0 hit points, they must roll on a critical injury table.
*   Injuries can include: broken bones (disadvantage on certain checks), concussions (reduced spell save DC), trauma (disadvantage on fear saves), or scarring (permanent reminders of their struggles).
*   Injuries heal slowly and require medical attention or magical healing.
*   This reinforces that combat has lasting consequences and retreat is often wise.
