**Blood in the Water: The Aqueduct Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are hired to investigate what seems like a simple case of water rights disputes in the drought-stricken city of Ashenvale, but they quickly discover a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of government. As they dig deeper into fraudulent land deals, diverted aqueducts, and mysterious deaths, they realize that the city's water supply is being controlled by corrupt officials who profit from the people's suffering. Every lead brings them closer to a truth that powerful forces will kill to protect, and every revelation shows them that the system is too broken to fix. In the end, they must decide whether to expose the conspiracy knowing it may change nothing, or walk away from a case that has already cost them too much—because in Ashenvale, it's just the way things are.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the construction of Ashenvale's ancient aqueduct system and how it transformed the region from desert to garden.
    *   Write the history of the Blackwater family and their role in previous water crises that shaped the city's power structure.
    *   Describe the Great Drought that began five years ago and how it has reshaped Ashenvale's society and politics.
    *   Explain the evolution of water rights law and how it was corrupted over time to benefit the wealthy.
    *   Detail the Water Guild's transformation from public servants to corrupt power brokers.
    *   Write about the Dryland Exodus—the forced migration of the poor from districts where water was cut off.

        *   **Public Agenda:** We are working to solve the water crisis through private investment.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To transform Ashenvale from a diverse city into an exclusive enclave for the wealthy.

        *   **Public Agenda:** We demand fair access to water and the right to return to our homes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some elements are willing to use violence against those they see as responsible.

        *   **Relationships:** Sympathetic toward investigators; desperate for any help against the powerful.
