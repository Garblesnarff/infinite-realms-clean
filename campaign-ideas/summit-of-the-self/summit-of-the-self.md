---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Summit of the Self
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Mental Health Allegory / Journey / Personal Growth
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **10-12**
**Tone (keywords):** introspective, emotional, perseverance, confronting darkness, hope, acceptance, triumph
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party is drawn to Mount Celeste, a mystical peak said to grant clarity and peace to those who reach its summit. Each character carries their own inner demons—anxieties, depression, trauma, self-doubt—manifested as shadow selves that hunt them during the climb. As they ascend through treacherous terrain and impossibly precise challenges, they must confront their Badeline—their dark reflection—and learn that accepting their flaws is the only way to reach the top. The mountain tests not just their physical skills but their will to keep climbing when every fiber of their being screams to give up.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions)

A vertical journey of self-discovery, each chapter ascending higher while descending deeper into personal truth.

*   **Act I — The Base and First Slopes (Sessions 1-6):** The party arrives at the mountain town of Forsaken City, where they meet the caretaker who warns them of the mountain's trials. Each character begins to experience visions and manifestations of their inner struggles. The climb begins with relatively manageable challenges, but they encounter their first Badeline—a shadow self that taunts them with their deepest fears. They must learn the mountain's rhythm: precision, patience, and persistence.
*   **Act II — The Mid-Mountain Crisis (Sessions 7-12):** The party reaches treacherous areas like the Crystal Caverns and Mirror Temple, where reality bends and their Badelines grow stronger. They discover an ancient magic that allows split-second "dashes" through danger, but overuse causes mental exhaustion. One character is nearly lost to their shadow self. The party learns about a previous climber who succeeded and now maintains a mystical connection to the mountain. They must accept help and vulnerability to progress.
*   **Act III — The Summit Push (Sessions 13-18):** The final ascent through the Core and Summit requires perfect execution and complete self-acceptance. Each character must face their Badeline alone in a personal trial chamber. The revelation: their shadow selves aren't enemies but parts of themselves that need integration. By accepting their darkness as strength, they gain the power to achieve what seemed impossible. The final climb requires the party working in perfect harmony, supporting each other's weaknesses with their strengths. At the summit, they find not just peace but the power to help others climb their own mountains.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of mental health, perseverance through depression and anxiety, accepting your shadow self, and the journey being as important as the destination. It asks: Can you keep climbing when everything tells you to quit? Is your darkness truly your enemy? What does it mean to conquer yourself rather than a mountain? The central conflict is internal—each character versus their own mind—but manifested externally through the mountain's challenges and their Badeline manifestations.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Precision Platforming Challenges**
*   Combat takes a backseat to skill checks requiring exact timing and positioning
*   Climbing challenges use Dexterity (Acrobatics) with escalating DCs
*   Failure means falling and taking damage, but never instant death—you can always climb again
*   "Precision moments" require exact die rolls (hit specific DC ranges, not just meeting/beating)
*   Environmental hazards (spikes, falling blocks, wind gusts) require tactical awareness

### 2. **Celestial Dash Mechanic**
*   Characters learn to expend movement as a short-range teleport (15 feet in any direction)
*   Can dash through hazards, gaps, or obstacles that would otherwise be impassable
*   Limited uses (Proficiency bonus per short rest initially, improves with progression)
*   Dashing through danger requires skill checks
*   Can be upgraded: double-dash, directional control, dash-attack

### 3. **Stamina & Exhaustion System**
*   The climb is exhausting—physical and mental strain accumulate
*   Failed precision checks or Badeline encounters cause exhaustion levels
*   Rest spots are rare and precious
*   Must manage resources: push through or rest and risk losing momentum
*   Exhaustion also represents mental fatigue and despair

### 4. **Badeline Encounters**
*   Each character has a personal Badeline with unique abilities mirroring their own
*   Badelines know all your tactics and exploit your weaknesses
*   Cannot be permanently killed—only driven off temporarily
*   Attacks are emotional as well as physical (Wisdom saves against psychological damage)
*   Integration Trial: Succeeding on a high-DC Insight check to accept your shadow self

### 5. **Integration Powers**
*   After accepting their Badeline, characters gain "Shadow Union" abilities
*   Access to their shadow self's strength when needed
*   Temporary power boost when embracing difficult emotions rather than suppressing them
*   Badeline becomes an ally, offering advice or assistance in dire moments
*   Mechanical benefit: Advantage on saves against despair, bonus action to channel shadow strength

### 6. **Respawn System**
*   Falling or "dying" doesn't end the game—you respawn at the last checkpoint
*   Represents trying again after failure
*   Each respawn adds a mark of determination (track attempts)
*   No mechanical penalty, but emotional weight of repeated failure affects roleplay
*   Can spend determination marks for automatic success on one precision check (limited)

### 7. **Summit Dream Sequences**
*   Between sessions, characters have prophetic dreams about the summit
*   Provide hints about upcoming challenges
*   Reveal glimpses of their integrated future selves
*   Players can request to explore dream space for insight into their Badeline's fears
