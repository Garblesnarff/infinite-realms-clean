# Creative Brief: Summit of the Self

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Pixel Art Mountain Ascension with Emotional Atmosphere (Celeste-inspired)

Inspired by the precise pixel art and emotional color storytelling of *Celeste*. This style captures the verticality of mountain climbing, the stark beauty of dangerous terrain, the visual metaphor of internal struggle, and the contrast between harsh environments and moments of peace.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Verticality:** Tall frames, upward perspectives, vast drops below, emphasizing the climb's scale
*   **Precision and Danger:** Sharp spikes, narrow platforms, pixel-perfect gaps showing how unforgiving the challenges are
*   **Emotional Color Language:** Blue for calm/sadness, red/purple for anxiety/danger, golden for achievement/hope
*   **Shadow Manifestation:** Dark mirror versions of characters with distorted features and menacing presence

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Introspective, determined, emotional, precise, dangerous-yet-beautiful, perseverance, melancholic hope
*   **Feeling:** The weight of depression mixed with the spark of determination. Every step forward is hard-won. Beauty exists alongside danger. Solitude that's both lonely and peaceful.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Early Mountain:** Cool blues, grays, abandoned urban decay, misty atmosphere
*   **Mid-Mountain:** Crystalline purples and magentas, mirror reflections, golden sunset cliffs
*   **The Core:** Deep reds and oranges, pulsing energy, intense heat and pressure
*   **The Summit:** Soft pastels, cotton-candy clouds, dawn light, peaceful white snow
*   **Badeline Presence:** Deep purples, blacks with red highlights, shadowy distortion effects
*   **Prompt Example:** "...pixel art mountain scene with a cool blue and gray color palette. The ruined city at the mountain's base is covered in mist. In the foreground, a character in a light blue jacket looks up at the towering peak. Purple shadowy energy swirls behind them—their Badeline manifestation with glowing red eyes. Snow falls gently."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Main Characters:** Simple, relatable designs with distinctive clothing (jackets, climbing gear)
*   **Facial Expressions:** Range from exhausted to determined to tearfully triumphant
*   **Badeline Forms:** Dark mirror versions with sharp edges, flowing shadowy hair, aggressive postures
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young woman with shoulder-length red hair in a light blue jacket with a white hood. She carries a worn backpack with strawberry patches. Her expression is determined despite tears in her eyes. Next to her, her Badeline—a shadow version with wild purple-black hair, sharper features, glowing red eyes, and a hostile smirk. Pixel art style."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Forsaken City:** Crumbling buildings, overgrown with vines, platforms at various heights, urban decay
*   **Golden Ridge:** Sunset-lit cliffs with floating feather platforms, warm golden lighting, distant peaks
*   **Mirror Temple:** Reflective surfaces everywhere, symmetrical architecture, kaleidoscope effects
*   **The Core:** Crystalline structures, flowing magma-like energy, pulsing with heartbeat rhythm
*   **The Summit:** Above the clouds, serene mountaintop shrine, endless sky, flags from previous climbers
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art scene of a crystalline temple made of purple mirrors. The architecture is symmetrical with infinite reflections creating a kaleidoscope effect. Floating platforms with precise gaps between them. A character sees dozens of their own reflection, but some reflections have red glowing eyes—Badeline corrupted versions. Magenta and purple color scheme."

**5. Climbing Mechanics & Precision:**
*   **Platform Layouts:** Gaps that look barely jumpable, spike patterns requiring perfect timing, moving platforms
*   **Dash Visual Effects:** Character leaves a trailing after-image with motion lines, brief sparkle effect
*   **Hazards:** Red spikes, crumbling blocks about to fall, wind gusts with directional arrows
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art of a challenging climbing section. Narrow platforms separated by dangerous gaps over a bottomless pit. Red spikes line the walls. A character mid-dash, their body pixelated and translucent with a cyan trail behind them, teleporting through a gap too wide to jump normally. Tiny falling snow adds atmosphere."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High Contrast:** Deep shadows against bright sky, emphasizing height and danger
*   **Atmospheric:** Mist, clouds, snow, and wind effects add emotional weight
*   **Emotional Lighting:** Warm light represents hope and achievement, cool light represents struggle and loneliness
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit pixel art with high contrast. The character stands on a small platform with deep shadows below suggesting a massive drop. Above, clouds part to reveal golden sunlight on the distant summit. Their shadow is cast long across the platform, but the shadow has glowing red eyes—their Badeline watching from within."

## Music & Sound

A piano-driven, emotional soundtrack that shifts between melancholic exploration, tense precision challenges, and triumphant achievement. The music reflects internal emotional states—anxious rapid notes during Badeline encounters, gentle contemplative melodies at rest spots, swelling orchestral triumph at the summit. Celeste-inspired: delicate yet powerful, using electronic elements mixed with classical piano. The soundscape should make players feel both alone and determined.

## Voice

An internal monologue voice that shifts between self-doubt and determination. Sometimes whispers of anxiety ("You can't do this"), sometimes fierce resolve ("One more try"). The pacing is breathless during climbs, exhausted at failures, quietly triumphant at successes. The Badeline voice is the same but crueler, more cutting, representing the inner critic. At integration, both voices speak in harmony. Role: The voice of internal struggle and eventual self-acceptance.
