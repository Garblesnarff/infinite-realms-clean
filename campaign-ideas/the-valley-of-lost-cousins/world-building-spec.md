### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Valley of Lost Cousins**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party includes the Bone cousins—cartoony outcasts from distant Boneville who stumble into a mysterious fantasy valley cut off from the outside world. What begins as a comedic fish-out-of-water adventure gradually reveals an epic fantasy conflict: the valley is protected by ancient powers against the Locust—an ancient evil seeking to break free and consume the world.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Boneville—the cartoony city the Bones came from, why they were exiled, what it represents (normalcy, comfort, the past).
    *   Write the ancient history of the valley—the old kingdom, the war against the Locust, how it was sealed away.
    *   Describe the royal bloodline—why Thorn's family is important, what power they hold, the prophecy surrounding them.
    *   Explain the dragons—ancient beings connected to the land itself, protectors and keepers of secrets.
    *   Chronicle the Locust—what it was before corruption, how it became an ancient evil, what it wants, how it manipulates.
