# Creative Brief: The Valley of Lost Cousins

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cartoony Characters in Epic Fantasy World

Inspired by Bone's unique blend of cartoony protagonists in a richly detailed fantasy setting. The Bone cousins are simple, round cartoon characters while the valley and its inhabitants are lush, detailed fantasy illustrations.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Stylistic Contrast:** Simple, round cartoon characters (Bones) against detailed, realistic fantasy environments.
*   **Tonal Evolution:** Early sessions bright and lighthearted, later sessions darker with shadows and epic scope.
*   **Natural Beauty:** The valley is lush, alive, beautiful—worth fighting for.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic fantasy, cartoony heroes, tonal shift from light to dark, natural beauty, ancient evil, coming-of-age, found family.
*   **Feeling:** Starting with whimsy and adventure, gradually revealing epic scope and real stakes. Beauty threatened by darkness.

**2. Character Design:**
*   **The Bone Cousins:** Simple, round white characters with minimal features—think classic cartoon simplicity. Expressive despite simplicity.
*   **Valley Inhabitants:** Detailed fantasy characters—Thorn is realistically drawn, Gran'ma Ben shows age and strength, dragons are magnificent.
*   **Rat Creatures:** Detailed monsters, threatening despite occasional comedy.
*   **The Locust:** Nightmare fuel—incomprehensible, terrifying, wrong.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A simple round white cartoon character (Fone Bone) with big eyes and minimal features, standing in a lush, detailed fantasy forest. The contrast between the simple character design and the richly detailed environment is stark and intentional. Beside him stands Thorn, a realistically drawn young woman in simple farm clothes."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Early Campaign:** Bright, saturated colors—greens, blues, warm sunlight. Pastoral and inviting.
*   **Middle Campaign:** Colors remain beautiful but shadows lengthen, hints of darkness.
*   **Late Campaign:** Epic contrasts—deep shadows against brilliant light, the corruption of ghost circles (dead gray), the horror of the Locust (sickly yellows and greens).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette of rich greens and warm earth tones showing a beautiful fantasy valley in spring. Long shadows hint at approaching danger, and in the distance, a dead gray circle spreads across the landscape where nothing grows."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Lush, detailed fantasy landscapes—rolling hills, dense forests, mountain ranges, river valleys. Inspired by natural beauty.
*   **Atmosphere:** Changes from welcoming to ominous as the Locust's influence grows.
*   **Details:** Ancient ruins half-hidden in forests, dragon caves, pastoral farms, dark ancient sites.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sweeping vista of a fantasy valley—rolling green hills dotted with farms, dense forests in the distance, mountains on the horizon. Ancient stone ruins peek through the trees. The sky shifts from clear blue to gathering storm clouds. In the foreground, simple cartoon characters look out over this detailed, lush landscape."

**5. The Tone Shift:**
*   **Early Sessions:** Bright lighting, comedic situations, minimal threats.
*   **Middle Sessions:** Beautiful but danger lurks, longer shadows, hints of darkness.
*   **Late Sessions:** Epic fantasy scope—massive battles, dragon flight, cosmic horror, but still moments of beauty.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Early campaign scene: cartoon characters at a lighthearted cow race, bright sunshine, community celebration. Late campaign scene: the same valley under siege, armies of rat creatures, the sky dark with smoke, but dragons soar overhead in defiant beauty."

**6. The Locust:**
*   **Style:** Cosmic horror—multiple eyes, locusts swarm forming shapes, corruption spreading, fundamentally wrong.
*   **Purpose:** The visual opposite of the valley's beauty—death, consumption, emptiness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Lord of the Locusts manifesting—a towering figure formed from thousands of locusts, multiple glowing eyes, spreading corruption that turns vibrant landscape gray and dead. The image should evoke cosmic horror while contrasting against the valley's natural beauty."

## Voice

**Bone Cousins:** Various American accents—Fone is everyman normal, Phoney is fast-talking schemer, Smiley is dopey but warm.
**Thorn:** Strong, clear, young woman finding her voice.
**Gran'ma Ben:** Older woman, tough, hints of past nobility.
**The Great Red Dragon:** Deep, ancient, mysterious but kind.
**The Locust:** Multiple voices speaking as one, wrongness in sound itself.

## Music & Audio

*   **Early Campaign:** Light orchestral, pastoral themes, acoustic instruments, playful melodies.
*   **Middle Campaign:** Themes darken, minor keys creep in, maintaining beauty but adding tension.
*   **Late Campaign:** Full epic fantasy orchestra, choir, dramatic themes, but never losing the melodic heart.
*   **The Valley:** Nature sounds—birds, wind through trees, flowing water—gradually replaced by ominous silence as Locust approaches.
*   **The Locust:** Dissonant sounds, insect swarms, wrongness in audio form.
