# Guardians of the Aurora Gate - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Beautiful Cosmic Horror** - Aurora as both protection and prison, dimensional boundaries visible

**Colors**: Aurora spectrum (green, pink, purple, blue), stark arctic whites, Outside's impossible colors (colors that shouldn't exist)

**The Lights**: Living curtains of energy, conscious patterns, faces in aurora, watchful and ancient

**The Outside**: Visual impossibility, Escher-like, beautiful but wrong, seeing it causes sanity strain

**Guardians**: Marked by aurora exposure, slight glow, eyes reflecting northern lights, dimensional scars

## Music
- Aurora Theme: Ethereal vocals, crystalline instruments, beautiful and alien
- Guardian Theme: Nordic folk meets electronic ambient
- The Outside: Discordant beauty, sounds that shouldn't harmonize but do
- Breach Theme: Reality tearing sounds, dimensional collapse audio
- Peaceful Moments: Arctic wind, ice sounds, aurora hum (real recordings)

## Voice Acting
- Aurora Mother: Multiple voices in harmony, speaks in light patterns translated to sound
- Commander North: Weary authority, carrying cosmic burden
- Dr. Spectrum: Scientific rationality crumbling into dimensional madness
- Outsider King: Voice from impossible direction, words that mean more than they should
- Refugee from Outside: Human voice with harmonic overtones, changed by exposure

**Tagline**: "The Northern Lights Are Watching. They've Always Been Watching."

**Key Art**: Massive aurora curtain spanning sky, silhouettes of Guardians at ice station below, visible crack in aurora revealing impossible geometry beyond, faces in the lights watching
