# Creative Brief: The Thirteenth Sign

## Visual Art Direction
- Ophiuchus symbol (serpent wrapped around staff) appearing in unexpected places
- Medical/healing aesthetics mixed with serpent imagery
- Reality "glitching" to show thirteen instead of twelve
- Color scheme: Emerald green and serpent scales, mixing healing and poison

## Key Visual Elements
- **Ophiuchus:** Majestic figure wrapped in living serpents, both beautiful and threatening
- **The Erasure Effect:** History books showing twelve signs then flickering to show thirteen
- **Ghost Kingdom:** Spectral city existing between moments
- **Serpent Motifs:** Medical caduceus becoming magical focus

## Music Direction
- Main theme with thirteen notes (not twelve)
- Serpentine, sinuous melodies
- Healing hymns mixed with revenge motifs
- Growing presence of thirteenth note throughout campaign

## Voice Acting
- **Ophiuchus:** Noble but bitter, healer's compassion mixed with avenger's rage
- **Zodiac Lords:** Defensive, some guilty, some defiant
- **Ghost Kingdom spirits:** Sad, forgotten, pleading to be remembered
- **Cosmic Archivist:** Detached, academic, revealing uncomfortable truths

## Atmosphere
- Mystery thriller meets historical injustice
- Growing realization that both sides have lied
- Horror of being erased from existence
- Triumph of forgotten being remembered

## Marketing Taglines
- "There were always thirteen"
- "The zodiac lied. The serpent remembers."
- "Healing or poison? The choice is yours."
- "What happens to the forgotten?"
