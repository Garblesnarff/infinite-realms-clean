# Creative Brief: Spiral of Uzumaki

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Junji Ito's Detailed Body Horror

Inspired by the meticulous, unsettling artwork of Junji Ito, this style combines beautiful linework with deeply disturbing imagery. The spiral pattern is everywhere—gorgeous and terrible in equal measure. Body transformations are rendered in uncomfortable detail.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Detailed Line Work:** Extremely intricate, precise lines showing every disturbing detail of transformations.
*   **Spiral Motif:** The spiral pattern appears in everything—nature, architecture, bodies, compositions.
*   **Beautiful Horror:** Transformations are grotesque but rendered with aesthetic precision, making them disturbingly beautiful.
*   **Existential Wrongness:** Reality itself looks slightly off. Physics doesn't work correctly. Perspectives are wrong.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Body horror, spirals, obsession, existential dread, beautiful wrongness, Junji Ito, transformation, surreal, physics-defying.
*   **Feeling:** Something fundamental about reality is wrong. The spiral is everywhere and it's both beautiful and terrifying. Your body is not your own.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Extremely detailed black and white manga-style illustration. Every hair, every pore, every twisted bone visible.
*   **Textures:** Smooth skin becoming spiral patterns, bone showing through flesh, slime trails, impossible flexibility.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Detailed manga-style illustration in the style of Junji Ito. Extreme detail in linework. A person's body twisting into a spiral shape, bones visible beneath translucent skin, face showing ecstasy and horror simultaneously."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Primarily black and white like manga, but when color is used: pale skin tones, dark blood reds, sickly greens, the ivory of bone.
*   **The Spiral:** When highlighted, use iridescent colors—oil-slick rainbows suggesting something not quite of this world.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Black and white illustration with selective color. The spiral patterns on a transformed body shimmer with impossible iridescent colors—purples and greens that hurt to look at."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Realistic Japanese manga style. As sessions progress, spiral patterns appear on skin, bodies become more flexible, eyes gain spiral pupils.
*   **Transformed:** Various stages: snail-people (slow, slimy), twisted (bones spiraled, limbs coiled), fully consumed (body is a living spiral, barely recognizable as human).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A person in mid-transformation. Their left arm has twisted into a perfect spiral, bones spiraling outward through the skin. Their face shows a disturbing smile of bliss despite the horror. Spiral patterns are forming on their skin like tattoos appearing spontaneously."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Town:** Realistic Japanese coastal town, but spiral motifs appear everywhere—in architecture, street layouts, shadows.
*   **Transformed Spaces:** Buildings with spiraling corridors, rooms that loop impossibly, gravity following spiral patterns.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Japanese town street, but something is wrong. The road curves into a spiral. Building windows are arranged in spiral patterns. Even the trees' branches grow in spirals. Everything is too orderly, too perfect."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Heavy use of precise hatching and cross-hatching. Sharp contrasts between light and shadow. Shadows themselves may form spiral patterns.
*   **Purpose:** Detail is everything. Every transformation, every wrong angle is visible.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Manga-style shading with intricate hatching. A spiral staircase lit from above, the shadows forming perfect spiral patterns on the walls. A figure stands at the bottom, their shadow somehow spiraling in the opposite direction."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use spiral compositions—circular framing, subjects at the center of spiral patterns, perspective that curves and loops.
*   **Junji Ito Signature:** Extreme close-ups of horrified/ecstatic faces, full-body shots showing complete transformations, environment establishing shots emphasizing the wrongness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Spiral composition with the subject at the center. Concentric spiral patterns emanating outward. A transformed person stands at the center, their body a perfect spiral, arms and legs coiled around themselves, face visible at the top showing blissful acceptance."

## Voice

A quiet, matter-of-fact Japanese female voice with a Tokyo accent, speaking as if narrating a documentary about something mildly interesting rather than horrific. This disconnect between tone and content creates unease. The pacing is slow and deliberate, with pauses that let the horror sink in. Emotion is subdued—discussing body horror and cosmic wrongness in the same tone one might use to describe a pottery technique. Audio includes environmental sounds: ocean waves (that sound wrong, rhythmic in spiral patterns), wind chimes forming spiral melodies, the wet sound of transforming flesh, the scrape of bone on bone. Role: The detached observer, documenting events too strange and terrible to process emotionally, so retreating into clinical description.
