### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Shadows of Inaba**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Students in the small town of Inaba discover they can enter a parallel dimension called the Midnight Realm through television screens, where repressed psychological Shadows manifest as monsters. A serial killer throws victims into this realm, and if not rescued before the next fog, they die. Players must balance everyday life and relationship-building with investigating murders and dungeon delving, ultimately confronting a deity who tests whether humanity prefers comfortable lies or painful truths.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the mythology of Izanagi and Izanami from Japanese legend and how it relates to the Midnight Realm.
    *   Write the history of how the Midnight Realm was created as a reflection of humanity's collective unconscious.
    *   Describe the nature of Shadows - repressed aspects of the self that become monsters when denied.
    *   Explain how Personas are Shadows that have been accepted and integrated, becoming inner strength.
    *   Detail the legend of the Midnight Channel and how it became an urban legend in Inaba.
    *   Write the backstory of how Izanami granted select humans the power to access the Midnight Realm.
    *   Describe the Velvet Room and Igor's purpose as a guide for those with the Wild Card ability.
    *   Explain the nature of the fog - when it appears, victims trapped in the Midnight Realm die as their Shadows consume them.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below.
*   **Factions Roster:**

        *   **Goals:** Solve the serial murders, rescue victims from the Midnight Realm, discover the truth.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal leader - decisions made collectively, though one PC may emerge as the "leader" Wild Card.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Appear as normal students and workers; no one knows about their secret activities.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Enter TVs to access the Midnight Realm and save kidnapping victims before the fog comes.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to access the Midnight Realm, Personas, Teddie's guidance, growing Social Links.

    *   **The Shadows** (Major - Antagonistic)
        *   **Goals:** Exist as manifestations of repressed human psychology; consume their "originals" if not accepted.

*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players correctly identify a Midnight Channel victim before the deadline.
    *   **THEN:** They have time to complete that person's dungeon and save them, adding them as a Social Link and potential party member.
    *   **IF:** Players fail to rescue a victim before the fog deadline.
    *   **THEN:** That victim is found dead, the town's fear increases, and the players lose a potential Social Link permanently.
    *   **IF:** A victim rejects their Shadow during confrontation.
    *   **THEN:** The Shadow goes berserk (powered-up boss fight). If defeated this way, the victim survives but doesn't gain a Persona.
    *   **IF:** A victim accepts their Shadow.
    *   **THEN:** The Shadow transforms into their Persona peacefully (or after a weaker symbolic battle), and they become empowered and grateful.
    *   **IF:** Players max a party member's Social Link.
    *   **THEN:** That character unlocks their ultimate Persona evolution and a capstone character scene resolving their arc.
    *   **IF:** Players identify the wrong person as the killer.
    *   **THEN:** The real killer continues, potentially taking Nanako as a victim to raise the stakes.
    *   **IF:** Players max the Jester/Hunger Social Link with the killer before discovering their identity.
    *   **THEN:** Unlock special dialogue and insight into the killer's psychology during confrontation.
    *   **IF:** Players defeat the killer but don't discover Izanami's involvement.
    *   **THEN:** Bad ending - the case seems closed but the Midnight Realm remains, and the true threat goes unchallenged.
    *   **IF:** Players' combined Social Link levels are high during the final battle.
    *   **THEN:** Friends appear to support them, providing buffs, healing, and enabling the ultimate Persona evolution for the final attack.
    *   **IF:** Players choose to accept Izanami's offer of a comfortable false world.
    *   **THEN:** Bad ending - Inaba becomes peaceful but the truth is buried and the players lose their memories of events.
    *   **IF:** Players reject Izanami's offer and fight for truth.
    *   **THEN:** True ending - defeat the goddess, seal the Midnight Realm, save Inaba, but must eventually leave their bonds behind.
