# Creative Brief: Shadows of Inaba

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Stylish Modern Mystery (Persona 4-inspired)

Inspired by the vibrant, stylish aesthetic of *Persona 4*, blending mundane small-town Japan with psychedelic horror, bold graphic design, and a distinctive yellow color scheme. This style aims to capture the mystery, psychological depth, hopeful tone, and slice-of-life meets horror atmosphere of "Shadows of Inaba."

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Style and Contrast:** Juxtapose the mundane (school hallways, shopping districts) with the surreal (twisted Shadow dungeons, Midnight Channel imagery).
*   **Bold Graphics:** Use sharp, clean designs with strong typography, silhouettes, and the iconic yellow-and-black color scheme.
*   **Duality of Self:** Show characters alongside their Personas or Shadows, representing inner truth versus outer appearance.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Mystery, psychological, stylish, hopeful, surreal, modern, small-town, shadow-self, fog, television, truth-seeking.
*   **Feeling:** A contemporary mystery with supernatural elements. The atmosphere balances everyday life (school, friends, part-time jobs) with psychological horror (repressed desires manifesting as monsters). Stylish and cool despite dealing with heavy themes.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, anime-inspired character designs with sharp edges and confident linework. Modern fashion sense. Personas have more elaborate, mythological designs.
*   **Textures:** Realistic for the real world (school uniforms, storefronts), surreal and distorted for the Midnight Realm (melting walls, flesh-like surfaces, impossible geometry).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A stylish anime illustration. The focus is on a high school student in a gakuran uniform standing confidently, with a massive armored warrior Persona looming behind them in a heroic pose."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by yellow and black for key imagery (menus, UI elements, dramatic moments). Real world uses natural, muted colors - gray skies, green rice paddies, warm indoor lighting. Midnight Realm uses vibrant, clashing colors - neon pinks, toxic greens, deep purples.
*   **Fog and TV Effects:** Yellow-tinted fog, static and scan lines for television-related imagery.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered with a bold yellow and black color scheme for the graphic elements, while the background shows a foggy small-town street in muted grays and browns. Yellow caution tape frames the composition."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Modern anime teenagers in school uniforms, casual wear, or part-time job outfits. Each character has a signature color and style. Personas are larger-than-life mythological or historical figures manifesting their inner truth.
*   **Expression:** Characters express personality through poses and fashion. Shadows are grotesque, exaggerated versions representing repressed aspects.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A teenage girl in a red kimono-style dress with traditional inn-keeper aesthetics, standing beside her Persona - a massive phoenix princess in flowing robes with fire motifs."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Real world: realistic small-town Japan - shopping districts, high school, riverbanks, family restaurants. Midnight Realm: surreal dungeons themed around victims' psyches (castle, bathhouse, laboratory, heaven).
*   **Atmosphere:** Real world feels lived-in and nostalgic. Midnight Realm is psychedelic horror - warped perspectives, disturbing symbolism, physical manifestations of psychological concepts.
*   **Details:** Real world: vending machines, telephone poles, TV screens. Midnight Realm: eyes in the walls, distorted faces, symbolic imagery (chains, cages, mirrors).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A surreal dungeon interior representing repressed masculinity - a steamy bathhouse with rose motifs, heart decorations, impossibly tall ceilings, and shadows moving on their own. The perspective is slightly warped and dreamlike."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting. Real world uses natural lighting with occasional dramatic shadows. Midnight Realm uses theatrical lighting - spotlights, colored gels, shadows that defy physics.
*   **Special Effects:** TV static overlays, scan lines, yellow fog effects, Persona summons with shattering glass/card effects, All-Out Attack cutins with bold graphic design.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the duality - warm and natural for human connections, harsh and unnatural for Shadow confrontations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a harsh spotlight from above, creating deep shadows on the character's face as they face their Shadow. Yellow fog swirls at the edges, and television static distorts the background."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Stylish, manga-panel inspired compositions. Use of negative space, bold framing, and graphic elements. Character cutins for dramatic moments. Wide shots for the small-town atmosphere, tight shots for psychological intensity.
*   **Techniques:** Use framing devices (TV screens, door frames, windows) to isolate characters. Reflection and mirror imagery to show duality. Bold typography for emphasis.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A stylish composition split down the middle. Left side: a normal teenager in their school uniform in a mundane hallway. Right side: the same person in battle gear, summoning their Persona in the Midnight Realm. Yellow and black graphic elements frame both sides."

## Voice

A warm, friendly voice with hints of mystery and melancholy, like a narrator recounting a bittersweet memory. The pacing is conversational yet thoughtful, building tension during investigations and softening during Social Link moments. The emotion balances hope and determination with an undercurrent of psychological depth. Audio quality is clear with a slight vintage quality, as if broadcast through an old television. Role: The voice of the Midnight Channel announcer or a narrator reflecting on that formative year in Inaba.
