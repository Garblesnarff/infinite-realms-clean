**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Comedy / Reverse Isekai / Slice-of-Life Adventure
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 7-8 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **10** → Finish **14**

**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
After a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Hero Emilia, the Demon Lord Maou and his loyal generals are forced to flee through a collapsing magical portal. They emerge not in another fantasy realm, but in modern-day New York City, stripped of most of their powers and trapped in mortal forms. To survive in this baffling world of rent, jobs, and smartphones, the once-feared Dark Lord must take a job at McRonald's fast food restaurant while plotting his return to power. But as they adapt to mundane life—dealing with difficult customers, paying bills, and navigating human relationships—the party begins to question whether conquest is truly their destiny.

## Difficulty Context

**Light** - This campaign emphasizes role-playing, comedy, and character development over combat. Challenges are more about adapting to modern life and resolving conflicts through creative solutions rather than violence. The tone is lighthearted, and failure often leads to humorous situations rather than dire consequences.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 7-8 sessions)

A fish-out-of-water comedy about villains learning to be human.

*   **Act I — Culture Shock (Sessions 1-3):** The party (former demon lord and generals) arrives in New York City with no money, no identification, and no understanding of how this world works. They must find shelter, acquire legal documentation through questionable means, and secure employment to afford basic necessities. The once-mighty Demon Lord becomes a shift manager at McRonald's, while his generals take on equally mundane roles. Their attempts to apply fantasy logic to modern problems result in hilarious mishaps.
*   **Act II — Minimum Wage Warriors (Sessions 4-6):** As the party settles into their new lives, they face challenges both mundane (dealing with terrible customers, making rent, understanding human emotions) and supernatural (they discover magic still exists in this world, hidden beneath the surface). The Hero Emilia arrives in pursuit, but she's just as powerless and confused as they are. Former enemies must cooperate to survive, leading to awkward alliances and personal growth. The party slowly builds a life worth living, making friends and finding purpose beyond conquest.
*   **Act III — The Return Question (Sessions 7-8):** The party discovers a way to restore their powers and return to their fantasy realm—but it requires them to abandon everything they've built in the modern world. They must decide: reclaim their throne and resume the war, or embrace their new lives as ordinary (mostly) people? Meanwhile, a new threat emerges from the fantasy world, and the party realizes they're the only ones who can stop it, even without their full powers.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Fall from Grace"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Comedy Setup
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Opening flashback: The party as feared demon generals laying siege to the Hero's fortress.
    *   The Hero Emilia forces them through a collapsing portal. They emerge in a filthy New York alley.
    *   Reality sets in: They're powerless (10th level instead of 20th), have no money, and don't understand cars, electricity, or modern language.
    *   They attempt to acquire food and shelter using intimidation—it fails hilariously.
    *   A kind homeless person explains the basics: "You need money. Money requires a job."
*   **Escalation:** Night falls, it starts raining, and they have nowhere to sleep. The Demon Lord declares, "I will conquer this... 'apartment rental market.'"

### Session 2 — "The McRonald's Gambit"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party forges documents using minor magic and applies for jobs.
    *   Demon Lord Maou gets hired at McRonald's after an unexpectedly successful interview (his intimidating presence reads as "management material").
    *   His generals land various jobs: retail, delivery, construction, etc.
    *   Training montage of the Demon Lord learning to make burgers and operate the cash register.
    *   First shift: Everything that can go wrong does. They treat customers like enemy combatants and workplace mishaps like combat encounters.

    *   They navigate grocery shopping, cooking, and budgeting with varying success.
    *   A mysterious magical disturbance occurs at McRonald's—food starts floating, customers hear whispers.
    *   The party investigates and discovers residual magic from their own arrival is causing havoc.
    *   They must contain it without revealing their true nature to humans.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hero Emilia tracks them down, bursting into McRonald's with her holy sword (now significantly less powerful).
    *   Epic confrontation... is interrupted by the lunch rush. Both sides are too powerless to risk a real fight.
    *   Awkward standoff over burgers. Emilia is also broke and struggling to adapt.
    *   They declare a truce: defeat means nothing if they all starve in this weird world.
    *   Emilia takes a job at a rival chain, setting up workplace rivalry.
*   **Escalation:** The magical disturbances are increasing. Something is draining magic from their world into this one.

### Session 5-6 — "The Hidden City"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party discovers an underground community of magical beings hiding in New York: fey merchants, cursed nobles, exiled mages.
    *   They learn about the "Veil"—magic that hides the supernatural from ordinary humans.
    *   A powerful entity called the Magister controls magic in this realm and doesn't appreciate newcomers.
    *   The party must negotiate with the Magister for the right to stay and access to magical resources.
    *   Meanwhile, they're balancing their mundane jobs, budgets, and growing attachments to human friends.

### Sessions 7-8 — "Worlds in Balance"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The source of the leaks is revealed: a rogue demon general is trying to tear open a portal to invade the modern world.
    *   The party must stop them using a combination of their remaining powers and modern ingenuity.
    *   Epic battle in Times Square, hidden from humans by the Veil, mixing magic and mundane tactics.
    *   After victory, a stable portal is found—they can go home and reclaim their power.
    *   The party must choose: return to war and conquest, or stay in this world where they've found purpose, friends, and maybe even happiness.
*   **Escalation:** Whatever they choose, they realize they've changed. Conquest seems hollow compared to the life they've built.

## Key Locations

1.  **McRonald's (Times Square Location):** A bustling fast-food restaurant where the Demon Lord works. Gleaming, noisy, and perpetually crowded. The party's "throne room" is the break room.

2.  **Sasazuka Apartment:** A cramped, aging apartment building where the party lives. Thin walls, temperamental heating, but it's home.

3.  **The Night Market:** A hidden supernatural bazaar that appears in Central Park after midnight. Fey merchants sell magical goods, and information flows freely.

4.  **The Veil Nexus:** A secret chamber beneath the New York Public Library where the Magister maintains the barrier between mundane and magical.

5.  **Emilia's Studio Apartment:** A tiny, barely-furnished space where the Hero lives in near-poverty, a stark contrast to her former glory.

6.  **Times Square (Battlefield):** The neon-lit heart of Manhattan becomes the site of the final magical battle, hidden from mundane eyes by the Veil.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity, redemption, and finding purpose beyond power. The central conflict is internal: can people defined by conquest and violence learn to find meaning in ordinary life? The party must grapple with who they are when stripped of their grand destinies. Are they monsters playing at being human, or are they discovering their true selves for the first time?

The external conflict—stopping the magical leaks and the rogue general—serves as a catalyst for this internal journey. The climax offers a clear choice: return to their old lives of power and war, or embrace their new, humbler existence. The campaign suggests that true strength lies not in domination, but in choosing kindness and connection.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Daily Grind**
*   Between adventure sessions, the party must manage their mundane lives using a simple minigame.
*   Each character has a "Stability Score" representing their job performance, finances, and social connections.
*   Successfully completing work shifts, paying bills, and maintaining relationships increases Stability.
*   High Stability provides benefits: extra money for magic items, allies who help in crises, advantage on social checks.
*   Low Stability creates problems: eviction, job loss, isolation, disadvantage on checks.

### 2. **Power Deprivation**
*   The party starts at 10th level instead of their former 20th, representing their weakened state.
*   Certain powerful abilities are "locked" and can only be used by spending precious magic reserves.
*   Magic is recovered slowly through rest or by visiting the Night Market.
*   This encourages creative problem-solving using mundane skills rather than relying on overwhelming power.

### 3. **The Veil Mechanic**
*   When supernatural events occur in public, the party must make checks to maintain the Veil (hide magic from mundane observers).
*   Failed checks attract attention: police, media, or worse—the Magister's enforcers.
*   Success allows them to operate covertly and maintain their civilian identities.
*   Some challenges require balancing "do we use magic and risk exposure, or handle this mundanely?"

### 4. **Redemption Tokens**
*   When party members perform genuinely selfless or kind acts (protecting coworkers, helping strangers, choosing compassion over ruthlessness), they earn Redemption Tokens.
*   These can be spent for powerful narrative benefits: automatic success on key rolls, turning enemies into allies, or unlocking character growth moments.
*   The number of tokens the party accumulates influences the campaign's ending and their final choice.
