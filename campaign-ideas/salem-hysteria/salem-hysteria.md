# Salem Hysteria

*A Paranoia Horror Campaign — Short Campaign (6-8 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Salem Hysteria
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Paranoid Horror / Social Thriller / Witch Hunt
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6-8 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **5**
**Tone (keywords):** paranoid, accusatory, claustrophobic, puritan, hysterical
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are residents of Salem Village in 1692 when a few young girls' accusations of witchcraft spiral into mass hysteria that tears the community apart through paranoid accusations, spectral evidence, and judicial murder. As farmers, merchants, clergy, and accused, they must navigate a world where any enemy can denounce anyone as a witch, where defending the accused makes you suspect, and where Puritan extremism has created a system that demands constant confessions to avoid execution. The campaign explores how rational people succumb to mass hysteria, the horror of legal systems run by paranoia, and whether there's escape from accusation once the witch hunt begins. This is Salem—where heroes must choose between their integrity and their lives.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Afflicted Girls"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Signs
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Young girls in Salem Village begin showing strange behavior: fits, screaming, contortions.
    *   The Puritan community interprets this through religious lens: witchcraft or demonic possession.
    *   The first accusations are made against social outsiders: a beggar, a slave, a woman who doesn't conform.
**Escalation:** The accused confess under pressure, naming others as witches to save themselves. The chain begins.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Spectral Evidence"
*   **Focus:** Legal Horror / Impossible Defense
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The trials accept "spectral evidence"—victims claiming they see the accused's spirit tormenting them.
    *   There's no defense against spectral evidence; denial proves guilt, confession saves you if you name others.
    *   Players witness neighbors they've known for years accused based on grudges, property disputes, or fear.
**Escalation:** The hysteria spreads beyond social outsiders. Respected community members are accused.

### Sessions 4-5 — "Touch Test and Swimming"
*   **Focus:** Witch Test Horror / Accusation Spreads
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Bizarre "tests" are used: if the accused touches the afflicted and fits stop, it proves guilt.
    *   Anyone who defends the accused or questions the trials becomes suspect themselves.
    *   Players must choose: participate in madness, stay silent, or risk being accused for defending victims.
**Escalation:** One or more players are accused of witchcraft based on old grudges, jealousy, or simply being in the wrong place.

### Sessions 6-7 — "The Hanging Hill"
*   **Focus:** Executions / Point of No Return
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Those who refuse to confess are hanged. Confessors who name others are spared to testify against new accused.
    *   Players watch innocent people die while guilty confessors live—the system rewards lies.
    *   The hysteria reaches its peak: ministers' wives are accused, anyone could be next.
**Escalation:** The accused players must choose: confess falsely and name others, maintain innocence and hang, or somehow escape.

### Session 8 — "The Madness Ends"
*   **Focus:** Resolution / Aftermath
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The hysteria collapses when accusations reach too high—the governor's wife is accused and he ends the trials.
    *   Survivors emerge to a shattered community. Many innocent died. False accusers go unpunished.
    *   The campaign ends with the question: How did rational people create this horror? Could it happen again?
**Escalation:** Years later, some participants publicly apologize. Others never admit wrongdoing. Salem remains haunted.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores mass hysteria, paranoid accusation, and the horror of legal systems corrupted by fear. The central conflict is surviving in a community where anyone can accuse anyone of witchcraft without proof, where defending the accused makes you suspect, and where the only escape is false confession that requires naming others. Players must navigate impossible choices between integrity and survival, between helping the innocent and protecting themselves, and between rational skepticism that may get them killed and playing along with madness. The campaign asks: How do rational people create mass hysteria? Why does fear destroy community bonds? Can you resist communal madness without being destroyed? And what's the cost of survival through participation in evil? The answer: Salem teaches that accusation without proof, fear overriding reason, and social pressure for conformity can turn neighbors into executioners.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Suspicion Tracker**
*   Every action that seems unusual, defending accused, or questioning trials increases Suspicion.
*   High Suspicion makes players vulnerable to accusation.
*   Players must balance moral action against survival.

### 2. **The Confession Dilemma**
*   If accused, players choose: confess falsely (and name others), maintain innocence (and hang), or flee (and confirm guilt).
*   Confession saves you but spreads hysteria by requiring you to accuse others.
*   This mechanic shows the impossible moral choices Salem created.

### 3. **Spectral Evidence**
*   Accusers claim to see players' spirits tormenting them in dreams and visions.
*   There's no defense—denying it proves guilt (witches lie), confessing confirms it.
*   This reinforces the horror of Salem's legal system.

### 4. **Community Fracture**
*   Track how Salem's social bonds collapse under accusation.
*   Old grudges become witch accusations; property disputes become spectral evidence.
*   The campaign shows how fear destroys community.

### 5. **The Aftermath**
*   Track who survived, who died, who confessed, who accused.
*   The epilogue shows the long-term consequences: broken community, unpunished accusers, survivors' guilt.
*   Players see whether they maintained integrity or participated in the horror.
