# Creative Brief: Salem Hysteria

## Art Style: Puritan Horror (The Crucible meets The VVitch)

Inspired by the paranoid intensity of *The Crucible* and the folk horror of *The VVitch*. This style captures Puritan austerity, communal paranoia, and the horror of witch hunt hysteria.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Claustrophobia:** Small village, everyone watching everyone, no escape.
*   **Puritan Aesthetic:** Black clothing, stern faces, religious severity, communal judgment.
*   **Hysteria Visualization:** Show the escalating madness through body language and expressions.

### Color Palette:
Puritan blacks and grays, New England autumn colors, courtroom wood browns, the stark white of accusers' fits, blood red of execution.

### Character Design:
Puritan clothing (severe, black, modest), afflicted girls showing dramatic fits, accused showing fear and dignity, judges showing certainty and coldness.

## Voice

A voice capturing the paranoid intensity and tragic inevitability of Salem. Respectful of genuine Puritan faith while horrified by its extremism. The narrator speaks with claustrophobic tension—everyone is watching, anyone could be next. Audio: Puritan prayers, accusatory shouting, courtroom proceedings, hanging rope, communal fear.
