# Clockwork Elemental
*When steam meets spirit, innovation ignites revolution*

## Campaign Overview

In a world where the four nations (Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, Air Nomads) are entering an industrial revolution, ancient elemental bending is being augmented—and threatened—by clockwork technology. The party lives in Republic City, a melting pot where bending meets machinery, where traditional monks clash with engineers, and where a new type of power is emerging: those who can bend metal, lightning, and blood itself.

When industrialist Hiroshi Sato unveils mecha-suits that let non-benders match elemental masters, the delicate balance shatters. The Equalist movement rises, demanding equality between benders and non-benders. The party must navigate this revolution while uncovering a conspiracy: a secret society is weaponizing the spirit world itself, creating machines powered by captured spirits. The campaign explores themes of progress vs. tradition, equality vs. hierarchy, and whether technology that replaces magic dooms or saves the world.

## Core Themes

- **Progress vs. Tradition**: Industrialization threatening spiritual balance
- **Equality vs. Privilege**: Non-benders demanding rights benders take for granted
- **Technology vs. Magic**: Can they coexist or must one dominate?
- **Spirit World Balance**: Modernization damaging sacred connections
- **Found Family**: Diverse team overcoming cultural divisions
