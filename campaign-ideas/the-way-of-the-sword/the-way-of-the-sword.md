# The Way of the Sword
*Walk the path of Japan's greatest swordsman—from ronin duelist to enlightened strategist*

## Campaign Overview

Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), Japan's most famous swordsman, fought 60+ duels undefeated, developed the two-sword Niten Ichi-ryū style, and wrote *The Book of Five Rings*. This campaign follows his journey from brutal duelist to enlightened warrior-philosopher, exploring themes of mastery, obsession, legacy, and the difference between killing and true victory.

The party are fellow ronin (masterless samurai), students, rivals, and companions on Musashi's *musha shugyō* (warrior pilgrimage). Together, they'll fight legendary duels, navigate Sengoku/Edo period Japan, participate in major battles, study multiple martial and artistic disciplines, and ultimately transcend mere swordsmanship to achieve strategic and spiritual enlightenment.

This is a campaign about perfecting one's craft, questioning what victory means, and transforming from weapon to artist. Combat is precise, deadly, and philosophical. Every duel is a statement about character, not just skill.

## Core Themes

- **Mastery Through Discipline**: 10,000 hours make expert; lifetime makes master
- **Victory Without Fighting**: Ultimate skill is making combat unnecessary
- **Ronin Identity**: Masterless freedom vs. societal rejection
- **Art of War**: Strategy transcends swordsmanship
- **Legacy Over Glory**: Teaching lasts longer than reputation
- **Enlightenment Through Combat**: Zen in the midst of death
