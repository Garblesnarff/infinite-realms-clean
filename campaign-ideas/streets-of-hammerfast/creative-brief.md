# Creative Brief: Streets of Hammerfast

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Urban Realism / Documentary Aesthetic (The Wire-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty, documentary-style realism of *The Wire*. This style aims to capture the institutional decay, street-level struggle, and moral complexity of a city failing its people at every level.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Unflinching Realism:** Describe scenes with documentary authenticity—decaying buildings, real poverty, institutional spaces that feel bureaucratic and worn.
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Visual storytelling should reveal character through environment—a detective's cluttered desk, a corner boy's cheap equipment, a politician's staged photo op.
*   **The City as Character:** Hammerfast itself is a protagonist—its decay, its rhythms, its failures are central to every scene.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Urban decay, institutional failure, moral complexity, systemic corruption, gritty realism, interconnected systems, street-level struggle.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense that the problems are too big, too entrenched. Hope exists in individuals, not systems. The atmosphere is heavy with the weight of broken promises.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic, documentary quality. Clean, unromanticized depictions of urban poverty and institutional spaces.
*   **Forms:** Buildings are real and worn—cracked facades, boarded windows, graffiti. People show the wear of hard lives—tired faces, practical clothing.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic urban scene showing a row of decaying tenement buildings. Cracked brick, boarded windows, faded gang tags on walls. In the foreground, a group of young men stand on a corner, watching the street. The atmosphere is tense, watchful, real."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated, realistic urban colors—grays, browns, faded reds from brick buildings. Winter scenes are cold and harsh. Summer scenes are dusty and hot.
*   **Contrast:** Institutional spaces (police stations, city hall) use fluorescent lighting and beige/gray bureaucratic palettes. The streets have more color but it's faded, worn.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted, realistic color palette of urban grays and browns. A hot summer day with dusty streets. The colors are faded, sun-bleached, reflecting the city's decay."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic human proportions, characters dressed in authentic urban clothing—police uniforms, street wear, business suits for politicians.
*   **Aging and Wear:** Characters show the physical toll of their lives—detectives with tired eyes, street dealers with old scars, politicians with practiced smiles.
*   **Diversity:** The city is diverse—different races, backgrounds, and perspectives are represented authentically.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A middle-aged detective in rumpled business casual attire—cheap tie loosened, dress shirt wrinkled, badges clipped to belt. His face shows exhaustion and cynicism, but his eyes are sharp. He sits at a cluttered desk covered in case files and cold coffee."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Authentic urban spaces—police station bullpens, street corners with makeshift markets, decaying high-rise projects, city hall chambers, dockyard warehouses.
*   **Atmosphere:** Every location tells a story of institutional failure or survival despite it.
*   **Details:** Wiretap equipment, case boards with photos and string, abandoned buildings, political campaign signs, graffiti memorials to the dead.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cramped police Major Crimes office. Desks cluttered with files, a large evidence board on the wall covered in surveillance photos connected by string, old coffee cups, fluorescent lighting, institutional beige walls. The space feels underfunded and overcrowded."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, realistic lighting. Harsh fluorescent lights in institutional spaces, natural street lighting, shadows that hide crime and surveillance.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reveals the unglamorous truth—there's no cinematic beauty in a wiretap room or a crime scene.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh fluorescent office lighting that casts no dramatic shadows, only the stark reality of bureaucratic space. A detective reviews evidence under this unflattering light."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Documentary-style framing. Wide shots of urban landscapes to show context, medium shots of conversations and confrontations, close-ups that reveal character through expression.
*   **Techniques:** Use of surveillance camera angles, views through car windows during stakeouts, overhead shots showing how individuals fit into larger systems.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot from an elevated position showing a street corner in a poor neighborhood. Young dealers stand in formation, lookouts at either end. Pedestrians navigate around them. The composition shows the territorial control and the routine normality of the drug trade."

## Voice

A measured, observational voice that speaks with the authority of someone who has seen everything and believes nothing will change. The tone is that of a world-weary narrator recounting not a story but a documented reality. There's no judgment, only observation. The voice is mature, male or female, with a slight urban accent. It doesn't sensationalize—it simply reports. When describing institutional failure, there's a heaviness, almost resignation. When describing individual acts of dignity or defiance, there's a quiet respect. Role: The voice of the city itself, or a journalist who has covered these streets for decades.
