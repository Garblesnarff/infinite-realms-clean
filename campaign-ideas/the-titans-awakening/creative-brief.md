# Creative Brief: The Titans Awakening

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Apocalyptic Kaiju Realism

Inspired by the monumental scale and devastating beauty of Godzilla films, particularly the 2014 Legendary Pictures interpretation. This style emphasizes the terrifying majesty of colossal creatures, the fragility of human civilization, and the awe-inspiring devastation of forces beyond comprehension.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Destruction:** Always show the massive size difference between Titans and human structures. Include environmental devastation—crumbling buildings, tidal waves, volcanic eruptions.
*   **Ground-Level Perspective:** Frame many scenes from the human eye level, looking up at the towering Titans to emphasize their god-like scale.
*   **Elemental Power:** Titans should visually embody their elements—Scorathyx wreathed in flames and magma, Leviathax dripping with torrential water and covered in barnacles and ancient coral.
*   **Disaster Aesthetics:** Show the aftermath and active destruction—fires, floods, panicked crowds, military futility.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Apocalyptic, awe-inspiring, desperate, monumental, elemental fury, disaster, humanity's insignificance, pyrrhic struggle.
*   **Feeling:** A mixture of terror and wonder. The world is ending, but it's beautiful and terrible. The tone is serious and grounded, not campy.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic with an emphasis on texture. Titans should have organic, naturalistic forms—rough stone, dripping water, crackling flame—rather than smooth or mechanical designs.
*   **Forms:** Titans are massive and animalistic, often quadrupedal or serpentine. Their bodies show geological age—cracks, moss, barnacles, embedded debris.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic illustration of Scorathyx, a 300-foot tall creature of molten stone and magma. Its body is craggy and textured like cooled lava, with rivers of glowing orange magma flowing through cracks. Its eyes are deep wells of fire."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dark, muted, and earthy for environments (grays, browns, dark blues). Titans are the primary source of vibrant color—glowing oranges and reds for Scorathyx, deep blues and greens for Leviathax.
*   **Contrast:** The glow of the Titans against the dark, devastated landscape creates dramatic visual focus.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of ash-gray ruins and dark storm clouds, illuminated by the intense orange glow of Scorathyx's molten body and the fires spreading across the city."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Small, vulnerable, clad in practical military gear or civilian clothing. Often shown in silhouette against the Titans. Expressions of terror, determination, or exhausted resolve.
*   **Titans:** Each Titan is a unique creature, visually distinct:
    *   **Scorathyx:** A massive, reptilian creature of volcanic stone with glowing magma seams and a ridge of jagged obsidian spines.
    *   **Leviathax:** A serpentine, whale-like creature covered in ancient coral and dripping with seawater, with multiple pairs of clawed flippers.
    *   **Thermagox:** A titanic, almost dragon-like beast with crystalline formations across its body and an aura of reality-distorting energy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A ground-level shot of a soldier in tattered uniform, backlit by explosions, staring up in horror at Scorathyx's massive, clawed foot descending toward the camera."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Devastated urban landscapes, collapsing buildings, military installations, and natural disasters. Ruins should show realistic destruction—partial collapses, fires, flooding.
*   **Details:** Abandoned vehicles, fleeing crowds, military checkpoints, emergency lights, debris clouds, ash falling like snow.
*   **Natural Zones:** Volcanic regions with rivers of lava, stormy coastlines with massive waves, the World's Wound with shimmering, unstable magical energy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Highcrest, a gleaming fantasy metropolis, with half the city ablaze and collapsing as Scorathyx wades through its streets. Military forces fire futile spells and ballista at the creature. Civilians flee in the foreground."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting. The Titans are primary light sources—glowing from within with elemental energy. Environments are often backlit by fires, explosions, or ominous storm light.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, oppressive shadows to emphasize the scale of the Titans and the darkness of the situation.
*   **Weather Effects:** Ash clouds, smoke, rain, and mist are common, creating atmospheric depth and adding to the disaster aesthetic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the glow of Scorathyx's radioactive breath, a cone of superheated plasma that illuminates the entire battlefield in harsh orange light, casting long shadows of fleeing soldiers."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use of forced perspective to emphasize scale. Wide, cinematic shots for Titan action, tight, claustrophobic shots for human survival moments.
*   **Techniques:** Frame Titans in the background towering over the action. Use foreground elements (destroyed buildings, fleeing people) to create depth. Low-angle shots looking up at Titans. High-angle shots showing the scope of destruction.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle, wide shot with a destroyed tank in the foreground, soldiers running across the mid-ground, and Scorathyx's full body towering in the background, its mouth opening to unleash its atomic breath."

## Voice

A deep, gravelly male voice with a documentary narrator's tone, delivering lines with somber gravity and restrained intensity. The standard American accent carries the weight of witnessing something both terrible and magnificent, with a pacing that is slow and deliberate, allowing the horror to sink in. The emotion is a mixture of awe and dread, with an undercurrent of resigned determination. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle ambient rumble suggesting distant destruction. Role: A survivor recounting the Titan crisis, or a military briefing officer delivering devastating news.
