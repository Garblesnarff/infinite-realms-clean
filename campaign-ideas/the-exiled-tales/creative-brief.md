# Creative Brief: The Exiled Tales

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Fairy Tale Noir Meets Urban Fantasy

Inspired by Fables' blend of classic fairy tale imagery with gritty modern New York, this style juxtaposes timeless storybook characters against contemporary urban environments. Think iconic fairy tale figures in modern dress, magical realism in city streets, and the contrast between legendary status and mundane reality.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Fairy Tales in Modern Dress:** Classic characters recognizable by key features but dressed and living contemporary.
*   **Hidden Magic:** Magical elements concealed within or bleeding through mundane urban settings.
*   **Class Contrast:** Visual distinction between wealthy and poor Fables, luxury and struggle.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Fairy tale noir, urban fantasy, hidden community, political intrigue, immortals in disguise, dark fairy tales, New York setting.
*   **Feeling:** The uncanny mix of legendary and ordinary. Immortals buying coffee, Big Bad Wolf as a detective, Snow White in business attire. Magic hidden in plain sight.

**2. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Fairy tale characters made contemporary but still iconic. Bigby Wolf is a tall, rough man in a rumpled coat with predatory eyes. Snow White is professionally dressed but radiates regal bearing.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tall, rough-featured man in his 40s wearing a worn detective's coat over casual clothes. His eyes are unnaturally yellow and predatory, his teeth slightly too sharp. This is the Big Bad Wolf as a modern urban detective. He stands on a New York street corner, smoking, everything about him suggesting barely contained danger."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Fabletown Scenes:** Urban New York—grays, browns, brick reds, with occasional pops of fairy tale color (red capes, golden hair, enchanted objects glowing softly).
*   **Homelands Scenes:** Full fairy tale palette—deep forest greens, castle grays, magical golds and silvers, ominous dark purples for the Empire.

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Fabletown:** Realistic New York City streets, brownstones, apartments, with subtle magical details for those who look closely.
*   **The Farm:** Rural upstate property with magical creatures trying to live normal lives.
*   **The Homelands:** Classic fairy tale kingdoms—castles, enchanted forests, magical palaces—now occupied and militarized.

**5. Visual Contrasts:**
*   Juxtapose storybook characters with mundane modern activities
*   Show glamoured appearances versus true forms
*   Contrast The Woodland luxury with poor Fables' struggles

## Voice

Multiple voices for diverse characters:
- **Bigby:** Gruff male voice, film noir detective tone, world-weary but sharp.
- **Snow White:** Professional female voice, controlled, hints of deep exhaustion beneath competence.
- **Narrator:** Classic fairy tale narrator voice, but with modern cynical edge.

## Music & Audio

*   **Fabletown:** Urban sounds—traffic, city life—with subtle magical undertones (distant bells, whispered spells).
*   **Investigation Scenes:** Noir jazz, acoustic guitar, atmospheric.
*   **Homelands:** Full orchestral fairy tale themes, but tinged with darkness.
*   **Empire:** Martial drums, ominous brass, the sound of wooden soldiers marching.
