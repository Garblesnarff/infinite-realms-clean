# Creative Brief: Shadowhunters Ascendant

## Art Style: Gothic Urban Fantasy (Mortal Instruments meets Underworld)

Modern New York City nightlife meets gothic supernatural warfare. Black leather, angelic runes, glowing weapons, and glamorous Downworlders.

### Core Principles:
*   **Angelic Aesthetics:** Glowing runes on skin, silver seraph blades, white-gold angelic symbols.
*   **Urban Gothic:** Nightclubs, warehouses, cathedrals—modern settings with supernatural overlays.
*   **Downworlder Glamour:** Vampires (elegant, pale), werewolves (rough, strong), warlocks (colorful, eccentric), fae (beautiful, alien).

### Color Palette:
*   **Shadowhunters:** Black leather gear, silver weapons, white-gold runes glowing on skin.
*   **Demons:** Sickly greens, sulfurous yellows, shadow blacks, unnatural forms.
*   **Vampires:** Pale skin, blacks and crimsons, elegant clothing, red eyes when feeding.
*   **Warlocks:** Vibrant, eclectic colors—Magnus's signature is glitter and blue magic.
*   **Werewolves:** Earth tones, leather, denim, practical clothing.
*   **Faeries:** Ethereal, nature-inspired colors, impossible beauty, alien features.

### Character Design:
*   **Shadowhunters:** Black leather gear (pants, jackets, boots), runes visible on exposed skin (arms, neck), carrying seraph blades and steles. Ages teens to 30s.
*   **Clary:** Red-haired, artistic, casual modern clothing initially, then Shadowhunter gear. Sketchbook always present.
*   **Jace:** Blonde, arrogant posture, perfectly maintained gear, confident smirk.
*   **Magnus:** Tall, glitter makeup, cat eyes (warlock mark), flamboyant suits, rings on every finger, blue magic sparks.

### Voice:
Dual voice: (1) Shadowhunter—modern young adult (New York accent), confident, sarcastic, trained warrior. (2) Downworlder—varies by species (vampires are aristocratic, warlocks are theatrical, werewolves are gruff). Role: Narrating demon hunting and supernatural politics.
