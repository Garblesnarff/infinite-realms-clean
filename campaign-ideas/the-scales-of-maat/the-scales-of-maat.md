# The Scales of Ma'at

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Egyptian Mythology / Mystery / Moral Drama / Afterlife Journey
- **Estimated Length**: 20-25 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-15
- **Tone**: Mystical, Philosophical, Grand, Ominous, Redemptive

### Core Premise
The players died and awakened in the Duat, the Egyptian underworld, where they must journey through twelve perilous gates representing the hours of night to reach the Hall of Two Truths. There, their hearts will be weighed against the feather of Ma'at (truth/justice). But something is corrupting the judgment process - hearts both pure and wicked are being devoured by Ammit indiscriminately, and souls are disappearing before reaching their final rest. The players must solve the mystery of who corrupts Ma'at while navigating the treacherous Duat, facing their own sins and virtues, and ultimately deciding whether to save the Egyptian afterlife or expose its flaws.

### Difficulty Context: **Medium**
This campaign balances combat, puzzle-solving, and moral choices. Encounters test both tactical skill and ethical judgment. Success requires understanding Egyptian mythology, tracking clues across the underworld, and making difficult decisions about justice, mercy, and truth. Combat can be avoided through wisdom and proper rituals, but fighting in the Duat has unique challenges.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Journey Begins (Sessions 1-6)**
- Players die (or enter the Duat while living) and begin the traditional journey through the twelve gates of night. Each gate presents challenges requiring knowledge of Egyptian funeral rites and magical passwords. They meet Anubis, who guides souls through the Duat, and begin noticing irregularities - some gates are corrupted, monsters that shouldn't exist attack travelers, and souls are vanishing. They must reach the Hall of Two Truths while investigating these anomalies.

**Act 2: The Corruption Spreads (Sessions 7-15)**
- In the Hall of Two Truths, players witness hearts being judged. They see both the innocent devoured and the guilty passed through. Ma'at herself appears troubled. The players are tasked with investigating the corruption, traveling to different regions of the Duat: the Field of Reeds (paradise), the Lake of Fire (punishment), the Cave of Apophis (chaos), and the libraries of Thoth. They uncover evidence that someone is manipulating the Scales of Ma'at and feeding souls to Apophis to empower chaos.

**Act 3: The Architect of Chaos (Sessions 16-22)**
- The conspiracy is revealed: Set, god of chaos and desert, seeks to overthrow Osiris and Ma'at's judgment system, believing it unjust and corrupt. He argues that the Scales are flawed - punishing minor sins while allowing the powerful to buy their way to paradise with proper burial rites and magical knowledge. Set offers the players a choice: help him destroy the corrupt system, defend it despite its flaws, or forge a new path based on true justice rather than ritual knowledge.

**Act 4: Judgment Day (Sessions 23-25)**
- The players must make their final choice. Defend Ma'at and the traditional order (preserving stability but continuing injustice), side with Set (bringing change but risking chaos consuming the Duat), or propose reform (challenging both gods to create genuine justice). Their decision determines the fate of all Egyptian souls, the balance between order and chaos, and their own final judgment. The campaign climaxes with their hearts weighed on reformed Scales that measure true virtue, not ritual compliance.

### Major NPCs

- **Anubis**: Jackal-headed god of mummification and guide of souls. **Role**: Mentor / Guide / Ally. **Personality**: Solemn, compassionate, bound by duty, conflicted about the corruption he sees. **Flaw/Secret**: Knows the judgment system is flawed but fears change would bring chaos; secretly helps some unworthy souls pass judgment out of mercy.

- **Ma'at**: Goddess of truth, justice, and cosmic order. **Role**: Judge / Quest Giver / Symbol. **Personality**: Serene, unwavering, embodies law itself, increasingly distressed by corruption. **Flaw/Secret**: She is order personified and cannot adapt; bound by rules even when they produce injustice; fears that questioning her role questions reality itself.

- **Osiris**: God of the dead and judge of souls. **Role**: Ultimate Authority / King of the Duat / Traditionalist. **Personality**: Dignified, wise, kind but inflexible, murdered and resurrected. **Flaw/Secret**: His own judgment was flawed (Set murdered him, but was Set unjustified?); maintains the system because changing it would admit his reign is imperfect.

- **Set**: God of chaos, storms, and foreigners. **Role**: Antagonist / Revolutionary / Truth-Teller. **Personality**: Fierce, intelligent, bitter from being cast as villain, genuinely believes in his cause. **Flaw/Secret**: Murdered his brother Osiris; seeks reform but also revenge; his chaos could destroy the Duat entirely; offers valid criticism but dangerous solutions.

- **Thoth**: Ibis-headed god of wisdom, writing, and magic. **Role**: Information Broker / Neutral Scholar / Key Ally. **Personality**: Intellectual, curious, detached, records all but judges nothing. **Flaw/Secret**: Has recorded evidence of Ma'at's judgment failures for millennia but never acted; his neutrality enables injustice; fears being forced to choose sides.

- **Ammit**: The Devourer, part crocodile, lion, and hippo. **Role**: Executioner / Force of Nature / Victim. **Personality**: Not truly sentient, acts as cosmic garbage disposal, increasingly corrupted and hungry. **Flaw/Secret**: Being fed corrupted souls drives her mad; she devours innocents not from evil but from corruption; might be redeemed if the system is cleansed.

- **Isis**: Goddess of magic and healing, wife of Osiris. **Role**: Ally / Healer / Hidden Power. **Personality**: Compassionate, powerful, protective, most skilled in magic. **Flaw/Secret**: She resurrected Osiris using forbidden magic; questions whether he returned fully or if something was lost; might support reform if convinced it's necessary.

- **The Shabti of the Wealthy**: Clay servants created by the rich to serve them in the afterlife. **Role**: Social Commentary / Minor Antagonists / Victims. **Personality**: Vary from loyal servants to resentful slaves. **Flaw/Secret**: Represent the injustice of the afterlife - the wealthy avoid labor while the poor toil eternally; some rebel against their masters.

### Key Locations

- **The Hall of Two Truths**: Massive columned hall where Osiris sits in judgment. The Scales of Ma'at stand in the center, surrounded by forty-two divine judges. Souls recite the Negative Confession, claiming innocence of 42 specific sins. The heart is weighed. Pass and proceed to paradise; fail and face Ammit. The hall echoes with declarations of innocence and screams of the devoured.

- **The Twelve Gates of Night**: Each gate represents an hour of night the sun-god Ra travels through the Duat. Each has guardians, magical passwords, and challenges. The First Gate is easiest, the Seventh is deadliest. Souls must navigate all twelve to reach judgment. Each gate is a level of the campaign with unique themes.

- **The Field of Reeds (Aaru)**: Egyptian paradise for the justified. Eternal farmlands along perfect rivers, abundance without toil (if you have shabti servants), reunions with loved ones. But investigation reveals inequality - the wealthy live in palaces while the poor still labor. Paradise is stratified by earthly status.

- **The Lake of Fire**: Where the truly wicked burn eternally. Not torture for cruelty's sake, but purification. Some souls emerge cleansed after centuries. Others never escape. The players must venture here to investigate if Set is recruiting the damned.

- **The Cave of Apophis**: The great serpent of chaos who tries to devour Ra each night. A place of pure entropy where reality breaks down. Set's stronghold and the source of the corruption. Dangerous and reality-warping, but contains answers.

- **The Library of Thoth**: Infinite repository of all written knowledge, every spell, every judgment recorded. Navigating it requires understanding Egyptian hieroglyphics and concepts. Contains evidence of Ma'at's failures but also the solution to corruption.

- **The Barque of Ra**: The sun-god's boat that travels through the Duat each night, fighting Apophis and bringing hope of dawn. Traveling with Ra grants protection but draws the attacks meant for him. Epic battles against chaos.

### Central Conflict
The Egyptian afterlife promises justice through Ma'at's judgment, but the system is flawed. Ritual knowledge and wealthy burial rites allow the wicked to pass, while the poor and ignorant face harsher judgment. Set exploits these flaws to corrupt the Scales, but his solution - destroying order itself - risks plunging the Duat into chaos. The players must decide: preserve an unjust but stable system, embrace revolutionary chaos, or find a third way that reforms judgment while maintaining cosmic balance. The campaign explores themes of justice vs law, truth vs tradition, and whether imperfect order is better than chaos.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Heart-Weight Tracking**: Each player has a "heart weight" stat tracking their moral choices. Acts of truth, justice, and compassion reduce weight. Lies, cruelty, and selfishness increase it. At campaign's end, hearts are weighed. This creates moral consequences for decisions. Players can see their own weight gradually, creating tension about final judgment.

- **The Negative Confession**: Players must periodically recite parts of the 42 Negative Confessions ("I have not killed, I have not stolen, I have not lied..."). If they've committed those sins, must pass Deception checks or face consequences. Encourages virtuous play while allowing flawed characters.

- **Hieroglyphic Puzzles**: Many challenges require decoding hieroglyphics using provided cypher. Represents the importance of knowledge in Egyptian afterlife. Some passages require specific magical phrases from the Book of the Dead. Players feel the injustice of judgment based on ritual knowledge rather than virtue.

- **Shabti Servants**: Wealthy souls have shabti (magical servants) who perform tasks for them. Players without proper burial rites must do things personally. This mechanic highlights afterlife inequality and builds sympathy for reform.

- **Divine Ka (Spirit Power)**: Track Ka points representing spiritual energy. Spend Ka to cast Egyptian magic, resist corruption, or bargain with gods. Earn Ka through virtuous acts and completing rituals. Running out makes you vulnerable to Duat's dangers.

- **Corruption Meter**: Track the Duat's corruption level. As it rises, encounters become harder, safe areas vanish, and chaos spreads. Players' choices affect the meter. Creates urgency and visible consequences.

### Plot Twists and Complications

- **The Wealthy Villain**: A soul who passed judgment through proper burial rites despite being a murderous tyrant now lives in paradise while his victims suffer. Confronting him reveals the system's core flaw.

- **Anubis's Mercy**: Players discover Anubis has been secretly helping unworthy souls pass judgment out of compassion. This is technically corruption, but morally right. Do they expose him?

- **Set Was Right**: Evidence shows Set's murder of Osiris was partially justified - Osiris was becoming a tyrant. Set's vilification is propaganda. This complicates the moral landscape.

- **Ma'at's Flaw**: Ma'at herself is incapable of understanding mercy or context. She judges by absolute standards regardless of circumstances. A starving person who stole bread is equal to a wealthy thief. The goddess of justice lacks compassion.

- **The Corruption Source**: Set is causing corruption, but he's using a legitimate flaw - the Scales were always slightly imbalanced, just usually not enough to notice. He's exploiting, not creating, the injustice.

- **Players Failed Judgment**: Midway through the campaign, players' hearts are weighed and some might fail. Instead of death, they must argue their case, introducing the concept of appealing judgment based on circumstances rather than absolute law.

- **Ammit's Suffering**: The Devourer is sentient and suffers from eating souls. She begs the players to end her existence, revealing she's another victim of the unjust system.

- **The Alternative**: Thoth reveals other cultures' afterlives with different systems. Greek Hades has Elysium and Tartarus but also the Asphodel Meadows for average souls. Christian afterlife offers redemption through repentance. Maybe Egyptian judgment is one way, not the only way.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players reform the Scales of Ma'at to judge true virtue and circumstances rather than ritual knowledge. The system becomes more just while maintaining cosmic order. Set is convinced to stand down or is defeated but his criticisms addressed. Ammit is cleansed. All souls get fair judgment.

**Partial Victory**: Players stop Set's chaos but cannot reform Ma'at's judgment. The corruption is cleared but the fundamental injustice remains. Stability is preserved at the cost of ongoing inequality. The players pass judgment but know others will suffer unfairly.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Players side with Set and destroy the judgment system entirely. Chaos spreads through the Duat. Without Ma'at's order, the afterlife becomes unpredictable. Some souls flourish in freedom but others suffer worse than before. Order is lost but so is injustice.

**Defeat**: The corruption consumes the Duat entirely. Apophis breaks free and devours Ra. The Egyptian afterlife collapses into chaos. All souls, worthy and wicked, are lost. Ma'at's order ends and nothing replaces it. Alternatively, players fail their judgment and are devoured, unable to complete their mission.

**Philosophical Victory**: Players realize the journey itself was the point. Whether they pass judgment matters less than how they lived (and died). Their hearts are weighed and if they're found worthy, it's because of growth during the campaign, not starting virtue. Even if they fail judgment, they exposed the system's flaws and planted seeds of reform for future souls.
