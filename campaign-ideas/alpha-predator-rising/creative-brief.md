## Visual Motifs

**Scale Indicators:**
- Always show humans in titan shots
- Aircraft for size reference
- Buildings as toys
- Perspective shots emphasizing height

**Ancient Power:**
- Titans covered in scars from million-year battles
- Radiation glow from Godzilla
- Bioluminescence from deep ocean origins
- Weathered, eternal presence

**Symbiosis:**
- Mothra and Godzilla—yin yang imagery
- One is destroyer, one is healer

- We are not the focus

This creative direction emphasizes that titans are forces of nature, ancient and indifferent, beautiful and terrible, and that witnessing them is like standing before gods—humbling, terrifying, and awe-inspiring.
