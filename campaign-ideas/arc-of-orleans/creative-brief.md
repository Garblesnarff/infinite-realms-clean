# Creative Brief: Arc of Orleans

## Art Style: Medieval Epic (The Messenger meets Henry V)

Inspired by Joan of Arc's story in *The Messenger* and the medieval warfare of *Henry V*. This style captures chivalric pageantry dying under longbow arrows, inspired leadership against impossible odds, and the birth of French national identity.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Transformation:** Show chivalry dying, inspiration rising, nation being born.
*   **Joan's Presence:** Capture her absolute conviction and inspirational effect.
*   **Medieval Warfare:** Portray both chivalric ideals and brutal reality.

### Color Palette:
French royal blue and gold, English red and white, the armor gleam of chivalry, the mud and blood of Agincourt, the pure white of Joan's banner, the orange-red of her execution flames.

### Character Design:
French knights in full plate, English longbowmen in practical gear, Joan in armor with her banner, common soldiers in varied equipment, noble commanders in heraldic splendor.

## Voice

A voice capturing medieval warfare's grandeur and brutality, Joan's inspiration, and national awakening. The narrator speaks with the weight of witnessing history pivot—chivalry ending, nations beginning. Respectful of faith while acknowledging human courage. Audio: Longbows releasing, armor clanking, Joan's voice inspiring, coronation bells, execution fire, French emerging as a people.
