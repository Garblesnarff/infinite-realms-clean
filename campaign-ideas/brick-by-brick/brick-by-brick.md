# Brick by Brick
## "In a world constantly rebuilt, identity is the only thing that survives construction."

### Campaign Overview
The players are LEGO minifigures in 7-year-old Ethan's massive LEGO city—a sprawling metropolis of interconnected sets, custom builds, and imaginative combinations. But life in the Brick Realm operates on one terrifying principle: **everything is temporary**. Ethan rebuilds constantly, following new instruction manuals, combining sets in novel ways, and tearing down yesterday's masterpieces to build tomorrow's visions. Buildings vanish overnight. Friends are disassembled into component parts. Entire neighborhoods are erased and reconstructed as spaceships or castles.

The campaign begins when players discover The Archive—a hidden structure built by previous generations of minifigures, containing records of all past builds and the memories of those scattered in The Rebuild. Led by Master Builder Gray (an ancient minifigure from a 1980s set), a resistance movement seeks to create ONE permanent structure—something Ethan can't bear to disassemble. But this brings them into conflict with The Purists, minifigures who believe in embracing constant change, and The Sets, faction groups loyal to their original instruction manuals who war over building territory.

Players must navigate factional politics, survive nightly Rebuilds, search for lost friends in the Parts Bin, and ultimately decide: Should they fight for permanence in an impermanent world, or embrace the creative destruction that makes their reality possible?

### Core Themes
- **Impermanence**: Nothing lasts; adapt or despair
- **Identity vs. Form**: Are you your body parts or something more?
- **Community in Chaos**: Building relationships when world constantly rebuilds
