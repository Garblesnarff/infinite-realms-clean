# Operation Dragonmark - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
**Sophisticated Spy Fantasy** - A fusion of James Bond's sleek elegance with high fantasy elements. Think tuxedos with dragonscale patterns, magical gadgets that look like jewelry, and locations that blend opulent luxury with arcane power. Everything should feel expensive, dangerous, and slightly fantastical.

### Visual Themes
- **Metallic Glamour**: Gold, silver, and platinum accents everywhere. Polished surfaces reflecting magical light.
- **Dragon Motifs**: Subtle draconic imagery woven into architecture, fashion, and design. Never overt, always elegant.
- **Shadow and Light**: High contrast between illuminated luxury and dangerous shadows. Chiaroscuro lighting.
- **Retrofuturism**: 1960s spy aesthetic reimagined with magical technology. Art deco meets arcane.
- **Tactical Elegance**: Even combat gear looks stylish. Function and fashion are one.

### Character Design Notes

**Player Character Agents**
- Formal wear that transforms into combat gear
- Dragonmarks glow subtly when abilities activate (each a different color)
- Concealed weapons that look like accessories (cane swords, ring daggers, bracelet shields)
- Hair and clothing always perfect, even mid-combat (magical grooming enchantments)
- Signature items that define each character (special watch, unique cufflinks, distinctive scarf)

**Director Morgantha (M)**
- Severe business attire in charcoal and deep blue
- Silver hair pulled back in a tight bun
- Steel-rimmed glasses that occasionally glow with divination magic

- Wild hair that seems to defy gravity
- Goggles that flip between multiple magical lenses

**Goldclaw**
- Immaculate golden suit with dragon-scale patterns
- Mechanical golden left hand with dragon claw design
- Scarred right side of face (burn marks in draconic pattern)

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Theme
**Orchestral Jazz Fusion** - Big band brass section mixed with classical strings, punctuated by electric guitar riffs enchanted with magic. Think John Barry's Bond themes but with harpsichord and harp for the fantasy element. Leitmotifs for each major character that weave through the score.

### Instrumentation By Location

**Bureau Headquarters**
- Precise orchestral strings (violins, cellos)

**Casino Scenes**

- Anvil strikes and industrial sounds

**Emotional Scenes**
- Strip back to solo instruments (piano, acoustic guitar, harp)
- String sections for swelling emotion
- Silence used strategically for impact
- Heartbeat sound design for intimate moments
- Sound Design: Breathing, the clink of glasses in a toast, the rustle of important documents, the silence after betrayal

### Dynamic Music System
- Music responds to player actions and success/failure
- Stealth sections: minimalist, tension-building, percussion-focused
- Combat escalation: music layers add as fight intensifies
- Victory stingers: triumphant brass burst when objectives complete
- Failure motifs: dissonant strings when things go wrong
- Cliffhanger endings: cut to silence at dramatic moments
