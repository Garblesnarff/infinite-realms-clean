# Creative Brief: The Scribe of Seawind Isle

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gentle Rural Realism with Artistic Flourishes

Inspired by the natural, contemplative aesthetic of Barakamon, with realistic but beautiful depictions of rural coastal life, emphasis on calligraphy and artistic process, and a gentle color palette that reflects the healing journey. This style aims to capture the introspective, heartwarming, and gently comedic tone of "The Scribe of Seawind Isle," where art and life intertwine.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Natural Beauty:** Emphasize the honest beauty of rural life, nature, and simple moments without romanticizing or dramatizing.
*   **Artistic Process:** Show the creation of art – brush strokes, ink flowing, hands working – as a meditative, meaningful act.
*   **Character Growth:** Visual progression from stiff/frustrated to relaxed/inspired should be evident in character designs and poses.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gentle, introspective, heartwarming, comedic, peaceful, natural, contemplative, healing, coastal, rural.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of calm renewal and quiet discovery. The atmosphere should feel like a gentle sea breeze – refreshing, cleansing, and full of subtle life.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, confident line work that reflects artistic discipline. Lines can be expressive and fluid, like calligraphy strokes. Characters are drawn realistically but with slightly softer edges.
*   **Forms:** Natural, organic forms dominate – flowing water, windswept grass, weathered wood. Characters have realistic proportions with expressive, thoughtful faces.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic illustration of a coastal village with clean, confident line work. Natural, organic forms with flowing, calligraphic quality to key elements."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Natural, muted colors of the seaside – soft blues, sandy beiges, weathered grays, green foliage, and warm wood tones. Occasional pops of vibrant color in character clothing or festival decorations.
*   **Texture:** Slightly textured like quality paper or canvas. Colors feel natural and grounded, never oversaturated. Ink and paint textures are visible in artistic elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a natural coastal color palette with soft blues, sandy beiges, and weathered wood tones. Subtle paper texture with visible ink strokes in calligraphy elements."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, relatable character designs. City-dwelling artists start looking stiff and formal, gradually relaxing into comfortable, casual clothing. Villagers wear practical work clothes with personal touches.
*   **Expression:** Characters show subtle emotions through body language and genuine facial expressions. Artists' frustration, contemplation, and eventual joy should be evident.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young artist in casual clothes sitting cross-legged, surrounded by calligraphy supplies. Thoughtful, slightly frustrated expression. Realistic style with soft, natural lighting."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Detailed, realistic coastal and rural environments – weathered buildings, fishing boats, tide pools, forest paths, lighthouse interiors. Each location feels authentic and lived-in.
*   **Atmosphere:** Natural lighting at different times of day – sunrise over the ocean, harsh midday sun, golden evening light, moonlight on water. Wind and weather are visible.
*   **Details:** Fishing nets, drying laundry, scattered children's toys, wild flowers, calligraphy tools, stacked firewood, seashells, weathered driftwood.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A coastal village at golden hour with realistic detail. Weathered wooden buildings, fishing nets drying, gentle waves. Natural lighting with warm sunset colors and authentic rural details."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, realistic lighting that changes with time and weather. Coastal light has a particular quality – clear, slightly harsh at midday, golden at dawn and dusk.
*   **Shadows:** Realistic shadows that ground subjects and create depth. Shadows are darker in midday sun, softer during golden hour.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reflects mood and time – harsh noon light for frustration and struggle, gentle evening light for breakthrough moments, soft overcast light for contemplation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by natural golden hour sunlight from the side, creating realistic shadows. Coastal lighting with warm, clear quality that emphasizes natural textures."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Contemplative compositions that often feature negative space, natural framing through doorways or windows, and subjects integrated into their environment. Artistic process shots show hands, tools, and creation in progress.
*   **Techniques:** Use of foreground, middle ground, and background to create depth. Wide shots of landscapes for moments of realization, close-ups of artistic work for focus and meditation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition showing an artist's workspace in a lighthouse studio. Foreground features calligraphy brushes and paper, middle ground shows the artist working, background reveals ocean view through large windows. Natural, contemplative framing."

## Voice

A calm, reflective male voice with a gentle rural accent, speaking slowly and thoughtfully as if choosing each word carefully. The tone is warm and understated, with quiet humor and wisdom earned through experience. The pacing is deliberately slow with comfortable pauses, conveying patience and the unhurried rhythm of island life. The emotion blends contentment, understated pride in simple work, and gentle amusement at city folk's struggles. Audio quality is clear but natural, like someone speaking while working with their hands, with subtle background sounds of waves, wind, and distant village activity. Role: An elderly islander or the narrator of a contemplative story about finding oneself through art and simplicity.
