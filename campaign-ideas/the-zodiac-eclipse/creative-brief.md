# Creative Brief: The Zodiac Eclipse

## Visual Art Direction
- Each session shows one constellation darkening
- Murder scenes are cosmic crimes - star-blood, celestial weapons
- Eclipse phases visible in sky each session
- Party accumulates glowing zodiac symbols as they inherit powers

**Key Visuals:**
- Eclipse progression calendar (visual countdown)
- Zodiac thrones with some empty/dark
- Eclipse-forged weapons (dark metal, void-touched)
- Party transforming as they gain power

## Music Direction
- Main theme loses one zodiac motif each session
- Starts with twelve instruments, ends with silence or new theme
- Each sign's death has musical funeral
- Hunter theme: Freedom vs. tyranny ambiguity
- Eclipse moments: Unsettling silence

## Voice Acting
- **Zodiac Signs:** Immortals facing mortality for first time
- Some dignified, some terrified, some relieved
- **Eclipse Hunters:** True believers, not cartoonish villains
- **Party:** Growing weight of inherited power

## Atmosphere
- Murder mystery meets countdown horror
- Each session could be last for a sign
- Moral complexity - no clear good guys
- Beauty and tragedy of dying stars

## Marketing Taglines
- "Twelve months. Twelve signs. One by one, they die."
- "The stars are being murdered. Will you save them?"
- "Every god has a moment of weakness."
- "When constellations die, who inherits the sky?"
