# World-Building Specification: The Zodiac Eclipse

## The Eclipse Cycle

Every 1,000 years, cosmic alignment causes Zodiac Eclipse:
- Each constellation eclipsed for exactly one month
- Order follows zodiac sequence (Aries through Pisces)
- During eclipse, that sign loses all power
- Historically, this was peaceful period of reflection
- This Eclipse, someone is killing the vulnerable signs

## Previous Eclipses

**2,000 years ago (1st Eclipse):** Peaceful, spiritually significant
**1,000 years ago (2nd Eclipse):** Several signs attacked but all survived
**Current (3rd Eclipse):** Systematic assassination campaign

**Pattern:** Eclipse periods becoming more dangerous as mortals grow bolder.

## Eclipse-Touched

Born during previous Eclipse:
- Immune to eclipse power loss
- Can channel zodiac magic even during eclipses
- See eclipse shadows and sense coming darknesses
- Rare (only born during Eclipse years)
- Current generation: Approximately 1,000 people worldwide
- Party is most powerful group

## Eclipse Hunters

Organization dedicated to ending zodiac influence:

**Founding:** 500 years ago by mortals tired of cosmic governance
**Philosophy:** Zodiac magic constrains free will and self-determination
**Methods:** Assassinate signs during vulnerable eclipse months
**Leadership:** Council of former zodiac champions who turned against their signs
**Weapons:** Eclipse-forged blades (void-metal that can kill immortals)
**Justification:** They're not entirely wrong about zodiac's control

**Hunter Factions:**
- **Freedom Seekers:** Want mortal self-determination
- **Pragmatists:** Believe zodiac is obsolete
- **Nihilists:** Want to end all cosmic magic
- **Vengeful:** Personal grudges against specific signs

## The Zodiac Signs (Detailed)

Each is an immortal being embodying their constellation:
- Ruled for millennia
- Provide cosmic magic to followers
- Govern their domains
- Are vulnerable only during eclipse
- Some deserve to fall, others don't

**The Dark Truth:**
Zodiac signs do feed on mortal belief and constrain free will to maintain power. Eclipse Hunters' accusations have merit. The question becomes whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

## Inheritance Mechanics

When zodiac sign dies:
- Their power must go somewhere
- Naturally flows to Eclipse-Touched
- Party accumulates power with each death
- Risk: Too much power corrupts
- Benefits: Can channel all zodiac abilities

**Corruption Track:**
Each inherited power increases corruption. Party risks becoming new tyrants.

## Eclipse-Forged Weapons

Created in void during eclipse:
- Only weapons that can permanently kill immortals
- Only function during eclipse periods
- Hunters have monopoly (initially)
- Party may acquire them
- Using them marks you as god-killer

**Creation:** Requires sacrificing cosmic connection, becoming permanently severed from zodiac magic.

## The Signs' Perspectives

**Aries (Dead):** Died fighting, respected Hunters' strength
**Taurus:** Wants to survive, willing to reform
**Gemini:** Split on issue (one twin sympathized with Hunters)
**Cancer:** Died protecting innocents, tragic
**Leo:** Humbled by vulnerability, growing
**Virgo:** Chose strategic sacrifice (reformed)
**Libra:** Tried negotiation, betrayed
**Scorpio:** Knows zodiac is flawed, might support end
**Sagittarius:** Philosophical about potential death
**Capricorn:** Traditional, believes zodiac necessary
**Aquarius:** Revolutionary, sides with Hunters
**Pisces:** Sees all outcomes, accepting of fate

## The Eclipse Observatory

Party's base of operations:
- Ancient structure tracking celestial events
- Contains records of previous eclipses
- Shows which sign is currently vulnerable
- Library of zodiac lore and hunter information
- Last neutral ground in the conflict

## Calendar and Timeline

**Month 1 (Aries):** Already dead when campaign begins
**Month 2 (Taurus):** First protection mission
**Month 3 (Gemini):** Partial failure
**Month 4 (Cancer):** Heroic death
**Month 5 (Leo):** Successful protection
**Month 6 (Virgo):** Strategic sacrifice
**Month 7 (Libra):** Midpoint, betrayal
**Month 8 (Scorpio):** Revelation
**Month 9 (Sagittarius):** Quest death
**Month 10 (Capricorn):** Judgment
**Month 11 (Aquarius):** Betrayal
**Month 12 (Pisces):** Endgame

Each session is one month. 12 sessions total = 12 months = 1 year.

## Three Possible Endings

**Preservation:** Save enough signs, defeat Hunters, maintain zodiac
**Destruction:** Allow zodiac's end, side with Hunters, mortals govern selves
**Transformation:** Neither preserve nor destroy, use crisis to reform zodiac into something better

Campaign designed so all three are valid depending on party's moral choices.

## Philosophical Core

Explores:
- Whether cosmic governance is benevolent or tyrannical
- Value of free will vs. guidance
- How to judge flawed but beneficial systems
- Whether assassination of "gods" is murder or liberation
- What mortals do when they inherit divine power

No clear answer. Party decides based on evidence and values.

## The Ultimate Question

If the zodiac constrains mortal free will but also provides meaning, stability, and magic - should it be preserved, destroyed, or transformed into something that offers guidance without control?

The campaign's answer comes from the party's choices throughout the twelve months.
