# The Zodiac Eclipse
**Tagline:** *One by one, the signs go dark. Soon, none will remain.*

## Campaign Overview

Every thousand years, a cosmic phenomenon called the Zodiac Eclipse occurs - each constellation is temporarily blocked from view, one per month, for twelve months total. During its eclipse month, that zodiac sign loses all power: magic fails, personalities flatten, kingdoms weaken. Traditionally, this period of vulnerability has been respected peacefully, a time for reflection rather than conquest. But this Eclipse is different.

Someone is killing the zodiac signs during their eclipse. When Aries was eclipsed, the immortal Lord Aries was assassinated. His power didn't return when the eclipse ended - he's permanently dead, and all Aries magic in the world has vanished. Now Taurus is eclipsed and under attack. If all twelve signs are killed during their vulnerable months, zodiac magic will die forever, plunging the world into an age without cosmic guidance.

The party are Eclipse-Touched - born during the last Eclipse, they're immune to power loss and can sense the coming darkness. They must protect each remaining sign during its eclipse month, hunt the Eclipse Hunters who are systematically murdering the zodiac, and discover who wants to end the age of stars and why. With each sign that falls, the party gains the deceased sign's power - but the weight of being the last zodiac magic users might be more than mortals can bear.

## Core Themes

- **Countdown Horror:** One sign per month dies
- **Vulnerability:** Even the mighty have weak moments
- **Legacy and Inheritance:** Taking on powers of the dying
- **Murder Mystery:** Who's killing gods and why?
- **The End of an Age:** Is zodiac magic worth preserving?

## Session Breakdown (12 Sessions - One per Sign)

### Month 1 - Aries Aftermath (Session 1)
Campaign begins with Aries already dead. Party investigates murder scene, becomes suspects, then reluctant protectors. Learn about Eclipse-Touched immunity. Taurus eclipse begins in 30 days.

### Month 2 - Taurus Under Siege (Session 2)
Protect Taurus during eclipse month. Eclipse Hunters attack. Party partially succeeds - Taurus wounded but survives. Gain first clues about Hunters: they're using eclipse-forged weapons that can kill immortals.

### Month 3 - Gemini Split (Session 3)
Gemini Twins are separated during eclipse (they maintain power through connection). Hunters kill one twin, other survives. Half of Gemini magic dies. Party inherits dual-nature powers from deceased twin.

### Month 4 - Cancer's Last Stand (Session 4)
Cancer fortifies during eclipse. Party helps defend. Epic siege. Cancer dies protecting civilians. Party inherits protective powers. Pattern becomes clear - Hunters are too strong during eclipses.

### Month 5 - Leo's Pride (Session 5)
Leo refuses protection, believing himself too mighty. Party must protect him against his will. Leo survives but humbled. Important intelligence gained about Hunter leadership.

### Month 6 - Virgo's Sacrifice (Session 6)
Virgo, the analytical one, has figured out the pattern. Chooses to sacrifice herself strategically, passing her power to the party before Hunters arrive. First willing transfer. Party gains analytical abilities.

### Month 7 - Libra's Balance (Session 7)
Midpoint of Eclipse. Libra proposes compromise with Hunters. Party meets Eclipse Hunter leaders, learns their motivation: zodiac magic has ruled too long, mortals deserve freedom. Libra arranges negotiation. Hunters betray and kill Libra. Party now questions their mission.

### Month 8 - Scorpio's Revelation (Session 8)
Scorpio, master of secrets, reveals truth: zodiac signs are parasitic, feeding on mortal belief. Eclipse Hunters are partially right. Scorpio offers to work with party to reform zodiac or end it properly. Scorpio survives with party's help.

### Month 9 - Sagittarius's Quest (Session 9)
Sagittarius seeks ancient weapon that can fight Hunters. Party joins the quest. Philosophical journey. Sagittarius dies finding weapon but passes it to party with blessing. Questions whether zodiac should be saved.

### Month 10 - Capricorn's Judgment (Session 10)
Capricorn, oldest sign, judges the party. Are they trying to save zodiac for right reasons? Party faces moral trial. Capricorn survives or dies based on party's choices and arguments about zodiac's value.

### Month 11 - Aquarius's Revolution (Session 11)
Aquarius joins the Hunters, believing zodiac's end will free humanity. Party must fight former ally. Major confrontation with Hunter leadership. Aquarius reveals some Hunters are former zodiac champions who turned against their signs.

### Month 12 - Pisces Endgame (Session 12)
Final eclipse. Pisces, the dreamer, sees all possible futures. Party faces Eclipse Hunter leader and must decide: complete zodiac protection (save old system), allow zodiac's end (embrace change), or create new synthesis (transform zodiac into something better). Final battle determines fate of zodiac magic.

**The Free Sage:** Philosopher who believes mortals need independence from stars
**The Fallen Champion:** Former zodiac warrior who learned uncomfortable truths

## Major Locations

**The Eclipse Observatory:** Tracks celestial events, party's base

**The Last Light Temple:** Where deceased signs' power resides
**The Cosmic Graveyard:** Where dead constellations go

## Unique Mechanics

### Eclipse Calendar
- One sign eclipsed per month (game session)
- During eclipse, that sign loses all power
- Party must protect or sign dies permanently
- Calendar creates countdown tension
- Can't prevent eclipses, only protect during them

### Inherited Powers
- When sign dies, party inherits portion of power
- Accumulating power makes party stronger
- But also makes them last zodiac magic users
- Risk of corruption from too much cosmic power
- Can choose to refuse inheritance

### Eclipse-Touched Immunity
- Party unaffected by eclipse power loss
- Can sense coming eclipses
- Can channel deceased signs' powers
- Makes them targets for both sides

### Hunter Weapons
- Eclipse-forged blades can kill immortals
- Only work during eclipse months
- Party can potentially acquire and use them
- Using them marks party as potential threats

### Moral Complexity System
- Track party's understanding of both sides
- Hunters have valid points about cosmic tyranny
- Zodiac signs aren't purely benevolent
- Final choice depends on moral position developed

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Hunters are right:** Zodiac does constrain mortal free will
2. **Some signs want to die:** Tired of immortal burden
3. **Party is becoming too powerful:** Inheriting powers corrupts
4. **One party member is a Hunter:** Sleeper agent revealed mid-campaign
5. **The Eclipse was triggered artificially:** Not natural phenomenon
6. **Previous Eclipse killed signs too:** This has happened before
7. **A new zodiac could emerge:** Death of old makes room for new
