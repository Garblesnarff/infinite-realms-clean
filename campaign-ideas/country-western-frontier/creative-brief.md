# Country Western Frontier - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic:** American frontier mythology meets magical realism. Wide open spaces, golden hour eternally, every sunset painted by God. Think Terrence Malick meets classic Westerns, with touch of Southern Gothic.

**Visual Influences:**
- Classic Western films (John Ford, Sergio Leone)
- Country music album covers (Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks)
- American landscape photography (Ansel Adams)
- Southern Gothic art
- Honky-tonk and roadhouse photography
- Americana and folk art

**Outlaw Territory:** Dusty, weathered, desert tones

**Hank the Lonesome:** Mournful, honky-tonk crooner
**Johnny:** Deep, authoritative, Johnny Cash-like
**Hank Williams:** Ethereal, sad, beautiful loneliness

## Cinematic Moments
