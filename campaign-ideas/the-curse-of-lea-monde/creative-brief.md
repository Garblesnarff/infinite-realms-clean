# Creative Brief: The Curse of Lea Monde

Inspired by *Vagrant Story's* dark, baroque aesthetic - Gothic architecture, body horror, religious imagery twisted into nightmare, and oppressive atmosphere.

## Art Style: Gothic Dark Fantasy

### Core Principles:
*   **Oppressive Architecture:** Baroque Gothic buildings decayed into nightmare labyrinths.
*   **Body Horror:** Enemies are twisted amalgamations of flesh, metal, and religious symbolism.
*   **Desolate Beauty:** The city is horrifying but hauntingly beautiful in its decay.

### Color Palette:
Dark grays, deep purples, dried blood reds, tarnished golds. Minimal color saturation emphasizing bleakness.

### Mood:
Lonely, oppressive, contemplative, horrifying. The weight of a cursed city bearing down on a single soul.

## Voice

A hollow, strained voice like someone recounting trauma they barely survived. Pacing is slow and deliberate. Emotion is suppressed (reflecting Riskbreaker conditioning) but horror bleeds through cracks. Audio has slight echoes as if speaking in vast empty cathedral.
