# The Moon's Madness
## "Where Nightmares Are Real and Reality Is a Nightmare"

### Campaign Overview

The party awakens in the Lunar Labyrinth with no memory of how they arrived. The massive moon hangs overhead, its face watching them with empty eyes. This is the realm of illusion, fear, and the subconscious made manifest. Here, nightmares walk, dreams bleed into waking, and sanity is a currency you spend to survive. The Lunar Physician, keeper of this realm, explains that they've been brought here to cure a plague of madness spreading through the multiverse—but first, they must navigate their own psychological terrors.

The labyrinth shifts based on fear. Paths appear and disappear according to what you dread most. The howling wolves hunt those who run from themselves. The crayfish rises from pools of repressed memory. And at the labyrinth's heart lies the source of the madness plague: a hole in reality where the subconscious of all beings has begun leaking through, creating a nightmare feedback loop that threatens to drown all existence in unprocessed fear.

To cure the plague, the party must journey through layers of personal and collective nightmare, confront the shadow aspects of themselves and others, and either seal the tear in reality or accept that some fears must be faced rather than suppressed. The path to sanity runs straight through madness.

### Key NPCs

**The Lunar Physician**: Shifts between lucid and mad, sees truths that sound like lies, guides with unreliable wisdom, genuinely trying to help

**The Dream Eaters**: Feed on nightmares, reduce fear by consuming it, but rob people of necessary confrontation; ambiguous allies

**The Wolf Pack**: Hunt the running, howl truths people don't want to hear, force confrontation, not evil—natural

**The Crayfish**: Risen from subconscious depths, represents repressed trauma, grows stronger when denied, must be faced

**The Moon Itself**: Silent watcher reflecting viewer's own gaze, speaks rarely but profoundly, not malicious—mirror

**The Mad Ones**: Trapped minds who couldn't navigate, some became nightmare, some found peace in madness, warnings and guides

**The Shadow Aspect**: Each character's dark reflection, everything they deny about themselves, can be enemy or integrated

**The First Dreamer**: Being who created the labyrinth as therapeutic space, now lost in their own creation

### Major Locations

**The Entrance Path**: Winding road between towers, wolf howls echoing, deceptively simple
**The Phobia Fields**: Landscapes of common fears—heights, depths, crowds, isolation, spiders, drowning
**The Memory Pools**: Reflective waters showing repressed pasts, crayfish emerge here
**The Labyrinth Heart**: Where reality tears, nightmares leak through, source of plague
**The Moon's Face**: Can be visited, reveals that the moon is a mirror, consciousness reflecting
**The Dream Eaters' Nest**: Safety but at cost of not confronting fears, comfortable trap
**The Shadow Gallery**: Where each person's dark aspects dwell, integration chamber

### Unique Mechanics

**Sanity Tracker**: Replaces health; damage is psychological; zero sanity is madness, not death; madness can be wisdom

**Fear Manifestation**: Personal fears become real enemies; facing them weakens them; running strengthens them

**Reality Stability**: Track if you're experiencing reality or illusion; uncertainty is constant; accepting uncertainty helps

**Shadow Integration**: Confront and accept dark aspects; rejection causes them to hunt you; acceptance grants their power

**Collective Nightmare**: Party shares some fears; facing together vs. alone changes outcomes

**Madness or Wisdom**: At low sanity, gain insights invisible at high sanity; cost and benefit

### Plot Twists

**You're Already Mad**: Reveal that party has been insane from the start; the "real world" was the illusion; labyrinth is truth

**The Physician Is Your Shadow**: The Lunar Physician is party's collective suppressed madness personified

**The Plague Is the Cure**: Madness epidemic is collective psychological healing; "sanity" was the real sickness

**Someone Isn't Leaving**: One party member chooses to stay; becomes new labyrinth keeper; necessary sacrifice

### Victory Conditions

**The Balanced Mind**: Face fears, integrate shadows, seal tear healthily; sanity and madness in balance; true ending

**The Mad Victory**: Embrace madness fully, stop fighting it, gain dark enlightenment; scary but functional

**The Suppression**: Seal tear completely, return to "normal," fears pushed down again; temporary victory, eventual return

**The New Physician**: Replace the Lunar Physician, maintain the labyrinth, help others face fears; sacrifice ending

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Madness**: Lose all sanity, become nightmare yourself, trapped forever
**Reality Lost**: Can't distinguish real from illusion, stuck in psychological loop, neither mad nor sane
**Suppression Breaks**: Sealed tear too weakly, plague returns worse, catastrophic failure
