# The Moon's Madness - World-Building Specification

## The Lunar Labyrinth's Nature

The labyrinth is the collective subconscious given physical form. It exists in the space between waking and dreaming, housing all suppressed fears, repressed memories, and denied shadow aspects of all conscious beings.

## How Fear Works Here

Fear is tangible. Your terrors manifest as actual threats. Running from them makes them stronger, faster, more real. Facing them makes them smaller, slower, more manageable. Complete acceptance causes them to dissolve or integrate.

## The Madness Plague

All beings suppress fears rather than processing them. Over time, the collective weight of unprocessed psychological material grew too heavy. Reality tore under the pressure. Now everyone's nightmares are leaking into waking life. The plague isn't disease—it's mass psychological crisis.

## The Moon's Purpose

The Moon doesn't create fear—it reflects it. Everything terrifying you see in the moon's light is actually within you, projected outward. The Moon is a mirror for the subconscious. This is why it seems to watch: You're watching yourself.

## The Wolves' Nature

Psychopomps that hunt those who flee from self-knowledge. They don't kill—they force confrontation. Being "caught" means facing what you've been running from. Some people die from shock, but the wolves themselves are neutral. They're the labyrinth's immune system, preventing complete self-deception.

## The Crayfish Symbolism

Represents the primordial subconscious, the deepest repressed material rising to demand recognition. In tarot, it crawls from water toward land—the unconscious seeking consciousness. Ignoring it makes it grow. Facing it allows integration of very old trauma.

## Sanity vs. Madness

The labyrinth challenges the binary. "Sanity" often means comfortable self-deception. "Madness" sometimes means uncomfortable truth. Real sanity is integrating both: Accepting reality (including its uncomfortable parts) while maintaining function.

## The Dream Eaters' Role

They offer relief by consuming your nightmares. But nightmares exist for a reason—they're unprocessed psychological material seeking resolution. Eating them removes symptoms without addressing causes. Temporary relief, long-term harm.

## Reality Stability

In the labyrinth, reality is consensus between your conscious and subconscious minds. When they disagree (which is most of the time), reality becomes unstable. Achieving internal agreement stabilizes reality around you. This is why madness and wisdom look similar here—both involve the conscious mind accepting what the subconscious knows.

## The Tear's Origin

When collective suppression reached critical mass, the barrier between consciousness and subconsciousness ruptured. Now the repressed material of all beings floods through. The tear can be sealed (suppression) or widened (full integration). Middle path: Teach healthy processing so the pressure decreases naturally.

## The Physician's Condition

She's been containing the tear alone, absorbing everyone's nightmares. It's driven her mad—but her madness is also profound wisdom. She sees truth but can't always communicate it coherently. Her condition is both the problem (can't maintain containment) and the solution (understands what's needed).
