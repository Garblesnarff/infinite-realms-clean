### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Forgotten Assassin**

**1. Core Concept:**
An amnesiac super-assassin awakens with no memory but extraordinary skills, pursued by both his former handlers and other operatives, must uncover his identity and expose the black ops program that transformed volunteers into expendable weapons through psychological conditioning.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the Treadstone program—black ops assassination program, existed 10+ years, dozens of operatives trained
*   Explain the conditioning process—volunteers recruited from military, psychological breaking, identity erasure, combat training, trigger implantation
*   Write about Jason Bourne's creation—volunteered after personal tragedy (family death?), transformed into perfect weapon
*   Describe previous missions—dozen successful assassinations of "threats to national security" (some legitimate, some political)
*   Detail the failed Wombosi mission—ordered to kill in front of children, Bourne refused, broke conditioning
*   Explain Treadstone's response—eliminate Bourne as malfunctioning asset
*   Write about other operatives—The Professor, Manheim, Castel—all weapons like Bourne
*   Describe CIA power structure—Ward Abbott at top, Alexander Conklin running day-to-day
*   Detail Bourne's survival—shot, fell into ocean, rescued by fishermen, amnesia from trauma and conditioning breaking

**3. Factions:**
*   **Treadstone Program** (Major) - Black ops assassination unit, hunting Bourne to protect secrets
*   **Bourne & Marie** (Major) - Amnesiac assassin and civilian ally, on the run, seeking truth
*   **CIA Legitimate Branches** (Major) - Official intelligence agency, mostly unaware of Treadstone
*   **Treadstone Operatives** (Minor) - Other assassins, some hunting Bourne, some questioning programming
*   **Foreign Intelligence** (Minor) - Other nations aware of Treadstone, seeking to exploit or expose
*   **Bourne's Past** (Minor) - Who he was before Treadstone, family/friends who think he's dead

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Jason Bourne (PC), Marie Kreutz, Alexander Conklin, Ward Abbott, The Professor
*   **Tier 2:** Nicky Parsons, Wombosi, Castel (another operative), Danny Zorn (CIA analyst)
*   **Tier 3:** "CIA Officer," "Treadstone Handler," "Foreign Agent," "Embassy Security," "Assassin," "Safe House Contact"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Mediterranean Sea** - Where Bourne awakens with amnesia
*   **Zurich Bank** - Safe deposit box revealing multiple identities
*   **American Embassy, Zurich** - Bourne seeks help, betrayed
*   **Paris Safe House** - Bourne's apartment, weapons and identities cache
*   **Marie's Apartment** - Temporary sanctuary, humanizing space
*   **Treadstone Training Facility** - Flashback location, psychological horror
*   **CIA Operations Center** - Command tracking Bourne
*   **The Professor's Farm** - Rural French location, climactic confrontation
*   **Various European Cities** - Chase across continent, each triggers memories

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Bourne accesses safe deposit box THEN discovers multiple identities, weapons, triggers first memories
*   IF Bourne seeks embassy help THEN betrayed by own government, realizes he's wanted
*   IF Bourne survives assassination attempts THEN Treadstone sends more skilled operatives
*   IF Marie helps Bourne THEN she becomes target, must stay with him for safety
*   IF Bourne reaches safe house THEN flashback to past missions triggered
*   IF Bourne encounters other operative (Castel) THEN learns he's not alone, program is bigger
*   IF The Professor confronts Bourne THEN mirror held up—this is what full conditioning looks like
*   IF The Professor is killed THEN warns about the "hand" behind the weapon
*   IF Bourne infiltrates CIA THEN accesses Treadstone files, learns full truth
*   IF Conklin confronts Bourne THEN explains program, kills himself rather than face exposure
*   IF Abbott tries to eliminate evidence THEN final confrontation over program's future
*   IF Bourne exposes Treadstone publicly THEN faces legal consequences but conspiracy ends
*   IF Bourne kills all leadership THEN program ended but he's a fugitive forever
*   IF Bourne disappears THEN finds peace but program may continue under new name
*   IF memories fully return THEN must reconcile who he was with who he's become
