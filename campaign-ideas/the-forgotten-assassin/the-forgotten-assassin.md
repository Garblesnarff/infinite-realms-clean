## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1–3):** PC wakes on a fishing boat with two bullets in their back and total amnesia. Discovery of safe deposit box containing multiple identities, weapons, currency. Attacked by assassins—instinctively defeats them with skills they don't remember learning. Realizes they're being hunted but doesn't know why. First flashback: killing a target in a hotel room. Horror of what you might be.

*   **Act II — The Investigation (Sessions 4–7):** Pursued across multiple cities. Each location triggers fragmented memories. Discover Treadstone program through documents in safe house. Learn they were "Jason Bourne" (codename)—one of several assassins in black ops program. Meet Marie—civilian who gets caught up, becomes ally and conscience. Embassy scenes: being hunted by your own government. First confrontation with another Treadstone operative reveals you're all the same: weaponized amnesiacs.

*   **Act III — The Professor (Sessions 8–11):** Tracked by "The Professor"—another Treadstone assassin sent to eliminate you. Cat and mouse across Europe. Flashbacks intensify: training sessions, psychological conditioning, past assassinations. Discovery that your last mission went wrong—refused to kill a target with children present, broke conditioning. Treadstone tried to eliminate you for failing. Fight with The Professor ends in his death, but he warns: "They'll send more. We're just the weapon. Kill the hand."

*   **Act IV — Treadstone Exposed (Sessions 12–14):** Infiltrating CIA equivalent to access Treadstone files. Discovery of Ward Abbott and Alexander Conklin—the architects. Learning the full horror: Treadstone takes volunteers, erases their identities, conditions them into perfect assassins through psychological trauma. You volunteered after personal tragedy, they exploited and weaponized your grief. Confronting Conklin—he's genuinely believes he's protecting the realm. Kills himself rather than face exposure.

*   **Act V — The Choice (Sessions 15–16):** Final confrontation with Ward Abbott and remaining Treadstone leadership. Evidence gathered to expose program publicly. But doing so reveals your crimes—you killed innocent people, not just targets. Choice: Expose Treadstone (justice but self-destruction), destroy evidence and disappear (survival but conspiracy continues), or take over the program to reform it from within (power but corruption). Resolution of identity: accepting you were Jason Bourne but choosing who you'll become.

## Central Conflict

Identity and Agency. Bourne must answer: "Who am I?" and more importantly, "Who do I choose to be?" The conspiracy is external, but the real conflict is internal.

Discovering you're a government-created weapon designed to kill without question forces reckoning with:
*   Past crimes (you murdered people)
*   Lost identity (your real name and history were erased)
*   Stolen agency (you volunteered but were manipulated and conditioned)
*   Current morality (you're trying to be good, but your skills are for killing)

The central question: Can you reclaim your humanity after being turned into a weapon? Are you defined by what you were made to do, or by what you choose to do now?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Amnesia System**
*   PC has no character backstory initially—it's discovered through play.
*   DM and player collaborate on fragments revealed gradually.
*   Mechanically: Wisdom saves trigger memories (often traumatic).
*   Each memory grants mechanical benefit (remembering combat training) but emotional cost.

### 2. **Fragmented Flashbacks**
*   Triggered by locations, items, people, or stress.
*   Flashback scenes show past missions and training.
*   Players experience what their character did without remembering doing it.
*   Gradually pieces together full picture.

### 3. **Instinctive Competence**
*   Bourne has skills he doesn't remember learning.
*   In combat/stealth: can use abilities "instinctively" without knowing why.
*   Creates unsettling feeling—"How do I know how to do this?"
*   Mechanically: proficiencies in weapons, languages, skills without character justification initially.

### 4. **Constant Pursuit**
*   Hunters tracking you across campaign.
*   "Heat" tracker: too much public activity draws assassins.
*   Must balance investigation with evasion.
*   No long rests in unsafe locations.

### 5. **Realistic Combat**
*   Fights are quick and lethal, not prolonged.
*   Environmental improvisation (pens as weapons, books as shields).
*   Escape is often better than victory.
*   Damage is realistic—getting shot matters.

### 6. **Identity Proliferation**
*   Bourne has dozens of false identities (passports, credit cards).
*   Can assume different personas for infiltration.
*   Tracking which identity is burned versus usable.
*   Creates paranoia—do you even know your real name?

### 7. **The Moral Cost Tracker**
*   As memories return, track crimes committed.
*   Each revealed assassination weighs on character.
*   Affects roleplaying and relationship with Marie.
*   Mechanically: can gain PTSD conditions, nightmares, guilt.

### 8. **Pattern Recognition**
*   Bourne sees tactical situations instinctively.
*   Can identify exits, weapons, threats automatically.
*   Mechanically: passive Perception very high, tactical insight bonuses.
*   But this gift is reminder of conditioning.

## The Treadstone Program (The Conspiracy)

**What It Is:**
*   Black ops assassination program hidden within CIA equivalent
*   Recruits volunteers (usually damaged people with military backgrounds)
*   Erases their identities and conditions them through psychological trauma
*   Creates perfect assassins: skilled, deniable, expendable
*   If operative fails or becomes liability, they're "retired" (killed)

**The Conditioning:**
*   Sleep deprivation, sensory manipulation, psychological breaking
*   Rebuild operative as weapon, erasing personality
*   Implant triggers and commands
*   Multiple identities to prevent attachment to any one
*   Moral framework is dissolved—kill on command

**Why It Failed With Bourne:**
*   Some core morality survived conditioning
*   Refused assassination in front of children
*   Human conscience reasserted itself
*   Now he's a liability who knows too much

**Other Operatives:**
*   Multiple "weapons" created
*   Some still functional (The Professor)
*   Others retired or failed
*   Bourne is most skilled but most dangerous to program

## Campaign Themes

*   **Identity and Memory:** Who are you without your memories?
*   **Moral Culpability:** Are you guilty for crimes you don't remember committing?
*   **Agency and Control:** Can a conditioned weapon reclaim free will?
*   **Trust and Paranoia:** Everyone could be an enemy.
*   **Redemption:** Can you atone for what you were forced to become?
*   **Conspiracy:** Governments commit atrocities in the name of security.

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign succeeds when:
*   Bourne discovers his full identity and past
*   The Treadstone conspiracy is exposed or destroyed
*   Bourne escapes the pursuit (at least temporarily)
*   Bourne makes peace with who he was and chooses who he'll be
*   Marie survives (if she's been part of the journey)

The "victory" is bittersweet—you've won but at great cost.

## Possible Endings

**Ending A — Exposure:**
*   Treadstone publicly revealed, shut down
*   Bourne testifies, faces legal consequences for some crimes
*   Pardoned due to conditioning, but reputation destroyed
*   Lives in shadow but conspiracy is ended

**Ending B — Disappearance:**
*   Destroys evidence, eliminates leadership
*   Vanishes with Marie into anonymity
*   Program continues under new name
*   Bourne is free but justice is incomplete

**Ending C — The New Weapon:**
*   Takes control of Treadstone
*   Reforms it to target truly evil people
*   Becomes what he hated but directs it toward good
*   Compromised ending—power corrupts

**Ending D — Suicide Run:**
*   Kills all Treadstone leadership in final assault
*   Dies stopping the program
*   Heroic sacrifice, complete redemption
*   Dark ending but clean

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Collaborate with player on Bourne's past (or keep it secret, revealing through play)
*   Pre-plan key flashback scenes to drop at dramatic moments
*   Create detailed Treadstone file on Bourne—his missions, targets, training
*   Design realistic combat encounters (tactical, environmental, quick)
*   Study spy thrillers for pacing—alternating action and investigation
*   Make pursuers competent—they should nearly catch Bourne regularly
*   Marie must be more than love interest—give her agency and skills
*   Each revealed memory should have emotional impact
*   Balance action setpieces with quiet character moments
*   The conspiracy should feel real—bureaucratic evil, not cartoonish
*   Conklin and Abbott should believe they're protecting the realm
*   Other Treadstone operatives are victims too—sympathetic antagonists
*   Final choice should have no clear "right" answer
*   Bourne's guilt over past must be addressed, not dismissed

*   Marie in danger due to Bourne's past
*   Bourne recruited to stop worse conspiracy
*   Other Treadstone operatives awakening and seeking answers
*   Bourne's original identity resurfaces—family, past life
*   The program was just one branch of larger conspiracy
