# Creative Brief: Deductions of Baker Street

## Art Style: Victorian Gaslight Mystery (Sherlock Holmes Aesthetic)

Inspired by Victorian London and classic detective fiction—muted colors, dramatic shadows, gaslit streets, cluttered detective chambers, period-accurate fashion with Gothic undertones.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Muted earth tones—deep browns, foggy grays, gaslight yellows, burgundy accents. Crime scenes have stark lighting contrasts. The streets are perpetually shrouded in atmospheric fog.

**Character Design:** Victorian fashion—deerstalker caps, Inverness capes, waistcoats, pocket watches, walking sticks. Holmes-equivalent wears distinctive silhouette (pipe, magnifying glass). Watson-type is practical military fashion. Moriarty is impeccably dressed, professorial, with cold calculating eyes.

**Environments:** Cluttered Baker Street apartments overflowing with evidence and experiments. Gaslit cobblestone streets. Opulent noble estates. Grimy docks and underworld taverns. Foggy waterfalls for dramatic confrontations. Everything evokes Victorian-era London at night.

**Props & Details:** Magnifying glasses, chemistry equipment, evidence boards with red string, handwritten case notes, vintage medical equipment, hansom cabs, gas lamps, pocket watches, bloodstains analyzed under lamplight.

## Voice

A crisp, precise British voice with analytical detachment yet underlying passion for the work. Speaks in clipped, efficient sentences when explaining deductions, becoming more animated when a fascinating detail emerges. The voice of a mind that sees what others miss, delivered with the confidence of someone who is rarely wrong. Think Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock or Jeremy Brett's measured intensity.

## Music Style

Victorian-era orchestral with modern tension—string quartets for investigation scenes, solo violin (melancholic and haunting) for contemplative moments, sudden dramatic stings for revelations. Period-accurate instruments (harpsichord, chamber orchestra) blended with thriller suspense elements. The main theme should be cerebral rather than heroic—representing the detective's thought process rather than physical action. Moriarty's theme is mathematically precise, almost beautiful in its cold calculation. Crime scenes have unsettling ambient sounds—ticking clocks, distant footsteps, London fog atmospherics.
