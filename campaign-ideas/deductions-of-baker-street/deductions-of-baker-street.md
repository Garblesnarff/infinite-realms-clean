## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Intellectual Challenges:** Puzzles require careful observation, note-taking, and logical deduction. The DM won't hand-hold.
*   **Red Herrings:** Multiple false leads and misleading evidence require players to think critically.
*   **Investigation Skills:** Success depends on asking the right questions, examining crime scenes thoroughly, and connecting disparate clues.
*   **Social Combat:** Interrogations, manipulation of suspects, and navigating high society require finesse.
*   **Moriarty's Genius:** The final antagonist is always three steps ahead, requiring players to outthink rather than outfight him.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — Establishing the Practice (Sessions 1–3):** The party solves their first major case (The Hound of the Shadowfell), establishing their reputation. Introduction to their Baker Street equivalent, loyal companions, and the city's criminal underworld.

*   **Act II — The Impossible Crimes (Sessions 4–7):** A series of seemingly supernatural mysteries: locked room murders, impossible thefts, disappearances that defy explanation. Each case has a rational solution requiring brilliant deduction.

*   **Act III — The Web Tightens (Sessions 8–11):** Patterns emerge connecting the cases. Evidence points to a criminal mastermind orchestrating everything. Introduction of Professor Moriarty—the Napoleon of Crime. The party realizes they're being tested.

*   **Act IV — Reichenbach Falls (Sessions 12–15):** Direct confrontation with Moriarty's organization. The party must dismantle his network while he simultaneously works to destroy them. Climax involves a deadly game of wits at a dramatic location where only intelligence, not violence, determines the winner.

## Central Conflict

Intelligence versus Intelligence. Unlike traditional D&D where martial prowess or magical power determines outcomes, this campaign rewards observation, logic, and deduction. The party must prove that reason and investigation can triumph over criminal genius. Moriarty represents the corruption of pure intellect—brilliance without morality. The central question: can good people thinking clearly defeat evil people thinking cleverly?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Deduction System**
*   When examining crime scenes, players make Investigation, Perception, and Insight checks. Success reveals clues (physical evidence, behavioral tells, timeline inconsistencies).
*   Players must connect clues themselves—the DM provides facts, not conclusions.
*   Reward creative logical leaps with Inspiration and narrative progress.

### 2. **Holmes's Mind Palace**
*   One PC (or NPC Holmes) can enter a mental visualization space to organize clues and test theories.
*   Mechanically: allows re-rolling failed Investigation checks if the player can explain their reasoning.

### 3. **The Casebook**
*   Players maintain an actual notebook of clues, suspects, timelines, and theories.
*   DM rewards thorough documentation with bonuses to future Investigation checks.

### 4. **Social Deduction**
*   Interrogations are skill challenges involving Insight (read tells), Deception (bluff about evidence), Intimidation (pressure suspects), and Persuasion (earn trust).
*   NPCs have secrets unrelated to crimes—red herrings that feel real.

### 5. **Moriarty's Countermoves**
*   When the party succeeds at a major investigation, Moriarty responds with a counter-scheme.
*   Track a "Heat" meter—too much success too quickly makes Moriarty act directly against them.

### 6. **The Impossible Crime Generator**
*   Each mystery has three components: Victim (who/why), Method (how—seems impossible), and Culprit (who benefits).
*   The "impossible" element always has a rational explanation requiring outside-the-box thinking.

### 7. **Disguise and Infiltration**
*   Characters can invest in disguise kits and Performance/Deception to infiltrate suspects' circles.
*   Success depends on researching the role beforehand and maintaining cover.

## Sample Mysteries

### **The Speckled Band**
A locked room murder where the victim was found dead with no visible wounds, no entry points, and only mysterious whistling heard before death. Solution: trained poisonous snake sent through ventilation.

### **The Copper Beeches**
A governess is hired under strange conditions—must cut hair, wear specific dresses, sit in windows. Investigation reveals plot to impersonate a kidnapped heiress.

### **The Norwood Builder**
A young man is accused of murder when a body is found in a burned building and all evidence points to him. The "victim" actually faked his death to frame an enemy.

### **A Scandal in Bohemia**
A royal figure is being blackmailed with compromising evidence. The party must retrieve it from the one person clever enough to hide it from them—Irene Adler.

## Campaign Themes

*   **The Power of Observation:** Details matter. Nothing is insignificant.
*   **Reason Over Force:** Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent detective.
*   **The Criminal Mind:** Understanding evil requires thinking like evil.
*   **Loyalty and Friendship:** Watson's steadiness balances Holmes's brilliance.
*   **The Game:** Detection is an intellectual competition, and the thrill is in the chase.

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign succeeds when:
*   The party solves the major connected mystery arc
*   Moriarty's criminal organization is dismantled (or Moriarty himself is defeated/arrested)
*   They prove that justice and reason can triumph over criminal genius
*   Their reputation as master detectives is secured beyond doubt

The ultimate victory isn't killing Moriarty—it's outsmarting him at his own game and proving that good, applied intelligently, is stronger than evil, however brilliant.

---

## Failure States

*   Moriarty frames the party for crimes, destroying their reputation
*   Innocents die because the party fails to solve cases in time
*   The party resorts to violence instead of investigation, losing moral high ground
*   Moriarty escapes completely, having learned all their methods

---

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Pre-plan each mystery with clear timelines, evidence trails, and red herrings
*   Keep detailed NPC notes on secrets, motivations, and alibis
*   Be prepared to improvise when players make unexpected deductive leaps
*   Never punish clever player reasoning even if it bypasses planned content
*   Seed Moriarty's presence early through seemingly unconnected details
*   Read classic Holmes stories for inspiration on mystery structures
*   Practice the art of describing scenes richly without giving away solutions
