# Creative Brief: The Cannibal Peninsula

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Wilderness Survival Horror (The Forest-inspired)

Inspired by the tense, naturalistic horror of *The Forest*, blending realistic wilderness survival with body horror and underground dread. This style emphasizes the contrast between the beautiful but deadly forest surface and the nightmarish, claustrophobic caves below.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Naturalistic Horror:** The forest should feel real and beautiful, but tainted by the presence of something deeply wrong—effigies, cannibals, and signs of violence.
*   **Body Horror:** Cannibals and mutants are disturbing, with unnatural proportions, pale skin, and grotesque mutations.
*   **Darkness & Claustrophobia:** Underground scenes should feel oppressive, with limited light and tight spaces creating tension.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tense, horrific, desperate, mysterious, escalating dread, survival, body horror, claustrophobic.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of being watched and hunted. The mood shifts from cautious exploration on the surface to suffocating terror in the caves.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed, with rough, organic textures for the forest and disturbing, distorted forms for cannibals and mutants.
*   **Forms:** Natural forest shapes (trees, undergrowth, rocks) contrasted with unnatural effigies (twisted bones, hanging corpses). Mutants have elongated limbs, extra appendages, and asymmetrical bodies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic, horror-inspired digital painting of a dense forest. Rough, organic textures dominate. In the foreground, a grotesque effigy made of bones and cloth hangs from a tree, a warning of danger."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, naturalistic greens and browns for the forest, shifting to cold blues and grays in the caves. Splashes of red (blood) and sickly yellows (infection, mutation).
*   **Surface Colors:** Deep forest greens, earthy browns, overcast grays.
*   **Underground Colors:** Cold stone grays, blacks, with unnatural bioluminescent blues and the sickly glow of arcane lights in the Facility.
*   **Cannibal/Mutant Colors:** Pale, corpse-like skin, raw red muscle, diseased yellows and greens.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of deep forest greens and earthy browns under an overcast sky. A pale, emaciated cannibal with raw, red wounds stands at the edge of the clearing, its skin an unnatural, corpse-like white."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers in improvised, crafted gear (hide armor, bone weapons, cloth wraps). They look battle-worn and desperate.
*   **Cannibals:** Pale, emaciated humanoids with elongated limbs, often naked or wearing scraps of rotting cloth. They move unnaturally, crawling or hunched.
*   **Mutants:** Horrific abominations with multiple limbs, exposed organs, and asymmetrical bodies. Some are massive brutes, others are skittering, spider-like horrors.
*   **Expression:** Adventurers show fear, determination, and exhaustion. Cannibals are feral and emotionless. Mutants are grotesque and nightmarish.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer wearing crude hide armor and wielding a sharpened spear, their face streaked with dirt and blood. Nearby, a pale cannibal with elongated arms and a hunched posture crawls toward them, its face twisted in a feral grimace."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Dense, realistic forests with thick undergrowth, towering trees, and natural obstacles. Caves are dark, wet, and claustrophobic.
*   **Atmosphere:** The forest is beautiful but menacing, with an ever-present sense of being watched. Caves are oppressive and filled with the unknown.
*   **Details:** Effigies marking territory, cannibal camps with bones and fires, cave walls slick with moisture, abandoned Facility labs with alchemical equipment and holding cells.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dense, realistic forest with towering pine trees and thick undergrowth. In a clearing, a crude camp made of bones, hides, and scavenged metal sits abandoned. Nearby, a grotesque effigy made of human remains hangs from a tree branch."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Naturalistic lighting on the surface (overcast, diffused sunlight). Underground, lighting is harsh and limited (torches, bioluminescence, arcane lights).
*   **Shadows:** Deep, long shadows in the forest create hiding spots for enemies. Total darkness in the caves, broken only by the party's light sources.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates tension—what lurks just beyond the light? Darkness is a constant threat.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the flickering light of torches held by the adventurers, casting harsh, dancing shadows on the wet cave walls. Beyond the light, the darkness is absolute, suggesting unseen horrors."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Tight, claustrophobic framing in the caves. Wider shots on the surface, but with a sense of encroaching danger at the edges.
*   **Techniques:** Use low angles to make threats seem larger and more imposing. Frame characters surrounded by darkness or effigies to create tension. Show the scale of the cave network or the forest's vastness to emphasize isolation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot looking up at a massive, multi-limbed mutant abomination blocking a narrow cave passage. The adventurers, tiny in comparison, hold up torches, their faces lit by the flickering flames as they prepare to fight or flee."

## Voice

A tense, hushed male voice with a slight Southern American accent, pacing that is slow and deliberate, as if trying not to attract attention. The emotion is controlled fear with moments of rising panic. Audio quality is realistic with environmental sounds—rustling leaves, distant howls, dripping water. Role: A survivor whispering instructions to others, or a narrator recounting a harrowing tale of survival in the wilderness.
