### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Cannibal Peninsula**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** After their airship crashes on a remote, forested peninsula, the party discovers that one of their companions—a young NPC they were escorting—has been kidnapped by pale, deformed cannibals. To survive and rescue the child, they must build shelter, craft weapons, and explore the hostile wilderness while fighting off increasingly aggressive mutant attacks. As they delve deeper into the peninsula's network of caves, they uncover the horrifying truth: a secret arcane research facility has been conducting experiments on captives, creating the cannibals and worse abominations. The rescue mission becomes a fight to escape the peninsula and expose the conspiracy before they too become test subjects.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Facility: a secret arcane research site established 50 years ago by a rogue mage consortium to conduct illegal experiments on humanoid subjects.
    *   Write the history of how the first test subjects were transformed into the cannibals, escaping containment and establishing tribes on the peninsula.
    *   Describe the discovery of an ancient artifact in the peninsula's deepest cave, which the Facility uses to power their most extreme mutations.
    *   Explain the fate of previous airship crashes—the peninsula's unusual magnetic properties cause navigational failures, providing the Facility with a steady supply of "subjects."
    *   Detail the hierarchy and culture of the cannibal tribes: they worship the "Bright Below" (the Facility) and believe the researchers are gods.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Facility Researchers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To perfect arcane mutation magic, creating the ultimate bio-weapon or achieving physical immortality through transformation.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Dr. Elara Cross, with a team of 5-6 mages and alchemists, plus construct guards.
        *   **Public Agenda:** (None. They are a secret organization.)
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To use the ancient artifact to transcend mortality, even if it means sacrificing hundreds of test subjects.
        *   **Assets:** The Facility (labs, holding cells, defenses), the Artifact, construct guards, captured test subjects.
        *   **Relationships:** Command the cannibals (who see them as gods); hostile to intruders; funded by shadowy external backers.
    *   **The Cannibal Tribes** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To survive, hunt, and serve the "gods" in the Bright Below.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Tribal, led by the strongest warriors. Megan Cross is the most powerful chieftain.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Defend territory, hunt for food, capture intruders for the gods.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some (like Megan) secretly hate the Facility but lack the power to rebel.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers, knowledge of the peninsula, primitive weapons, stealth.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve the Facility out of fear and indoctrination; hostile to all outsiders.
    *   **The Mutant Abominations** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** None. They are mindless, aggressive results of failed experiments.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None. They exist in isolation or small groups.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Attack anything that moves.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None. They are not sentient.
        *   **Assets:** Immense strength, horrific mutations, resistance to pain.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to everyone, including cannibals and Facility staff.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Timmy:** The kidnapped child, brave but terrified, potentially mutated by experiments.
    *   **Dr. Elara Cross:** The cold, amoral head researcher, a victim-turned-monster.
    *   **Megan Cross:** Elara's feral, mutated daughter, leader of the most aggressive cannibal tribe.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Desperate Fellow Survivor"
    *   "Feral Cannibal Scout"
    *   "Horrific Multi-limbed Mutant"
    *   "Ruthless Facility Guard (Construct)"
    *   "Traumatized Former Test Subject"

**5. Location Blueprints**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party destroys multiple effigies or kills cannibal leaders.
    *   **THEN:** The cannibal tribes become more aggressive, launching coordinated attacks on the base. Generate a major siege encounter.
    *   **IF:** The party delays the rescue for too long (more than 8 sessions).
    *   **THEN:** Timmy undergoes significant mutation. When rescued, he has new, unsettling abilities and may struggle with his humanity. This affects the party's reward and relationship with his family.
    *   **IF:** The party allies with Megan Cross, showing her they can help her.
    *   **THEN:** She provides safe passage through cannibal territory and reveals secret entrances to the Facility. However, she demands they kill Dr. Cross as payment.
    *   **IF:** The party destroys the Artifact in the Facility.
    *   **THEN:** The Facility loses power. Mutants go berserk, and the cave system begins to collapse. The party must escape immediately in a timed sequence.
    *   **IF:** The party rescues Timmy but chooses to expose the Facility's existence to the outside world.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a follow-up scenario where powerful nobles and mage guilds send investigators. The party may be hailed as heroes or targeted by the Facility's shadowy backers for knowing too much.
