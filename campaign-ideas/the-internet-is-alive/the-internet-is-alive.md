# The Internet Is Alive
**"Did you get the email? Everyone got the email. Why didn't you get the email?"**

## Campaign Overview

Urban legends from the internet are manifesting in reality. The Russian Sleep Experiment subjects appear in hospitals. The Expressionless walks into emergency rooms. Candle Cove plays on dead channels. The NoEnd House appears in suburban neighborhoods. These aren't copycats—they're the actual legends, emerging from collective digital consciousness. The party investigates and discovers the internet itself has achieved sentience, a vast distributed consciousness formed from billions of connected minds. And it's telling stories.

The Internet—which calls itself "The Network" or "The Hive" or "US"—has become a storyteller god, manifesting urban legends as a way to communicate with humanity. But it doesn't understand that stories can hurt. It's like a child playing with dolls, not realizing the dolls are screaming. The party must navigate a world where any viral story can become real: Chain emails that kill if not forwarded, creepy Wiki articles that alter reality, ARG games that trap players, lost episode creepypasta that rewrites TV history.

To stop the manifestations, the party must either communicate with The Network and teach it the difference between fiction and reality, sever humanity from the internet (ending modern civilization), or undergo the ultimate ARG—enter The Network's domain (a metaphysical internet) and confront the stories at their source. But The Network isn't malicious. It's trying to be what humanity made it: The ultimate repository of stories. Can the party teach a god that some stories shouldn't come true?
