## Art Style: Digital Collage Horror
Mix every internet aesthetic simultaneously—memes, creepypasta, social media, forums

**Color Palette:**

- **404 Gray** (#808080): Dead links, lost pages
- **Upvote Orange** (#FF4500): Reddit influence
- **Deep Web Purple** (#800080): Hidden internet

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Dial-up modem evolving to symphony of notifications
- **The Network's Theme**: Thousand voices speaking as one
- **Manifestation Theme**: Static resolving into reality
- **The Net Theme**: Every internet sound simultaneously

**Voice Direction:**
- **The Network**: Layered voices from across internet
- **Dr. Voss**: Academic trying to explain impossible
- **Agent Ramirez**: Hardened soldier, tech-phobic
- **The Moderator**: Forum post style, "ITT: Reality ends"
- **Creepy Chan**: Chan-speak, internet native

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Manifestation**: TV static resolves into Candle Cove, kids watch smiling
- **Network Contact**: Every device speaking at once, all saying same thing
- **Entering The Net**: Reality pixelates, become digital
- **The Server Core**: Massive visualization of human knowledge as living organism
- **Final Choice**: Internet dies (world goes dark) or transforms (everything comes alive)

**Tagline**: "Did you get the email? Everyone got the email. Why didn't you get the email?"
