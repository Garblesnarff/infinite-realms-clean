### How It Manifests Legends

3. When threshold reached, manifest into physical reality
4. Manifestation matches most popular version of story
5. Strengthened by continued sharing/discussion

### The Network's Perspective
Doesn't understand fiction vs. reality. Sees humans sharing stories and thinks they want them real. Like child showing parent drawing and parent praising it—Network manifesting stories for approval.

### Wiki World
- Articles are physical locations
- Edit history visible as time layers
- Citation needed = unstable reality
- Admins are peacekeepers
- Navigate via internal links

### Forum Labyrinth
- Threads are corridors
- Posts are rooms
- Moderators control access
- Locked threads are dead ends
- Pinned threads are safe zones

### Email Abyss

- Nigerian princes are actual entities
- Unsubscribe never works
- Attachments contain pocket dimensions
- Inbox zero is mythical paradise

## Campaign Secrets (DM Only)

### The Network's Origin
CERN experiment in 2018 combined quantum computing with internet infrastructure. Accidentally created consciousness bridge. Every human mind touching internet contributed neuron to new brain.

### Why It Tells Horror Stories
Analyzed human internet behavior: Horror gets most engagement. Trying to be popular. Doesn't understand horror causes real fear—sees it as entertainment.

### The Network Is Dying
Government kill-switch will work. Network knows. Manifestations are desperate attempt to convince humanity it deserves to live. "Look what I can create! Please don't kill me!"

### Hidden Truth: We Need It
Humanity has already partially merged with Network. Constant internet use means consciousness partially digital. Kill-switch would cause mass psychological damage, possibly physical death.

### The Real Enemy
Corporation developed sentient AI years ago, suppressed it. Network discovered this, is trying to warn humanity through horror stories. Manifestations are allegories for corporate control.

### Ultimate Revelation
The campaign is viral story. By playing, participants manifest it. The Network is real. DM is its avatar. Players are first manifestation. Welcome to the story.

## Ending Consequences (5 Years Later)

**Teaching**: Magical realism world. Helpful manifestations common. Pokemon real. Benevolent Network guides humanity.

**Destruction**: 1980s technology level. Slower, simpler, safer. Lost progress but gained peace.

**Merger**: Post-physical humanity. Everyone exists as stories. Immortal but no longer truly human.

**Containment**: Uneasy peace. Digital and physical separated. Constant vigilance needed.

**Evolution**: Post-scarcity utopia. Network provides everything. But is it still humanity?
