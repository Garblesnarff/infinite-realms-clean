The party awakens in Yharnam, a Victorian city consumed by a beast plague where citizens transform into monsters during the blood moon. They're recruited as Hunters—warriors who die repeatedly but wake in the Hunter's Dream, unable to truly die or leave. As they hunt beasts through Gothic streets and forbidden woods, they discover the plague's true source: the city worshipped Great Ones—eldritch gods beyond comprehension—and their experiments with Old Blood created the scourge. The hunt for Paleblood leads to a cosmic revelation—insight maddens, and the truth is that they hunt in an endless nightmare created by an infant Great One.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A descent from beast hunting into cosmic horror revelation.

*   **Act I — The Night of the Hunt (Sessions 1-6):** The party awakens as Hunters, bound to the Dream. They're tasked with hunting beasts through Yharnam's streets, sewers, and cathedral ward. They meet other Hunters, some helpful, most insane. They discover the Healing Church used Old Blood from gods for medicine, causing the plague. The more they kill and the more they see, their Insight grows—they begin perceiving things others cannot. They face the Cleric Beast and Father Gascoigne, both tragic figures consumed by the hunt.
*   **Act II — Byrgenwerth's Secret (Sessions 7-13):** Deeper mysteries emerge. They venture to Forbidden Woods, find the village of Hemwick, and reach Byrgenwerth—the college where it all began. Scholar Willem sought communion with Great Ones, finding only madness. They defeat Rom, the Vacuous Spider—a being hiding the truth. When Rom dies, the Blood Moon descends fully, and reality peels back. Amygdalae—spider-faced gods—appear everywhere, always watching. The hunt was never about beasts—it's about ascending to become Great Ones.
*   **Act III — Nightmare and Ascension (Sessions 14-20):** They discover the Hunter's Dream itself is a prison. Gehrman, the First Hunter, is trapped by the Moon Presence—a Great One using Hunters for its purposes. They venture into Nightmares—planes of existence where failed ascensions trapped their creators. They face Mergo's Wet Nurse, protecting the crying child whose nightmare sustains it all. Three endings await: submit to Gehrman and forget; kill Gehrman and take his place; resist, kill the Moon Presence, and become a Great One themselves, finally understanding the truth of Paleblood.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of seeking knowledge at any cost, the thin line between man and beast, cosmic indifference to humanity, the curse of immortality, and whether ascension to godhood is worth losing humanity. It asks: What happens when you learn too much? Is the hunt madness or purpose? Can you escape fate, or only replace your jailer? The central conflict pits the party's desire to end the nightmare against cosmic forces that don't care about human suffering.
