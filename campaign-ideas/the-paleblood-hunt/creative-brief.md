# Creative Brief: The Paleblood Hunt

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Victorian Gothic meets Lovecraftian Horror (Bloodborne-inspired)

Inspired by the dark, detailed aesthetic of *Bloodborne*. This style captures Victorian architecture in decay, beast transformations, cosmic entities beyond comprehension, blood-soaked streets, and the progression from Gothic horror to cosmic revelation. Everything is beautiful in its grotesqueness.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Gothic Architecture:** Spires, gargoyles, cobblestones, gaslights, Victorian decay
*   **Blood and Beasts:** Werewolf-like transformations, visceral combat, blood everywhere
*   **Cosmic Horror:** Spider-faced gods, impossible geometry, eyes manifesting everywhere
*   **Dark with Moonlight:** Perpetual night, blood moon lighting, deep shadows

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Victorian Gothic, cosmic horror, beast plague, blood moon, eyes on the inside, hunt or be hunted, madness
*   **Feeling:** Hunting through burning streets while citizens transform. The realization that gods watch from everywhere. Insight maddening.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Yharnam:** Dark grays and blacks, orange fire, dried blood reds, stone and cobblestone
*   **Blood Moon:** Deep crimson sky, sickly orange-red lighting, shadows turning purple
*   **Cosmic Elements:** Pale blue-white for Great Ones, ethereal glows, unnatural colors
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of Gothic horror. Dark gray stone buildings with Victorian architecture, gargoyles and spires. Orange firelight from torches and burning buildings. The sky is deep crimson—blood moon overhead. Dried blood stains cobblestones. Long shadows from gaslights. Mist rolling through streets."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Hunters:** Long coats, tricorn hats, multiple weapon harnesses, Victorian nobleman aesthetic gone martial
*   **Beasts:** Emaciated werewolf-like creatures, antlers, too many limbs, asymmetrical mutations
*   **Great Ones:** Lovecraftian—Amygdala with spider faces, Moon Presence pale and skeletal, impossible anatomies
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Hunter in a long black leather coat with capelet, tricorn hat, carrying a transforming saw-cleaver weapon. Victorian-era clothing adapted for combat. Determined but weary expression. Blood-splattered. Behind them, a massive beast with antlers, elongated limbs, and exposed muscle tissue. Gothic street with gaslights."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Yharnam:** Multi-level Victorian city, cobblestone streets, massive cathedrals, everything vertical
*   **Burning Streets:** Citizens with torches and pitchforks, pyres, Gothic nightmare
*   **Forbidden Woods:** Twisted ancient trees, snake corpses, ritual sites, village worshipping gods
*   **Nightmare Realms:** Impossible architecture, floating platforms, cosmic void backgrounds
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Victorian Gothic cathedral interior: massive vaulted ceilings, stone pillars with intricate carvings, stained glass showing cosmic imagery. Blood pooled on floors. Candles everywhere creating dramatic lighting. In the distance, a massive altar. The scale emphasizes human smallness. Blood moon visible through broken windows."

**5. Cosmic Horror Elements:**
*   **Amygdalae:** Spider-faced entities with multiple arms clinging to buildings
*   **Great Ones:** Pale, skeletal, alien geometries, too many or too few features
*   **Eyes:** Manifesting everywhere when Insight is high—in walls, shadows, the sky
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive cosmic horror: Amygdala—a spider-like creature with six arms, each hand having too many fingers. A head that's simultaneously a spider's face and something else. Pale gray-blue skin. Clinging to the side of a Gothic building, dwarfing it. Blood moon behind it. Perspective emphasizes its impossible scale."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Moonlight:** Strong backlighting, deep shadows, silhouettes
*   **Fire and Blood:** Warm orange contrasting cool moonlight
*   **Cosmic Glow:** Pale ethereal light from Great Ones, unnatural and unsettling
*   **Prompt Example:** "...cinematic lighting with blood moon as primary source. Deep crimson light casts long shadows. Orange firelight from torches creates warm pools. Pale blue-white cosmic energy emanates from eldritch symbols. High contrast between light and shadow. Volumetric fog diffusing light dramatically."

## Voice

A voice between exhaustion and determination, like someone who's died countless times but refuses to stop. The pacing is deliberate, punctuated by revelation. The tone shifts between Gothic dread, cosmic awe-terror, and grim resolve. There's an underlying theme of seeking knowledge that destroys sanity. Role: The voice of the eternal Hunter.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Orchestral with choir, Gothic cathedral organs, building to cosmic horror dissonance. Every boss has elaborate Latin or nonsense-language choral arrangements.
*   **Yharnam Streets:** Ambient dread—distant screams, fire crackling, mob chants, musical stings.
*   **Boss Battles:** Full orchestra with massive choirs, aggressive strings, Gothic organs. Each boss has unique leitmotif.
*   **Cleric Beast:** Violent strings, brass, representing animalistic fury.
*   **Father Gascoigne:** Tragic Latin choir, building intensity, music box melody haunts the track.
*   **Rom:** Ethereal, cosmic, revealing truth through sound.
*   **Mergo's Wet Nurse:** Lullaby turned horrifying, maternal protection gone wrong.
*   **Gehrman:** Melancholic piano and strings, The First Hunter's tragic theme.
*   **Moon Presence:** Dissonant, alien, cosmic horror made sound.
*   **Hunter's Dream:** Peaceful, haunting music box melody, respite that's also a prison.
