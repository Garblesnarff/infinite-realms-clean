# The Seven and the Damned

*An Anti-Hero Vigilante / Corporate Conspiracy campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Seven and the Damned
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Superhero / Corporate Conspiracy / Anti-Hero Vigilante / Satire
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** evil superheroes, corporate control, anti-hero vigilantes, power corrupts, satire, ultraviolence, "supes ain't gods"
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of ordinary people—blackmailed, traumatized, or seeking revenge—who discover that the realm's beloved superheroes ("Supes") are actually monsters. The Seven, the most powerful heroes, are corporate puppets of Vought Corporation, committing atrocities covered up by PR teams. The party must expose the truth using blackmail, violence, and a Supe-killing substance called Compound X, knowing that fighting gods makes them monsters too.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Direct combat with Supes is suicide. Success comes from ambushes, Compound X weapons, psychological warfare, and blackmail.
*   **Investigation:** Heavy emphasis on gathering evidence, hacking corporate files, and understanding Vought's coverups.
*   **Consequences:** Every action escalates Vought's response. Moral lines blur. The party must decide how far they'll go.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc about fighting monsters while becoming one.

*   **Act I — The Recruitment (Sessions 1–3):** The party's lives are destroyed by Supes. They're recruited by Butcher—a man obsessed with killing Homelander (the strongest Supe). They obtain Compound X and kill their first Supe.
*   **Act II — The Seven's Secrets (Sessions 4–7):** The party infiltrates Vought, gathering evidence of Supe atrocities. They discover Supes are created through Compound V—a serum given to babies. They blackmail lower-level Supes into cooperation.
*   **Act III — Vought Strikes Back (Sessions 8–11):** Vought deploys Supes to hunt the party. The public is turned against them. The party must expose Compound V publicly while fighting increasingly powerful enemies.
*   **Act IV — Scorched Earth (Sessions 12–15):** Homelander snaps, becoming openly tyrannical. The party launches a final assault on Vought Tower, using every dirty trick to bring down the Seven and destroy Vought—even if it means becoming the villains.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Tragedy"
*   Each party member has their life destroyed by a Supe's "accident"—collateral damage covered up by Vought PR.
*   They're approached by Butcher, who offers revenge if they join him hunting Supes.
**Escalation:** Butcher introduces them to Compound X—a substance that temporarily grants Supe-killing abilities.

### Session 2 — "Translucent"
*   The party's first target: Translucent, an invisible Supe spying for Vought.
*   They trap him using electricity (Compound X disrupts his powers) and interrogate him.
*   He reveals Supes have no oversight—they do whatever they want, and Vought covers it up.
**Escalation:** Killing Translucent makes the party terrorists in Vought's eyes. The Seven begin hunting them.

### Session 3 — "Get Some"
*   The party attends a Supe convention (Vought Expo), infiltrating as fans.
*   They gather evidence: videos of Supes killing civilians, financial records linking Vought to terrorism.
*   They're nearly caught by A-Train, the speedster Supe.
**Escalation:** Vought mobilizes its PR machine against the party, branding them extremists.

### Session 4 — "The Female"
*   The party rescues a mute woman from Vought labs—she was experimented on with Compound V.
*   She has super strength and regeneration but is traumatized and violent.
*   She joins the party, providing muscle against Supes.
**Escalation:** The party realizes Compound V is given to babies without consent—creating Supes is human experimentation.

### Session 5 — "Good for the Soul"

*   She reveals internal corruption: sexual assault, murder coverups, staged "rescues."
*   She becomes their inside informant.
**Escalation:** Deep (aquatic Supe) is found dead. The Seven suspect an internal traitor.

### Session 6 — "The Innocents"
*   The party discovers Flight 37—a plane Homelander and Queen Maeve failed to save, letting everyone die to protect their image.
*   Video evidence could destroy Homelander's reputation.
**Escalation:** Homelander becomes paranoid, using X-ray vision and super hearing to find the party.

### Session 7 — "The Self-Preservation Society"
*   The party raids a Vought lab, stealing Compound V samples and research data.

**Escalation:** The evidence is released online. Public opinion begins shifting against Vought.

### Session 8 — "Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men"
*   Vought counters by deploying Stormfront, a Supe with electrical powers—secretly a decades-old fascist.

**Escalation:** Vought uses social media manipulation, turning the public against the party.

### Session 9 — "Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker"
*   Butcher reveals his tragic past: Homelander assaulted his wife, driving Butcher's obsession.

**Escalation:** Internal conflict: is the party freedom fighters or Butcher's revenge squad?

### Session 10 — "What I Know"

### Session 11 — "You Found Me"

**Escalation:** Homelander publicly murders a protestor. He's done pretending to be heroic.

### Session 12 — "The Big Ride"
*   The party acquires a weapon that can kill Homelander—but using it requires suicide bombing proximity.
*   They debate: is killing one monster worth becoming monsters themselves?
**Escalation:** Homelander seizes control of Vought, becoming openly tyrannical.

### Session 13 — "The Bloody Doors Off"
*   The party assaults Vought Tower, fighting through The Seven and private security.
*   They use Compound X, explosives, blackmail, and every dirty trick.
**Escalation:** Queen Maeve, disgusted by Homelander, betrays him and helps the party.

### Session 14 — "The Reckoning"
*   Final battle with Homelander. The party uses Compound X weapons, environment, and teamwork.
*   Someone dies—possibly Butcher, possibly a PC, possibly an NPC ally.
*   Homelander is killed or permanently depowered.
**Escalation:** Vought collapses. But power vacuums create chaos.

### Session 15 — "What We Become"
*   The party faces consequences—they're heroes to some, villains to others.
*   New Supes emerge. The system that created them still exists.
*   Final choice: disband and disappear, become official Supe oversight, or continue vigilantism.

## Key Locations

1.  **Vought Tower:** Corporate headquarters, PR machine, Supe residences, labs.
2.  **The Seven's HQ:** Where the most powerful Supes live, train, and commit atrocities.
3.  **The Basement (Safe House):** Where the party plans, stores evidence, and hides.
4.  **Vought Labs:** Human experimentation sites, Compound V production.
5.  **Public Spaces:** Where Supes perform heroics for cameras while committing crimes off-camera.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **power corrupts absolutely**. Supes have godlike powers with no accountability, becoming monsters. The party fights them using violence, blackmail, and moral compromise—becoming monsters themselves. It explores whether ends justify means, whether heroes can exist without oversight, and whether killing monsters makes you one.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Compound X Injections**
*   Grants temporary Supe-level abilities (strength, durability, speed) but has side effects.
*   **Addiction:** Repeated use causes dependency and personality changes.

### 2. **Evidence Gathering**
*   Players collect blackmail material—videos, financial records, testimonies.
*   **Public Opinion:** Releasing evidence shifts public perception, affecting Vought's power.

### 3. **Supe Powers**
*   Each Supe has unique abilities. Direct combat is suicide—players must exploit weaknesses.
*   **Research:** Investigating Supe histories reveals exploitable flaws.

### 4. **Moral Degradation**
*   Every atrocity the party commits (torture, murder of innocents, collateral damage) degrades their morality.
*   **Becoming Villains:** High degradation causes NPCs to fear and oppose them.

### 5. **Vought PR Machine**
*   Vought controls media. Every party action is spun as terrorism.
*   **Counter-PR:** The party must leak evidence strategically to counter propaganda.
