# World-Building Specification Brief: The Buried Empire

**Core Concept**: Discovering a perfectly preserved 10,000-year-old empire buried underground. Archaeological wonder meets cosmic horror as the party learns why it was buried and what sleeps below.

**Lore Prompts**:
* Aethermoor's golden age—achievements in magic, art, technology.
* The Consuming Dark's arrival—what it is and what it wants.
* The Eternal Sleep—desperate plan to preserve civilization while sealing the terror.
* The Mechanism—magical-technological device that buried the entire empire.

**Factions**:
* **The Preservationists**: Surface scholars wanting to study carefully, leave mostly intact.
* **The Restorationists**: Awakened Aethermorians wanting to restore their empire.
* **The Exploiters**: Surface kingdoms wanting to loot technology and magic.
* **The Fearful**: Those who learn the truth and want everything resealed.
* **The Consumed**: Citizens being corrupted by the Consuming Dark as seals weaken.

**Key NPCs**:
* **Empress Solaria**: Awakened ruler, disoriented by 10,000 years passing, trying to restore empire.
* **Mira Dustborn**: Surface archaeologist, values preservation, party's moral anchor.
* **Sentinel ZX-7**: Guardian construct, bound by protocol not to reveal the truth.
* **The Void Sage**: Mad priest who remembers the terror, trying to warn everyone.
* **The Consuming Dark**: Entity that devours civilizations, sealed but stirring.

**Locations**:
* **Grand Entrance**: Massive sealed doors with warnings in dead languages.
* **Crystal Gardens**: Thousands sleeping in stasis, beautiful and haunting.
* **Great Library**: All knowledge of Aethermoor preserved—magic, history, warnings.
* **Throne of Hours**: Empress's palace frozen in time.
* **Forbidden Vaults**: Maximum security, holding the terror, seals weakening.
* **The Mechanism**: Control center for the burial and stasis systems.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF party awakens many Aethermorians THEN seals weaken faster, politics become complex, terror grows stronger.
* IF party studies library thoroughly THEN learn why empire buried itself, can prepare for terror.
* IF surface kingdoms learn of discovery THEN rush to exploit, create conflict with Aethermorians.
* IF seals break completely THEN Consuming Dark is released, threatens all civilizations.
* IF party reactivates Mechanism THEN can rebury empire but must choose who stays awake.
* IF Empress learns truth THEN either becomes ally or desperate tyrant trying to save her people.

**Mechanics**:
* **Archaeological Discovery**: Translating texts, understanding technology, piecing history together.
* **Awakening Control**: Party chooses who to wake and when; each has consequences.
* **Ancient Magic/Tech**: Learning to use powerful lost artifacts.
* **Seal Degradation**: Track weakness of seals; random encounters with corruption increase.
* **Temporal Culture Clash**: Aethermorians are 10,000 years out of time; social complications.
* **The Terror's Influence**: Corruption mechanics for those touched by Consuming Dark.
