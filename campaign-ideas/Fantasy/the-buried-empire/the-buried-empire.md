Deep beneath the earth lies Aethermoor, a perfectly preserved ancient empire that vanished 10,000 years ago—cities, libraries, and wonders frozen in time. When the party discovers an entrance while fleeing bandits, they become the first outsiders to witness this lost civilization. But Aethermoor isn't empty—the inhabitants are still here, preserved in crystalline stasis, and something is trying to wake them. As the party uncovers the empire's secrets, they discover why Aethermoor buried itself: they were fleeing something terrible, and that terror followed them down. The party must solve ancient puzzles, navigate political intrigue among awakening Aethermorians, and decide whether this civilization should be brought back to life or left sleeping forever.
