# Creative Brief: Children of the Planet

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Pre-rendered Cyber-Fantasy with Industrial Gothic (Final Fantasy VII-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic pre-rendered aesthetic of *Final Fantasy VII*. This style captures industrial mega-cities contrasted with natural beauty, cyberpunk technology mixed with high fantasy magic, anime character design, and the visual weight of environmental destruction made beautiful and terrible.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Contrast:** Massive reactors versus flowers, steel cities versus green planet
*   **Cyber-Fantasy Fusion:** High-tech machinery with magical crystals (Materia), guns and swords together
*   **Industrial Beauty:** Rust, pipes, metal, neon signs—beautiful in their oppressive scale
*   **Anime Character Design:** Spiky hair, oversized weapons, expressive faces, distinctive silhouettes

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Eco-punk, corporate dystopia, planetary consciousness, memory and loss, epic scope, bittersweet heroism
*   **Feeling:** Standing under metal plates blotting out the sky. Flowers growing in impossible places. The planet screaming silently as it's drained.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Midgar:** Dark grays, industrial browns, neon greens (Mako), harsh artificial lighting
*   **Slums:** Rust oranges, shadow blacks, occasional neon signs, perpetual twilight
*   **Natural World:** Vibrant greens, clear blues, golden sunlight—shocking after Midgar
*   **Lifestream:** Luminous green, flowing ethereally, both beautiful and eerie
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette split between industrial decay and natural beauty. Foreground: dark gray metal plates and pipes with glowing green Mako energy flowing through tubes, rust and grime. Background: bright blue sky and green fields visible beyond the city. A single yellow flower in the cracked concrete. High contrast between artificial and natural."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Protagonist Archetype:** Spiky blonde hair, oversized sword, purple SOLDIER uniform, distinctive silhouette
*   **Ancient Girl:** Long hair with bow, pink dress, staff, gentle appearance hiding strength
*   **Villain:** Long silver hair, black coat, impossibly long katana (Masamune), single black wing
*   **Anime Proportions:** Distinctive hair, expressive eyes, stylized but grounded
*   **Prompt Example:** "A mercenary with impossibly spiky blonde hair, blue eyes with a glow suggesting Mako enhancement. Wearing purple SOLDIER uniform with pauldron. Carrying a massive sword almost as tall as them—the Buster Sword—with a wide blade. Determined expression. Anime art style with realistic shading."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Midgar:** Multi-level city with plates above, slums below, Mako reactors like sci-fi cathedrals
*   **Reactors:** Industrial gothic—massive pipes, glowing green energy, steam and machinery
*   **Natural Areas:** Lush forests, beaches, mountains—emphasizing what's being lost
*   **Ancient Ruins:** Crystal structures, ethereal architecture, underwater or floating
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive Mako reactor: industrial cathedral with towering pipes, metal catwalks, and glowing green energy flowing through transparent tubes. Steam rises everywhere. The scale is enormous—human figures are tiny. Gothic industrial architecture with rivets and rust. Green ethereal light illuminates the darkness. Pre-rendered CG style."

**5. Magic and Summons:**
*   **Materia:** Glowing orbs of different colors representing elements and abilities
*   **Magic Effects:** Spectacular, colorful, anime-influenced (fire explosions, ice shards, lightning)
*   **Summons:** Massive entities—dragons, gods, titans—with elaborate attack sequences
*   **Limit Breaks:** Over-the-top ultimate attacks with special visual effects
*   **Prompt Example:** "A character casts magic by holding a glowing blue Materia orb. Ice crystals form in the air, creating massive icicle spears that rain down on enemies. The effect is elaborate and anime-styled—bright blue energy, freeze effects spreading across the ground, sparkles and magical particles. Cinematic camera angle emphasizing the scale."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Pre-rendered Quality:** Fixed camera angles, detailed lighting, cinematic composition
*   **Mako Glow:** Green luminescence from technology and Lifestream
*   **Dramatic Lighting:** Strong shadows, spotlight effects, noir-influenced
*   **Prompt Example:** "...pre-rendered CG lighting with detailed shadows and highlights. Green Mako glow provides eerie underlighting. Strong backlighting creates dramatic silhouettes. Volumetric fog and steam diffuse light beams. Fixed camera angle like a cinematic shot. High detail on materials—metal reflects light, cloth has texture."

## Voice

A voice carrying both determination and doubt, like someone fighting for a world while questioning their own identity. The pacing builds from quiet to explosive. The tone shifts between eco-warrior anger, personal confusion, camaraderie, and facing cosmic horror. There's an underlying theme of memory and what makes someone real. Role: The voice of fractured heroism seeking truth.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Orchestral with synthesizers, electric guitar, and piano. Nobuo Uematsu-style emotional range from serene to apocalyptic. Leitmotifs for characters and locations.
*   **Midgar:** Industrial sounds, machinery, oppressive ambience. Synth-heavy tracks.
*   **Overworld:** Beautiful orchestral exploration themes, hopeful despite the mission.
*   **Combat:** Intense rock-orchestral fusion, electric guitar riffs, driving percussion.
*   **Aerith's Theme:** Gentle piano, heartbreaking melody, reprised at her death with full orchestra.
*   **One-Winged Angel:** Latin choir, aggressive orchestration, organ, representing Sephiroth's false divinity.
*   **Lifestream:** Ethereal chorus, flowing ambience, representing collective consciousness.
*   **Summons:** Each has unique musical identity during their cinematic attacks.
*   **Gold Saucer:** Upbeat carnival music, jarring contrast to the main quest's weight.
