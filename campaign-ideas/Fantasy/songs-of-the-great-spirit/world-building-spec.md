### **World-Building Specification Brief: Songs of the Great Spirit**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When Coyote the Trickster steals the sacred songs maintaining balance between physical and spirit worlds, the party—chosen through vision quests revealing ancestral connections—must journey across sacred lands following trickster puzzles, learning from spirit animals, and discovering that Coyote's theft serves necessary purpose in preventing stagnation, ultimately restoring harmony by accepting that order and chaos must dance together rather than one dominating the other.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**

    *   Write about spirit animals as guides, teachers, and aspects of natural power

    *   Note: This should represent multiple Native traditions respectfully, not homogenize diverse cultures

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the sacred songs remain stolen THEN balance between worlds continues fracturing
*   IF spirit animals lose their way THEN natural order collapses causing disasters
*   IF Coyote is defeated or killed THEN creative chaos ends causing stagnation unto death
*   IF pure order is imposed THEN nothing grows, changes, or adapts—slow death of all
*   IF vision quests are completed THEN ancestral wisdom and spirit animal bonds are gained
*   IF respect and reciprocity are maintained THEN spirits offer aid and teaching
*   IF nature is taken from without giving back THEN spirits withdraw and curses follow
*   IF trickster puzzles are solved through cleverness THEN Coyote reveals next steps
*   IF direct approaches are forced THEN they fail—trickster logic requires thinking sideways
*   IF ancestral wisdom is heeded THEN past mistakes aren't repeated
*   IF the Wendigo is faced THEN party confronts what happens when balance is lost
*   IF both worlds are understood THEN the party can navigate between them safely
*   IF stories are told with power THEN they heal, teach, and transform reality
*   IF the songs are returned unchanged THEN rigid order returns causing future problems
*   IF the songs incorporate trickster wisdom THEN adaptive harmony replaces brittle tradition
*   IF balance is restored with chaos accepted THEN harmony dances between order and change
