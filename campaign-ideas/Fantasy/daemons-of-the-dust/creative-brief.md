# Creative Brief: Daemons of the Dust

## Art Style: Victorian Steampunk Meets Metaphysical Fantasy (His Dark Materials meets Parallel Worlds)

Victorian-era aesthetics blended with fantastical elements—daemons as visible souls, alethiometers as brass compasses, armored bears, and parallel Oxford.

### Core Principles:
*   **Visible Souls:** Every human accompanied by animal daemon (rendered realistically, glowing faintly at the connection point).
*   **Parallel Worlds:** Familiar locations (Oxford, Arctic) with alternate-reality twists (zeppelins, church authority, different history).
*   **Dust Visualization:** Subtle golden particles visible in certain light, attracted to consciousness.

### Color Palette:
*   **Brytain (Oxford):** Muted Victorian colors—browns, grays, burgundy. Gaslight glow, fog, aged stone.
*   **Arctic (Bolvangar):** Whites, pale blues, harsh light on ice, cold sterility of research station.
*   **Cittàgazze:** Mediterranean warmth—terracotta, sun-bleached stone, azure sky—but abandoned and eerie.
*   **Daemons:** Natural animal colors but with slight ethereal glow where bonded to human.
*   **Dust:** Shimmering gold particles, visible as soft light, concentrated around adults.

### Character Design:
*   **Humans with Daemons:** Victorian clothing (coats, dresses, practical adventure gear). Daemon always within arm's reach, matching human's mood/posture.
*   **Children:** Daemons shapeshift frequently (bird, cat, mouse, etc.). Faces show wonder and fear.
*   **Mrs. Coulter:** Elegant, dangerous beauty, gold dress, golden monkey daemon (no visible bond—unsettling).
*   **Armored Bears:** Massive polar bears in ornate metal armor, intelligent eyes, carrying massive weapons.

### Voice:
British, literate, thoughtful—young adult voice (early teens to twenties) with wonder and philosophical questioning. Role: Narrating discoveries about parallel worlds and the nature of consciousness.
