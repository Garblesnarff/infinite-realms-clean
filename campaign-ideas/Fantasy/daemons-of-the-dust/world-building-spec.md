### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Daemons of the Dust**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players live in a world where souls are external animal companions (daemons). They discover parallel worlds, a conspiracy to sever children from daemons, and the truth about Dust—particles of consciousness the Magisterium calls sin. They must navigate church oppression, armored bear politics, and metaphysical warfare.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Daemons are external manifestations of souls, bonded to humans from birth. Separation causes pain and death.
*   The Magisterium (church) controls society, suppressing knowledge and free inquiry as heresy.
*   Dust is elementary particles attracted to consciousness, especially post-puberty (the Magisterium equates this with original sin).
*   Lord Asriel discovered parallel worlds and seeks to overthrow the Authority (ancient angel pretending to be God).
*   Intercision is the process of severing children from daemons before puberty to prevent Dust attraction.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Magisterium (Antagonist):** Authoritarian church controlling society through theological tyranny and intercision experiments.
*   **The Oblation Board:** Secret Magisterium branch kidnapping children for intercision research, led by Mrs. Coulter.
*   **Asriel's Rebellion:** Scientist-warriors building a Republic of Heaven to destroy the Authority.
*   **The Gyptians:** Nomadic water-people, independent of Magisterium control, value family and freedom.

**5. Location Blueprints**
