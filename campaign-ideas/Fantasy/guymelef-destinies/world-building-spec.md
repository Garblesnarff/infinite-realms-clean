### **World-Building Specification Brief: Guymelef Destinies**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   An Earth protagonist is transported to Gaea (fantasy world) where kingdoms wage war using Guymelefs (magical mecha). Their arrival was prophesied by tarot. They join Van Fanel (dragon prince) and allies against the Zaibach Empire, which seeks to rewrite destiny using Fate Alteration machines. The campaign explores destiny vs. free will, romance, and whether perfect peace justifies removing choice.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail Gaea's connection to Earth (the Mystic Moon)—rare individuals are transported, gaining prophetic abilities.
*   Explain Draconian bloodlines—ancient humans who bonded with dragons, gaining transformation powers. Van's lineage.
*   Describe Guymelef creation—magical machines powered by Energists (drag energist from dragon hearts, standard energist from mining).
*   Outline Zaibach's rise—Emperor Dornkirk (Isaac Newton from Earth) used scientific knowledge to build an empire.
*   Detail the Fate Alteration Engine—machine that manipulates probability, ensuring desired outcomes. Dornkirk seeks "perfect peace" by eliminating war through controlled destiny.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Kingdom of Fanelia** (Minor - Destroyed Early): Dragon warrior culture, Van's homeland, burned by Zaibach.
*   **Asturia** (Major - Allied Kingdom): Political center, base for resistance, Princess Millerna rules.
*   **Zaibach Empire** (Major - Antagonist): Militaristic state using Fate Alteration to conquer. Led by Emperor Dornkirk.
*   **Mystic Seers** (Minor): Tarot readers and prophets who guide via prophecy.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Van Fanel** (dragon prince), **Hitomi Kanzaki** (Earth isekai protagonist), **Allen Schezar** (knight rival), **Emperor Dornkirk** (fate engineer), **Folken** (Van's fallen brother), **Princess Millerna** (Asturian ruler), **Dilandau Albatou** (psychotic Zaibach ace).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Fanelia Ruins** (destroyed homeland), **Asturia Palace** (political center), **Zaibach Fortress** (industrial capital), **Mystic Valley** (seer sanctuary), **Destiny's Engine Chamber** (final battleground).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** party follows tarot prophecy exactly **THEN** prophecy fulfilled but agency questioned—was it fate or choice?
*   **IF** party defies prophecy **THEN** unexpected consequences occur, proving free will exists but is chaotic.
*   **IF** Fate Engine destroyed **THEN** free will restored, future uncertain, Zaibach collapses.
*   **IF** Fate Engine used **THEN** party can rewrite one major event but becomes dependent on controlled fate.
*   **IF** Folken redeemed **THEN** he aids against Dornkirk, changing Zaibach's leadership.

**7. Guymelef Combat Mechanics:**
*   Medieval-style mecha combat—swords, lances, shields.
*   **Energists:** Power cores. Stronger emotions = more power output.
*   **Transformations:** Escaflowne can shift from dragon to humanoid mid-combat.
*   **Stealth Fields:** Zaibach units have cloaking (invisibility until they attack).

**8. Tarot Prophecy Mechanics:**
*   DM draws tarot cards for major decisions or sessions.
*   **Upright/Reversed:** Affects interpretation (upright = positive, reversed = warning).
*   **Examples:**
    *   The Fool: New beginnings or reckless choices.
    *   The Tower: Sudden upheaval or destruction of illusions.
    *   The Lovers: Romance or crucial choice between two paths.
*   Players interpret and decide how to act on prophecies.

**9. Fate Alteration Mechanics:**
*   Late-game enemies can force rerolls of player successes.
*   **Counter:** Destroy local Fate Engines to restore normal causality in regions.
*   **Ultimate Choice:** At campaign end, access to main Engine—rewrite one major past event (resurrection, prevent war) but risk addiction to controlled fate.

**10. Dragon Transformation:**
*   Van (or Draconian bloodline party member) can transform into a dragon.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Massive combat bonuses (flight, breath weapon, enhanced strength).
    *   **Risk:** Must make Wisdom saves each round or go berserk, attacking indiscriminately.
    *   Partial transformation (wings, claws) offers middle ground with less risk.

**11. Isekai Protagonist Abilities:**
*   **Prophetic Visions:** Advantage on initiative or Insight checks (seeing seconds into future).
*   **Earth Knowledge:** Can apply anachronistic solutions (physics, strategy, technology concepts foreign to Gaea).
*   **Mystic Moon Connection:** Can sense when destiny is being altered (Fate Engine active nearby).
