**The Bridgeburners' Last March**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the war-torn Malazan Empire, the players are members of the legendary Bridgeburners, an elite military company marked for death by their own empress. Gods, ascendants, and immortal beings walk the battlefields alongside mortals, pursuing incomprehensible agendas that shape the fate of continents. As the players march from siege to siege, they become entangled in a Convergence—a nexus point where the threads of destiny, divine power, and mortal will intersect. They must navigate brutal warfare, cosmic power struggles, and the realization that even gods can die.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the Malazan Empire by Emperor Kellanved and Dancer, and their subsequent assassination by Laseen.
    *   Write the history of the Bridgeburners, from elite company to expendable asset, and their legendary campaigns.
    *   Describe the nature of Ascendancy and how mortals can achieve godhood through witness and will.
    *   Explain the Warrens—magical dimensions tied to specific powers and Elder Races (Tellann, Omtose Phellack, Rashan, etc.).
    *   Detail the Elder Races: Tiste Andii, Tiste Edur, Tiste Liosan, Jaghut, Imass, Forkrul Assail, K'Chain Che'Malle.
    *   Write about the Crippled God, how he was chained, and his influence on the world.
    *   Describe the Azath Houses and their function as trans-dimensional prisons for powers too dangerous to exist freely.
    *   Explain Convergence—how power, prophecy, and will draw together to create nexus points where reality becomes malleable.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Bridgeburners** (Major - Player faction)
        *   **Goals:** Survive campaigns against impossible odds, protect each other, resist the Empress's attempts to exterminate them.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military structure with sergeants and squad leaders, but loyalty is to comrades, not commanders. Led (in spirit) by Whiskeyjack.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are the Empire's elite soldiers, first into battle.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** We know the Empress wants us dead. We're preparing to defy orders when necessary and seeking allies against her.
        *   **Assets:** Legendary combat prowess, Quick Ben (impossibly powerful mage), Kalam (master assassin), mutual loyalty stronger than steel.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by the Claw and Empress; respected by soldiers empire-wide; noticed by multiple gods and ascendants.

        *   **Relationships:** At war with Seven Cities rebellion, Free Cities alliance, and multiple other powers; internally fracturing due to Laseen's paranoia.

    *   **The Tiste Andii of Moon's Spawn** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Preserve Kurald Galain (Warren of Darkness), protect their dying race, stay out of mortal affairs when possible.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness. Other powerful Tiste Andii serve as his sworn swords.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We defend our territory and our Warren. Leave us alone.

        *   **Assets:** Moon's Spawn (floating fortress-mountain), immortal warriors of immense power, Dragnipur (Rake's sword containing a realm).
        *   **Relationships:** Grudging respect for some mortals; opposed to the Pannion Domin; neutral toward Empire unless provoked.

        *   **Public Agenda:** Chaos, manipulation, mysterious schemes that seem random.

        *   **Goals:** Free the Crippled God from his chains, no matter the cost to reality.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Distributed structure—priests, corrupted mages, those driven mad by proximity to his suffering.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Varies by cell—some don't know they serve him.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Crippled God's freedom might destroy the world, but his suffering is unbearable and his followers are driven by his agony.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to corrupt other powers, otataral (magic-nullifying substance), prophetic knowledge from the chained god.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players side with the Empress against the Bridgeburners' interests.
    *   **THEN:** They gain imperial favor but lose squad loyalty. Quick Ben refuses to help them. Bridgeburners become enemies. Generate a betrayal mission where former comrades hunt them.

    *   **IF:** The players help Shadowthrone's plans succeed.
    *   **THEN:** The Crippled God is freed through compassion rather than violence. Reality shifts toward mercy. But Shadowthrone becomes more powerful, creating new problems. Generate a new power balance.

    *   **IF:** The players kill Anomander Rake or steal Dragnipur.
    *   **THEN:** Kurald Galain collapses, unleashing the souls trapped in Dragnipur. A new Desolation begins as imprisoned horrors escape. Tiste Andii begin dying en masse. Generate apocalyptic consequences.

    *   **IF:** The players achieve Ascendancy.
    *   **THEN:** They gain cards in the Deck of Dragons. Other gods notice and test them. They can no longer die permanently but are bound to cosmic responsibilities. Generate their divine domain and first divine challenge.

    *   **IF:** The players witness Coltaine's crucifixion and survive.
    *   **THEN:** They gain massive Witness points and hardened resolve. But they're traumatized—impose psychological consequences. Generate a memorial mission in Coltaine's honor.

    *   **IF:** The players break one of the Crippled God's chains.
    *   **THEN:** Portion of his power is freed, causing localized reality corruption—increased cruelty, suffering manifest physically. But also, his influence lessens elsewhere. Generate spreading corruption zone and moral dilemma.

    *   **IF:** A player reads the Deck of Dragons and their own card appears.
    *   **THEN:** They've been noticed by the pantheon. Ascendancy is now inevitable—they can only choose its nature. Generate approaches from various gods trying to sway them.

    *   **IF:** Players show compassion to the Crippled God instead of attacking him.
    *   **THEN:** Reality itself shifts. The god's nature begins changing from hate to hope. Other gods are shocked. Generate a path where suffering is healed rather than defeated.
