# Creative Brief: The Bridgeburners' Last March

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grimdark Military Realism with Mythic Grandeur

Inspired by the works of Marc Simonetti (official Malazan artist) and the aesthetic of military historical paintings, combined with cosmic horror elements. This style captures the brutal realism of warfare alongside the incomprehensible scale of divine beings and magical catastrophes.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Contrast Scale:** Show mortals dwarfed by gods, vast armies against floating mountains, intimate human moments against cosmic backdrops.
*   **Military Authenticity:** Depict realistic armor, weapons, tactics, and the toll of war—mud, blood, exhaustion, camaraderie.
*   **Divine Otherness:** Gods and Ascendants should feel alien, powerful, and slightly wrong—they don't belong in mortal spaces.
*   **Grimdark Palette:** Use muted, dusty colors for mortal scenes; shift to impossible, vivid colors when the divine intrudes.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grimdark, military, epic-yet-futile, gods-among-mortals, convergence, dust-and-blood, mythic-realism, philosophically-complex.
*   **Feeling:** Exhaustion mixed with dark humor, the weight of history, the sense that mortals matter despite being powerless. Beauty found in solidarity and sacrifice, not triumph. Cosmic forces care nothing for mortal suffering, yet mortals persist.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and gritty for soldiers and environments; angular, geometric, or flowing and impossible for divine beings. Heavy use of texture—worn leather, rusted mail, ancient stone.
*   **Forms:** Soldiers wear practical armor (Malazan heavy infantry in scale mail, Wickan cavalry in leather and bone), weapons are functional. Gods appear in forms that hurt to perceive—too many limbs, impossible geometry, shadows that move wrong.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Bridgeburner soldier in worn, dusty scale armor and torn cloak, exhausted face streaked with dirt, holding a notched sword. Behind him, the impossible silhouette of Moon's Spawn—a mountain floating in the sky, crackling with elder magic. In the style of Marc Simonetti's grimdark military fantasy."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Mortal scenes use dusty browns, muted grays, dried-blood reds, and steel blues. Divine scenes introduce unnatural colors—void-black that seems deeper than darkness, silver that glows without light source, the bruised purple of Warrens opening.
*   **Luminosity:** Lighting is harsh and realistic—desert sun bleaching everything, campfire creating harsh shadows—except when magic intrudes, creating impossible illumination.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of dust-brown battlefield, gray steel, and dried blood. The sky is torn open by a Warren—a gash of unnatural purple-black energy spilling impossible silver light onto the horrified soldiers below."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Mortals are realistically proportioned, showing age, scars, exhaustion. Clothing is practical, worn, repaired. Ethnic diversity reflects Malazan's multi-continental empire (dark-skinned Seven Cities natives, pale Genabakis northerners, copper-skinned Wickans).
*   **Divine Beings:** Tiste Andii are impossibly tall and beautiful but with wrong undertones—silver skin, eyes like liquid darkness. Jaghut have green-tinged skin and tusks, ancientness radiating from them. Ascendants appear almost normal until you notice they cast no shadow, or too many shadows.
*   **Expression:** Soldiers show grim determination, dark humor, bone-deep weariness. Gods show alien emotions—cruelty without malice, compassion without warmth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Anomander Rake, Tiste Andii lord, impossibly tall with silver-white skin and flowing black hair. His eyes are pools of absolute darkness, reflecting nothing. He wears black armor that seems to absorb light, and carries Dragnipur—a massive sword with a blade like captured night. He stands amid a battlefield of corpses, utterly unmoved, in the style of Marc Simonetti."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic military landscapes—siege camps with rows of tents, battlefields churned to mud, ancient cities with diverse architecture (Seven Cities' sandstone domes, Darujhistan's blue-flamed walls, Black Coral's eternal night).
*   **Atmosphere:** Dust, smoke, the aftermath of magic scarring reality. Skies are often wrong—two moons instead of one, tears in reality showing other dimensions, floating impossibilities like Moon's Spawn.
*   **Details:** Equipment everywhere (discarded weapons, supply wagons, field hospitals), graffiti and soldier culture visible, ancient ruins beneath newer construction, Warren-scars in reality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The siege of Pale: thousands of Malazan army tents spread across a dusty plain before a walled city. Above, impossibly, floats Moon's Spawn—a massive mountain suspended in the air, trailing debris and shadow. Lightning arcs between the two as mages duel. The ground is cratered from magical bombardment. Grimdark military fantasy in the style of historical war paintings combined with cosmic horror."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh realism for natural light—desert sun creates sharp shadows, overcast skies diffuse everything flatly. Magical light is always wrong—it comes from nowhere, creates shadows in multiple directions, or seems to originate from within objects.
*   **Shadows:** Heavy, oppressive shadows in Black Coral (eternal night). Moon shadows when multiple moons rise. The absence of shadow when Warren-light illuminates, making everything feel surreal.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting distinguishes mortal reality from divine intrusion. Natural light grounds us; supernatural light creates unease.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the harsh desert sun creating stark shadows, except where a Warren has opened—a tear in reality spilling shadowless purple light that makes the soldiers' faces look wrong, as if the light comes from inside them rather than the Warren."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide shots emphasizing scale contrast (mortals tiny before gods or vast armies). Medium shots showing soldier camaraderie. Close-ups on weathered faces, worn equipment, and significant glances.
*   **Techniques:** Use divine beings or impossible phenomena as background elements dwarfing human drama. Frame mortal characters against cosmic backdrops to emphasize their insignificance yet persistence. Show aftermath as much as action—fields of corpses, ruined cities, exhausted survivors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the Chain of Dogs: a miles-long column of refugees and soldiers marching across empty desert, raising massive dust clouds. In the foreground, a Wickan cavalry rider watches the horizon. Far behind, barely visible, an enormous rebel army pursues. The composition emphasizes the impossible distance they must travel and the futility of their march, yet captures their grim determination. Grimdark epic military fantasy."

## Voice

A weathered, world-weary voice with a hint of dark humor, like a veteran soldier recounting impossible campaigns around a campfire. The accent is neutral but carries the cadence of military speech—clipped, precise, occasionally sardonic. Pacing alternates between the slow, measured tone of someone who has seen too much and sharp bursts of intensity during battle descriptions. The emotion conveys exhaustion mixed with stubborn persistence—the knowledge that what you're doing is probably futile, but you'll do it anyway because your comrades depend on you. Audio quality is clear but slightly rough, like it's been recorded in a tent during a campaign rather than a studio. Role: The company annalist, recording the deeds of the fallen so they won't be forgotten.
