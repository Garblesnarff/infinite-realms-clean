In the war-torn Malazan Empire, the players are members of the legendary Bridgeburners, an elite military company marked for death by their own empress. Gods, ascendants, and immortal beings walk the battlefields alongside mortals, pursuing incomprehensible agendas that shape the fate of continents. As the players march from siege to siege, they become entangled in a Convergence—a nexus point where the threads of destiny, divine power, and mortal will intersect. They must navigate brutal warfare, cosmic power struggles, and the realization that even gods can die, while uncovering the true enemy: Crippled God, chained and festering, who seeks to break the world itself.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A campaign inspired by Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen, focusing on military operations against a backdrop of divine intervention and philosophical complexity.

*   **Act I — The Siege of Pale (Sessions 1–5):** The players, veterans of the Bridgeburners, participate in the disastrous siege of Pale, where High Mage Tayschrenn's ritual goes catastrophically wrong, killing thousands of their own soldiers. They witness Moon's Spawn—a floating fortress—rain death upon the army, and encounter the enigmatic Tiste Andii led by Anomander Rake. Surviving the massacre, they realize the Empress is using the Bridgeburners as expendable pawns. They meet their first Ascendants: Shadowthrone and Rope (Cotillion), who offer cryptic warnings about a greater game being played.

*   **Act II — The Chain of Dogs (Sessions 6–11):** The Bridgeburners are deployed to Seven Cities during a continent-wide rebellion. They witness the heroic and doomed march of Coltaine's Chain of Dogs—a refugee column pursued by hundreds of thousands of rebels. The players must conduct asymmetric warfare, protecting civilians while dealing with Soletaken (shapeshifters), corrupted priests of the goddess Poliel (plague), and the machinations of the immortal Laseen. They encounter more gods: Fener (war), Oponn (chance), and the terrifying Crippled God whose influence is growing. They discover the Azath Houses—ancient prisons of power—and learn that reality itself is breaking down.

*   **Act III — The Convergence at Black Coral (Sessions 12–15+):** All threads converge. The Bridgeburners march to Black Coral where Anomander Rake, Shadowthrone, the Crippled God, and the Empress's forces all gather for a final confrontation. The players must choose sides in a conflict where there are no clear heroes: Will they defend the Malazan Empire despite its cruelty? Aid Shadowthrone's byzantine plans? Stand with Rake to prevent the Crippled God from breaking free? The final battle involves gods dying, warrens (magical dimensions) collapsing, and the players realizing they have become Ascendants themselves through sheer will and witness. Their choices will determine which gods survive, which fall, and whether compassion or vengeance defines the new age.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   Redeployed to Darujhistan, a free city that resists the Empire, the players conduct covert operations.

### Sessions 8-11 — "The House of Chains"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players discover an Azath House manifesting, a trans-dimensional prison that captures gods and ascendants.

    *   They find one of the Crippled God's chains anchoring reality, festering with divine agony.
    *   They must choose: Leave it intact (preserving reality but perpetuating suffering) or break it (freeing part of the Crippled God's power with unknown consequences).
    *   They reach Ascendant status themselves through sheer proximity to divine power and their refusal to break despite witnessing so much.
**Escalation:** Breaking or preserving the chain attracts the attention of Elder Gods and the Crippled God himself, who speaks directly to them.

    *   The players must choose which faction to support, knowing all have legitimate grievances and terrible methods.
    *   They witness gods dying permanently: Fener is pulled down from godhood, Rake sacrifices himself to preserve Kurald Galain, Shadowthrone achieves apotheosis.
    *   The final choice: Allow compassion or vengeance to define the outcome. Can they show mercy to the Crippled God, the source of so much suffering, recognizing he was chained unjustly?
    *   Multiple endings based on choices: Empire preserved but cruel, Empire falls and chaos reigns, new pantheon rises, Crippled God freed and redeemed.
**Escalation:** The players themselves must decide whether to accept godhood and join the new pantheon, or refuse immortality and return to mortal life, having changed the cosmos.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Anomander Rake, Son of Darkness** — *Lord of Moon's Spawn*
    *   **Role:** Ancient Tiste Andii warrior, immortal, wielder of Dragnipur (a sword containing an entire realm). Noble but exhausted by eons of existence.
    *   **Personality:** Tragic, honorable, burdened by impossible responsibility. Speaks rarely but his words carry the weight of ages. Melancholic yet still fights for what's right.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His sword, Dragnipur, traps the souls of those it kills in eternal servitude, pulling a massive wagon of chains in darkness—a cruelty he despises but uses because reality depends on it.

2.  **Shadowthrone and Cotillion (The Rope)** — *Ascendants of Shadow*
    *   **Role:** Former Emperor Kellanved and his assassin Dancer, now gods of the Shadow Warren. They manipulate events across continents with byzantine plans.
    *   **Personality:** Shadowthrone is theatrical, paranoid, and brilliant. Cotillion is sardonic, pragmatic, and quietly compassionate. They bicker constantly but are utterly loyal to each other.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Their grand plan is actually motivated by compassion—they're trying to free the Crippled God without breaking reality, but they can't reveal this without ruining the plan.

3.  **The Crippled God** — *The Chained One*
    *   **Role:** A divine being from another realm, chained and tortured for millennia. His suffering poisons reality, creating cruelty and despair.
    *   **Personality:** In agony constantly, his thoughts are broken glass—beautiful insights mixed with screaming hatred. He is both victim and monster.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was chained unjustly, dragged from his own realm by jealous gods. His cruelty is born from endless torture, not inherent evil. Compassion could redeem him, but who shows compassion to the source of all suffering?

4.  **Empress Laseen** — *Ruler of the Malazan Empire*
    *   **Role:** Pragmatic, ruthless leader who assassinated Kellanved to take power. Uses the Bridgeburners as expendable assets.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, calculating, brilliant strategist. She shows no emotion, makes decisions based purely on imperial benefit. Not evil, but utterly pragmatic.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She's terrified of Shadowthrone's return and makes increasingly paranoid decisions. Her cruelty stems from fear disguised as strength.

5.  **Quick Ben** — *Bridgeburner High Mage*
    *   **Role:** The squad's mage, impossibly powerful, with a mysterious past. Bonded to twelve warrens simultaneously (normally fatal).
    *   **Personality:** Clever, theatrical, loyal to his squad above all else. Constantly schemes but ultimately has a good heart.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He contains the souls of twelve mages he merged with to escape slavery. He's essentially twelve people in one body, which slowly fractures his sanity.

6.  **Tavore Paran** — *Adjunct to the Empress*
    *   **Role:** Emotionless military commander leading the Bonehunters (army) in impossible campaigns. Secretly working against the Crippled God.
    *   **Personality:** Appears completely cold and unfeeling. Never explains her plans. Soldiers hate her because she seems to waste their lives pointlessly.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She's actually the most compassionate character, executing a plan to free the Crippled God through compassion. Her coldness is armor protecting her from the agony of sending soldiers to die for a purpose she can't reveal.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of compassion in a cruel world, the price of power, and whether suffering creates monsters or reveals character. The central question is whether the players will perpetuate cycles of vengeance or break them through understanding. Gods are not abstract entities but characters with motivations, flaws, and the capacity to die. Mortals can become gods through will and witness. The greatest act of heroism might not be defeating evil, but showing mercy to it—even when that mercy seems undeserved and potentially dangerous.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Witness and Will**
*   Characters don't level traditionally. Instead, they gain power through Witnessing (experiencing cosmic-scale events) and Will (making choices that matter in the face of overwhelming power).
*   Each time a player witnesses a god's action, an Ascendant duel, or a convergence event, they gain Witness Points.
*   Each time a player makes a difficult choice that defies expectations or changes events, they gain Will Points.
*   Combining Witness and Will allows them to touch divine power: manifesting a Warren, challenging Ascendants, eventually becoming Ascendants themselves.

### 2. **The Deck of Dragons**
*   A mystical tarot deck representing the current state of divine politics. Each card represents a god, ascendant, or cosmic force.
*   Players can "read the Deck" to gain cryptic insights into upcoming events, reveal hidden players, or understand divine motivations.
*   The Deck changes dynamically—when a god dies, their card shatters. When a new Ascendant rises, a new card appears.
*   Players who become Ascendants gain their own cards in the Deck.

### 3. **Warren Magic**
*   Instead of traditional spell slots, mages access Warrens (magical dimensions).
*   Each Warren has unique properties: Tellann (fire/stone, ancient), Rashan (shadow), Denul (healing), Serc (sky/storm), Hood's Path (death).
*   Using a Warren means pulling its reality into the material world—dangerous and unpredictable.
*   Warrens can be damaged, sealed, or collapse entirely based on divine conflicts. If a Warren a mage uses is destroyed, they lose those powers permanently.
*   High-level mages can be "aspected" to multiple Warrens like Quick Ben, but each additional Warren risks fragmentation of self.

### 4. **Convergence Mechanics**
*   As the campaign progresses, Convergence builds—a cosmic pressure as multiple powerful beings and events draw together.
*   Mechanically, when Convergence is high, impossible things become possible: mortals can harm gods, prophecies fulfill themselves, coincidences pile up.
*   Players feel Convergence as narrative pressure—NPCs appear at dramatically appropriate moments, battles escalate impossibly, choices carry cosmic weight.
*   At peak Convergence (final sessions), players can rewrite reality itself through their choices, but every action has profound consequences.

### 5. **Ascendancy Path**
*   At high levels, players can become Ascendants (demigods) through unique personal paths.
*   This requires: a True Name discovered, a Warren mastered, a legendary deed witnessed by thousands, and a Choice that defines their nature.
*   Ascendancy grants immortality, immense power, and a seat in the divine games—but also eternal responsibility and the attention of enemies across millennia.
*   Players can refuse Ascendancy, remaining mortal but keeping their freedom and eventual rest.
