# Creative Brief: Dead Witch Walking

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cincinnati Urban Fantasy with Ley Line Energy (The Hollows-inspired)

Inspired by the species-diverse world of *The Hollows* where Cincinnati hides Inderland bounty hunters, witches draw power from ley lines, and demons make deals. This style captures ley line energy, diverse supernatural species, and found family dynamics.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Ley Line Power:** Visible energy lines crossing Cincinnati, witch magic channeling earth power
*   **Species Diversity:** Vampires, witches, pixies, werewolves, elves—each visually distinct
*   **Found Family:** Witch, vampire, and pixie partnership, different species cooperating
*   **Demon Marks:** Visible corruption on soul, smudges of darkness
