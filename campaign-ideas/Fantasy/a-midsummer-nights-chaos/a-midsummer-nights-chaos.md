## What "Low-Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Comedy over Combat:** Most challenges are social, romantic, or comedic rather than deadly.
*   **Dream Logic:** The forest operates on fae rules—things transform, promises bind, dreams blur with reality.
*   **Romantic Chaos:** Love potions cause complicated entanglements that must be untangled.
*   **Theatrical Performance:** Must put on a play for the fairy court—performance matters.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

*   **Act I — Into the Forest (Sessions 1–2):** Party enters the enchanted forest pursuing different goals—some fleeing arranged marriages, some seeking adventure, some hired to find missing nobles. Meet the quarreling lovers already hopelessly confused by Puck's meddling.
*   **Act II — The Fairy War (Sessions 3–5):** Discover Oberon and Titania's war over the changeling child is causing seasonal chaos. Oberon enlists party to help with his love potion scheme against Titania. Puck "helps" but causes more confusion. Party members may be love-potioned.
*   **Act III — The Play's the Thing (Sessions 6–8):** Must perform a ridiculous play about tragic lovers for Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding (and the fairy court). Meanwhile untangle who actually loves whom after multiple love potions.
*   **Act IV — Midsummer's Dream (Sessions 9–10):** Everything resolved through reconciliation of fairy rulers, proper love potion antidotes, and the question—was any of it real or all a midsummer night's dream?

## Major NPCs

1.  **Puck / Robin Goodfellow** — *The Mischievous Sprite*
    *   Oberon's servant, loves pranks, genuinely tries to help but causes chaos. "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"

2.  **Oberon** — *The Fairy King*
    *   Proud, jealous, in conflict with his queen over the changeling child. Uses love potions to win the argument. Powerful but petty.

3.  **Titania** — *The Fairy Queen*
    *   Equally proud, refuses to surrender the changeling. When love-potioned, falls for the most ridiculous target possible.

4.  **Hermia, Lysander, Helena, Demetrius** — *The Confused Lovers*
    *   Four young mortals whose romantic entanglements are made infinitely worse by Puck's meddling with love potions.

5.  **Bottom** — *The Weaver Transformed*
    *   Leading man of the artisan actors, gets transformed with a donkey's head, becomes object of Titania's enchanted affection.

6.  **Theseus and Hippolyta** — *The Duke and His Bride*
    *   Mortal rulers whose wedding is the frame for all events. Former enemies now to be married.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Enchanted Forest:** Where mortal rules don't apply, fae magic reigns, and it's always twilight or moonlight.
2.  **Oberon's Court:** The fairy king's seat of power—beautiful, dangerous, bound by strange rules.
3.  **Titania's Bower:** Where the fairy queen sleeps surrounded by her followers—Puck targets this with love potion.
4.  **The Clearing:** Where the artisans rehearse their terrible play and lovers' paths cross.
5.  **Athens:** The mortal city where order theoretically reigns, destination after the forest's chaos.

## Central Conflict

Order versus chaos, duty versus love, mortal reason versus fae magic. The fairy rulers' pride has thrown nature into disorder. Mortals flee arranged marriages for true love but can't tell true love from enchantment. The party must navigate a world where magic makes everything complicated and nothing is as it seems. The question: what is real love versus enchanted infatuation? And when you wake, was any of it real?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Love Potion Chaos**
*   Flower juice makes victims fall for the first person they see. Must track who's enchanted, who loves whom truly, and fix the mess.

### 2. **Fae Promises**
*   Any promise made in the forest is binding. Words matter. Loopholes exist but require cleverness.

### 3. **Transformation Magic**
*   Puck can transform party members—donkey heads, changed appearances. Usually comedic, sometimes tactical.

### 4. **Dream Logic**
*   In the forest, impossible things happen. Logic doesn't apply consistently. Embrace the surreal.

### 5. **The Play Performance**
*   Must rehearse and perform "Pyramus and Thisbe" or similar. Quality determines fairy court's reaction. Bad performances might be more entertaining.

### 6. **Midsummer's Blessing**
*   If the party helps reconcile Oberon and Titania, they receive the fairy rulers' blessing—love finds its proper matches and good fortune follows.
