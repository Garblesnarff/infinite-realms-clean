## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth
The Deep Cave is not geological; it is the fossilized hesitation of a God. Eons ago, the Creator paused before speaking the word that would invent "Loneliness." That pause became heavy, sinking into the bedrock of reality, calcifying into a mountain that exists in all minds simultaneously. The mountain, **Mount Silentium**, is a physical manifestation of the gap between souls. It does not obey Euclidean geometry; it obeys the geometry of trauma and memory. To climb it is to traverse one's own nervous system; to descend is to mine the ore of one's own subconscious.

### Timeline of the Silentium
1.  **The First Hesitation:** The Creator pauses, creating the mountain.
2.  **The Age of Screaming Stone:** The first mortals enter; the acoustics amplify their regrets until their heads explode.
3.  **The Arrival of the First Lantern:** A blind man brings a light fueled by acceptance, quieting the stones.
4.  **The Great Schism of Reflections:** The Mirror Pool boils over, flooding the lower caverns with liquid doppelgängers.
5.  **The Era of the Silent King:** A tyrant tries to conquer the peak; he is turned into a permanent echo.
6.  **The Night of the Weeping Stalactites:** Gravity reverses for an hour; tears fall *up* into the sky.
7.  **The Invention of the False Door:** A trickster demon installs doors that open into the viewer’s most embarrassing memory.
8.  **The Hermit’s Ascension:** The current Hermit (formerly a soldier named Kaelen) accepts the lantern 1,000 years ago.
9.  **The Fading:** The Lantern begins to flicker, causing hallucinations in the waking world miles away.
10. **The Summons:** Identical letters appear in the pockets of the Party, written in their own handwriting.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because **Wisdom is a finite resource that decays.** The Lantern does not burn oil; it burns "Integrated Trauma." The Hermit has run out of his own trauma to process. He is empty. The mountain needs fresh pain to transmute into light, or the "Hesitation" will end, and the God will finally speak the word "Loneliness," permanently severing every soul in existence from every other.

## Section 8: MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### The Physics of Solitude
Distance in the cave is not measured in feet, but in **Emotional Resonance**.
*   **Rule:** If two players are arguing in real life (or in character), their characters physically drift 10ft apart per round, even if they try to stay close.
*   **Rule:** "Helping" an ally (Advantage) pulls them 5ft closer.

### The Lantern Resource
The Lantern is the central mechanic.
*   **Fuel:** It does not burn oil. It burns **Wisdom Points** or **Hit Dice**.
*   **Mechanic:** At the start of every session, the party must sacrifice 1 HD each to feed the lantern. If they refuse, the "Shadow Level" increases (Enemies get +2 to hit).
*   **Dimming:** As the campaign progresses, the light radius shrinks. 60ft -> 30ft -> 15ft -> 5ft.

### The Sanity System: "Resolve"
*   Each PC starts with 10 **Resolve Points**.
*   **Losing Resolve:** Seeing a Doppelgänger (-1), Failing a WIS save (-1), Being alone for a session (-2).
*   **0 Resolve:** The character gains a "Permanent Quirk" (e.g., Fear of Mirrors) and resets to 5 Resolve.

---

## Section 9: SESSION GUIDE
[TAG: DM_GUIDE]

### Phase 1: Separation

*   **Session 3: The Echoes.** Players can hear each other but not see. Puzzle solving across the void.
*   **Session 4: The Convergence.** Party reunites at the Base Camp. Realize the map is psychological.

### Phase 2: Descent

*   **Session 6: The Gallery.** PCs face their backstories. Roleplay heavy. No combat.
*   **Session 7: The Mirror Pool.** The Doppelgänger fight. High lethality.
*   **Session 8: The Deep Dark.** Lantern begins to fail. Resource management panic.

### Phase 3: The Summit
*   **Session 9: The Gravity Shift.** World flips. Up is down. Climbing the "roots" of the mountain.
*   **Session 10: The Ego Death.** Characters lose their names/classes for one encounter. Must fight as "Commoners."
*   **Session 11: The Hermit's Rest.** Reaching the summit. The Hermit dies. The choice is presented.
*   **Session 12: The New Light.** Final Boss: The Embodiment of Loneliness. One player must choose to stay or the cycle ends.
