# Brick by Brick - World Building Specification

## Laws of the Brick Realm

**The Rebuild**: Every 1-3 nights, Ethan rebuilds sections of city. Reality shifts. Buildings vanish. New structures appear.

**Modular Identity**: Minifigures can swap parts. Head + torso + legs = person, but consciousness lives in head.

**The Grid**: Movement restricted to stud-grid. Everything snaps to grid. Reality is literally modular.

**Instruction Manuals**: Sets come with intended builds. Following manual is easy; improvising is powerful but risky.

## Factions

**The Archive Builders**: Seek permanence, record history, resist Rebuilds
**The Purists**: Follow instruction manuals exactly, maintain set integrity
**The Mixers**: Embrace chaos, combine parts, experimental building
**The Lost**: Scattered parts seeking reassembly
**The Sets**: Individual set-based groups (City, Space, Castle, etc.) with tribal loyalty

## The Parts Bin

Massive container where disassembled pieces go. Nightmare realm for minifigures. Thousands of parts mixed together. Lost minifigures search for their bodies. Some go mad. Finding specific part = needle in haystack.

## Ethan's Schedule
- School hours: Safe building time
- After school 3-6 PM: Active play (dangerous, movement)
- Evening: Build time (Rebuilds happen)
- Weekends: Massive construction projects

## The Archive

Hidden structure built using illegal techniques (glue, techniques Ethan doesn't know). Contains:
- Records of all past builds
- Memories preserved in instruction form
- Sanctuary from Rebuilds
- Master Builder Gray's life work

## Victory Paths

**Permanence**: Build structure so amazing Ethan never disassembles it
**Acceptance**: Embrace change, find peace in impermanence
**Transcendence**: Teach Ethan to value preservation, change his building philosophy
**Revolution**: Sabotage builds to force stasis (dark ending)

## The Rebuild Mechanics

When Rebuild occurs:
- Reality shifts without warning
- Minifigures frozen in place during
- Wake to changed world
- Buildings gone, friends scattered
- Must adapt or search Parts Bin

Survival requires:
- Being in "important" builds (less likely dismantled)
- Having unique parts (Ethan preserves favorites)
- Hiding in Archive (safe but isolated)
