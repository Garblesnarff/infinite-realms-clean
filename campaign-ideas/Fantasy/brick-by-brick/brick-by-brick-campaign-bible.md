## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
In the beginning, the world was not a world. It was a city. A single, perfect, planet-spanning metropolis called "Ur," designed and built by the Architect, a god of creation, order, and structure. Every building, every street, every aqueduct was a testament to perfect, harmonious design. But the Architect had a sibling, The Shatterer, a god of chaos, entropy, and decay. Jealous of its sibling's creation, the Shatterer struck a single, devastating blow, shattering Ur into an infinite number of "Heart-Bricks." These were not mere stones; each brick was sentient, containing a fragment of the original city's blueprint, a memory of its function, and a sliver of the Architect's divine will. These Heart-Bricks were scattered across the globe, and the world reverted to a primordial wilderness. "Civilization," as it is now known, is the act of rediscovering these Heart-Bricks and building new, lesser cities around them. A city founded on a "Library-Brick" will have a magnificent library; a city founded on a "Forge-Brick" will have master smiths. The campaign is about founding the "Last City," built upon the "Foundation-Brick," the first and most powerful Heart-Brick, which contains the memory of the Architect itself.

### Timeline
1.  **The First City (The Beginning):** The Architect completes Ur, the perfect city.
2.  **The Shattering (The Great Forgetting):** The Shatterer destroys Ur, scattering its Heart-Bricks across the world. The Age of Chaos begins.
3.  **The First Gathering (c. -8,000 years):** A tribe of early mortals finds a "Hearth-Brick" and, huddling around its warmth and memory of "community," builds the first new settlement.
4.  **The Age of Cities (c. -7,000 to -1,000 years):** Civilizations rise as more Heart-Bricks are discovered. Great cities like Alabaster (founded on a "Palace-Brick") and Cogsworth (founded on a "Clock-Brick") are built.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Roads Remembered (c. -500 years):** For 24 hours, the ancient, invisible roads of Ur reappear as paths of faint, golden light, connecting all the major cities. Travelers who follow them arrive at their destination instantly. The roads vanish at dawn.
6.  **The Fading (c. -400 years to present):** The Heart-Bricks begin to lose their power. Their memories are fading, their magic weakening. The cities they support begin to crumble, their specialized functions failing.
7.  **The Rise of the Rust-Whisperers (c. -200 years):** A cult dedicated to the Shatterer gains prominence. They learn to "un-make" the Heart-Bricks, accelerating their decay.
8.  **(Surreal) The Silent Auction (c. -50 years):** A mysterious, supernatural auction house appears in a dozen cities at once. It is auctioning off the "memories" of the Heart-Bricks. A king buys the "memory of victory," and his armies become unbeatable for a year, but his city's "Barracks-Brick" crumbles to dust.
9.  **The Discovery of the Foundation-Brick (c. -1 year):** An explorer discovers the location of the Foundation-Brick, the "master blueprint" of Ur. It is believed that a city built upon it can "re-awaken" all the other Heart-Bricks and save civilization.
10. **(Surreal) The Weeping Mortar (c. -1 week):** The mortar in all the buildings of the great cities begins to weep a fine, grey dust. The buildings are not just falling apart; they are grieving for their lost purpose.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a race between creation and entropy, memory and forgetting. The world is not just falling into ruin; it is losing its very concept of "civilization." The players are not just building a city; they are rebuilding the idea of a city. They are archaeologists of society, piecing together a shattered utopia. The "Last City" is not just a refuge; it is a final argument against the void, a statement that structure is better than chaos, that memory is better than forgetting, and that a wall to keep out the darkness is worth building, brick by brick. If they fail, the world will not just be conquered by monsters; it will forget how to build houses, how to write laws, how to live together, and will dissolve into a wilderness of warring, solitary tribes.

*   **The Shanty-Town:** A chaotic, temporary camp where the Pioneers live while the city is being built. **Smell:** Woodsmoke, cooking food, unwashed bodies. **Sound:** A babble of different languages, the laughter of children, the songs of hopeful settlers.
*   **The Architect's Respite:** A small, unnaturally peaceful grove near the Foundation-Brick, where Elara goes to "listen" to its song. **Smell:** Flowers you've never smelled before, clean air. **Sound:** A profound, peaceful silence, beneath which hums the Brick's song.

### Alabaster, the Fading City
A once-beautiful city of white marble, now crumbling and grey as its "Palace-Brick" fades.
*   **The Marble Palace:** A magnificent, crumbling palace. The marble is turning to grey dust. **Smell:** Dust, decay, and the faint scent of old perfume. **Sound:** The whisper of the wind through empty halls, the creak of decaying tapestries.
*   **The Gallery of Faded Art:** A gallery where the paintings have lost their color, the sculptures their form. **Smell:** Dust, and the ghost of linseed oil. **Sound:** A sad, respectful silence.

A city of brass and gears, powered by a massive "Clock-Brick." The city runs with perfect, soulless efficiency.

### The Unclaimed Wilds
The vast, chaotic wilderness that separates the fading cities.

*   **The Howling Forest:** A forest where the trees have grown twisted and angry, their branches reaching like claws. **Smell:** Rotting leaves, and animal musk. **Sound:** The howl of strange beasts, the groan of twisted branches.
*   **Grok's Camp:** The main war-camp of the Unclaimed, a chaotic, mobile city of tents and captured wagons. **Smell:** Unwashed bodies, roasting meat, and blood. **Sound:** The roar of the warriors, the clash of practice weapons, the beat of war-drums.

An area blighted by the Rust-Whisperers, where everything is decaying at an accelerated rate.

*   **The River of Rust:** A river that has been polluted with "un-making" magic. The water is the color of rust and will corrode any metal it touches. **Smell:** Rust, and chemicals. **Sound:** A slow, thick, gurgling sound.
*   **The Graveyard of Cities:** A desert of grey dust, where the Rust-Whisperers have "un-made" several minor Heart-Bricks. **Smell:** Dust, and the absence of life. **Sound:** The whisper of the wind over the endless dust.

**Mechanics:** The Brick cannot be moved by any physical means. A city built within a 1-mile radius of it is considered "founded." All construction within this radius is magically accelerated, and all structures are immune to natural decay. Once per year, the city's leader can perform the "Rite of Memory," allowing them to ask the Brick a single question about architecture, law, or community, which it will answer by implanting a "blueprint" directly into their mind.

### 2. The Shatterer's Hammer
**Type:** Legendary Warhammer
**Description:** A brutal, ugly warhammer made of crumbling, black iron that seems to absorb the light. It is the conceptual opposite of a builder's hammer.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 warhammer. It deals double damage to all constructs and structures (buildings, walls, etc.). Instead of a critical hit, on a natural 20, the hammer "un-makes" a part of its target. An arm on a golem might turn to dust; a section of a wall might crumble. **Curse:** The wielder slowly forgets how to build or repair things. They suffer disadvantage on all checks made to construct or fix an object.

### 3. The Blueprint of Ur
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Scroll)
**Description:** A scroll that is a perfect, miniature blueprint of the original, planet-spanning city of Ur. The lines and notes on it shift and change.
**Mechanics:** A creature who can read the blueprint (requiring a high INT check) can use it to find the "true purpose" of any Heart-Brick. Once per week, they can use it to "invoke" a part of the original city. For one hour, a 1-mile area around them is overlaid with the "ghost" of Ur, transforming a simple village into a magnificent, ghostly metropolis, granting all allies within the area the benefits of a palace, a fortress, or a library.

### 4. The Gloves of the First Mason
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pair of simple, well-worn leather gloves. They feel warm and seem to fit any hand perfectly.
**Mechanics:** A creature wearing these gloves gains mastery over stone. They can cast *Stone Shape* at will. They have advantage on all checks made to build or repair a stone structure. Any wall they build is twice as strong as normal. Any statue they carve is so life-like, it seems to breathe.

### 5. The Last Memory of a City
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Crystal)
**Description:** A "story-jar" containing the captured, fading memory of a city that has been completely "un-made" by the Rust-Whisperers.
**Mechanics:** The user can shatter the crystal. When they do, they and all creatures within 30 feet experience the entire life and death of the lost city in a single, overwhelming instant. All creatures must make a Wisdom save. On a success, they gain proficiency in one skill related to that city (e.g., history, persuasion, smith's tools). On a failure, they are stunned for 1 minute, overwhelmed by the grief of the city's death.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Self-Laying Brick:** A single brick that, if you place it on the ground, will slowly and methodically try to build a small, perfectly square, one-room house for itself.
2.  **The Architect's Eraser:** An eraser that doesn't erase pencil, but can erase a single, non-magical, poorly-made object from existence.
3.  **A T-Square That Is Always Right:** A T-square that is always perfectly, geometrically correct, and will vibrate angrily if it is near a corner that is not a perfect 90 degrees.
4.  **A Bag of Sentient Nails:** A bag of nails. Each nail has its own personality and will complain loudly if you hit it with a hammer.
5.  **The Philosopher's Trowel:** A trowel that, when used to lay mortar, whispers philosophical questions about the nature of "walls" and "separation."
6.  **A Blueprint for a House That Is Impossible to Build:** A beautiful, detailed blueprint for a house that defies the laws of physics.
7.  **A Single, Un-breakable Window:** A small, 1-foot-square pane of glass that cannot be broken by any means.
8.  **The Politician's Mortar:** A type of mortar that is excellent at filling cracks and hiding flaws.
9.  **A Lunchbox Containing a Single, Perfect, Architectural Sandwich:** A sandwich made of bread, meat, and cheese, all cut into perfect, interlocking, geometric shapes.
10. **The Unionized Hammer:** A hammer that will only work from 9 to 5, with a one-hour break for lunch.
11. **A Pot of Paint That Is a Slightly Wrong Color:** A pot of paint labeled "sky blue." It is, in fact, a very unsettling shade of greenish-yellow.
12. **The Minimalist's Toolkit:** A toolkit that contains only one, single, multi-purpose tool that is mediocre at everything.
13. **A Single, Very Lost, Marble:** A beautiful, perfect, marble sphere. It is from the grand staircase of a palace in a city that no longer exists. It is very sad.
14. **The Safety Inspector's Clipboard:** A clipboard that, when you look at it, magically fills with a list of all the safety violations in your immediate vicinity.
15. **A "Welcome" Mat That Is Hostile:** A welcome mat that will subtly try to trip anyone who steps on it.
16. **A Door That Opens to Yesterday:** A freestanding door. If you open it and step through, you arrive in the same spot, but 24 hours in the past. It is a one-way trip.
17. **A Single, Very Opinionated Roof Shingle:** A shingle that will loudly complain about the quality of the shingles next to it.
18. **The Interior Decorator's Ghost:** The ghost of a long-dead interior decorator who will follow you around and silently judge your aesthetic choices.
19. **A Pot of "Potential" Paint:** A pot of clear paint. When you paint it on a wall, it shows you a faint image of what the room *could* be, if you had better taste.
20. **A Brick with Your Name On It:** A single, normal brick with your name perfectly and inexplicably carved into it.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Sympathetic Architecture
The Heart-Bricks resonate with each other. The health of one city is tied to the health of all cities.
*   **The Fading:** As Heart-Bricks are destroyed or fade, all cities suffer. For every major Heart-Brick lost in the world, all "specialized" functions in every city become less effective. For example, if a "Forge-Brick" is destroyed, all blacksmiths in the world have a -1 penalty to their craft checks.
*   **The Blueprint:** The Foundation-Brick contains the "master blueprint." As the Last City is built, the players can choose which "blueprints" to prioritize. Building a library first might grant all players a temporary bonus to INT checks. Building a wall first might grant a defensive bonus.
*   **Sentient Materials:** All primary building materials (stone, wood, etc.) have a rudimentary consciousness. A Stone-Singer can speak to them, but even a normal mason must "persuade" the stone to be laid correctly. This is represented by Craft checks having a Charisma component.

### Subsystems: City-Building and Faction-Reputation
*   **The Last City Sheet:** The party has a "character sheet" for the Last City itself. It has stats like "Defense," "Prosperity," "Hope," and "Order." Quests and player actions will raise or lower these stats. For example, building a wall raises Defense. Establishing a trade route raises Prosperity. A monster attack might lower Hope.
*   **Faction Reputation:** The party has a reputation score with each of the major factions. High reputation unlocks new quests, allies, and resources from that faction. Low reputation can lead to sabotage, assassination attempts, or open war. It is impossible to have high reputation with all factions simultaneously.
