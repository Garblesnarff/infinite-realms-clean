# The Burning Season
*The world catches fire. The flames never die. Only ash remains.*

## Campaign Overview

The Great Forest of Evergreen, covering a third of the continent, has been burning for 40 days. What started as a single lightning strike has become an unstoppable firestorm. Millions of acres consumed. Smoke blots out the sun. Animals flee in massive migrations. Hundreds of forest communities destroyed. The fire is spreading—to grasslands, to farmlands, toward cities. Firefighting efforts fail. Rain doesn't come. The flames seem almost... alive.

The truth: The Ember Tyrant, an ancient primordial of eternal flame imprisoned within a massive magical tree at the forest's heart, has been freed. The forest fire is its awakening—it IS the fire. As it grows stronger, consuming more, it will eventually ignite the entire world, transforming it into a realm of eternal burning.

The party must navigate walls of flame, rescue refugees from fire's path, discover the truth about the Ember Tyrant, and find a way to stop the inferno before there's nothing left to save but ashes.

## Core Themes

- **Unstoppable Advance**: Fire spreads exponentially, can't be stopped conventionally
- **Smoke and Ash**: Apocalyptic atmosphere, sun blotted out, breathing difficult
- **Fleeing Before Flames**: Constant evacuation, racing wildfire
- **Scorched Earth**: Everything burns—forests, homes, crops, civilization
- **Fire as Life**: Destruction that enables renewal, but at what cost?
- **Last Stands**: Choosing what to defend, what to let burn

## Session Breakdown (24-30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Spark (Sessions 1-6)
**Sessions 1-2**: Campaign opens in forest village as fire approaches. Ember storm raining down. Evacuate civilians, fight through flames. Fire behaves strangely—spreads too fast, ignores firebreaks. Barely escape, watch home burn.

**Sessions 3-4**: Join refugee column fleeing forest. Massive animal migration, thousands of people, smoke everywhere. Fire jumps firebreak impossibly. Meet Ranger Smokejumper, elite firefighter. She explains: This is no natural fire. Something is driving it.

**Sessions 5-6**: Reach evacuated town being fortified as firebreak. Party joins desperate defense—dig trenches, wet everything, magical wards. Fire arrives. Defense fails spectacularly. Fire climbs magical barriers. Town evacuates, another home lost. Pattern clear: Fire can't be stopped, only fled.

### Arc 2: The Firestorm (Sessions 7-14)
**Sessions 7-9**: Military mobilizes. Water mages attempt rain. Fire is too hot—water evaporates before hitting ground. Druids try to communicate with fire. It responds, speaks through flames. Says single word: "HUNGRY." Investigation into forest's heart where fire began.

**Sessions 10-12**: Journey toward fire's origin against fleeing refugees. Navigate burned wasteland, active fire zones, smoke storms. Discover ancient druid circle knew truth: Heartwood Tree, massive magical oak, was actually prison for Ember Tyrant. Someone released it. Find evidence of ritual—intentional.

**Sessions 13-14**: Fire Cult revealed. Led by Ash Prophet who believes world should burn. They freed Tyrant intentionally. Cult is fireproof (dark ritual), spreads flames, worships destruction. Infiltrate cult, learn: Tyrant is sentient fire entity that feeds on burning. Goal is total world immolation.

### Arc 3: The Burning World (Sessions 15-24)
**Sessions 15-17**: Fire reaches grasslands, spreads even faster. Farms burning, food supply threatened. Refugee crisis—millions fleeing, nowhere left to go. Cities fortify, but fire approaches. Smoke blocks sun globally, bizarre twilight world. Ash falls like snow everywhere.

**Sessions 18-20**: Journey to Heartwood location. Navigate ocean of fire. Extreme heat, magical protection required. Find massive crater where tree stood. At center: Ember Tyrant forming—growing humanoid of pure flame, miles tall. It speaks: Imprisoned unjustly, world will burn as it burned.

**Sessions 21-24**: Learn ancient druids imprisoned it because it wouldn't stop burning, threatened all life. Tyrant believes burning is natural state, life is aberration. Must choose: Fight it (nearly impossible), imprison it again (requires sacrifice), negotiate (alien mind), redirect (can fire be controlled?), or accept (world of ash, scattered survivors).

### Arc 4: The Final Conflagration (Sessions 25-30)
**Sessions 25-27**: Gather components for chosen solution. If fighting: Need water from primordial ocean, ice from frost titan, etc. If imprisoning: Need new Heartwood, massive ritual. If negotiating: Need to prove value of life to fire entity. Time pressure—fire consuming faster.

**Sessions 28-30**: Final confrontation at Heartwood crater. Multi-faction battle: Party, military, druids, cult, fire elementals. Ember Tyrant at full power—avatar of eternal flame. Resolution determines world's fate. Success: Fire stopped/controlled/negotiated. Failure: World becomes burning wasteland. Epilogue: Rebuilding what fire left or adapting to ash-covered world.
