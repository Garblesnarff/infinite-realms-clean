## The Ember Tyrant

Ancient entity embodying eternal combustion. Not evil—fire is its nature. Imprisoned for 10,000 years for burning uncontrollably. Sees life as fuel, burning as natural state. Intelligent but alien morality. Can be negotiated with: Offer controlled burning zones, natural fire cycles, coexistence. Or fight it—incredibly difficult, might require opposite extreme (flood, freeze).

## Fire Progression

**Day 1**: Lightning strike (or cult arson)
**Day 10**: 10,000 acres burning
**Day 20**: 100,000 acres, forest communities evacuating
**Day 40**: 1 million acres, unstoppable (campaign start)
**Day 60**: Reached grasslands, spreading faster
**Day 80**: Approaching cities, smoke global
**Day 100**: Final confrontation, burn or save

## Solutions

1. **Re-Imprisonment**: Create new Heartwood Tree, massive druid ritual, requires guardian sacrifice
2. **Destruction**: Summon opposing primordial (Water Lord floods, Frost Titan freezes), trade one apocalypse for another
3. **Negotiation**: Convince Tyrant to accept controlled existence—designated burn zones, natural fire cycles
4. **Exhaustion**: Let it burn everything, wait for fuel depletion (billions dead)
5. **Merger**: Party member becomes eternal flame keeper, guides Tyrant's burning

## Locations

**The Great Forest**: Continent-spanning woods, now burning, millions of creatures fleeing
**Heartwood Crater**: Miles-wide origin point, ocean of flame, Tyrant manifesting
**Scorched Wasteland**: Behind fire line, ash fields, nothing living, eerie beauty
**Refugee Plains**: Where millions gather, running out of space
**The Smoke Sky**: Global ash clouds blocking sun, crops dying, climate cooling despite fire

## Endings

**Controlled Fire**: Tyrant accepts designated burn zones, natural fire cycle restored
**New Prison**: Heartwood recreated, guardian volunteers to eternal watch
**Elemental War**: Water Lord floods world to stop fire, new disaster
**The Burning**: Total failure, world becomes flame, scattered fireproof survivors
**Exhaustion**: Tyrant burns itself out after consuming most life, pyrrhic victory
