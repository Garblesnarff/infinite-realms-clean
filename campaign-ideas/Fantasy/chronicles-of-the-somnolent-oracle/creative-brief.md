# Chronicles of the Somnolent Oracle - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Minority Report meets Doctor Strange—temporal visions, branching timelines visualized, time flowing like water.

**Color Palette:**
- **Past**: Sepia tones, faded colors
- **Present**: Full saturation, normal colors
- **Future**: Oversaturated, ethereal glow
- **Fixed Points**: Golden aura, unmistakable
- **Paradox Zones**: Colors that shift temporally

## Art Direction
- **Prophetic Visions**: Transparent overlays showing multiple outcomes
- **Temporal Dreamscape**: Escher meets Dali—time as physical space
- **The Inevitability**: Moves in reverse, ages backward, unsettling
- **Timeline Branches**: Visible as glowing pathways
- **Chronos**: Three ages simultaneously visible

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Philip Glass style minimalism—repeating patterns suggesting cycles
**Vision Theme:** Echoing, reverb-heavy, sounds from future bleeding into present
**Inevitability Theme:** Reversed audio, countdown timers, clockwork grinding
**Voice Direction:**
- **Chronos**: Speaks in past-present-future simultaneously ("You did/do/will")
- **Inevitability**: Reversed speech (players hear forward translation)
- **Future Selves**: Vary based on which timeline they represent

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Prophecy**: Vision overlaying reality, two timelines visible
- **Fixed Point Violation**: Temporal shockwave, reality rejecting change
- **Meeting Future Self**: Split screen—present and future
- **Time Storm**: Past, present, future colliding visually
- **Final Choice**: Seeing all possible outcomes simultaneously
