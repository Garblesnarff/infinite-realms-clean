They must balance winning fights to maintain their cover while conducting nighttime reconnaissance, uncovering drug laboratories, slave pens, and Han's collection of deadly enforcers.
*   **Act III — The Hall of Mirrors (Sessions 10–15):** The tournament finals take place in Han's legendary Hall of Mirrors, where reality and illusion blur. The party must defeat Han's champions, confront the crime lord himself, and escape the island as it descends into chaos, freeing prisoners and destroying the criminal infrastructure.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of honor versus survival, the corruption of martial arts by criminal greed, and the cost of revenge. The central conflict is whether the party can maintain their moral principles while infiltrating a ruthless organization, and whether they prioritize their personal vendettas or the greater good of freeing Han's captives.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Tournament Bracket System**
*   The tournament operates on a bracket system that the DM can adjust based on pacing.
*   Each fight can be a full combat encounter, a skill challenge (for minor opponents), or a series of contested ability checks representing different combat exchanges.
*   Winning fights grants reputation with Han, unlocking access to restricted areas of the island.

### 2. **Martial Arts Styles**
*   Each major NPC has a distinct fighting style that grants them unique abilities (Bolo's crushing blows, Mei Ling's pressure points, O'Hara's grappling).
*   Players can learn techniques from defeated opponents by studying their forms (represented by feat-like bonuses).
*   The campaign encourages creative use of monk abilities, battle master maneuvers, and open hand techniques.

### 3. **Stealth & Investigation Balance**
*   The party must maintain their cover as tournament competitors while investigating at night.
*   Failed stealth checks during investigation increase Han's Suspicion Score.
*   At certain thresholds, Han takes countermeasures: increased patrols, fake information traps, or confronting the party directly.

### 4. **The Hall of Mirrors Mechanic**
*   The final arena creates mirror duplicates of combatants that must be distinguished from the real fighters.
*   Perception checks reveal the true target, or players can attack mirrors to shatter them and reduce illusions.
*   Han can teleport between mirrors, requiring tactical positioning to corner him.

### 5. **Honor & Disgrace**
*   Player actions during fights affect their reputation: fighting honorably grants respect, fighting dirty grants fear.
*   High honor makes NPCs more willing to ally with the party and share information.
*   High disgrace makes Han more interested in recruiting them, offering better bribes and access.
