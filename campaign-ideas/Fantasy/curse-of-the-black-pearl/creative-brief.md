# Creative Brief: Curse of the Black Pearl

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Swashbuckling Fantasy Caribbean with Gothic Supernatural

Inspired by the vibrant yet dark aesthetics of the *Pirates of the Caribbean* films. This style captures the romance of the Golden Age of Piracy, the supernatural horror of cursed crews, the majesty of Age of Sail naval warfare, and the otherworldly beauty of ocean gods and realms of the dead.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Theatrical Swashbuckling:** Dynamic sword fights, swinging on ropes, dramatic poses on ship railings
*   **Moonlit Supernatural:** Curse reveals transform in moonlight—flesh becomes bone, beauty becomes horror
*   **Detailed Ship Combat:** Tall ships with full rigging, cannon fire, splintering wood, naval tactics
*   **Ocean Magic:** Glowing depths, tentacles from below, storms with divine fury, impossible whirlpools

Below, crew fires cannons at pursuing Company ship. Lightning illuminates scene in frozen moment. Diagonal rain, wind-whipped clothing, dynamic poses showing motion and balance. Dangerous energy of combat and storm combined."

## Music & Sound

*   **Environmental:** Creaking ship wood, crashing waves, cannon fire, wind in rigging, distant thunder

## Voice

A roguish, slightly drunk-sounding voice that nevertheless contains surprising wisdom. Speech pattern is circular—starts a thought, digresses into tangents, somehow arrives at point. Tone shifts between comedic rambling ("This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught..."), sudden seriousness about supernatural matters, and genuine emotion about freedom and the sea. Accent is indeterminate maritime—hints of British, Caribbean, and generic pirate. Often sounds like improvising but reveals planning later. Role: The voice of the cunning survivor who talks his way through everything.
