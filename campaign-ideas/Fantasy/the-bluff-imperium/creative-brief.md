# Creative Brief: The Bluff Imperium

## Art Style
Film noir meets Vegas glamour. Dark felt greens, rich reds, gold accents. Smoky atmosphere, dramatic lighting. Characters designed as anthropomorphic playing cards—hearts pulse with life, spades shimmer darkly, diamonds refract light, clubs are solid and sturdy. Faces show micro-expressions exaggerated for gameplay—raised eyebrows, twitching mouths, dilating pupils all visible.

## Color Palette
- **Hearts**: Crimson #DC143C, passionate reds
- **Diamonds**: Royal blue #4169E1 (not red—subvert expectations), wealth shimmer
- **Clubs**: Deep black #000000 with green undertones
- **Spades**: Obsidian #0B1013, authority dark
- **Felt**: Forest green #228B22
- **Chips**: Gold #FFD700, silver #C0C0C0, platinum #E5E4E2
- **Corruption**: Purple static when tells fail #9370DB

## Music
Jazz and electronic fusion. Upright bass represents heartbeats and tells. Saxophone for bluffing scenes. Electronic beats for high-stakes hands. Silence before big reveals. Dealer's theme is rhythmic card shuffling turned into percussion.

## Voice Direction

**The Dealer**: Whispered ASMR quality, sound of cards shuffling between words, never loud, terrifyingly calm

**Royal Flush Members**: Each suit has distinct accent (Hearts: French, Diamonds: British, Clubs: Russian, Spades: Italian), ranks determine vocal pitch (Ace highest, Ten lowest)

**The Bluff Master**: Confident salesman voice, every statement sounds convincing even when lying, warm and trustworthy tone hiding deception

**Tell Reader**: Clinical, analytical, describes what she sees ("Your left eye twitched 2mm, pupil dilation 15%, you're bluffing")

**Wild Card (Joker)**: Shifts voices randomly—male, female, old, young, accents changing mid-sentence, unstable audio

## Cinematic Moments

**The Bust**: Slow motion Dealer's cards being revealed—impossible losing hand. Reality glitches—cards blur, suits invert, the table cracks.

**Perfect Bluff**: Character claims Royal Flush with nothing. Close-ups on micro-expressions as opponent tries to read them. Heartbeat sound design. Opponent folds. Reveal of actual garbage hand.

**Going All-In**: Character pushes all chips forward. Time slows. Montage of what they could lose. Resume speed—cards flip, fate decided.

**Tell Reading Battle**: Split screen showing both players' faces. Overlays highlighting tells—eye movement tracks, breathing indicators, micro-expressions frozen and analyzed.

**The Final Hand**: All NPCs and party at Grand Table. Cards dealt in ritual silence. The pot is reality itself (visual of cosmos in chip pile). Five minutes of pure tension before showdown.
