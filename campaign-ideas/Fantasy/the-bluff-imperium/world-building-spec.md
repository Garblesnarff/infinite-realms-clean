**Culture**: Extreme elitism, believe their combination proves inherent superiority

### The Straight Flush Guilds
**Structure**: Groups of five sequential suited cards (e.g., 9♥ 8♥ 7♥ 6♥ 5♥)
**Role**: Military and merchant classes

### The Four-of-a-Kind Cartels
**Composition**: Four cards of same rank (e.g., 8♣ 8♦ 8♥ 8♠)

**Culture**: Brotherhood mentality, obsessed with matching and conformity

### The Full House Families
**Structure**: Three-of-a-Kind + Pair combinations
**Role**: Established families, landed gentry

### The Wild Card Anarchists
**Leader**: The Joker
**Belief**: Fixed rules are tyranny, embrace chaos and transformation
**Power**: Can become any card temporarily
**Danger**: Unstable, unpredictable, can disrupt any hand combination

## Cosmic Mechanics

### Ante as Life Force
Ante chips are crystallized belief and confidence. When you bet Ante, you're wagering your conviction in reality. Going bust means losing all belief—you cease to exist because you don't believe you do.

### The Tell Language
Micro-expressions form a language—pupil dilation = fear, nostril flare = aggression, eyebrow raise = surprise. Master Tell Readers can have entire conversations through facial micro-movements.

### Bluff Materialization
A sufficiently convincing bluff becomes real. If you make everyone believe you hold a Royal Flush, the universe reshapes your hand to match their belief. Reality is consensus.

### Pot Odds as Fate
The mathematical probability of winning a hand determines cosmic likelihood. Characters with correct pot odd calculations literally bend probability in their favor.

### The House Edge
The Dealer historically maintained a small advantage (house edge) that kept reality stable. With the Dealer gone, that edge is collapsing—chaos increasing.

### Tilt Cascade
When someone goes on tilt (emotional decision-making after bad beats), they emit tilt energy that can infect others. Tilt cascades can cause mass hysteria and poor decision-making.

## Historical Events

### The First Deal
Cosmic legend says reality began when the First Dealer dealt out the first hand from the infinite deck.

### The Suit Wars
Ancient conflict when Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades fought for dominance. Ended in stalemate—no suit superior.

### The Joker's Exile
The Wild Card was banished for disrupting too many hands. Eventually returned and formed the Anarchist movement.

### The Great Bluff
A Two of Clubs convinced everyone he was the Ace of Spades, ruled for 100 years before being called. His exposure caused economic collapse.

### The Tell Reader Purge
When Tell Readers first emerged, they executed anyone caught lying. This tyranny ended when the Poker Face Rebellion formed.

### The Dealer's Arrival
The current Dealer appeared mysteriously 1,000 years ago, bringing order and dealing fate. Now that stability is breaking down.

## The Final Revelation

The Unwinnable Hand was: The Dealer held Five Jokers. Impossible in normal poker, but the five Wild Cards combined to beat any normal hand. This reveals that Wild Cards are more powerful than the fixed hierarchy—chaos can defeat order. The party must decide whether to preserve the fixed suit/rank system or embrace the wild transformation the Jokers represent.
