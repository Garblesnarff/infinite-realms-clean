Creatures from all realms—dragons, demons, elves, mind flayers, and stranger beings—arrive to enjoy exquisite food in neutral territory.

## Difficulty Context

**Medium** - This campaign balances social encounters, investigation, and occasional combat. Success requires creative problem-solving, cultural sensitivity, and resource management. The challenges are less about defeating enemies and more about satisfying demanding customers, preventing conflicts between rival factions, and uncovering mysteries through careful observation and conversation.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8 sessions)

A tale of connection through cuisine, diplomacy through dining, and mystery through mundane magic.

*   **Act I — The Inheritance (Sessions 1-3):** The party discovers Restaurant Nekoya and learns its secret—it connects to multiple worlds on "Seventh Day." When the enigmatic owner disappears, leaving only a note asking them to "keep the doors open," they must quickly learn to cook, serve, and manage the establishment. They meet regular customers from various planes, each with their own stories and preferences. The party realizes that maintaining the restaurant's neutrality and quality is harder than it looks, as even small mistakes can have diplomatic consequences.
*   **Act II — The Gathering Storm (Sessions 4-6):** As the party becomes more skilled at running the restaurant, they notice concerning patterns: some customers have stopped coming, new faces appear with ulterior motives, and tension between rival factions is rising. A powerful entity called the Covenant Keeper appears, warning that the restaurant's neutrality is threatened. The party must navigate increasingly complex social situations, mediate disputes, and investigate why the balance is shifting. They discover that the restaurant is more than a business—it's a carefully maintained peace treaty between worlds.
*   **Act III — The Feast of Fates (Sessions 7-8):** The truth is revealed: someone is trying to destroy the restaurant to reignite old conflicts between planes. The party must prepare an unprecedented "Feast of Fates"—a meal so perfect that it reminds all guests why peace is worth preserving. They face sabotage, difficult customers with hidden agendas, and the final revelation of what happened to the original owner. The campaign culminates in a grand dinner service where every dish must be perfect, every guest must be satisfied, and the party's diplomatic skills will determine whether the doors between worlds remain open or close forever.

## Key Locations

1.  **Restaurant Nekoya (Main Floor):** A cozy, warm dining room with mismatched tables, a welcoming atmosphere, and a kitchen visible through a service window. The restaurant seats about 30 comfortably.

3.  **The Door Chamber:** A mystical back room where doors from across the multiverse materialize on Seventh Day. Each door is unique, reflecting its world of origin.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of unity through diversity, the power of hospitality, and finding common ground across impossible differences. The central conflict is maintaining peace and connection in a world (multiverse) that tends toward division and conflict.

The external conflict—stopping the saboteur and preventing the doors from closing—is driven by a deeper question: Is peaceful coexistence between vastly different cultures possible, or is it just a pleasant fantasy? The restaurant represents the hopeful answer, but it requires constant effort, understanding, and the willingness to serve others selflessly.

The campaign celebrates the idea that sharing a meal is one of the most powerful forms of connection, and that everyone—no matter how different—has something in common: the need for nourishment, comfort, and community.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Service Quality System**
*   Each Seventh Day service is rated on Quality (food taste/presentation), Timeliness (serving customers promptly), and Diplomacy (keeping the peace).
*   Success in all three earns "Satisfaction Points" that unlock benefits: new recipes, better ingredients, loyal customer support.
*   Failure results in consequences: customers don't return, negative rumors spread, the Covenant weakens.
*   The final Feast of Fates requires maximum Satisfaction Points to succeed.

### 2. **Recipe Mastery**
*   Master Tanaka's recipe book contains dishes from across the multiverse.
*   Learning a new recipe requires gathering specific ingredients and making successful cooking checks.
*   Each recipe has a "mastery level" that improves with practice.
*   Perfectly prepared dishes grant temporary buffs to customers (and can be crucial for diplomacy).
*   Some recipes have hidden magical properties that are discovered through experimentation.

### 3. **Customer Loyalty**
*   Regular customers develop relationships with the party based on how well they're served.
*   Loyal customers provide benefits: information, gifts, assistance during crises.
*   Each customer has a "Favorite Dish" and "Dietary Restrictions" that must be remembered.
*   Serving a customer their favorite meal perfectly grants advantage on social checks with them.
*   Offending a customer (wrong order, poor quality, showing favoritism) damages the relationship.

### 4. **The Doors of Infinity**
*   Each Seventh Day, 2d6 doors appear from random planes.
*   The DM rolls on a "Door Table" to determine which worlds connect that day.
*   Some doors bring friendly regulars, others bring new customers (potentially challenging).
*   Rare "Crisis Doors" bring customers in dire need or fleeing danger.
*   The party can learn to influence which doors appear by strengthening anchor sites.
