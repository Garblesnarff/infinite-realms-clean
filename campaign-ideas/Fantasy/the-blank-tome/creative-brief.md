# The Blank Tome - Creative Brief

## Art Direction
**Aesthetic**: Reality with visible edits. Crossed-out elements, margin notes appearing in space, floating text being written in real-time.

**The Tome**: Pure white leather, infinite pages, golden edges. Glows softly. Pages turn themselves. Text appears as reality changes.

**Rewrite Effects**: Reality pixelating/dissolving/rewriting. Photoshop-style editing in 3D space. Characters temporarily sketched before fully rendered.

## Music Direction
**Main Theme**: Pen scratching on paper as percussion. Silence and anticipation. The sound of creation.

**Rewrite Zones**: Music glitches, restarts, changes mid-phrase. Audio representation of narrative instability.

**The Blank Temple**: Absolute silence. Oppressive. Potential humming at edge of hearing.

**Final Session**: Ambient writing sounds. Soft encouragement. Music that builds as players narrate their ending.

## Voice Acting
**The First Scribe**: Authorial, omniscient narrator quality. Gentle but absolute.

**Chaos**: Anarchic, chaotic speech patterns, multiple voices, beautiful disorder.

**The Blank Prophet**: Speaks in whispers, pauses, incomplete sentences. The sound of unsaid things.

**The Recursive Author**: Aware they're fictional. Speaks with metafictional knowledge. Fourth-wall breaking.

## Sound Design
**Writing Effects**: Pen on paper, ink flowing, pages turning. Sacred sounds of creation.

**Reality Rewrites**: Static, glitching, erasing sounds, redrawing whooshes.

**The Tome Opening**: Leather creaking, pages whispering potential, golden light humming.
