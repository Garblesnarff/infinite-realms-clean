### Core Premise
At school, Kyoko Hori is the perfect student—popular, responsible, attractive, and seemingly has it all together. But at home, she transforms: dressed in simple clothes, caring for her younger brother, managing the household while her parents work. Meanwhile, Izumi Miyamura appears gloomy and antisocial at school, with long dark hair covering his face. But beneath his clothes, he hides elaborate tattoos and piercings from a rebellious phase he's ashamed of. When they accidentally encounter each other outside school—Hori seeing Miyamura's true appearance when he helps her injured brother, and Miyamura discovering Hori's domestic life—they form a pact to keep each other's secrets. As they spend more time together in their "real" forms, they fall in love, learning that their authentic selves are far more lovable than their carefully constructed facades.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Secret Revealed (Sessions 1-3)**
- Introduction to both characters' dual lives. Hori is popular at the academy but exhausted from maintaining perfection. Miyamura is isolated and lonely, assumed to be gloomy when he's actually just shy. An accidental meeting outside school reveals their secrets. They agree to help each other—Miyamura helps with Hori's brother, Hori gives him a safe space to be himself. They grow comfortable with each other in ways they can't with anyone else.

**Act 2: Growing Closer (Sessions 4-7)**
- As they spend more time together, their relationship deepens from friendship to romance. Other students begin noticing changes—Miyamura smiles more, cuts his hair, becomes more social. Hori shows her more genuine self even at school. Their friends (Toru, Yuki, and others) get involved, creating a wider circle of authentic relationships. Small adventures and slice-of-life moments build intimacy. They confess their feelings and begin dating, but struggle with how public to make it.

**Act 3: Authentic Selves (Sessions 8-10)**
- The final arc deals with integrating their secret and public selves. Miyamura reveals his tattoos and piercings to their friend group, fearing rejection but finding acceptance. Hori struggles with jealousy and possessiveness as Miyamura becomes more popular. They learn that being vulnerable and real is better than being perfect and fake. The campaign ends with them comfortable in their own skin, openly together, and surrounded by friends who know and love their authentic selves.

### Key Locations

- **The Academy**: Where public personas are maintained. Classrooms, hallways, the rooftop where friends gather.
- **Hori's House**: Her true territory. A modest but warm home where she cooks, cleans, and cares for Souta. Where she can be herself.
- **Miyamura's Apartment**: Rarely shown. Sparse and lonely, reflecting his isolation before meeting Hori.
- **The Park**: Where the friend group hangs out. Neutral territory for both public and private selves.
- **Various Slice-of-Life Locations**: Shops, cafés, the summer festival, winter ice skating—places where the relationship deepens through small moments.

### Central Conflict
The tension between public persona and private self. The fear that our authentic selves aren't good enough versus the reality that we're most lovable when we're genuine. Learning to integrate all aspects of identity rather than compartmentalizing.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Dual Identity Tracking**: Track how each character presents themselves at school vs. at home/with each other. As the campaign progresses, these identities should merge.
- **Intimacy Through Mundane Acts**: Major relationship development happens during domestic activities—cooking, cleaning, shopping, caring for Souta. These are skill challenges that build emotional connection.
- **Revelation Moments**: When characters reveal hidden aspects of themselves (Miyamura's tattoos, Hori's domestic life, their relationship), roll for how others react. Track acceptance levels.
- **The Comfort Zone**: Miyamura has a "Social Comfort" meter. Being his authentic self with Hori raises it. This makes him more confident in other social situations, mechanically reflected in better social skill checks.
- **Domestic Skills**: Both characters gain mechanical bonuses to domestic tasks (cooking, cleaning, childcare) that wouldn't typically matter in D&D but are central to their relationship and character growth.
