# The Divine Comedy Quest

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Comedy Fantasy / Parody / Adventure / Slice-of-Life
- **Estimated Length**: 6-8 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-10
- **Tone**: Hilarious, Irreverent, Absurd, Heartwarming, Self-Aware

### Core Premise
The players died embarrassing deaths and awoke before a beautiful but utterly useless goddess who offers them reincarnation in a fantasy world to defeat the Demon King. There's just one problem: they can bring one thing with them, and if they choose the goddess herself, she comes along as a party member. Trapped in a fantasy world with terrible luck, impossible quests, and party members who are incredibly powerful but utterly dysfunctional, the players must somehow make a living, pay off their debts, and maybe - eventually - do something about that Demon King. Emphasis on comedy, character dynamics, and the gap between fantasy expectations and ridiculous reality.

### Difficulty Context: **Light**
This campaign prioritizes fun, comedy, and character moments over tactical challenge. Encounters are designed to create humorous situations rather than deadly threats. Success comes from creative problem-solving and embracing the absurdity.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Welcome to Axel (Sessions 1-3)**
- Players die ridiculous deaths, meet goddess Aqua, and are reincarnated in a fantasy town called Axel. They discover this world doesn't work like they expected: magic has bizarre requirements, quests pay terribly, their party members are powerful but useless, and they're drowning in debt. They take on starter quests that go hilariously wrong while learning that survival requires creativity and teamwork.

**Act 2: The Ridiculous Adventures (Sessions 4-6)**
- The party gains notoriety (usually for the wrong reasons) and takes on increasingly absurd quests. They battle giant toads, destroy noble mansions, accidentally become wanted criminals, and somehow make things worse while trying to help. Each session is a semi-contained adventure that builds their reputation and relationships while slowly, accidentally progressing toward the Demon King plot.

**Act 3: The Accidental Heroes (Sessions 7-8)**
- Despite their best efforts to avoid it, the party is drawn into confronting one of the Demon King's generals. Through a combination of dumb luck, creative abuse of overpowered abilities, and the power of friendship (and explosion magic), they somehow succeed. They realize they might actually be able to defeat the Demon King - they just need to survive their own incompetence first.

### Key Locations

- **The Town of Axel**: Beginner adventurer town near the Demon King's territory. Has guild hall, shops, taverns, and stable. Familiar and comfortable despite constant chaos. The party's home base.

- **The Adventurer's Guild Hall**: Where quests are posted, parties register, and the party causes constant problems. Luna's desk is ground zero for chaos. Has quest board, dining area, and training grounds.

- **The Party's Stable Residence**: They live in a stable because it's cheap. Somehow becomes increasingly comfortable. Site of character bonding moments and morning chaos.

- **Wiz's Magic Shop**: Sells magical items of questionable utility. Constantly on the verge of bankruptcy. Safe space where party can relax and plot.

- **The Succubus Shop**: Establishment offering dreams of your desires. Aqua tries to shut it down; party members visit for various reasons. Source of recurring gags.

- **Alcanretia**: Hot springs town full of Aqua cultists. Absolutely chaotic when the party visits. Beautiful springs but insufferable zealots.

### Central Conflict
The tension between epic fantasy expectations and absurd reality. The party is supposedly destined to defeat the Demon King, but they're broke, dysfunctional, and cause as many problems as they solve. The real conflict is whether they can grow as people, function as a team, and maybe accidentally become heroes - while surviving their own incompetence and terrible decision-making. The campaign explores friendship, found family, and the idea that heroes don't have to be perfect, just persistent.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Aqua's Luck Aura**: At the start of each session, roll a d20 for "Party Luck." 1-5: Things will go hilariously wrong (disadvantage on one roll). 6-15: Normal chaos. 16-20: Absurd good fortune (advantage on one roll). This creates unpredictability and opportunities for comedy.

- **Megumin's Explosion**: Once per day, Megumin can cast Explosion (10d6 force damage, 40-ft radius, no save). It always succeeds and destroys the target. Then she collapses and cannot walk. Someone must carry her. The party must decide when to use this tactical nuke.

- **Darkness Can't Hit Anything**: Darkness has incredible AC and HP, but disadvantage on all attack rolls. However, enemies are drawn to attack her (she provokes opportunity attacks deliberately). She's the perfect tank and terrible fighter.

- **Absurd Success Through Failure**: When the party's plan fails spectacularly (DM's discretion), they can turn the failure into success through creative narration. Explain how the disaster actually solved the problem. Rewards creativity and embraces chaos. Can be used once per session.
