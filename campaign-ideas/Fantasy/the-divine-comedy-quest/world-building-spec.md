### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Divine Comedy Quest**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players died embarrassing deaths and were reincarnated by a useless goddess into a fantasy world to defeat the Demon King. Unfortunately, they brought the goddess with them, and she's more trouble than help. In the beginner town of Axel, they must assemble a dysfunctional party of overpowered but specialized adventurers. Through absurd quests, property damage, and terrible decisions, they somehow become heroes while drowning in debt and causing chaos. Success requires embracing the absurdity and the power of friendship.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the reincarnation system where people from other worlds are recruited to fight the Demon King.
    *   Write the history of the Demon King and why they need to be defeated (keep it lighthearted).
    *   Describe the class and skill system, including ridiculous specialized classes like "Arch-Wizard Who Only Knows Explosion."
    *   Explain why the goddess Aqua was allowed to be brought to the mortal world and cannot return.
    *   Detail the Eris faith vs. Aqua faith rivalry (petty religious squabbles).
    *   Describe the Crimson Demon Clan and their obsession with chunibyou behavior and explosion magic.
