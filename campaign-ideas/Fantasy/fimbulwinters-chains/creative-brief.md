# Fimbulwinter's Chains - Creative Brief

## Art Direction

### Visual Style
**Frozen Desolation with Crystalline Beauty** - The world is dying but beautiful. Every frame should balance the horror of endless winter with the terrible aesthetic perfection of ice and darkness.

### Color Palettes
- **Dominant**: Blues (ice blue, midnight blue, steel blue), whites (snow, frost, ice), blacks (endless night)
- **Accent**: Dim reds and oranges (geothermal vents, fire, precious warmth), pale greens (sickly Aurora, dying life)
- **Contrast**: Memories of spring/summer shown in oversaturated, almost painful warmth

**Underground Cities**: Warm reds from fires, amber lighting, cave browns
**Surface World**: Monochrome blues and whites, minimal color, oppressive darkness
**Seasonal Visions**: Each season vibrant when manifested—green/pink for Spring, gold/orange for Summer, rust/burgundy for Autumn

### Environmental Design
- **Ice Everywhere**: Frost on every surface, icicles, frozen architecture half-buried
- **Darkness**: Perpetual twilight at best, usually full night
- **Verticality**: Underground cities descend deep, Frost Palace towers impossibly high
- **Beautiful Death**: Frozen corpses, ice-preserved ruins, crystalline formations

### Character Design
- **Humans**: Layered clothing, fur, makeshift insulation, gaunt from rationing, pale from darkness
- **Winter/Empress**: Impossibly beautiful ice-queen, inhuman perfection, crystalline crown, eyes without warmth
- **Season Spirits**: Translucent, ghostly, struggling to maintain form in endless cold

## Music Direction

### Overall Tone
Cold ambient soundscapes, minimal melodies, lots of silence and wind. Use of drone notes, bells, ice sounds.

**Key Instruments**:
- Strings (cold, high, tense)
- Bells and chimes (ice-like)
- Synthesizers (atmospheric drones)
- Silence (important—make it uncomfortable)

**Reference Artists**:
- Sigur Rós (Icelandic atmospheric)
- Hildur Guðnadóttir (Chernobyl OST - cold dread)
- Thomas Köner (ambient ice)
- Real blizzard/arctic wind recordings

**Winter's Theme**: High crystalline notes, wind sounds, beautiful but emotionless
**Spring's Theme**: Fragile flute, hesitant, barely there, growing stronger if revived
**Summer's Theme**: Desperate strings building to rage, fire sounds
**Autumn's Theme**: Resigned cello, falling patterns, wisdom in decay

## Voice Acting

**Empress of Ending Seasons (Winter)**: Female voice processed with reverb and cold, beautiful but inhuman, slow speech, ancient and weary. Reference: Tilda Swinton + ice cracking sounds

**Ghost of Spring**: Child voice, distant echo, confused and sad, growing stronger. Like someone calling from far away.

**Fury of Summer**: Crackling, aggressive, male energy, impatient, rage barely contained. Heat and flame underlying all words.

**Wisdom of Autumn**: Elderly, androgynous, accepting, gentle but firm. Rustling leaves punctuate speech.

**Human NPCs**: Exhausted, cold, desperate but determined. Voices should sound like people surviving against impossible odds.

## Sensory Elements

**Constant Cold**: Describe temperature every scene, breath visible, shivering, numb extremities
**Darkness**: Limited vision, reliance on firelight, oppressive night
**Sound**: Wind always present, ice cracking, distant howling, eerie quiet
**Smell**: Clean cold air, woodsmoke, stale underground air, absence of growing things

## Marketing

**Tagline**: "Winter Came. Winter Stayed. Winter Speaks."
**Key Art**: Frozen city buried in snow, single light in window, massive ice-queen figure looming in aurora-lit sky above
**Color Script**: Begin in warm underground (false security), move to monochrome ice surface, end with hints of color if spring returns
