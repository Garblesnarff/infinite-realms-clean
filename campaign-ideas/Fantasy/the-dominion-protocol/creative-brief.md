# Creative Brief: The Dominion Protocol

## Art Style
Card-based reality where everything appears as physical playing cards. Characters are composed of their deck cards orbiting around them. Action cards glow and activate with magical effects. Treasure cards shimmer with metallic light (copper dull, silver bright, gold radiant). Victory cards appear heavy and ornate but dim (representing their power but uselessness). The Supply appears as glowing card pillars. The Trash is a dimensional void where cards fall into darkness.

## Music
Medieval fantasy meets strategic planning. Harpsichord for treasure counting. String quartet for action chains. Percussion for buying and trashing. Each card type has musical signature: Village is upbeat dance, Smithy is industrial hammering, Laboratory is curious investigation, Witch is ominous chanting. Shuffling deck creates rhythmic foundation. Buying cards has satisfying "purchase" chime. Trashing cards has sorrowful farewell melody.

## Voice Direction

**Copper Collective**: Meek, defeated, speak in unison about their unchanging poverty

**Province Baron**: Regal but struggling, out of breath from carrying so many VP cards, powerful but weak

**Chapel Priest**: Solemn, speaks of necessary sacrifice and painful growth, offers difficult salvation

**Village Architect**: Rapid-fire excited speech about combos and synergies, talks in action chains

**Curse Witch**: Cackling malice, takes pleasure in others' suffering, spreads corruption gleefully

**Laboratory Scientist**: Analytical, curious, constantly theorizing about deck optimization

**Custom Card Creator**: Glitching voice mixing multiple card effects, unstable audio, reality-breaking

**Trash Transcendent**: Eerily calm, speaks from beyond the cycle, knows peace of permanence

## Cinematic Moments

**First Turn**: Character draws five cards from their deck. The cards appear hovering around them. They play a Copper (it dissolves into one coin), a Village (splits into two action markers), then a Smithy (three new cards materialize into hand). They spend coins to buy a Silver (it appears and falls into discard pile). Discard hand, draw five new cards.

**The Shuffle**: Deck pile empties—last card drawn. The discard pile (dozens of cards) levitates, swirls in tornado formation, shuffles randomly, then settles back down as new deck pile. The past becomes the future.

**Perfect Combo**: Village (+2 actions) → Smithy (+3 cards) → Market (+1 action, +1 card, +1 coin, +1 buy) → Repeat. Actions chain infinitely. Character draws entire deck, has 50+ coins, buys five Provinces in single turn. Unstoppable engine achieved.

**Chapel Sacrifice**: Character plays Chapel card. Dark altar appears. They select four cards (three Estates, one Copper) and throw them into the altar. Cards burn away completely—removed from deck forever. Painful but purifying. Deck is now leaner and stronger.

**Curse Attack**: Witch card activates. Opponent must take a Curse. A black poisonous card manifests and forces itself into their deck. -1 Victory Point. Their deck is now corrupted.

**Trash Transcendence Ending**: Character makes final choice—trashes their entire deck including their own identity card. They fall into the Trash dimension. Instead of destruction, they find peace—no more shuffling, no more cycling, permanent existence outside the protocol.
