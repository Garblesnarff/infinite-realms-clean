# World-Building Specification: The Dominion Protocol

## Faction Details

### The Big Money Faction
Philosophy: Simple is best. Just buy treasure and provinces. No complex combos. Pragmatic and consistent. Represent traditional capitalism and accumulation.

### The Engine Builders
Philosophy: Create perfect action chains. Draw entire deck every turn. Generate infinite resources. Represent optimization and mastery. Tech-focused elite.

### The Trash Purifiers
Philosophy: Chapel worship. Trash all weak cards. Achieve deck purity through destruction. Represent asceticism and self-improvement through sacrifice.

### The Attack Militants
Philosophy: Victory through sabotage. Militia, Witch, and other attacks. Weaken enemies rather than strengthen self. Represent conflict and zero-sum thinking.

### The Gardens Cultivators
Philosophy: Win through alternative VP. Gardens gives 1 VP per 10 cards. Build massive deck instead of trimming it. Represent quantity over quality.

### The Curse Spreaders
Philosophy: Drag everyone into negative VP. Witch, Mountebank, and other curse-givers. If everyone has -10 VP, having -5 VP wins. Represent spite and malice.

### The Platinum Elitists
Philosophy: Only buy the best. Platinum treasures, Colony victory cards. Disdain "lesser" cards like Copper and Estate. Represent luxury and excess.

### The Village Communalists
Philosophy: Villages provide +2 actions, enabling community action chains. Believe in collective power through connection. Represent cooperation and synergy.

### The Laboratory Scholars
Philosophy: Knowledge is power. Draw cards to see more options. Laboratory (+2 cards, +1 action) worshipers. Represent education and information.

### The Remodel Transformers
Philosophy: Use Remodel to transform weak cards into strong cards. Estate becomes Duchy becomes Province. Represent evolution and metamorphosis.

### The Custom Card Rebels
Philosophy: Create new kingdom cards outside the protocol. Break established rules. Represent innovation or heresy depending on perspective.

## The Deck-Building Philosophy

### Your Deck Is Your Soul
The 10+ cards you carry aren't possessions—they're components of consciousness. Copper represents base material thought. Silver is improved cognition. Gold is enlightened thinking. Victory cards are ego—they feel good but make you slower.

### The Discard-Shuffle Cycle
Buddhist wheel of samsara. Your played cards (actions taken) go to discard (past). When deck (future) empties, discard becomes deck (past becomes future). You're trapped in cycle of return—everything you've done comes back. Enlightenment means escaping the cycle.

### The Trash as Nirvana
Trashed cards don't cycle back—they're free. The Trash is not hell but heaven. Cards there exist permanently, unchanging, outside the shuffle. Liberation through destruction of cycling self.

### Victory Points as Attachment
Provinces and VP cards are worldly attachments. They feel like achievement but weaken your functionality. The more you "win" traditionally, the worse you perform. Enlightenment requires letting go of victory.

### Action Chains as Flow State
Perfect combo (Village → Smithy → Market → repeat) is flow state consciousness. Actions chain naturally without thought. But achieving this requires sacrificing traditional victory (too many action cards means too few VP cards).

## Extended NPC Roster

### The Copper Majority
Billions of citizens who never improve beyond starting deck. Fear change. Comfortable in poverty. Represent masses who accept their station.

### The Province Baron (full backstory)
Started poor, worked hard, bought every Province. Has 8 Provinces in 20-card deck. 48 Victory Points—but draws Province instead of action 40% of the time. Paralyzed by success. Can barely function but "winning" by traditional metrics.

### The Chapel Priest (full backstory)
Discovered enlightenment through destruction. Trashed all Estates and Coppers. Achieved perfect lean deck—but then kept going, trashing Silvers, Golds, eventually trashing self. Now exists in Trash dimension, offering others the same liberation/destruction.

### The Village Architect (full backstory)
Built perfect engine: 15 Villages, 10 Smithies, 5 Markets. Can draw entire deck, play 50+ actions, generate 100+ coins per turn. But has zero VP cards—refuses to clog the beautiful machine. Cannot "win" but doesn't care. Represents pure mastery over victory.

### The Witch Queen (full backstory)
Spread 47 Curses to opponents. Every enemy has negative VP. She has 0 VP but wins by default. Victory through making everyone else worse. Represents spite, zero-sum thinking, and the dark side of competition.

## The Revelation

The Dominion Protocol is not a game—it's existence itself. "Deck-building" is the process of identity construction. You start poor and weak (7 Copper, 3 Estate) but can choose who to become through purchases (buy what you want to be, trash what you don't want).

The Supply represents available options—society's possibilities. The kingdom cards chosen determine what realities are accessible. Different kingdoms create different worlds.

The Victory Point race is society's trap—accumulating wealth/status (Provinces) feels like winning but actually weakens you. The richest people are often the most dysfunctional (Province Baron).

The Trash is not death—it's transcendence. Trashing your cards (and eventually yourself) means exiting the cycle of reincarnation (discard-shuffle). The Trash is nirvana.

The Custom Card Creator represents evolution beyond established rules. New kingdom cards mean new possibilities—expanding beyond the protocol's limitations. This is either heresy (to traditionalists) or enlightenment (to progressives).

## Final Choice

Party must decide:

1. **Win Traditionally**: Accumulate 6 Provinces, achieve highest VP, "win" the game. This validates the protocol but traps you in the cycle.

2. **Perfect Engine**: Build infinite combo deck, achieve total mastery, but reject VP cards entirely. Power without victory—mastery for its own sake.

3. **Trash Transcendence**: Chapel yourself and entire deck into the Trash. Exit the protocol permanently. Nirvana through self-destruction.

4. **Create New Cards**: Work with Custom Card Creator to make kingdom cards that didn't exist before. Expand the protocol—evolution rather than preservation or destruction.

5. **Merge All Decks**: Combine everyone's decks into one massive cosmic deck. Collective consciousness—individuality lost but unity gained.

Each ending represents different philosophy about identity, progress, competition, and the meaning of existence. The "right" answer depends on the party's values developed through the campaign.
