# The Dominion Protocol
*"You are your deck. Your cards are your choices. Build yourself from copper to gold, from estate to province."*

## Campaign Overview

The Dominion is a realm where individuals exist as living card decks. Each person starts with ten cards: seven Copper (1 coin each) and three Estate (1 Victory Point each)—poor and weak. Life is the process of deck-building: buying better cards to add to your deck, trashing bad cards, upgrading your abilities, and accumulating Victory Point cards that represent power and status but clog your deck during play (they do nothing except count toward final score).

The central mechanic: each "turn" you draw five cards from your deck (your hand), play Action cards to manipulate reality, spend Treasure cards to buy new cards from the Supply piles (cosmic marketplace), then discard everything and draw five new cards. Your discard pile reshuffles into your deck when empty—creating an ever-evolving cycle where your past choices return to haunt or help you.

The campaign begins when the impossible occurs: someone draws six cards instead of five. Then a player buys a card that isn't in any Supply pile. The fundamental rules of deck-building are corrupting. Investigation reveals that someone has created custom kingdom cards—new action/treasure/victory cards with abilities that break the established protocol. More disturbing: some people's decks are merging with others, creating hybrid identities.

The party must master deck-building: buying Action cards (Village, Smithy, Laboratory, Market), Treasure cards (Silver, Gold, Platinum), Victory cards (Duchy, Province, Colony), and Attack cards that hurt opponents. They'll build powerful engine decks that chain actions together, thin their decks by trashing weak cards, and discover that the Victory Point race is actually a trap—accumulating Provinces makes your deck clunky and weak. The truth: you're not your cards; you're the space between them. Transcending the deck means stopping the buy-discard-shuffle cycle entirely.

## Core Themes

- **Identity as Constructed**: You build yourself through choices
- **Efficiency vs. Victory**: Strong deck vs. high points (contradictory goals)
- **The Cycle of Return**: Everything discarded comes back
- **Deck Thinning**: Removing your weaknesses
- **Engine Building**: Chaining actions for exponential power
- **The Trash as Sacrifice**: Destroying parts of yourself permanently

## Campaign Sessions (30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Starting Deck (Sessions 1-8)
Party begins with basic 10-card decks (7 Copper, 3 Estate). Learning deck-building mechanics—draw five, play actions, buy cards, shuffle discard when empty. First kingdom card purchases. Discovery of the six-card anomaly. Introduction to the Supply piles and the Trash.

### Arc 2: The Engine Wars (Sessions 9-17)
Advanced deck-building—creating action chains (Village into Smithy into Market). Political conflict between Big Money strategy (just buy treasure and provinces) vs. Engine Building (create complex action combos). Discovery of custom kingdom cards that shouldn't exist. Investigation into who's creating them.

### Arc 3: The Attack Phase (Sessions 18-25)
Introduction to Attack cards (Witch, Militia, Mountebank) that force opponents to discard, gain curses, or weaken their decks. The party must defend against deck corruption while attacking enemies. Discovery that Victory Point cards are weakening everyone—the more you "win," the worse your deck performs.

### Arc 4: The Trash Transcendence (Sessions 26-30)
Final arc. Discovery that the Trash (where destroyed cards go permanently) is actually a higher plane of existence where cards are freed from the deck cycle. The party must choose: accumulate Provinces and "win" traditionally, or trash their entire deck (including themselves) and transcend the protocol entirely. Final boss is a being who has achieved perfect deck efficiency but lost all victory points—or vice versa.

## Key NPCs

### The Copper Collective (Starting Masses)
Citizens who never buy better cards, remaining forever with starting 7 Copper + 3 Estate decks. Represent stagnation and fear of change. Comfortable in weakness because it's familiar.

### The Province Baron (Victory Hoarder)
Has accumulated massive Victory Points (Provinces, Colonies) but their deck is so clogged with VP cards that they can barely function. Rich but paralyzed. Represents the trap of traditional victory.

### The Chapel Priest (Trash Master)
Commands the Chapel card (trash up to 4 cards per turn). Can permanently remove cards from decks. Terrifying power to destroy identity. Offers liberation through destruction or tyranny through forced "improvement."

### The Village Architect (Action Chainer)
Has built the perfect engine—Villages providing extra actions, Smithies drawing cards, Markets giving coins and buys. Can take infinite actions per turn but has neglected Victory Points. Powerful but can't "win" traditionally.

### The Curse Witch (Attack Specialist)
Spreads Curse cards (-1 VP) to opponents through Witch card. Weakens enemies while strengthening self. Represents sabotage and zero-sum thinking.

### The Silver Knight (Balanced Median)
Avoids extremes. Uses Silver (not Copper or Gold), Duchy (not Estate or Province). Represents moderation and balance. Neither strongest nor richest, but consistent.

### The Militia General (Hand Control)
Uses Militia card to force opponents to discard down to 3 cards. Controls others' options. Military faction that believes in limiting enemy capabilities rather than improving own.

### The Laboratory Scientist (Draw Engine)
Obsessed with drawing more cards. Laboratory gives +2 cards, +1 action. Believes perfect information (seeing entire deck) is the path to victory. Pursues omniscience over accumulation.

### The Throne Room Duplicator (Doubling Power)
Uses Throne Room card to play other action cards twice. Represents exponential thinking and combo potential. Can double effects but requires precise setup.

### The Gardens Grower (Alternative Victory)
Uses Gardens card (1 VP per 10 cards in deck). Wins by having massive deck instead of traditional VP cards. Represents alternative path to victory through quantity over quality.

### The Custom Card Creator (The Corruptor)
Mysterious entity creating new kingdom cards that don't fit the protocol. Either genius innovator or reality-breaking virus. Final boss or savior depending on perspective.

### The Trash Transcendent (The Freed One)
Former player who trashed their entire deck, including their own identity card. Now exists in the Trash—permanent, unchanging, outside the shuffle cycle. Enlightened or destroyed?

## Major Locations

### The Supply (Cosmic Marketplace)
Ten kingdom card piles plus basic treasure/victory piles. What's available shapes what reality can become. Changes between games. Represents possibility and limitation.

### The Trash (Permanent Destruction)
Where trashed cards go—never to return to deck. Different from discard (which cycles back). Represents death, sacrifice, or transcendence depending on philosophy.

### The Discard Pile (The Past)
Where played and bought cards go. Awaiting reshuffle into deck. The past that will return as future. Visible to all—no secrets about what you've done.

### The Deck (Potential)
Undrawn cards. Your future. Hidden from everyone including yourself. Mystery and anticipation. When empty, triggers reshuffle—past becomes future.

### The Hand (Present Reality)
Five cards currently available (standard). What you can act with right now. Temporary but powerful. Discards at end of turn—the fleeting present.

### The Play Area (Active Choices)
Where action cards are played during turn. Visible effects happening in real-time. Public demonstration of your strategy.

### The Victory Vault
Where Province and Colony cards are stored—the goal everyone pursues. Tempting but treacherous—taking them weakens your deck's functionality.

### The Curse Swamp
Where Curse cards originate. Negative VP cards forced on players by attacks. Toxic waste dump of malicious magic.

### The Chapel of Destruction
Where the Chapel card dwells. Allows trashing (permanent removal) of up to 4 cards. Temple of sacrifice and purification.

### The Kingdom Chamber
Where the 10 kingdom cards for each "game" are chosen. Cosmic lottery that determines available strategies. Different kingdoms create different realities.

### The Big Money Highway
The simplest strategy—just buy treasure and provinces, no complex actions. Fast but limited. Represents pragmatism over creativity.

### The Engine Workshop
Where complex action chains are built and tested. Laboratory of possibility. Represents mastery and optimization.

## Unique Mechanics

### Deck-Building Core
Start with 10 cards (7 Copper, 3 Estate). Each turn: draw 5 cards, play actions, buy cards (add to discard), clean up (discard hand and played cards), draw 5 new cards. When deck empty, shuffle discard into new deck.

### Action Cards
Provide abilities: +Cards (draw more), +Actions (play more actions), +Coins (spend more), +Buys (buy multiple cards), special effects (trash, attack, etc.)

### Treasure Cards
Copper (+1 coin), Silver (+2 coins), Gold (+3 coins), Platinum (+5 coins). Spend coins during buy phase.

### Victory Cards
Estate (1 VP), Duchy (3 VP), Province (6 VP), Colony (10 VP). Score points but do nothing during turns—dead weight that clogs deck.

### Attack Cards
Hurt opponents: force discards, add Curses (-1 VP), reduce hand size. Create interaction and conflict.

### Trash Mechanic
Permanently remove cards from deck. Improves efficiency by removing weak cards but reduces deck size. Chapel, Remodel, and other cards enable this.

### Combo Chains
String together actions: Village (+2 actions) → Smithy (+3 cards) → Market (+1 action, +1 buy, +1 coin, +1 card) → repeat with more actions.

### Deck Cycling
Understanding when your deck reshuffles. Can time purchases to come into hand when needed. Skilled players track every card.

### Big Money Strategy
Simple approach: buy treasure and VP, minimal actions. Consistent but limited. Good for beginners.

### Engine Strategy
Complex approach: build action chains to draw deck, generate infinite coins/actions. Powerful but requires setup.

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: You ARE Your Deck
The cards aren't possessions—they're components of identity. Trashing a card is removing part of your soul. Buying new cards is choosing who to become.

### Twist 2: Victory Points Are Poison
Provinces and other VP cards intentionally weaken decks. The "victory" condition is designed to make winners weak so others can catch up. True power requires rejecting VP.

### Twist 3: The Trash Is Heaven
Cards in Trash haven't been destroyed—they've transcended. They're free from the shuffle cycle, existing permanently rather than temporarily.

### Twist 4: The Supply Is Finite
When Supply piles run out (3 empty piles ends game), reality collapses. The approaching scarcity is existential threat—eventually there will be no more cards to buy.

### Twist 5: All Decks Are One Deck
Everyone's decks are secretly part of one massive cosmic deck. When you buy a card, you're removing it from others' possibilities. Zero-sum existence.

## Victory Conditions

### Traditional Victory
Accumulate most Victory Points through Provinces, Duchies, and special VP cards. Trigger game end (3 empty Supply piles or Province pile empty). Count VPs—highest wins.

### Perfect Engine
Build deck so powerful it draws itself entirely each turn, generates infinite coins, buys every remaining card. Achieve total deck mastery without caring about VPs.

### Trash Transcendence
Trash entire deck including self. Enter the Trash permanently. Achieve freedom from the shuffle cycle. Enlightenment through destruction.

### Curse Everyone
Use attack cards to give every opponent multiple Curses. Drag everyone into negative VPs. Win through sabotage rather than self-improvement.

### Alternative Victory
Use Gardens or other alternative VP cards to win through unconventional means. Prove there are multiple paths to victory.

## Defeat Conditions

### Curse Death
Accumulate too many Curse cards (-1 VP each). Negative victory points. Deck so poisoned it cannot function.

### Deck Bloat
Buy too many cards including VP cards. Deck becomes massive and inconsistent. Can't draw what you need when you need it.

### Action Lock
Opponents attack to reduce hand size or block actions. Unable to play your combos. Paralyzed by enemy interference.

### Supply Exhaustion
All Supply piles empty before you've accumulated VPs. Game ends prematurely with you in losing position.

### Identity Dissolution
Trash too many cards, including core identity. Deck becomes empty void. You cease to exist as coherent being.
