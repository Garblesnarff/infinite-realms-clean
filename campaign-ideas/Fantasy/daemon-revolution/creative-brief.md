# Daemon Revolution - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Victorian Gothic meets Arctic fantasy. Philip Pullman's naturalistic magic. Daemons rendered as photorealistic animals. Steampunk elements (zeppelins, alethiometer mechanisms) grounded in period aesthetic.

## Color Palettes
**Northern Lights**: Aurora Green (#00FF7F), Ice Blue (#E0FFFF), Night Purple (#301934), Star White (#FFFAFA)
**Magisterium**: Authority Black (#0F0F0F), Dogma Grey (#696969), Crimson (#DC143C), Brass (#B5A642)
**Dust**: Golden Amber (#FFBF00), Consciousness Shimmer (iridescent), Truth Blue (#4169E1)

## Music
Orchestral with emphasis on strings. Nordic influences for Arctic sequences. Choral elements for Magisterium (sacred music corrupted). Individual daemon themes (instrumentation matching animal).

## Voice Direction
**Mrs. Coulter**: Nicole Kidman's cold elegance. Maternal warmth hiding cruelty.
**Lord Asriel**: Daniel Craig's intensity. Aristocratic rebel.
**Iorek**: Deep bass, slow speech, absolute certainty.
**Lee Scoresby**: Sam Elliott's Texan drawl, humor masking heroism.

## Cinematic Moments
- Daemon settling (transformation finalizing)
- Intercision horror (surgical soul removal)
- Iorek's bear fight (armored combat)
- Aurora bridge opening (reality tearing)
- Meeting the Authority (decrepit angel revealed as false god)
- Subtle knife cutting reality
- Spectres consuming daemons (horror imagery)

## Player Experience
External soul companion creates unique roleplay. Horror of Intercision makes stakes visceral. Philosophical questions about consciousness, authority, and truth embedded in mechanics.
