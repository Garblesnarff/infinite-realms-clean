# World-Building Specification: The Celestial Circuit

## Cosmology and World Structure

### The World of Astralis

Astralis is not a traditional planet but rather a cosmic structure shaped like a massive wheel or circuit. The twelve zodiac kingdoms are arranged in a perfect circle around a central hub called the Cosmic Core. The world exists simultaneously in the material plane and the astral plane, with the zodiac kingdoms serving as anchoring points between the two realities.

**Physical Layout:**
- Total diameter: Approximately 10,000 miles
- Each kingdom occupies roughly 830 square miles of territory
- Borders between kingdoms are marked by liminal zones called Transition Grounds
- The Cosmic Core sits at the center, normally inaccessible
- Above the world: The Star Dome, showing all constellations
- Below the world: The Void of Forgotten Signs

### The Grand Orrery

At the Celestial Observatory sits the Grand Orrery - a massive mechanical/magical device that tracks the position of every celestial body. It serves as both a navigation tool and a power source for the zodiac magic that maintains reality.

**Function:**
- Predicts the Grand Alignment with perfect accuracy
- Shows real-time positions of all zodiac forces
- When all twelve blessings are collected, it reveals the path to the Cosmic Core
- Can be damaged or manipulated, affecting the cosmic order

### The Grand Alignment

Every 1,000 years, all twelve zodiac constellations align perfectly in the night sky. During this 24-hour window:
- The barriers between kingdoms become thin
- The Cosmic Core becomes accessible
- Zodiac magic reaches maximum potency
- The cosmic order can be restructured or reaffirmed
- Without completion of the Pilgrimage of Twelve, catastrophe occurs

## The Cosmic Core

The center of the Celestial Circuit, normally sealed off from access. It appears as a vast spherical space where all twelve zodiac constellations are visible simultaneously, even during the day. At the core's center floats the Throne of Discord - the erased 13th seat.

**Properties:**
- Only accessible during Grand Alignment
- Requires all twelve blessings to enter
- Time moves strangely; one hour outside equals one day inside
- Reality is malleable; belief shapes existence
- The final confrontation occurs here

## Magic System: Zodiac Sorcery

### Elemental Foundation

All zodiac magic stems from four elements:
- **Fire** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Passion, action, transformation
- **Earth** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Stability, material, endurance
- **Air** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Thought, communication, change
- **Water** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Emotion, intuition, flow

### Astrological Casting

Magic users must be attuned to one or more zodiac signs. The casting system involves:
1. **Sign Invocation:** Calling upon a zodiac's power
2. **Elemental Channeling:** Drawing on Fire/Earth/Air/Water
3. **Personality Resonance:** Embodying the sign's traits amplifies power
4. **Cosmic Timing:** Magic is stronger during that sign's season

### The Blessing System

Each completed trial grants a permanent blessing (detailed in main campaign document). Blessings can:
- Stack and combine for unique effects
- Be shared among party members temporarily
- Evolve as the campaign progresses
- Become corrupted if misused

### Retrograde Magic

When signs go retrograde (reversal periods), magic from that sign:
- Produces opposite effects
- Becomes unpredictable
- Can access normally forbidden powers
- Causes personality inversions in those attuned

## Key NPCs - Extended Profiles

### Discord the Serpent Bearer

**Full Background:**
Once called Asclepius, Discord was the 13th Zodiac Lord representing healing, medicine, and necessary change. Their constellation depicted a figure holding a serpent-wrapped staff - the symbol of healing. However, 5,000 years ago, the other Zodiac Lords feared Discord's power to transform and change the cosmic order. In a unanimous decision, they erased Discord from reality, redistributing their power among the remaining twelve.

**Current State:**
- Exists partially out of phase with reality
- Can manipulate events but not directly intervene
- Has been driving each Zodiac Lord toward their worst traits
- Genuinely believes the system needs to be destroyed
- Still retains some healing powers, creating moral complexity

**Motivations:**
- Primary: Revenge for erasure and centuries of non-existence
- Secondary: Prove that the 12-sign system is inherently flawed
- Hidden: Actually wants to be invited back, not destroy everything
- Deepest: Hurt and lonely, wants acknowledgment of injustice

**Combat Abilities:**
- Phase shifting (hard to target)
- Reality manipulation (changes battlefield)
- Serpent summoning (healing and poison)
- Truth-seeing (knows all secrets)
- Transformation magic (the strongest)

### The Constellation Children

Twelve orphans born during the last Grand Alignment, each embodying a zodiac sign's positive traits:

1. **Aria** (Aries): Brave, protective of younger children
2. **Terra** (Taurus): Stable, provides comfort to others
3. **Gemina** (Gemini): Clever, solves problems through communication
4. **Marea** (Cancer): Nurturing, creates family among orphans
5. **Leonas** (Leo): Inspiring, natural leader without ego
6. **Virga** (Virgo): Helpful, serves others without perfectionism
7. **Libran** (Libra): Fair, mediates disputes wisely
8. **Scorpius** (Scorpio): Intense but loyal, protects secrets
9. **Sagira** (Sagittarius): Curious, teaches others
10. **Caprian** (Capricorn): Ambitious for group, not self
11. **Aquila** (Aquarius): Innovative, brings community together
12. **Pisca** (Pisces): Compassionate, dreams for better world

These children serve as reminders of what each sign could be at its best. They can potentially become the next Zodiac Lords if the current ones fail.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Travel Between Kingdoms
- Transition Grounds between kingdoms take 2-3 days to cross
- The Celestial Compass guides the correct path
- Attempting to skip kingdoms causes reality distortions
- Each transition causes elemental shift (party must adapt)

### Seasonal Effects
As the year progresses, different signs are "in season":
- Characters born under the current sign gain advantage on checks
- Magic from that element is enhanced
- The currently-active kingdom experiences power surge

### Birth Chart Mechanics
Each PC has:
- **Sun Sign:** Core personality and main power source
- **Moon Sign:** Emotional responses and subconscious
- **Rising Sign:** How others perceive them, affects NPC reactions
- **Planetary Placements:** Add minor bonuses/complications

### Corruption Tracking
As party uses zodiac powers, track corruption:
- Overusing one sign's blessing leads to personality imbalance
- Party must use all blessings equally
- Corruption manifests as becoming like the corrupted lords
- Can be cleansed through roleplay and balanced choices

### The Fate Die
Special d12 mechanic:
- Roll when facing major choices
- Each number represents a zodiac sign's advice
- Following the die's wisdom grants bonuses
- Ignoring it has consequences
- Creates tension between fate and free will

## Secrets and Hidden Lore

1. **The Zodiac Lords are dying:** They can no longer transfer power to successors without the pilgrimage.

2. **Discord was justified:** Historical records hidden in each kingdom prove Discord's erasure was unjust.

3. **The party are reincarnated:** Each PC has a past life connection to one of the signs.

4. **There were originally 13 thrones:** Evidence exists in ancient architecture.

5. **The Grand Alignment can be manipulated:** A hidden mechanism in the Cosmic Core allows reality restructuring.

6. **Celestia knows more than she admits:** She was alive during Discord's erasure and feels guilty.

7. **One Zodiac Lord sided with Discord:** That lord's corruption is actually their punishment.

8. **The Constellation Children are test subjects:** Discord created them to prove a balanced zodiac is possible.

9. **The circuit can be broken:** Destroying it would free mortals from zodiac influence but end all zodiac magic.

10. **The party must become the new Zodiac Lords:** This is the only way to truly fix the system.
