## Visual Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Volcanic red (#C41E3A), magma orange (#FF6600), steam white (#F0F0F0), ice blue (#87CEEB), obsidian black (#0C0C0C)
- **Visual Style**: Iceland geothermal features, Dante's Inferno descent, impossible heat meeting impossible cold
- **Key Imagery**: Geysers erupting in patterns, rivers of lava spelling words, frozen core in heart of fire

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Deep earth rumbling, rhythmic like breathing, building intensity with depth
- **Earthheart Voice**: Eruption sounds forming syllables, bass so deep it's felt not heard
- **Frost-That-Hungers**: Ice cracking in reverse, cold that sounds like screaming
- **Soundscape**: Steam hissing, magma bubbling, stone groaning, geyser eruptions as punctuation

## Voice Acting
- **Grandmother Hekla**: Ancient, raspy from steam inhalation, speaks slow like stone
- **Earthheart**: Multiple voices of erupting earth, impossible to understand at first, gradually clarifying
- **Frost-That-Hungers**: Whisper of absolute cold, desperate and lonely, alien
- **Magma Shepherd**: Crackling fire voice, protective parent
