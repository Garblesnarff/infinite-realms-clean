# World-Building Specification: Earth's Breath

## The Earthheart - Complete Nature

### Physical Form
- Not localized—distributed across all volcanic/geothermal activity
- Consciousness emerges from convection currents in mantle
- Uses geysers/vents as sensory organs and voice
- "Brain" is the entire molten core

### The Breath Cycle
- **Normal Pattern**: 300 geysers erupt in sequence over 12-hour cycle
- **Inhale Phase**: Magma descends, pressure builds, geysers dormant
- **Exhale Phase**: Magma rises, pressure releases, geysers erupt
- **Message Encoding**: Timing, duration, and temperature of each eruption = language
- **Current Disruption**: Pattern broken by parasite draining heat

### Communication History
- Never actively communicated before (didn't need to)
- Operated on instinct/automatic processes
- Crisis forced consciousness to focus, attempt speech
- Learning to communicate in real-time during campaign

## Frost-That-Hungers - Origin and Nature

**What It Is**: Crystallized absence of heat, sentient cold
**Origin**: Fragment from space between planes, drifted through void for eons
**Arrival**: 1,000 years ago, fell through planar rift into Earthheart
**Growth**: Fed slowly on geothermal energy, finally large enough to impact system
**Motivation**: Pure survival—it's dying of cold even while stealing heat
**Communication**: Forms ice in impossible places (hot springs, lava), patterns in frost

## The Steamcaller Order

**Founded**: 3,000 years ago when first shaman interpreted geyser patterns
**Practice**: Meditative observation, pattern recognition, prophecy interpretation
**Population**: Was 200, now 150 (50 died in temple eruption)
**Sacred Sites**: Built temples over major geysers for optimal reading
**Controversy**: Newer generation questions if patterns are truly meaningful or just confirmation bias

## Descent Zones - Heat Levels

**Steam Caves** (1,000-5,000 feet deep)
- Temperature: 150-200°F
- Protection: *Endure elements* sufficient
- Duration: Days of travel
- Challenges: Navigation, steam burns, getting lost

**Hot Stone** (5,000-15,000 feet deep)
- Temperature: 1500-2000°F
- Protection: *Protection from energy (fire)* required
- Duration: Hours (too hostile for camping)
- Challenges: Lava flows, fire elementals, toxic gases

**Breath Chamber** (15,000-20,000 feet deep)
- Temperature: 2500°F
- Protection: Artifact or 9th-level magic required
- Duration: Minutes (unsustainable even with magic)
- Challenges: Everything is hostile, survival itself is challenge

**Frozen Core** (20,000+ feet symbolic)
- Temperature: Paradox—absolute zero in molten core
- Protection: Both heat AND cold protection needed
- Physics: Shouldn't exist, sustained only by parasite's power
- Final confrontation location

## Three Solutions - Complete Details

### Solution 1: Kill the Parasite
- **Method**: Combat in Frozen Core
- **Difficulty**: High—Frost-That-Hungers is CR 20+
- **Cost**: Genocide of unique entity, moral weight
- **Outcome**: Earthheart recovers fully, Breath Cycle returns to normal
- **Consequences**: Party haunted by killing desperate refugee

### Solution 2: Feed from Elsewhere
- **Method**: Open portal to Plane of Fire, redirect heat flow
- **Difficulty**: Extreme—requires planar magic and negotiations with fire elementals
- **Cost**: Resources, time, potential planar politics
- **Outcome**: Both entities sustained, but maintenance required forever
- **Consequences**: Created dependency on planar connection

### Solution 3: Transform the System
- **Method**: Help Earthheart evolve to fire-ice duality
- **Difficulty**: Moderate but risky—transformation could fail
- **Cost**: Permanent change to world's geothermal patterns
- **Outcome**: New type of planetary consciousness emerges
- **Consequences**: Unpredictable—might be better, might be worse

## Magic System - Geothermal Magic

**Geyser Reading** (Ritual): Interpret eruption patterns, gain prophetic insight
**Steam Step** (3rd level): Teleport through steam vents
**Lava Shaping** (5th level): Control and redirect molten stone
**Core Communion** (7th level): Directly contact Earthheart, ask questions
**Transform Earthheart** (9th level): Permanently alter planetary core (extremely dangerous)

## Campaign Outcomes

**Balanced Core**: External heat source found, both entities survive independently, ongoing maintenance required.

**Transformed Earthheart**: Integration successful, new dual-nature planetary consciousness, unpredictable but stable geothermal activity.

**Guardian's Sacrifice**: Hekla becomes eternal bridge, human-Earthheart communication established, grandmother's consciousness preserved in core forever.
