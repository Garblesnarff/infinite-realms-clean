### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Bathhouse Beyond**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party crosses into the Spirit Realm and must work at Yubaba's bathhouse to survive, navigating stolen names, transformation curses, and spirit politics while discovering that honest work, true identity, and kindness matter more than gold or power.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail how the Spirit Realm overlaps with the mortal world and where the thresholds exist
    *   Explain the bathhouse's original purpose versus what Yubaba has made it
    *   Describe the nature of spirits—how they're born from rivers, places, emotions, and concepts
    *   Write about the magic of true names and why forgetting them traps souls
    *   Detail the relationship between Yubaba and Zeniba and what they represent
    *   Explain how mortal pollution affects spirits and why river gods suffer

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **Yubaba's Empire** (Major) - Bathhouse workers and controlled spirits, goal: profit and power through greed
    *   **The Free Spirits** (Major) - Independent spirits and gods, goal: maintain balance between realms
    *   **Zeniba's Circle** (Minor) - Simple spirits choosing wisdom over wealth, goal: teach true values
    *   **The Trapped** (Minor) - Humans and spirits who forgot their names, goal: survive or remember

**5. Location Blueprints**

*   **Yubaba's Bathhouse** - Six-story wooden structure with baths, worker dormitories, Yubaba's penthouse
*   **The Boiler Room** - Coal-fired heart of the bathhouse where soot sprites work
*   **The Spirit Train Line** - Railway crossing flooded landscapes, connecting distant spirit locations
*   **Zeniba's Cottage** - Rural home representing simpler values, end of the one-way train
*   Each location has unique spirits, work challenges, and opportunities for character growth

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF a character forgets their true name THEN they become permanently trapped in the spirit realm
*   IF the party treats No-Face with greed THEN it becomes a dangerous monster requiring pacification
*   IF they treat No-Face with kindness THEN it becomes a loyal, helpful companion
*   IF they successfully cleanse the River God THEN they earn respect and magical protection
*   IF they discover Haku's true name THEN they can help free him from Yubaba's control
*   IF they journey to Zeniba THEN they learn the deeper truths about names and contracts
*   IF they pass Yubaba's final test THEN they earn freedom but must choose what to take back
*   IF they take greed back to the mortal world THEN it fades to nothing; wisdom and growth remain
