A three-act structure following the party's journey from lost strangers to valued workers to heroes who can leave with what matters most.

*   **Act I — The Threshold (Sessions 1–4):** The party accidentally enters the Spirit Realm, are cursed or transformed, and must secure employment at Yubaba's bathhouse to survive. They learn the rules: work hard, don't anger the witch, and above all—don't forget your true name.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 1 — "The Spirit Town"
*   The party crosses a mysterious threshold (an abandoned theme park, a strange tunnel, a forgotten shrine) and emerges in a spirit town at dusk.
*   As night falls, spirits appear and the party's mortal forms begin to fade.
*   **Escalation:** One party member is transformed into an animal or begins turning transparent. They must find shelter before they disappear completely.

### Session 2 — "The Bathhouse Contract"
*   They seek help at the magnificent bathhouse. Haku, a mysterious spirit boy, tells them the only way to survive is to get a job from Yubaba the witch.
*   Yubaba tests them with impossible tasks and cruel wit, but ultimately gives them contracts—taking their names in exchange.
*   **Escalation:** They're given new names. They must not forget their true names or they'll be trapped forever.

### Session 3 — "First Day of Work"
*   The party works various bathhouse jobs: cleaning floors, hauling coal for the boiler, preparing baths for spirits, serving at reception.
*   They meet fellow workers: spirits, minor gods, and other trapped humans who've forgotten their names.
*   **Escalation:** A powerful and filthy spirit arrives, demanding service. Failure will anger Yubaba.

### Session 4 — "The Stink Spirit"
*   The party must clean the powerful "stink spirit" in the most challenging bath.
*   Through hard work, they discover it's actually a noble river god, polluted and suffering.
*   Removing the pollution earns them respect, rewards, and the river god's blessing.
*   **Escalation:** The witch notices their competence. They're given harder, more dangerous assignments.

### Session 5 — "No-Face"
*   A mysterious masked spirit called No-Face appears, drawn to the party's kindness.
*   When treated with greed, No-Face becomes dangerous, consuming spirits and growing monstrous.
*   **Escalation:** No-Face rampages through the bathhouse. The party must calm it without violence.

### Session 6 — "Haku's Secret"
*   Haku reveals he's also trapped—Yubaba stole his name and he can't remember who he truly is.
*   He transforms into a white dragon, revealing his spirit form.
*   **Escalation:** Haku is injured during a mission for Yubaba, carrying something stolen. The party must help him.

### Session 7 — "The Witch's Twin"
*   They learn of Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister, who Haku stole a powerful seal from.
*   The party must journey across the spirit realm to Zeniba's cottage to return it and beg forgiveness.
*   **Escalation:** The journey requires a magical train that only goes one way—a leap of faith.

### Session 8 — "The One-Way Train"
*   The party rides the spirit train across a flooded world, seeing glimpses of other spirits' lives.
*   They reach Zeniba's cottage and discover she's kind, not cruel—it was all a test.
*   **Escalation:** Zeniba reveals Yubaba is corrupted by greed, and the bathhouse was once a place of genuine healing.

### Session 9 — "Remembering Names"
*   Through reflection and Zeniba's gentle guidance, the party begins remembering their true names.
*   They discover Haku's true identity—a river spirit from the mortal world.
*   **Escalation:** To free Haku and themselves, they must confront Yubaba with their knowledge.

### Session 10 — "The Bargain"
*   They return to the bathhouse. Yubaba won't release them easily—she proposes challenges and riddles.
*   The party must identify cursed loved ones from a group of identical spirits using only their hearts.
*   **Escalation:** Success means freedom; failure means eternal servitude.

### Session 11 — "Breaking the Contract"
*   Through cleverness and the power of true names, the party breaks their contracts.
*   They help other trapped spirits remember who they are.
*   **Escalation:** Yubaba's power comes from stolen names—freeing spirits weakens her empire.

### Session 12 — "The Return"
*   The party must choose what to bring back: gold and magic fade in the mortal world, but wisdom and growth remain.
*   They help Haku break free and remember his river.
*   **Escalation:** Returning to the mortal world means leaving behind the wonder and friendships of the spirit realm.

### Sessions 13-14 (Optional Extended Campaign) — "The Spirit Bridge"

*   They establish proper relationships between spirits and mortals, healing both realms.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Spirit Town:** Vibrant nighttime marketplace where spirits gather, feast, and bathe.
2.  **Yubaba's Bathhouse:** Six-story wooden structure filled with baths, worker quarters, and magical spaces.
3.  **The Boiler Room:** Hot, coal-powered chamber where Kamaji works with soot sprites.

## Central Conflict

Identity versus greed. Yubaba's bathhouse runs on stolen names and forced labor—she grows powerful by making others forget who they are. The party must resist losing themselves to the work, remember their true identities, and help others do the same. The deeper conflict is between greed (Yubaba hoarding gold and names) versus genuine service (Zeniba's humble wisdom and the party's honest work).

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **True Name System**
*   Characters must track their true names separately. If they forget (fail memory checks or go too long without using it), they risk becoming permanently trapped.

### 2. **Transformation Curses**
*   Characters may be cursed into animal forms or altered states. They must discover what breaks each specific curse.

### 3. **Hard Work Rewards**
*   Genuine effort in bathhouse tasks grants tangible benefits—respect, favors from spirits, and magical rewards.

### 4. **Spirit Etiquette**
*   Learning and following spirit world customs provides advantages; ignorance causes problems.

### 5. **No-Face Encounters**
*   No-Face's behavior reflects how the party treats it—kindness creates a helpful ally, greed creates a monster.

### 6. **Memory Challenges**
*   Periodic checks to see if characters remember their pasts, with consequences for failure.

### 7. **The One-Way Journey**
*   Some paths in the spirit realm can't be retraced—choices have permanent consequences.
