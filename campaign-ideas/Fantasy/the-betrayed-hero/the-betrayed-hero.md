- **Player Level Range**: 1-12
- **Tone**: Dark, Bitter, Determined, Eventually Hopeful, Tactical

### Core Premise
The players are summoned to another world as the legendary Shield Heroes, prophesied defenders against the Waves of Catastrophe. But on their first night, they're betrayed and framed for a terrible crime. Stripped of their reputation, resources, and allies, they must survive in a hostile kingdom while still fulfilling their duty to fight the Waves. They'll build power from nothing, find allies among the oppressed, and ultimately prove their worth while deciding whether to save a world that condemned them or let it burn. The campaign explores themes of injustice, resilience, and whether those wronged owe anything to their accusers.

### Difficulty Context: **Hard**
This campaign features challenging combat, resource scarcity, and a hostile social environment. Players must manage reputation, finances, and political maneuvering alongside traditional adventuring. Early sessions are especially difficult as the party has no support.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Fall and Survival (Sessions 1-3)**
- Players are summoned as heroes, gifted with legendary shields, and celebrated. Then comes the betrayal - a false accusation of assault against the princess. Stripped of credibility and resources, they must survive in a kingdom that despises them. They discover they can't level up without killing, can't kill effectively with shields alone, and must find creative solutions. They recruit their first slave companion and begin the bitter work of fighting the Waves while hated.

**Act 2: Building from Ashes (Sessions 4-6)**
- The party begins to build their own power base outside the kingdom's systems. They help oppressed villages, recruit outcast companions, and discover unique shield abilities. Each Wave fought proves their necessity, even if the kingdom won't acknowledge it. They uncover hints that their betrayal was part of a larger conspiracy and begin gathering evidence while preparing for confrontation.

**Act 3: Vindication and Choice (Sessions 7-8)**
- The truth behind the betrayal emerges, tied to the kingdom's corruption and a deeper conspiracy. The players must decide: seek revenge, demand justice, or rise above it all. The final Wave threatens everything, and only the Shield Heroes can stop it. They'll face both monsters and the corrupt system, proving their worth and choosing what kind of heroes they'll be - bitter avengers or true defenders.

### Key Locations

- **The Castle Town of Melromarc**: Where the summoning occurred. Beautiful but hostile to the players. Site of their betrayal and eventual vindication. Has castle, guilds, markets, and slums where demi-humans live.

- **The Slave Trader's Shop**: Dark but honest place where the party gains their first companions. Magical contracts ensure loyalty. Uncomfortable but necessary refuge when no one else will help.

- **The Village of Lute**: Small demi-human village the players save and help rebuild. Becomes their true home base and shows who they really are as people. Center of their growing reputation among the oppressed.

- **The Dragon's Hourglass**: Mystical device that tracks Waves and allows hero power-ups. Located in cathedral. Site of tense encounters with other heroes and officials.

- **The Cal Mira Islands**: Archipelago with level-boosting properties. Site of bonding between heroes and discovery of conspiracy evidence. Beautiful but dangerous.

- **The Throne Room**: Where both betrayal and vindication occur. Represents the kingdom's corruption and eventual need to face truth.

### Central Conflict
The fundamental struggle between what's right and what's acknowledged. The players are heroes doing heroic work while being treated as villains. They must protect people who despise them, work with heroes who betrayed them, and serve a kingdom that framed them. The campaign explores whether heroism requires recognition, whether the wronged owe their oppressors anything, and how to move forward after injustice. Can you be a hero when everyone says you're a villain?

### Unique Mechanics

- **Shield Specialization**: Players cannot use conventional weapons, only shields. However, shields can absorb materials to unlock new forms with unique abilities (poison shield, rope shield, rage shield, etc.). Encourage creative solutions like using shields for deflection, binding, or environmental manipulation. Defensive builds become tactically complex.

- **Reputation System**: Track reputation separately with: The Crown (nobility/officials), The People (commoners), The Demi-Humans (oppressed races), and Other Heroes. Actions shift these ratings. Low Crown reputation means higher prices, hostile guards, and no official support. High Demi-Human reputation grants allies, information, and safe havens. Creates meaningful choices about who to help.

- **Rage Shield Temptation**: When players suffer major injustice or their companions are threatened, they can access the Rage Shield (significant power boost, but character becomes consumed with hatred). Using it too often risks permanent alignment shift toward vengeance. Creates tension between power and principle.

- **Wave Countdown**: Between sessions, the DM tracks days until the next Wave. Players must balance preparing for Waves (leveling, equipment, recruiting) with gathering evidence of their innocence. The countdown creates urgency - they can't just hide and wait for vindication. The world needs defending despite everything.
