### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Betrayed Hero**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are summoned as the legendary Shield Heroes to defend the Kingdom of Melromarc from interdimensional Waves. On their first night, they're betrayed and falsely accused by the princess, becoming outcasts in the kingdom they're meant to protect. With shields that can't directly attack and no allies, they must survive, build power from nothing, and still fight the Waves while hated. They'll recruit companions from the oppressed, uncover the conspiracy behind their betrayal, and ultimately choose whether a world that condemned them deserves saving.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

    *   Write the history of Melromarc and the human supremacist Church of the Three Heroes.
    *   Describe the oppression of demi-humans and why the Shield Hero is specifically hated.
    *   Explain the legendary weapon system and how heroes level up and unlock abilities.
