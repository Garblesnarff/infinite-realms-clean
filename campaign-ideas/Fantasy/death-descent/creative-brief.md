# Death Descent - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

### Art Direction

**Primary Aesthetic**: Red Bull Rampage meets Shadow of the Colossus meets Attack on Titan
- Vast mountain vistas with impossible scale
- Titans' fossilized bones visible in rock formations
- Reality tears showing otherworldly landscapes bleeding through
- POV camera angles emphasizing speed and verticality
- Contrast between pristine nature and corporate scarring

**Color Palette**:
- **Mountain Colors**: Stone gray, snow white, pine green, sky blue
- **Titan Colors**: Bone white, arterial red, bruised purple, ancient gold
- **Corporate Colors**: Sterile silver, warning yellow, industrial orange, toxic green
- **Magic Colors**: Speed trails (electric blue), time dilation (amber), reality tears (prismatic fractals)

**Key Visual Motifs**:
- Tire tracks as sacred markings
- Massive scale—humans tiny against landscape
- Fossilized anatomy integrated into geography
- Speed blur and motion lines
- Dust and debris clouds from descents
- First-person handlebar view for intense moments

### Environmental Design

**Kahale Village**:
- Traditional wooden structures with modern bike repair facilities
- Integration of old and new—ancient carvings next to bike racks
- Warm firelight contrasting cold mountain air
- Community gathering spaces for storytelling
- Sacred hot springs with healing properties

**The Blood Runs**:
Each of the 13 runs has distinct visual identity:
- **Skull Run**: Rocky outcroppings forming skull shape, hollow eye sockets as tunnels
- **Spine**: Vertical drop past massive vertebrae, bone-white stone against dark rock
- **Heart Chamber**: Pulsing red crystal formations, lava flows like blood
- **Rib Cage**: Fossilized bones creating natural half-pipes and gaps

**Summit Resort**:
- Jarring modernity against ancient mountains
- Glass and steel architecture that looks invasive
- Deforestation scars and drilling sites
- Sterile luxury hiding environmental devastation
- Propaganda posters showing "safe, family-friendly" mountain

**Reality Tears**:
- Fractal edges where normal space breaks down
- Glimpses of impossible geometry beyond
- Color distortion and prismatic effects
- Gravity behaving wrong—water flowing up, rocks floating
- Titan's dream-logic made manifest

## Audio Design

### Music Direction

**Soundtrack Vibe**: Extreme sports adrenaline meets epic fantasy orchestral
- **Action Runs**: Electronic rock, heavy drums, driving bass (The Chemical Brothers, Pendulum)
- **Exploration**: Atmospheric ambient with indigenous instrumentation

- **Corporate Scenes**: Discordant, unsettling corporate muzak twisted

**Dynamic Music System**:
- Tempo increases with speed

- Suspension compressing/extending
- Brake squeals on steep descents
- Bike frame creaking under stress
- Crashes (devastating, impactful)

**Environmental Sounds**:
- Wind howling through peaks
- Rockslides and debris falling
- Lava bubbling in Heart Chamber
- Reality tears: Electrical crackling mixed with whispering
- Titan's breathing: Deep, slow, earthquake-like

**Magic Sounds**:
- Speed trails: Doppler effect, sonic booms

## Tone & Atmosphere Summary

**Primary Feeling**: Adrenaline terror mixed with transcendent beauty
**Secondary Feeling**: Environmental reverence versus corporate destruction
**Tertiary Feeling**: International brotherhood through shared danger

The campaign should feel like standing at the top of an impossible drop, knowing you might die but unable to resist the call. Every session balances:
- Raw fear of consequences
- Pure joy of perfect execution
- Respect for nature's power
- Anger at environmental destruction
- Camaraderie forged through survival
- Spiritual connection to landscape

Make players feel their stomach drop during descents. Make them hold their breath during jumps. Make them pump their fists during perfect landings. Make them mourn fallen riders. Make them hate Summit Industries viscerally. Make them love the mountain like a living thing.

This is extreme sports as religious experience, with apocalyptic stakes and earth-shaking consequences.
