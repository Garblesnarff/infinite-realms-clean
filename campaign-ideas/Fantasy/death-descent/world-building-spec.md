# Death Descent - World-Building Specification

## The Shattered Peaks

### Geological History

**The Titan Era (Millions of Years Ago)**
- Earth was home to massive titans—living mountains
- These beings shaped continents through their movements
- The Shattered Peaks titan was among the largest
- Titans eventually entered hibernation as world cooled
- This particular titan was mortally wounded by unknown force

**The Dying (500,000 Years Ago)**
- Titan attempted to sleep despite fatal injury
- Its death throes created the mountain range
- Body fossilized in place, becoming geological formation
- Circulatory system crystallized into magical ley lines
- Consciousness fragmented but didn't fully dissipate

**First People (10,000 Years Ago)**
- Indigenous Mountain Watchers discovered the sleeping titan
- Learned to communicate through dreams and ritual
- Developed the Blood Run concept—following the circulation paths
- Created traditions to keep the titan peacefully sleeping
- Built Kahale Village at mountain base as eternal guardians

**Colonial Era (300 Years Ago)**
- Outsiders arrived seeking mineral wealth
- Initial mining operations triggered tremors
- Mountain Watchers revealed sacred nature of peaks
- Uneasy truce: Limited tourism, no deep excavation
- Some cultural exchange, bikes introduced to Mountain Watchers

**Modern Era (Present)**
- Summit Industries discovers titan remains have commercial/military value
- Increased reality rifts as titan stirs from long sleep
- Blood Runs become urgent necessity, not just tradition
- International extreme sports community drawn to impossible trails
- Campaign begins as rifts reach critical mass

### The Thirteen Blood Runs

Each corresponds to section of titan's fossilized circulatory system:

**1. The Skull Run (Head)**
- Location: Northern peak, through fossilized cranium
- Difficulty: Moderate (introduction run)
- Hazards: Time-slowed zones, echo chambers
- Rift Type: Memory leaks (visions of titan's past)

**2. The Eye Socket (Vision)**
- Location: Massive hollow in mountain face
- Difficulty: Hard (blind sections, must feel the way)
- Hazards: Darkness, false paths, vertigo
- Rift Type: Sensory distortion

**3. The Throat Drop (Voice)**
- Location: Vertical shaft, near-free fall
- Difficulty: Expert (minimal control possible)
- Hazards: Terminal velocity, pinpoint landing required
- Rift Type: Sound-based attacks (titan's scream)

**4-7. The Arm Runs (Four Limbs)**
- Location: Four separate mountain faces
- Difficulty: Varies (each tests different skill)
- Hazards: Unique to each limb's function
- Rift Type: Physical manifestations (phantom limbs attacking)

**8-10. The Torso Runs (Organs)**
- Location: Deep within mountain interior
- Difficulty: Extreme (cave systems, lava flows)
- Hazards: Heat, darkness, reality tears
- Rift Type: Elemental chaos

**11-12. The Spine (Central Nervous System)**
- Location: Main ridge of mountain range
- Difficulty: Legendary (most have died attempting)
- Hazards: Everything at once, constantly shifting
- Rift Type: Complete reality breakdown

**13. The Heart Chamber (Circulatory Core)**
- Location: Mountain's absolute center
- Difficulty: Mythic (all previous challenges combined)
- Hazards: The titan's consciousness fully manifest
- Rift Type: Direct psychic confrontation with the Dreamer

### Summit Industries

**Corporate Structure**:
- Publicly: "Adventure tourism and sustainable development"
- Actually: Titan remains harvesting and weaponization
- Parent company: Classified military-industrial complex

- Side effect: Waking the titan
- Backup plan: Detonate charges if titan wakes (destroy evidence)
- True purpose: Weaponizing titan consciousness as psychic bomb

**Resources**:
- Private security force (ex-military)
- Geological surveyors (unknowing accomplices)
- PR team spinning environmental destruction as progress
- Experimental tech: Anti-gravity platforms, reality stabilizers
- Unlimited funding from shadowy sources

**The Resort**:
- Surface operation providing cover
- Luxury accommodations for wealthy tourists
- "Safe" trails and ski lifts
- Underground: Labs, drilling operations, specimen storage

- Origin: Riders who "died" on mountain but returned changed
- Equipment: Appears normal but behaves impossibly
- Weakness: Unstable, might be hallucinations
- Colors: Gray, translucent
- Base: None—exist partially outside normal space

### Mountain Watcher Culture

**Social Structure**:
- Elder Council (7 members, Kahale is head)
- Rider Caste (those who run the Blood Runs)
- Guardians (protect sacred sites)
- Storytellers (preserve oral history)
- Healers (tend injured riders, hot spring keepers)
- Common folk (farmers, craftspeople, support roles)

**Spiritual Beliefs**:
- Mountain is sleeping giant worthy of respect
- Death while riding honorably = highest honor
- Bikes are sacred tools, treated as part of self
- Speed is meditation, descent is prayer
- The titan dreams and dreams are real
- Balance must be maintained or catastrophe follows

**Rituals**:
- **Bike Blessing**: Before dangerous runs
- **The Graveyard Visit**: Honor fallen riders
- **Dream Interpretation**: Elders guide based on visions
- **Blood Run Ceremony**: Formal preparation, witnesses required
- **Victory Feast**: After successful rift sealing
- **Mourning Ride**: For those killed on mountain

**Sacred Sites**:
- **The First Trail**: Where Mountain Watchers learned to ride
- **The Dream Pool**: Hot spring where titan's thoughts surface
- **The Bone Shrine**: Fossilized finger bone, altar site
- **The Echo Caves**: Where titan's voice still reverberates
- **Kahale Village Center**: Community heart, eternal flame

### The Titan Dreamer

**Nature**:
- Fragmented consciousness of dying titan
- Experiences time non-linearly
- Doesn't understand human scale or lifespan
- Not malevolent but incomprehensibly powerful
- Dreams bleed into reality through rifts

**Abilities**:
- Reshape mountain terrain unconsciously
- Create pocket dimensions from memories
- Possess susceptible individuals (Dr. Summit)
- Manifest physical avatars (bones coming alive)
- Time manipulation within its domain
- Psychic attacks (confusion, fear, madness)

**Motivation**:
- Wants pain to stop (doesn't realize waking = death for millions)
- Curious about small beings (humans) crawling on it
- Confused why its body won't move
- Partially remembers the being that killed it (unknown threat)
- Attracted to movement and speed (why riders can communicate)

**Weaknesses**:
- Unconscious most of the time
- Can be soothed by completing Blood Runs
- Responds to sincere respect and communication
- Fragmented nature makes it inconsistent
- Ancient wounds still vulnerable to specific magics

### Momentum Magic System

**Theory**:
The titan's fossilized circulatory system contains residual life force. Extreme kinetic energy (downhill biking) resonates with this power, allowing riders to channel it.

**Basic Techniques**:
- **Gravity Defiance**: Extend air time, adjust trajectory mid-flight
- **Time Dilation**: Slow personal perception during critical moments
- **Path Vision**: See safe routes through chaos
- **Bike Fusion**: Temporary psychic bond with bicycle
- **Reality Anchoring**: Stabilize shifting terrain temporarily

**Advanced Techniques** (learned through completing Blood Runs):
- **Bone Riding**: Transform bike into titan bone construct
- **Dream Walking**: Enter titan's memories consciously
- **Rift Navigation**: Travel through tears safely
- **Momentum Transfer**: Share speed with other riders
- **Flow State Apotheosis**: Become temporarily one with mountain

**Limitations**:
- Requires actual speed—can't cast while stationary
- Draining—sustained use causes exhaustion, potential death
- Blocked by Summit's reality stabilizers
- Requires attunement with titan (spiritual component)
- Bikes can shatter under mystical stress

**Corruption Risk**:
Overuse connects rider too deeply to titan's dying consciousness. Symptoms:
- Hearing titan's thoughts
- Seeing through its fossilized eyes
- Losing sense of self/scale
- Potentially becoming titan avatar
- Ultimate fate: Merging completely (becoming Crash-like entity)

### Technology vs Magic

**Summit's Tech**:
- **Reality Stabilizers**: Suppress rift formation, block momentum magic
- **Drilling Rigs**: Extract titan blood crystals
- **Anti-Grav Platforms**: Allow construction in impossible locations
- **Consciousness Dampeners**: Prevent titan from fully waking (temporarily)
- **Weaponized Rift Generator**: Prototype reality weapon

**Rider Gear Integration**:
- Bikes can be blessed by Mountain Watchers (magical)
- Or modded by Summit tech (technological)
- Or hybrid (most effective but ethically complex)
- Titan bone components provide natural magic resistance
- Smart sensors can detect rifts before visual manifestation

### The Graveyard

**Purpose**:
Memorial to all riders who died on the Shattered Peaks, regardless of faction.

**Layout**:
- Bikes planted vertically in ground like headstones
- Arranged chronologically, oldest at center
- Each bike tells story (modifications show rider's style)
- Fresh flowers and offerings constantly replenished
- Overlooks the Heart Chamber entrance

**Spiritual Significance**:
- Riders believe fallen comrades watch over from here
- Many visit before dangerous runs for courage
- Some claim to see ghosts of dead riders
- Crash allegedly appears here most frequently
- The titan's dreams are clearest here (thin barrier between life/death)

**Notable Graves**:
- The First Rider (Mountain Watcher legendary founder)
- Axel's twin sister (recent, fresh trauma)
- Various international champions
- Mysteriously empty spots (for future deaths, including potentially PCs)

### Economy & Resources

**Currency**:
- **Official**: Standard international money
- **Underground**: Respect/reputation, barter
- **Sacred**: Titan bone fragments (incredibly valuable)

**Trade Goods**:
