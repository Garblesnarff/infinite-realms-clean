Set, god of chaos and the desert, has murdered his brother Osiris again and scattered the pieces of his soul across the Duat—the Egyptian underworld—threatening to throw the cosmic order of Ma'at into permanent imbalance. The party, chosen by Anubis as agents of divine justice, must journey through the perilous halls of the Duat, face the trials of the Book of the Dead, and recover Osiris's fragmented ba while navigating the politics of gods who embody both creation and destruction. Their hearts will be weighed on the Scales of Ma'at, and they must decide whether cosmic balance matters more than mortal freedom.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Underworld Navigation:** The Duat is a vast, multi-layered realm of tests, judgment, and monsters.
*   **Divine Paradox:** Egyptian gods are not simply good or evil—Set maintains necessary chaos alongside Osiris's order.
*   **Death Mechanics:** The campaign involves multiple deaths, resurrections, and spirit journeys.
*   **Cosmic Balance:** Actions affect Ma'at—the universal balance that maintains reality itself.
*   **Complex Mythology:** Multiple aspects of the soul, divine forms, and cyclical time create layered challenges.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

A five-act journey through death, judgment, and cosmic balance.

*   **Act I — The Murder of Osiris (Sessions 1–4):** Set murders Osiris and scatters his soul-fragments. The party witnesses the crime and is recruited by Anubis to recover the pieces before Set can permanently destroy the god of life and death, which would end the cycle of resurrection for all beings.
*   **Act II — Journey Through the Duat (Sessions 5–8):** They descend into the Egyptian underworld, facing the Twelve Gates, monstrous guardians, and trials from the Book of the Dead. Each gate reveals more about Set's plan and the nature of Ma'at.
*   **Act III — The Weighing of Hearts (Sessions 9–12):** They discover the Scales of Ma'at are corrupted—hearts are being judged unfairly, souls devoured by Ammit who shouldn't be. They must restore proper judgment while facing their own hearts' weighing.
*   **Act IV — Set's Throne (Sessions 13–16):** Set has claimed Osiris's throne and begun unmaking the cosmic order. The party allies with gods like Horus, Isis, and Thoth while navigating divine politics. They learn Set's chaos is necessary for balance, but his current actions go too far.
*   **Act V — The Cosmic Balance (Sessions 17–20):** They resurrect Osiris, face Set in battle on the borders of chaos and order, and determine the new balance. The campaign concludes with the party's own judgment—will they achieve eternal life in the Field of Reeds, or continue the cycle of rebirth?

## Central Conflict

Order versus chaos as eternal, necessary balance. Set's murder of Osiris represents chaos overwhelming order, threatening to prevent all resurrection and rebirth. But Set isn't purely evil—his chaos prevents stagnation and enables growth. Osiris's pure order could freeze existence in eternal unchanging peace. The party must restore balance rather than choosing one extreme, understanding that both order and chaos are needed for life. Their judgment determines whether they understand true Ma'at—balance, not dominance.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Ka, Ba, and Akh**
*   Egyptian souls have multiple parts. Tracking them creates unique death and resurrection mechanics.

### 2. **Heart-Weighing Trials**
*   Characters' actions affect their heart's weight. Regular judgment tests determine divine favor.

### 3. **Book of the Dead**
*   Learn spells and passwords from the Book to navigate the Duat safely.

### 4. **Ma'at Balance**
*   A meta-tracker for cosmic order. Too much order or chaos has consequences for reality itself.

### 5. **Divine Forms**

### 6. **The Twelve Gates**
*   Navigate the structured challenges of the underworld, each requiring specific knowledge or power.

### 7. **Solar Cycle**
*   Time in the Duat follows Ra's journey—different challenges by "time of night."

### 8. **Mummification and Preservation**
*   Proper burial rites and preserved bodies affect resurrection and spirit journey capabilities.

### 9. **Divine Intervention**
*   Gods can directly intervene, but doing so affects Ma'at's balance—help has cosmic costs.

### 10. **Eternal Life or Rebirth**
*   Campaign ending offers actual choices: eternal paradise, divine service, or return to the mortal cycle.
