# Flavor Hunters Guild
## "Track It, Capture It, Cook It, Devour It"

### Campaign Overview

The Flavor Hunters Guild is an elite organization of adventurers who specialize in tracking down the world's most dangerous, rare, and delicious creatures. Part monster hunters, part chefs, these gourmet warriors risk their lives in the most hostile environments imaginable to capture legendary ingredients that can fetch fortunes and create dishes capable of miraculous effects. The party begins as rookie hunters taking on simple gathering contracts, but they quickly discover that the food chain is far more complex—and dangerous—than they imagined.

When the Guild Master announces the "Century Hunt"—a once-in-a-lifetime quest to capture ingredients from the Eight Apex Beasts whose meat grants godlike powers—the party finds themselves competing against veteran hunters, criminal poaching organizations, and ancient creatures that haven't been hunted in generations. Each Apex Beast exists as both an ecological keystone and a culinary legend, and harvesting them will require not just combat prowess but understanding of their habitats, behaviors, and the ethics of taking their lives. The party must decide: Is any ingredient worth the cost? Where is the line between hunting and murder? And what happens when you eat something so powerful it begins to change you?

As they journey through impossible landscapes—forests where every plant wants to eat you, oceans with creatures that predate language, mountains that scrape the stars—the party will grow from simple hunters into legends themselves. But the greatest danger may not be the monsters they hunt, but the hunger within themselves that grows with each magnificent feast.

### Core Themes

### Unique Mechanics

**Monster Ecology System**
- Every creature has a detailed ecology: habitat, diet, behavior, predator/prey relationships
- Knowledge checks reveal information that makes hunting easier and more ethical
- Understanding creature = better ingredients and less waste
- Over-hunting species causes ecosystem collapse and random encounters

**Field Dressing and Harvesting**
- After defeating creature, must properly harvest ingredients before they spoil
- Time-sensitive skill challenges
- Different tools for different creatures (butchering knives, surgical saws, collection vials)
- Quality of harvest affects final dish potency
- Wasting ingredients affects reputation

**Preparation and Cooking**
- Monster ingredients require special preparation techniques
- Improper cooking can waste ingredients or even be poisonous
- Chef Umami teaches techniques throughout campaign
- Party can experiment with new recipes
- Critical success creates legendary dishes

**Consumption and Transformation**
- Eating monster meat grants temporary abilities based on the creature
- Multiple servings or especially powerful ingredients cause permanent changes
- Apex Beast consumption causes dramatic transformations
- Must manage transformation - too much and you become monstrous
- Benefits vs. corruption balance

**Hunt Planning**
- Before each major hunt, planning phase allows preparation
- Research monster ecology (knowledge checks)
- Gather appropriate equipment (shopping)
- Scout location (exploration)
- Choose approach (combat, trapping, stealth, negotiation)
- Better planning = higher success chance

**Ethical Hunting System**
- Choices about when to kill, spare, or capture affect reputation
- Three factions track party's hunting philosophy: Guild (balance), Cartel (power), Wildkin (preservation)
- Sustainable practices yield long-term benefits
- Wasteful hunting creates enemies and ecological disasters
- Final outcomes determined by cumulative choices

**Ingredient Trading**
- Rare ingredients can be sold for gold or traded for equipment
- Black market offers more but attracts criminal attention
- Guild prices fair but requires good standing
- Some ingredients too valuable or dangerous to sell
