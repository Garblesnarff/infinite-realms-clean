**Title:** The Alchemist's Burden
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Steampunk Fantasy / Alchemy / Military / Conspiracy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 18-22 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14-17**
**Tone (keywords):** equivalent exchange, homunculi, military conspiracy, restoration, sacrifice
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In the militaristic nation of Amestris where alchemy is science, the party sought forbidden power through human transmutation—alchemy's greatest taboo—and paid terrible prices (lost limbs, lost bodies, lost souls). Now seeking to restore what was lost, they become State Alchemists serving the military while uncovering a massive conspiracy: the nation itself is a transmutation circle, and the shadowy homunculi serving Father plan to sacrifice millions to create a Philosopher's Stone of unimaginable power. The party must master alchemy, expose the conspiracy, and choose what they're willing to sacrifice to achieve their goals.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 18-22 sessions)

*   **Act I — Equivalent Exchange (Sessions 1-6):** The party, having committed human transmutation and suffered consequences, becomes State Alchemists. They investigate rumors of Philosopher's Stones—legendary items that break alchemy's rules. They encounter homunculi and learn of Father's existence.
*   **Act II — Truth and Conspiracy (Sessions 7-14):** The party travels the nation investigating, facing military corruption, civil war, and the homunculi. They learn the horrifying truth: Amestris' borders form a transmutation circle, and a coming eclipse will trigger a nationwide sacrifice.
*   **Act III — The Promised Day (Sessions 15-22):** The party must stop Father from becoming a god while facing homunculi, the military, and Father's overwhelming power. They must choose: use a Philosopher's Stone (made from human souls) to restore what they lost, or destroy it and find another way. The final battle determines whether millions die or equivalent exchange holds true.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of equivalent exchange, the cost of power, whether ends justify means, and what defines humanity. It asks: What are you willing to sacrifice for your goals? Can you accept loss or must you fight fate? Is using evil (Philosopher's Stones made from human souls) to achieve good ever justified? The central conflict pits human determination against godlike power and forces impossible moral choices.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Alchemy System**
*   Transmutation requires: understanding composition, deconstruction, and reconstruction
*   Alchemists specialize: combat alchemy, medical, equipment crafting, research
*   Transmutation circles drawn or inscribed on gloves/weapons
*   Equivalent Exchange: can't create something from nothing, must have materials
*   Each alchemist has signature style (flame, metal, earth, water, etc.)

### 2. **Philosopher's Stones**
*   Legendary items made from human souls that break equivalent exchange rules
*   Allow impossible transmutations and near-unlimited power
*   Each use consumes souls trapped within
*   Party must decide: use this evil power for good ends, or reject it completely

### 3. **Lost Body Parts**
*   Party members who performed human transmutation lost something (arm, leg, entire body, ability to have children)
*   Lost parts affect abilities but also grant unique perspectives
*   Automail (mechanical prosthetics) can replace limbs but require maintenance and hurt
*   Restoration is possible but at a cost

### 4. **State Alchemist Missions**
*   Party holds military rank, must complete assigned missions
*   Missions reveal conspiracy pieces while forcing moral compromises
*   Disobeying orders risks court-martial but following them aids the conspiracy

### 5. **Homunculi Regeneration**
*   Homunculi regenerate from nearly any damage by consuming Philosopher's Stone charges
*   Must destroy their core or deplete their stone to permanently kill
*   Each homunculus has unique abilities matching their sin

### 6. **The Gate of Truth**
*   Performing human transmutation forces you before Truth
*   Truth takes "the toll"—whatever you value most (sight, limbs, alchemy itself)
*   Grants understanding of alchemy's true nature
*   Can be voluntarily opened to trade gate knowledge for restoration
