# Creative Brief: The Alchemist's Burden

## Art Style: Steampunk Military with Alchemical Effects (Fullmetal Alchemist-inspired)

Inspired by the detailed mechanical designs and alchemical transmutation circles of *Fullmetal Alchemist*, blending early 20th-century military aesthetics with fantastic alchemy and body horror elements.

### Core Principles:

*   **Mechanical Detail:** Automail limbs with visible gears and hydraulics, steampunk technology
*   **Transmutation Visualization:** Glowing circles, matter deconstructing/reconstructing, energy arcs
*   **Military Aesthetic:** WW1-era uniforms, rank insignia, fortified cities
*   **Body Horror:** Lost limbs, homunculi regeneration, the Gate's grotesque imagery

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Military:** Navy blue uniforms with gold trim, gray buildings, steel machinery
*   **Alchemy:** Golden-yellow energy for transmutation circles, red for blood alchemy
*   **Homunculi:** Each has themed colors matching their sin

**Character Design:**
*   **Alchemists:** Military uniforms with personal modifications, transmutation circles on gloves or tattooed
*   **Automail:** Detailed mechanical limbs with visible joints and maintenance ports
*   **Homunculi:** Ouroboros tattoo mark, beautiful but inhuman, regenerating grotesquely

**Alchemy Effects:**
*   **Transmutation:** Matter glowing and reconfiguring with particle effects
*   **Circles:** Complex geometric patterns appearing on ground or objects
*   **Elements:** Fire appears as controlled streams, earth as spikes or walls
*   **Prompt Example:** "An alchemist claps their hands together creating a transmutation circle between their palms. Golden lightning arcs as they press their hands to the ground. The earth erupts upward forming a stone wall with glowing circuitry patterns visible as it forms."

## Voice

A determined voice weighted with guilt and resolve, showing the burden of past mistakes. Technical when discussing alchemy, emotional when discussing the lost. Theme of "what we're willing to sacrifice" and "the truth we must face." Role: The voice of equivalent exchange made manifest.
