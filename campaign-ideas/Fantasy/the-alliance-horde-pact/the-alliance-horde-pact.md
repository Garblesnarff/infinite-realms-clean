## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of unity, forgiveness, and the cost of hatred. The central conflict is not just the demon invasion, but the internal battle within each faction to overcome generations of bloodshed. The players must prove that former enemies can become allies, and that sometimes the greatest courage is choosing peace over vengeance.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Faction Reputation System**
*   The party tracks separate reputation scores with Alliance, Horde, and Neutral factions (scale: -10 to +10).
*   Actions, quest choices, and dialogue options affect these scores.
*   High reputation grants access to faction-specific rewards, allies, and information. Low reputation causes hostility.
*   The challenge is balancing reputation—favoring one side too heavily can break the Pact.

### 2. **The Pact Stability Meter**
*   A campaign-long tracker (0-100) representing how stable the Alliance-Horde truce is.
*   Successful joint missions, diplomatic victories, and unity moments raise it.
*   Friendly fire incidents, failed negotiations, and extremist attacks lower it.
*   If it drops below 25, the Pact shatters and the factions return to war, leading to a darker ending.
*   At 75+, the Pact holds strong enough for a permanent peace treaty in the epilogue.

### 3. **Legion Corruption Mechanics**
*   Certain powerful demon artifacts offer incredible power but risk corrupting the wielder.
*   Players who use corruption gain temporary bonuses but accumulate Corruption Points.
*   At certain thresholds, they must make Wisdom saves or suffer effects: paranoia, nightmares, physical mutations.
*   High corruption may attract demon attention or even turn the character into an antagonist.

### 4. **Combined Arms Tactics**
*   In major battles, the party can call on specific Alliance or Horde unit types for support.
*   Alliance units: Knight cavalry, mage artillery, gryphon riders, priests.
*   Horde units: Wolf raiders, shaman elementals, wyvern bombers, berserkers.
*   Before battle, players strategically deploy units on a simple battle map, creating synergies and countering enemy forces.
