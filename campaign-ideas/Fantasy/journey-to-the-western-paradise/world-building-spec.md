## The Philosophical Core

**Question:** What is enlightenment?
**Answer:** Not destination but journey. Not perfection but growth. Not isolation but compassion.

**Sun Wukong's Arc:**
- Rebellion against heaven = ego
- Imprisonment = consequence
- Service = humility
- Buddhahood = integration of wild nature with wisdom

**The Paradox:** Journey to get scriptures already in China (brought by earlier pilgrims). Point isn't destination—it's transformation along the way.

The campaign asks: **Can troublemakers become enlightened? Can violence serve compassion? Can chaos achieve order?**

Answer: Through friendship, service, and 81 trials—yes.
