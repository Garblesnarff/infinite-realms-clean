# Powder Revolution
## *When avalanches bow to your will and mountains choose their champions.*

### Campaign Overview

The Frostpeak Mountains aren't just covered in snow—they're alive with it. An ancient spirit called the Yuki-Onna has domain over all snow and ice in the range, and for centuries she's selected riders—snowboarders and skiers—as her champions. These riders can manipulate powder, summon avalanches, and carve impossible lines that reshape the mountain itself. But the Glacier Crown Corporation has developed technology to artificially create "perfect" snow, insulting the Yuki-Onna and threatening to replace natural winter with corporate-controlled climate.

Players are recruited into the Powder Collective, underground riders fighting a two-front war: competitive runs against corporate-sponsored teams in the Frostpeak Grand Prix (which has become propaganda for artificial snow), and guerrilla missions destroying weather machines before they permanently alter the mountain ecosystem. Victory requires winning all seven Grand Prix events while secretly completing the Seven Sacred Descents that will restore the Yuki-Onna's full power and banish artificial winter.

This is SSX Tricky meets Princess Mononoke meets snowboarding revolution, where sick tricks are spell components, avalanche surfing is standard, and the fate of winter itself hangs in balance.
