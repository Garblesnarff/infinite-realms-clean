# Powder Revolution - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

**Aesthetic**: SSX Tricky meets Studio Ghibli winter scenes meets extreme sports photography
- Deep powder explosions creating dramatic spray
- Yuki-Onna as ethereal ice maiden (beautiful/terrifying)
- Corporate resorts: Sterile, artificial, wrong
- Backcountry: Pristine, untouched, sacred
- Trick trails leaving magical ice/snow patterns

**Colors**:
- **Natural**: Pure white, powder blue, sunset pink on snow, forest green
- **Magic**: Aurora borealis effects (green/purple shimmer), crystalline blue, silver moonlight
- **Corporate**: Chemical blue (artificial snow), steel gray, warning orange
- **Yuki-Onna**: Pale white-blue, ice crystal effects, storm gray

## Audio Design

**Music**:
- **Action**: Electronic rock meets traditional Japanese instruments (shamisen + synth)
- **Powder Runs**: Orchestral swells, triumphant
- **Sacred Descents**: Ethereal, spiritual, wind-based
- **Corporate**: Industrial, aggressive, synthetic
- **Lodge Scenes**: Warm acoustic, camaraderie

**Sound Effects**:
- Board/ski carving (satisfying scrape)
- Powder spray (whoosh)
- Avalanche rumble (bass-heavy threat)
- Wind howling
- Ice cracking
- Trick landings (impact)
- Yuki-Onna's voice (wind-whisper)

## Voice Acting

**Elder Hana**: Elderly Japanese woman, cryptic wisdom, gentle but firm
**Ryker**: Cocky American jock, competitive energy masking insecurity
**Director Frost**: Cold British corporate, hiding pain beneath efficiency
**Yuki-Onna**: Layered female voices, wind-like, alien and beautiful
**Shred**: Ghostly echo, helpful warnings
**Atlas**: Gruff veteran American, dad energy, protective

## Cinematics

**Opening**: POV descending pristine powder, trick sequence, transition to Yuki-Onna vision, title card in snow spray

**Sacred Descents**: Each features perfect run cinematography + spirit manifestation + magical sealing effect

**Final Run**: All riders descending simultaneously, corporate machines failing, natural winter returning, Yuki-Onna's blessing

## Tone

**Primary**: Joyful rebellion through snow sports
**Secondary**: Environmental protection
**Tertiary**: Earning divine favor through excellence

Make players feel untouched powder under their board, wind in their face, triumph of perfect landings, spiritual connection to winter.
