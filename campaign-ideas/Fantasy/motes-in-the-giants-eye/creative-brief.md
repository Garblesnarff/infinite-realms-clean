# Motes in the Giant's Eye - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Forced perspective photography meets miniature dioramas. Everything familiar made alien through scale. Think Honey I Shrunk the Kids, Borrowers, Land of the Giants.

**Color Palette**: Normal domestic colors (wood browns, paint colors, fabric textures) but emphasize TEXTURE—wood grain like landscape, fabric weave like architecture.

**Scale Indicators**: Always include size comparison—party next to pencil (log-sized), standing on coin (platform), using button as shield.

## Music and Sound Design
**Ambient**: Amplified household sounds—clock ticking like drums, footsteps as earthquakes, voices as rumbling thunder, water running like waterfall roar.

**Stealth**: Quiet tension, heartbeats, careful movement sounds amplified.

**Giant Encounters**: Deep bass for their movements, distorted voices (too loud and low to understand easily), subsonic rumbles.

**Small Community**: Normal music/sounds (relief from constant overwhelming noise).

## Voice Acting
**Giants**: Voices should be distorted/bass-boosted, words stretched, need subtitles/interpretation. Tone more important than content initially.

**Emmie**: Child's voice but LOUD, innocent but thoughtless cruelty, genuine affection mixed with possession ("mine!").

**Small Community**: Normal voices (relief), but varied accents/backgrounds (collected from everywhere).

## Atmosphere
Constant sense of **vulnerability**. Environmental sounds always too loud. Everything is potential threat. But also wonder—child's perspective on adult world, everything new and strange.

This campaign is **survival horror with whimsy**—terrifying but also occasionally charming, deadly but full of creative solutions.
