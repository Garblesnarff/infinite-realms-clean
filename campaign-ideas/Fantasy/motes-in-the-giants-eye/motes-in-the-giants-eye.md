# Motes in the Giant's Eye
## *Stranded in a World Where Everything is 60 Feet Tall*

### Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a flower bed. But the flowers tower like sequoia trees. The grass is a forest of green pillars each 10 feet tall. In the distance, structures loom—impossible buildings that could house mountains. And then the shadow falls: a child's face, 60 feet tall, looking down at them with enormous eyes full of curiosity. They say something—words like thunder—and reach down with a hand that could crush them all...

The party has been transported (magical accident, curse, experiment gone wrong) to a world of giants where normal-sized humans are toy-sized curiosities. Or they're the normal ones and everything here is impossibly large. Either way, survival means navigating a domestic world turned lethal: crossing a table is a day's journey, avoiding being stepped on is constant threat, and communicating with beings 12x your size who may or may not see you as intelligent.

The campaign combines survival horror with creative problem-solving. Every domestic object is a dungeon, every pet is a kaiju, every meal time is a potential death sentence. The party must find others like them (if any exist), discover how they arrived, and find a way home—all while at the mercy of giants who might be friendly, curious, cruel, or simply unaware they're killing the party through casual carelessness.

### Core Themes

**Perspective Reversed**: The party becomes the "small" encountering the "normal." Empathy building for creatures we usually ignore. A beetle's perspective.

**Domestic Horror**: Normal becomes lethal. A cat is an apex predator. A rainstorm is biblical flood. A child playing is natural disaster.

**Communication Barrier**: Giants can't easily hear or see party. Misunderstandings are frequent and dangerous. Building understanding requires creativity.

**Resource Scarcity**: Everything is too big. A breadcrumb is a week's food. A thimble is a bathtub. Must improvise constantly.

**Kindness vs. Curiosity vs. Cruelty**: Giants' intentions matter. A kind giant child might accidentally kill party. A cruel giant might deliberately torment. A curious giant might dissect for science.

**Exile and Longing**: The party is separated from their world. Every moment is alienation. Homesickness and desperation drive action.

### Session Breakdown (20-30 Sessions)

**Act I: Survival Basics (Sessions 1-6)**
- **Session 1-2: Awakening**: Party wakes small (or in giant world). Initial confusion and panic. First encounter with giant—child finds them. Reaction determines tone: captures party in jar, tries to communicate, or accidentally nearly kills them. Establishes core challenges.

- **Session 3-4: The House**: Exploring giant's home. Kitchen is industrial zone, living room is vast plains, basement is dungeon. Avoid house pets (dog = kaiju), navigate furniture-mountains, find food/water. Meet others if any (perhaps other shrunken people or tiny natives).

- **Session 5-6: Communication**: Attempting to make giants understand party is intelligent. Charades, writing giant letters (exhausting), using mirrors to catch attention. Success brings aid; failure brings danger (seen as pests).

**Act II: The Giant's World (Sessions 7-16)**
- **Session 7-8: The Town**: Venture beyond house into giant's town. Streets are canyons, buildings are mesas, vehicles are catastrophes. Meet tiny community (if exists) living in walls, scavenging crumbs. Learn survival strategies.

- **Session 9-10: The Collector**: Giant scholar has collection of "tiny beings." Party might be captured, meet others, learn about world. Maybe this giant knows how to return party home—but wants specimens for study. Ethical dilemma: sacrifice freedom for information?

- **Session 11-12: The Escape**: Break out of collection, navigate laboratory (chemicals are hazards, equipment is environmental challenge). Chase sequence with giant trying to recapture. Either earn respect or make permanent enemy.

- **Session 13-14: The Wild**: Travel through giant's garden (wilderness at party scale). Encounters: insects (now massive threats), birds (kaiju), weather (apocalyptic). Survival adventure mode.

- **Session 15-16: Discovery**: Find evidence of transportation method. Perhaps ancient shrine, wizard's workshop, or scientific facility. Learn how they arrived. Complication: returning requires resources/magic only accessible at giant scale.

**Act III: Politics of Scale (Sessions 17-24)**
- **Session 17-18: The Resistance**: Meet organized community of smalls (other transported humans, or native tiny race). They've built hidden city in walls. Political factions: return home vs. adapt and stay, war on giants vs. coexistence, hope vs. despair.

- **Session 19-20: Giant Politics**: Smalls' actions affect giants. Stealing food causes investigations. Sabotage creates tensions. Party caught between scales—serving small community sometimes means harming giant families. Moral complexity.

- **Session 21-22: The Sympathizer**: One giant (maybe the child from beginning, now older) wants to help. Learns to communicate, provides resources, protects party. But relationship is complicated—power imbalance, misunderstandings, danger of being seen.

- **Session 23-24: The Exterminators**: Giants hire pest control—party and smalls are targets. Military campaign against what giants see as infestation. Escape and survival while watching community destroyed.

**Act IV: The Way Home (Sessions 25-30)**
- **Session 25-26: The Choice**: Method to return requires:
  - Sacrificing other smalls (power source requires lives)
  - Stealing from giant allies (betraying trust)
  - Destroying transportation permanently (trapping anyone else)
  - Working with cruel giant who has technology (moral compromise)
  Party must choose path and live with consequences.

- **Session 27-28: The Heist**: Regardless of path, requires infiltrating giant facility/location. Ocean's Eleven but everything is 60 feet tall. Creative problem-solving, teamwork, using scale to advantage.

- **Session 29-30: Resolution**:
  - **Return Home**: Successfully transport back. Bittersweet—leave friends/allies behind. Changed by experience. Maybe bring tiny allies with them, integrating into normal world.
  - **Stay**: Choose to remain. Build life in giant world. Acceptance of new reality. Found family with smalls community.
  - **Bridge Worlds**: Establish permanent connection. Enable trade/communication between scales. Become ambassadors. Optimistic but challenging future.
  - **Tragedy**: Fail to escape. Accept exile. Campaign could continue indefinitely in giant world, or end on melancholic note.

### Key NPCs

**Emmie the Giant Child** (Initially): 8 years old (from giant perspective), curious and kind but clumsy. Finds party, wants to keep as pets. Doesn't understand fragility. Gradually learns to communicate. Protects party from parents but also dangerous through carelessness.

**Professor Tallmire** (Giant Scholar): Collects "small beings." Not cruel—genuinely scientific curiosity. Treats party well (for specimens). Knows magic/science of transportation. Potential ally or antagonist depending on party's approach.

**Grimble** (Fellow Small): Human who's been here years. Leader of hidden community. Initially helpful but harbors resentment—wants to steal party's method home for self. Complex ally with ulterior motives.

**Whisper** (Native Tiny): Indigenous intelligent species at party scale. Giants never acknowledged them as sentient. Entire civilization exists hidden in walls. Wise, resourceful, but deeply afraid of giants.

**Mrs. Havershim** (Cruel Giant): Views smalls as pests. Hires exterminators. Represents giant who sees party as infestation. Dangerous because methodical and resourceful.

**The Sympathizer** (Young Adult Giant): Possibly grown-up Emmie. Learned to communicate with smalls. Works secretly to help. Risks social ostracism. Represents bridge between scales.

### Major Locations

**The House** (Tutorial Zone): Kitchen, living room, bedrooms. Each room is distinct biome. Familiar objects as impossible structures. Constant traffic (giants' daily life).

**The Walls** (Safe Haven): Hidden passages inside walls. Small community's city. Cozy but claustrophobic. Safe from giants but primitive living.

**The Garden** (Wilderness): Flowers like trees, grass like bamboo, insects as megafauna. Beautiful but deadly. Natural environment at wrong scale.

**The Town** (Urban Environment): Giant streets, shops, homes. Party navigates margins—sewers, alleys, rooftops. Urban adventure at mouse scale.

**The Laboratory** (Dungeon): Giant scientist's workspace. Chemicals, equipment, specimens. Hazardous environment. Contains information/tools for returning home.

**The Underneath** (Sewers/Basement): Where exterminators hunt. Dark, wet, dangerous. Where smalls go when discovered. Survival horror zone.

### Unique Mechanics

**Scale Physics**: Everything is bigger, therefore proportionally different. Falls from height less lethal (terminal velocity at smaller mass), but wind stronger, water surface tension like quicksand.

**Communication Challenges**: Speaking to giants requires shouting (audible but barely). Writing requires enormous effort. Misunderstandings frequent.

**Resource Management**: Food/water abundant but inaccessible. Giant-scale objects must be repurposed. Single crumb = multiple meals. Thimble = water storage.

**Stealth Mandatory**: Giants rarely actively looking for party. Advantage on stealth but catastrophic failure if spotted. Every encounter could be last.

**Environmental Hazards**: Domestic activities are natural disasters. Cleaning = flood, cooking = inferno, walking = earthquakes, pets = predators.

**Tiny Community Resources**: If party earns community's trust, gain access to: maps, guides, equipment sized properly, safe houses, information network.

### Plot Twists

**Twist 1**: Party wasn't shrunk—they were transported to giant dimension where this is normal scale
**Twist 2**: Others have been here before—some for decades—giving up on return
**Twist 3**: The giants are aware of smalls but suppress knowledge (prevents panic/ethical crisis)
**Twist 4**: Transportation was deliberate (conspiracy using party for giant-world infiltration)
**Twist 5**: Native tiny civilization has been here forever—giants literally never noticed intelligent species at their feet
**Twist 6**: Returning home is possible but strands everyone else permanently (selfish choice)
**Twist 7**: A giant is deliberately bringing smalls here (collecting, slavery, study, or benevolent rescue)
**Twist 8**: The worlds are merging—giants appearing in party's home world soon
**Twist 9**: Party member actually IS a giant who was shrunk/transformed (amnesia, curse)
**Twist 10**: There is no home to return to (world destroyed, time-displaced, never existed)

### Victory Conditions

**Escape and Return**: Get home, forever changed by experience
**Integration**: Stay, build life in giant world, find peace in exile
**Bridge**: Create permanent portal, become ambassadors between worlds
**Liberation**: Free all smalls from giant world, mass exodus
**Revolution**: Organize smalls to force giants to acknowledge them (long-term campaign shift)

### Campaign Themes

**Motes in the Giant's Eye** explores **perspective, vulnerability, adaptation, and what constitutes person-hood**. The campaign asks: How do we treat beings we see as lesser? What if WE'RE those beings?

Scale creates constant danger and forces creativity. Every mundane object becomes challenge. Party is vulnerable but not powerless—cleverness trumps strength. Communication is puzzle. Ethics are messy when survival conflicts with morality.

This is **Land of the Giants meets Borrowers meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids**—survival horror with wonder, domestic world made lethal, and profound questions about value and perspective.
