The party lives in a mundane village beside an ancient Wall that separates the mortal world from the magical realm of Faerie. When a falling star crashes beyond the Wall, they cross over to retrieve it—only to discover the "star" is a living celestial being sought by witches who want to devour her heart for immortality, princes fighting for a throne, and sky pirates. To protect the star and return home, they must navigate Faerie's wonders and dangers while discovering that crossing between worlds changes you forever, and true love requires sacrifice.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Dual World Navigation:** Different rules apply in Faerie—mortal logic doesn't always work.
*   **Multiple Threats:** Witches, princes, pirates, and Faerie creatures all pursue the star simultaneously.
*   **Romantic Stakes:** The campaign centers on emotional connections as much as physical danger.
*   **Fairy Tale Logic:** Problems are sometimes solved through cleverness, promises, and heart rather than combat.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Village of Wall:** Mundane town at the barrier between worlds, where the quest begins.

## Central Conflict

Love versus destiny. The star has a purpose in the heavens; falling to Earth was an accident. The party (particularly one member) falls in love with her, but loving her means letting her return to where she belongs. The witches represent selfish desire for immortality through consuming others. The princes represent ambition overriding morality. The party must choose selfless love—protecting the star and letting her fulfill her destiny even if it means separation.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Wall Between Worlds**
*   Crossing between mundane and Faerie has consequences. Magic works differently. Time flows strangely.

### 2. **The Star's Light**
*   Yvaine glows when happy, dims when sad or endangered. Her light level affects encounters—enemies track her by it.

### 3. **Celestial Power**
*   The star can shine with burning celestial fire against evil, but each use makes her more mortal and vulnerable.

### 4. **The Princes' Ghosts**
*   Dead princes remain as ghosts, commenting on events and sometimes aiding or hindering the party.

### 5. **Faerie Bargains**
*   Making deals with Faerie creatures requires precise wording and has binding consequences.

### 6. **Sky Ship Combat**
*   Aerial battles on lightning-harvesting vessels with cannons, boarding actions, and dramatic ship-to-ship combat.

### 7. **Heart's Gem**
*   The star's necklace gem represents her heart/essence. Protecting it is paramount; losing it means death or witch victory.
