# The Coral Kingdom's Fall - World Building Specification

## The Coralborn: Complete Species Profile

### Biology
- Symbiotic organism: Coral polyp colony + humanoid soul/consciousness
- Appearance: Humanoid shape made of living coral, 5-7 feet tall
- Lifespan: Potentially immortal (as long as coral healthy)
- Reproduction: Budding (new polyp colony gains sentience) or spawning (sexual reproduction)
- Requirements: Clean water, sunlight, stable temperature, calcium carbonate
- Vulnerability: Extremely sensitive to environmental changes

### Life Cycle
1. **Polyp Stage** (0-10 years): Mindless coral colony, normal reef species
2. **Awakening** (10-20 years): Consciousness emerges through symbiosis with reef's collective intelligence
3. **Shaping** (20-50 years): Colony shapes itself into humanoid form
4. **Maturity** (50-500+ years): Full sentience, can move (slowly), contribute to society
5. **Elder Stage** (500+ years): Vast wisdom, mostly stationary, become living buildings
6. **Death**: If coral dies, consciousness fades; if consciousness leaves, coral becomes normal polyp

### Society
**Government**: Matriarchal council (oldest females)
**Values**: Preservation, beauty, harmony, patience (think in centuries)
**Culture**: Art through living sculpture, music via water vibrations, philosophy of symbiosis
**Economy**: Trade beauty (art) and knowledge for necessities with other undersea civilizations
**Population**: 50,000 Coralborn across Reefhaven

### Current Crisis
- Bleaching killing coral bodies
- Young Coralborn dying before reaching maturity
- Elders crumbling as ancient coral dies
- Population crash imminent
- Existential threat to entire species

## Reefhaven: The Dying Paradise

### Geography
- Size: 1,000 miles long, 50 miles wide
- Depth: 50-200 feet (shallow tropical reef)
- Structure: Built over volcanic seamounts and ridges
- Zones: Outer Reef (most damaged), Inner Gardens (protected), Capital (political center)

### Current Health Status (40% and Falling)

**Healthy Zones** (25% of reef)
- The Last Garden: Preserved by ancient magic
- Royal Gardens: Protected by Coralborn magic
- Deep Sanctuaries: Too deep for some stressors

**Dying Zones** (50% of reef)
- Bleached but alive
- Can be saved with intervention
- Most of Reefhaven

**Dead Zones** (25% of reef)
- Complete die-off
- White skeletal coral
- Eerie graveyards
- May be unrecoverable

### Environmental Stressors Detailed

**1. Pollution (Baron Goldstein's Factory)**
- **Source**: Industrial waste dumping from surface factory
- **Effects**: Toxic water, smothered coral, diseased fish
- **Rate**: Killing 2% per week
- **Solution**: Shut down factory, install filters, legal action, or economic pressure

**2. Temperature Rise (Climate Change)**
- **Source**: Global warming affecting all oceans
- **Effects**: Coral bleaching, symbiotic algae dying
- **Rate**: Killing 1% per week
- **Solution**: Long-term (treaties, magic), short-term (cooling spells, shade structures)

**3. Invasive Species (Prince Parasitus's Sabotage)**
- **Source**: Crown-of-thorns starfish released deliberately
- **Effects**: Starfish eat coral faster than it regenerates
- **Rate**: Killing 1.5% per week
- **Solution**: Hunt starfish, find natural predator, magical containment

**4. Magical Contamination (Tidecaller's Experiments)**
- **Source**: Experimental spells corrupting water
- **Effects**: Mutations, unnatural growths, toxic magical residue
- **Rate**: Killing 1% per week
- **Solution**: Stop experiments, cleanse contamination, counter-spells

**5. The Demon's Curse (Coralyx's Contract)**
- **Source**: Ancient pact coming due
- **Effects**: Supernatural decay, resistance to healing magic
- **Rate**: Killing 3% per week (worst stressor)
- **Solution**: Resolve contract through legal loophole, equal sacrifice, or destroying demon

## The Demon's Contract: Complete Text

### Original Pact (500 Years Ago)

*"I, Coralyx, Lord of the Thirteenth Abyss, do grant unto the Coralborn people:*
- *Perfect paradise (most vibrant reef in all oceans)*
- *Five centuries of peace and prosperity*
- *Protection from external threats*
- *Abundance beyond measure*

*In exchange for:*
- *When the reef reaches its most beautiful state*
- *All souls of the Coralborn shall be mine*
- *To serve in my domain eternal*
- *Contract binding through blood of signatories*

*Signed: Queen Polypa the First (ancestor)*
*Witnessed: The Ocean Itself*
*Sealed: In coral and flame"*

### Legal Analysis
**Binding Elements**: Blood magic, witnessed by primordial ocean, demon contract law
**Triggering Condition**: "Most beautiful"—occurred 50 years ago (reef's peak)
**Grace Period**: Demon waited 50 years (enjoys anticipation)
**Now**: Payment due immediately

### Loopholes (Possible)
1. **Technicality**: "Most beautiful" subjective—if reef currently dying, not most beautiful anymore, reset timer
2. **Substitute**: Equal value sacrifice (one supremely good soul = thousands of normal souls?)
3. **Signatories**: Only blood descendants of original signer bound (queen's line only?)
4. **Witness Clause**: If Ocean itself revokes witnessing, contract void (requires speaking to ocean's consciousness)
5. **Willing vs Unwilling**: Contract doesn't specify—if Coralborn willingly serve, not "taken," might satisfy letter but not spirit

## The Polluters: Complete Profiles

### Baron Crassus Goldstein (Primary Industrial Polluter)
**Background**: Inherited factory from father, expanded without regard for environment
**Motivation**: Profit—ocean is free dumping ground, regulations would cost millions
**Method**: Dumps chemical waste, heavy metals, plastics directly into water
**Psychology**: Not malicious, just doesn't see ocean life as valuable as human prosperity
**Redemption Arc**: Can be convinced if shown economic benefit of healthy reef (tourism, fisheries)
**Alternative**: If unredeemable, factory must be shut down by force (legal, magical, or sabotage)

### Archmage Tidecaller (Magical Polluter)
**Background**: Brilliant researcher seeking to purify all ocean water magically
**Motivation**: Noble intentions—wants to help, experiments going wrong
**Method**: Testing powerful transmutation spells on reef water, creating toxic magical residue
**Psychology**: Obsessive scientist, doesn't realize damage until confronted
**Redemption Arc**: Easily convinced once shown harm, volunteers to fix it
**Counter-Effort**: Can develop purification ritual to cleanse own contamination

### Captain Refuse (Illegal Dumping)
**Background**: Smuggler paid by surface cities to dispose of waste
**Motivation**: Pure profit, no ideology
**Method**: Dumps garbage, toxic waste, sewage in remote reef areas
**Psychology**: Amoral opportunist, will work with whoever pays
**Usefulness**: Can be turned informant, reveal other polluters, help party if price is right
**Or**: Can be example (arrested/killed) to deter others

### Prince Parasitus (Saboteur)
**Background**: Merfolk noble from neighboring kingdom
**Motivation**: Wants Reefhaven's territory for expansion, orchest rating ecological terrorism
**Method**: Released crown-of-thorns starfish plague, funds other polluters
**Psychology**: Machiavellian, sees it as legitimate warfare
**Resolution**: Must be exposed politically, war with his kingdom, or assassinated
**Complications**: Killing him might trigger war, but he won't stop voluntarily

## Solutions to Each Problem

## Extended NPC Details

**Baron Goldstein**: Can have redemption arc, daughter shows him dying reef, realizes money means nothing if world is dead, funds restoration

**Archmage Tidecaller**: Genuinely wants to help, experiments were supposed to cure not harm, becomes passionate ally once convinced

**Prince Parasitus**: Irredeemable, must be stopped by force or politics, represents pure antagonist greed

**Coralyx**: Surprisingly reasonable for demon, respects cleverness, bound by contract as much as Coralborn, might even help if properly approached
