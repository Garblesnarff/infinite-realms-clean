# The Coral Kingdom's Fall
**Tagline:** *When Paradise Dies, Will You Save It or Mourn Its Passing?*

## Campaign Overview

The Coral Kingdom of Reefhaven is drowning—ironically. Once the most vibrant ecosystem in the seven seas, the thousand-mile reef system is experiencing catastrophic collapse. Coral bleaching spreads like wildfire. Fish populations crash. The water itself seems sick. The Coralborn—a civilization of sentient coral polyp colonies living symbiotically with their reef—are dying along with their home.

The party arrives as the last hope: Environmental specialists, druids, scientists, and adventurers hired to diagnose and cure the dying reef. What they discover is worse than natural disaster—it's murder. Multiple causes compound: Surface world pollution, magical experiments gone wrong, an invasive species released deliberately, and worst of all, the Coralborn's own ancient pact coming due. A demon lord once helped them build their paradise in exchange for a price to be paid "when the reef is most beautiful." That time is now.

The party must race against ecological collapse, identify and stop all causes of death, broker peace between surface and sea, confront those profiting from destruction, and decide if they'll pay the demon's price or find another way. Can a dying ecosystem be saved? Should it be, if the cost is too high? And if paradise falls, what remains?

## Core Themes
- **Environmental Catastrophe**: Ecological disaster in real-time
- **Multiple Causes**: No single villain, systemic failure
- **Tragedy of the Commons**: Everyone takes, no one preserves
- **Price of Paradise**: All utopias have hidden costs
- **Hope vs. Acceptance**: Fight inevitable decline or let nature take its course?
- **Intergenerational Guilt**: Current generation pays for ancestors' choices
- **The Value of Beauty**: Is saving something purely for its beauty enough reason?

## Key NPCs

**Queen Polypa** (Coralborn Monarch, Neutral Good): Symbiotic coral-humanoid, desperate to save people and reef, willing to sacrifice self

**Baron Crassus Goldstein** (Human Industrialist, Lawful Evil): Owns polluting factory, sees ocean as free waste disposal, profit over environment

**Archmage Tidecaller** (Elf Wizard, Chaotic Neutral): Experiments cause magical contamination, obsessed with research, doesn't realize damage

**Prince Parasitus** (Merfolk Noble, Neutral Evil): Released invasive species to destroy Reefhaven, wants their territory for expansion

**Coralyx the Devourer** (Demon Lord, Lawful Evil): Made original pact, now collects debt, not negotiable through traditional means

**Elder Kelp** (Ancient Treant-equivalent, Neutral): Oldest reef resident, remembers the pact, knows truth

**Dr. Marina Clearwater** (Human Scientist, Lawful Good): Environmental activist trying to stop pollution, ally to party

**Captain Refuse** (Half-Orc Smuggler, Chaotic Neutral): Illegal dumping for profit, can be turned informant or enemy

## Major Locations

**Reefhaven Capital**: Coralborn city built into living coral, beautiful but bleaching
**The Dying Fields**: Vast stretches of dead white coral, eerie graveyard
**The Last Garden**: Small preserved zone, shows what reef was like
**Goldstein Industrial**: Surface factory dumping waste
**Tidecaller's Tower**: Wizard's laboratory, magical contamination source
**The Demon's Gate**: Underwater volcano where Coralyx enters world

## Unique Mechanics

**Reef Health Meter** (100% to 0%)
- Starts at 40% and falling
- Tracks overall ecosystem vitality
- Each problem fixed restores percentage
- Below 25%: Mass extinction begins
- Below 10%: Ecosystem collapse irreversible
- Party has 10 in-game weeks before 0%

**Multiple Stressor System**
- **Pollution**: -2% per week (from factory)
- **Temperature**: -1% per week (climate change, slow to fix)
- **Invasive Species**: -1.5% per week (reproduce rapidly)
- **Magical Contamination**: -1% per week (from experiments)
- **Demon's Curse**: -3% per week (active until pact resolved)
- Each fixed stops that drain

**Ecosystem Restoration**
- Fixing problems stops decline
- Active restoration (planting coral, removing invasives) adds percentage
- Requires resources, time, and expertise
- Some damage is permanent

**The Demon's Contract**
- Legally binding supernatural pact
- Loopholes possible but difficult to find
- Breaking requires: Equal value sacrifice OR destroying demon OR clever wordplay
- Demon cannot be killed in traditional combat (reforms in Nine Hells)

## Plot Twists

1. **Ancestral Sin**: Modern Coralborn didn't make pact—ancestors 500 years ago did, current generation innocent victims
2. **The Industrial Conspiracy**: Goldstein knowingly poisoning reef to buy land cheap when Coralborn abandon it
3. **Good Intentions**: Tidecaller trying to create purification spell, experiments backfired catastrophically
4. **False Ally**: One Coralborn elder secretly working with demon (traitor for promised survival)
5. **The Price Was Clear**: Ancient texts show Coralborn ancestors knew price, chose to damn descendants for temporary paradise
6. **Demon's Sympathy**: Coralyx doesn't want to destroy reef, bound by contract, might help find loophole if party clever
7. **Player Connection**: One PC unknowingly descended from Coralborn ancestor who made pact (bloodline sacrifice option)

## Victory Conditions

**Full Restoration**: Fix all problems, find loophole in demon contract, reef saved at 100%, Coralborn survive, paradise preserved

**Pyrrhic Salvation**: Stop decline but reef permanently damaged, stabilizes at 50%, Coralborn survive but diminished, bittersweet

**Sacrifice Play**: Queen or party member substitutes for entire Coralborn population, reef saved, one soul to demon instead of millions

**Demon's Defeat**: Actually kill demon permanently (extremely difficult), break contract through force, but significant casualties

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Collapse**: Reef reaches 0%, complete ecosystem death, Coralborn extinct, demon claims souls anyway (contract fulfilled through death)

**The Devouring**: Fail to resolve pact, demon claims all Coralborn souls, reef becomes haunted dead zone

**Partial Genocide**: Save reef but lose Coralborn, or save Coralborn but lose reef, moral failure

**Industrialist Victory**: Goldstein and others exploit dying reef, profit from catastrophe, party fails to stop
