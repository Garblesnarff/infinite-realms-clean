# Creative Brief: Riders of Alagaesia

## Art Style: Epic Dragon Fantasy (Eragon meets Medieval Epic)

Medieval European fantasy with draconic majesty, elven elegance, and dwarven craftsmanship. Emphasizes the bond between Rider and dragon, ancient magic, and rebellion against tyranny.

### Core Principles:
*   **Draconic Majesty:** Dragons are massive, intelligent, and noble—every scale, wing, and eye reflects power and wisdom.
*   **Ancient Language Glyphs:** Magic manifests as glowing runes and symbols in the Ancient Language.
*   **Cultural Diversity:** Humans (medieval), elves (elegant nature-integrated), dwarves (underground masonry), Urgals (warrior tribes).

### Color Palette:
*   **Dragons:** Vibrant scale colors—sapphire blue, emerald green, blood red, gold, white, black. Each dragon is unique.
*   **Varden:** Earth tones, leather and steel, red banner with dragon symbol.
*   **Elves:** Forest greens, gold accents, flowing fabrics, natural materials.
*   **Dwarves:** Stone grays, metallic golds/silvers, firelight from forges.
*   **Empire:** Blacks and crimsons, cold steel, oppressive architecture.

### Character Design:
*   **Riders:** Wearing leather armor, carrying Brightsteel swords (colored to match dragons), Gedwey Ignasia glowing on palm. Ages 14-20s.
*   **Dragons:** Massive (size grows with age), intelligent eyes, elegant movement, scales shimmer with magic, unique horns/crests.
*   **Elves:** Tall, graceful, pointed ears, ageless beauty, flowing clothing, expert archers.
*   **Dwarves:** Short, stocky, bearded, expert smiths, ornate armor with clan runes.

### Voice:
Epic fantasy narrator—formal, slightly archaic language, young Rider's voice (earnest, determined). British-inspired accent for elegance. Role: Narrating the journey of a new Dragon Rider.
