The party discovers dragon eggs hidden since the fall of the original Dragon Riders, bonding with dragons and inheriting legendary power. They join the Varden rebellion against King Galbatorix—a mad former Rider who slaughtered his brethren and rules through fear and dark magic. As they learn the Ancient Language (true-name magic), train with elven warriors, and uncover their draconic heritage, they must unite divided peoples (humans, elves, dwarves, Urgals) to overthrow an empire and restore the Dragon Riders. The campaign explores power's corruption, the weight of legacy, and whether vengeance can coexist with justice.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dragon Bonding**
*   Each player bonds with a dragon hatchling (telepathic link, shared growth).
*   **Dragon Companion:** Acts as mount, battle ally, and magical conduit. Levels with player.

### 2. **Ancient Language Magic**
*   Magic requires speaking in the Ancient Language (true speech—cannot lie).
*   **True Name Power:** Learning someone's true name grants control over them. Discovering your own true name grants immunity.

### 3. **Gedwey Ignasia**
*   Dragon Riders bear a silver mark on their palm (where they first touched their dragon).
*   **Magical Conduit:** Grants enhanced magic, supernatural strength, and longevity.

### 4. **Rider's Blade**
*   Each Rider receives a custom sword from elven smiths (Brightsteel—indestructible).
*   **Bonded Weapon:** The sword's color reflects the dragon's scales.
