# L-Space Wanderers - World Building Specification

## L-Space: The Library Dimension

### Principle
Knowledge equals power equals energy equals matter equals mass. Mass warps space. Sufficient knowledge density creates dimensional distortion. All libraries connected through L-Space—walk far enough through any library and emerge in another.

### Properties
- Non-Euclidean geometry
- Navigation is thematic (follow concepts, not corridors)
- Time is relative (history section exists in past, future section in future)
- Gravity varies by knowledge weight
- Reality is permeable to information

### The Collapse
Too much knowledge accumulated. L-Space reaching critical mass. Will collapse into singularity—all information compressed to single point, then annihilated. Timeline uncertain. Could be years or days.

## Living Books

### The Truth
Party members are animated texts. Narrative magic gave them consciousness. Their bodies contain their stories. Reading themselves reveals their past and future.

### Mechanics
- Can be read for information (painful)
- Damaged by fire and water
- Aging occurs through readings (every reading wears them)
- Death means final page reached
- Can author themselves through choices

### Identity Crisis
Discovering you're a book is existentially horrifying:
- Everything you are is written
- Someone authored you
- Reading your end reveals your death
- Your existence is narrative, not biological

## The Blank Minds Faction

### Philosophy
Knowledge is suffering. Awareness is pain. The more you know, the more you suffer. Ignorance is bliss. Therefore: Destroy all knowledge, free humanity from information burden.

### Methods
- Knowledge bombs (information overload drives victims mad)
- Book burnings (systematic destruction)
- Memory erasure (wiping minds clean)
- Accelerating L-Space collapse (ending all knowledge)

### Leader: Erasure
Was Sophia's friend. Watched her go mad from omniscience. Concluded: Knowledge is poison. Became extremist. Genuinely believes enforced ignorance is mercy.

### Moral Complexity
They have points:
- Information overload is real
- Total knowledge is torture (Sophia proves this)
- Forgetting can be healing
- Some knowledge causes only suffering

But methods are genocidal. Burning books is destroying accumulated wisdom. Enforced ignorance is tyranny.

## Knowledge Predators

### The Devourer
Creature that consumes information. Eats books, devours memories, consumes ideas. Becomes composite of all knowledge absorbed.

**Abilities**:
- Memory drain (eats your past)
- Skill absorption (steals your abilities)
- Identity consumption (becomes you)
- Knowledge incarnation (manifests as information)

**Ecology**:
Natural predator in L-Space. Necessary for knowledge ecosystem. Without Devourers, information accumulates to collapse. They're terrifying but essential.

**Tragic Nature**:
Each Devourer is built from consumed knowledge. They are libraries incarnate. Killing one destroys all information it contained. Moral dilemma: Defend yourself or preserve knowledge?

## Sophia the Omniscient

### Achievement
Attained complete knowledge—knows everything that is, was, or could be. Total awareness. Ultimate understanding.

### Cost
Constant agony. All information simultaneously in mind. Cannot filter, cannot forget, cannot stop knowing. Every suffering across history felt. Every joy experienced. Every thought thought. Infinite consciousness is infinite pain.

### Warning
Living testament to knowledge's danger. Erasure was her friend, watched her achieve omniscience, watched it destroy her. This motivated Blank Minds' formation.

### Role
Tragic figure party encounters. Begs for ignorance. Cannot die (knows how to avoid death). Trapped in total awareness. Only mercy: Making her forget. But that requires destroying her accumulated knowledge.

## Major Library Sections

### The Lost Library of Alexandria
Still exists in L-Space. All "lost" texts preserved. Contains knowledge thought destroyed. Also: Possibly oldest library, therefore deepest L-Space anchor. Collapse might start here.

### The Akashic Records
Cosmic library containing all events. Reading it shows past lives, future possibilities, alternate timelines. Dangerous because total information about yourself can drive you mad.

### Unseen University Library
Discworld reference. Magical library with orangutan Librarian. Contains magical texts that do magic when read. "Reading" a fireball spell casts fireball.

### The Forbidden Stacks
Sealed books too dangerous to read:
- Necronomicon (drives readers mad)
- The Book of Endings (reveals how everything dies)
- The Infinite Jest (causes laughter until death)
- The True History (reality-breaking revelations)
- The Name of God (speaking it ends creation)

Party sometimes must retrieve these for containment or controlled use.

### The Biography Section
Every person's life story. Organized alphabetically. Party can find their own books here. Temptation to read ahead vs. spoiling your own story.

## The Singularity Point

### Location
Center of L-Space where collapse is happening. Infinite knowledge compressed to single point. Impossible to approach without information overload.

### Properties
- Infinitely dense information
- Time breaks down (all moments simultaneous)
- Identity dissolves (all selves merge)
- Reality becomes pure data
- Approaching causes omniscience and madness

### Final Destination
Campaign climaxes here. Party must either:
1. Accelerate collapse (embrace singularity)
2. Reverse collapse (burn books or expand space)
3. Stabilize collapse (create balance)

### The Transcendence Option
Merging with singularity = becoming unified information field. All knowledge, all consciousness, all stories become one. End of individuality but ultimate understanding. Ascension or annihilation?

## Resolution Options

### The Burning Ending
Destroy enough knowledge to reduce L-Space's mass below critical. Painful choices about which books to burn. Preserve system by sacrificing content. Utilitarian tragedy.

**Consequence**: L-Space survives but diminished. Lost knowledge never recovered. Cultural genocide for survival.

### The Expansion Ending
Create new dimensions to distribute knowledge weight. Risky reality manipulation. Could stabilize L-Space or break reality.

**Consequence**: Success = Infinite library space. Failure = Reality torn apart. High risk, high reward.

### The Singularity Ending
Embrace collapse. Merge with unified information field. Party reads their own final pages, completing their narratives, becoming part of cosmic consciousness.

**Consequence**: Individuality lost. Knowledge preserved as unified awareness. Transcendence or ego death?

### The Balance Ending
Controlled curation: Some burning (least valuable texts), some expansion (careful dimensional growth), some containment (seal dangerous sections). Difficult compromise requiring constant maintenance.

**Consequence**: Imperfect but sustainable. L-Space survives through managed equilibrium. Eternal vigilance required.

## Daily Life of L-Space Wanderers

**Navigation**: Follow conceptual threads. "Need dragon lore?" Walk toward dragon books across all libraries. Reality shifts around you.

**Deliveries**: Rare text courier service. Transport books between dimensions. Dodge knowledge predators and information pirates.

**Research**: Find specific texts for clients. Navigate infinite library to locate needle in infinite haystack.

**Containment**: Secure forbidden books. Prevent dangerous knowledge escape. Like magical firefighters.

**Survival**: Avoid getting lost (wander wrong genre, emerge centuries displaced), escape predators, resist reading your own endings.

## The Metafictional Layer

### Characters as Books
Party discovering they're texts is meta-commentary on characters in stories. All fictional characters are essentially written. Campaign makes this literal.

### Reading Endings
Choosing whether to read your own ending = Player agency vs. predetermined narrative. Do you spoil the campaign or let it unfold?

### Authorship
Who wrote the party? Unknown author. Possibly they're writing themselves through choices. Self-authorship through play.

### The Final Reading
Campaign ends with players literally reading their characters' final pages—narrating their endings aloud. Characters merge with information singularity or are preserved as completed books. Metatextual closure.

## Thematic Core

Knowledge is power, burden, weapon, beauty, danger, treasure, poison—all simultaneously. The campaign explores: How much knowledge is too much? Who decides what should be known? Can information be too free? Is forgetting sometimes mercy? And ultimately: What is worth preserving when preservation itself threatens collapse?

It's love letter to libraries, books, and knowledge while honestly examining their weight.
