# Creative Brief: Beneath the Grassblade

## Visual Art Direction
- **Color Palette:** Grass greens, earth browns, insect chitin blacks/browns, dewdrop crystal clear, pollen yellows
- **Environments:** Grass as forest, dirt as boulder fields, flowers as landmarks, puddles as lakes
- **Scale Reference:** Everyday objects (coins, buttons, bottle caps) as enormous compared to party
- **Insect Detail:** Compound eyes, antennae, wing membranes all visible and detailed
- **Surface Tension:** Water droplets as perfect spheres, walking on water surface visually

## Music and Sound Design
- **Main Theme:** Wonder and danger mixed, small-scale intimate instrumentation
- **Grass Forest:** Rustling amplified, wind in blades
- **Ant March:** Rhythmic, organized percussion
- **Spider's Web:** Delicate strings (literal web vibrations)
- **Bee Hive:** Constant buzzing ambience, organized chaos
- **Rain Storm:** Terrifying percussion, each drop a bomb-impact sound
- **Environmental:** Insect sounds amplified and detailed

## Voice Acting
- **Thornwick:** Weary but wise, has seen much
- **General Mandible:** Clicking, alien quality but understandable military precision
- **Queen Vespa:** Buzzing undertone, regal, business-minded
- **Chirp:** Musical voice, literal chirping incorporated
- **The Wizard:** Guilt-ridden, academic, desperate to help
