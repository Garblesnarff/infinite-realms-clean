# Camp Half-Blood Chronicles: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Gods" of Olympus are not, and have never been, truly divine. They are sentient ideas, powerful narratives that achieved consciousness in the Noosphere—the shared dream-space of human thought. They are powered by belief. For millennia, they reigned supreme, their stories told around every campfire and altar. But in the modern world of science, skepticism, and a thousand new distractions, belief is a dwindling resource. The Gods are fading, their forms becoming indistinct, their powers waning. In a desperate act of self-preservation, they initiated "The Chronicling": a plan to sire a new generation of heroes, demigod children whose lives would be so dramatic, so tragic, and so "story-worthy" that their legends would re-ignite belief in the old ways. "Camp Half-Blood" is not just a sanctuary; it is a story-farm, a narrative engine designed to mold these children into protagonists. The monsters they fight are not ancient evils, but "Counter-Narratives"—physical manifestations of modern ideas like logic, atheism, and scientific rationalism, which seek to erase the "irrational" stories of the gods from existence.

### Timeline
1.  **The Dawn of Belief (Ancient Greece):** As humanity first begins to tell stories of the sky, the sea, and the underworld, the first "God-Ideas"—Zeus, Poseidon, Hades—achieve consciousness in the Noosphere.
2.  **The Age of Myths (c. 1500 BCE - 300 CE):** The Gods are at the height of their power, fueled by the fervent belief of the ancient world. They sire the first generation of great heroes (Heracles, Perseus, etc.) to create compelling stories.
3.  **The Great Fading (c. 300 CE - 1800 CE):** With the rise of new religions and the Age of Enlightenment, belief in the Olympians dwindles. They retreat from the mortal world, their power greatly diminished.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day of Grey (1789 CE):** On the day the Bastille is stormed, a wave of pure, revolutionary "logic" sweeps the Noosphere. For 24 hours, all divine magic fails, and the Gods become faint, ghostly after-images of themselves. They realize they are on the brink of non-existence.
5.  **The First Chronicling (c. 1850 CE):** The Gods, desperate, begin siring a new generation of heroes, hoping their modern-day myths will restore them. The first, secret "Camp Half-Blood" is founded in a hidden valley in Greece.
6.  **The American Relocation (c. 1920 CE):** Realizing that the "heart of belief" has moved, the Gods relocate Olympus to the "600th floor" of the Empire State Building and move Camp Half-Blood to Long Island.
7.  **(Surreal) The Broadcast of Dreams (1969 CE):** The Apollo 11 moon landing sends a shockwave of scientific achievement through the Noosphere. For a week, everyone on Earth dreams of a silent, grey, and godless moon. Dozens of minor gods and nature spirits fade from existence entirely.
8.  **The Titan's Stirring (c. 1990 CE):** The "Titans"—not gods, but ancient, powerful narratives of chaos and destruction that predate the Olympians—begin to stir, sensing the Gods' weakness.
9.  **The First Great Prophecy (c. 15 years ago):** The Oracle of Delphi, now a reclusive spirit bound to an attic in Camp Half-Blood, issues a prophecy foretelling a child of the "Big Three" (Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) who will either save or destroy Olympus. The Big Three make a pact to sire no more children.
10. **(Surreal) The Un-Birthday (c. 1 year ago):** For one day, no one on Earth can remember their own birthday. All calendars are blank. This is a powerful "Counter-Narrative" of pure data attempting to erase the "story" of individual lives. The final battle for belief is about to begin.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a war for the soul of the modern world, a battle between the romantic, chaotic power of myth and the cold, hard logic of scientific rationalism. The players are not just pawns in a divine game; they are the living, breathing stories that will decide the outcome. Their quests are not just about retrieving a golden fleece, but about creating a tale so compelling it can compete with the moon landing and the internet. The ultimate enemy is not a monster, but apathy. If the players fail, the Gods will not be "killed" in a grand battle; they will simply be forgotten, fading into the background noise of a world that no longer has time for them.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. Anaklusmos (Riptide)
**Type:** Legendary Longsword
**Description:** Percy Jackson's signature weapon. A simple, bronze ballpoint pen that, when uncapped, transforms into a perfectly balanced, glowing bronze longsword.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 longsword that deals an extra 1d8 lightning damage to monsters. It is a "loyal" weapon; if lost, it will always reappear in the wielder's pocket after a few minutes. It cannot harm mortals, passing through them as if they were ghosts.

### 2. The Master Bolt
**Type:** Artifact (Javelin)
**Description:** The symbol of Zeus's power, a two-foot long, perfectly formed lightning bolt of pure, celestial bronze. It hums with immense power.
**Mechanics:** The Bolt can be thrown as a javelin. On a hit, it deals 20d10 lightning damage and creates a massive thunderclap that stuns all creatures within 100 feet. It then immediately returns to the hand of Zeus. It is the ultimate weapon, and its theft is the cause of a world-threatening war between the gods.

### 3. The Helm of Darkness
**Type:** Artifact (Helmet)
**Description:** The symbol of Hades's power. A helmet forged from pure, solidified darkness.
**Mechanics:** The wearer of the Helm is invisible, silent, and cannot be detected by any means, magical or mundane. They can also radiate an aura of intense fear, forcing all creatures who see them to make a high DC Wisdom save or become frightened. The Helm allows the wearer to command the dead and travel through shadows.

### 4. The Golden Fleece
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** The fleece of a legendary, winged ram. It glows with a warm, golden light and radiates an aura of pure, healing life-force.
**Mechanics:** The Fleece can heal any poison, disease, or curse. If draped over a living thing (like a tree or a person), it will create a magical barrier that repels all monsters. It can even bring a recently-deceased creature back to life, though not without consequences.

### 5. Daedalus's Laptop
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** A sleek, silver laptop, covered in glowing, Greek-letter keys. It contains the life's work of the master inventor, Daedalus.
**Mechanics:** The laptop contains the blueprints for every one of Daedalus's inventions, from simple automatons to the Labyrinth itself. A user with the right skills can use it to build incredible devices. It also has a direct, Wi-Fi connection to the "source code" of the Labyrinth, allowing the user to reshape its passages and traps. It is protected by a password that is a riddle only a true genius could solve.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Can of Diet Coke:** The preferred drink of Mr. D, as he is forbidden from drinking wine. It tastes of disappointment.
2.  **A Blue Plastic Hairbrush:** Annabeth's emergency weapon of choice. Surprisingly effective at hitting monsters in the eye.
3.  **A Minotaur's Horn:** The horn of the Minotaur, broken off in a fight. It smells faintly of beef.
4.  **A Camp Half-Blood Necklace:** A leather necklace with a single, hand-painted bead for every summer a camper has survived.
5.  **A Pair of Winged Sneakers:** A gift from Hermes. They allow you to fly, but they are notoriously unreliable and have a tendency to fly off on their own.
6.  **A Bag of Ambrosia and a Flask of Nectar:** The food and drink of the gods. It tastes like your favorite food. It can heal demigods, but is poisonous to mortals.
7.  **A "Logic-Bomb" Diffuser:** A device from a Logician that looks like a small, grey pyramid. When activated, it whispers a single, irrefutable, logical truth that can stun a lesser god for one round.
8.  **A Can of "Amazon-Prime" Energy Drink:** An energy drink from the Amazons. It gives you the effects of a *Haste* spell for one minute, but you must also pass a Wisdom save or feel an overwhelming urge to organize your inventory.
9.  **A "Party Pony" T-Shirt:** A t-shirt with obnoxious lettering. Wearing it grants you advantage on Charisma checks when dealing with centaurs.
10. **A Single, Perfect, Golden Apple of Discord:** An apple that, when thrown into a room, will cause everyone to argue over who is the "fairest."
11. **A "Myth-o-Magic" Figurine:** A small, collectible figurine of one of the gods or monsters. It is part of a popular, in-world collectible card game.
12. **A Satyr's Pan-Pipes:** A set of reed pipes that can play songs that make plants grow, or make people fall asleep, or just make people want to dance.
13. **A "Mist-form" Vial:** A vial of a strange, magical substance that can be used to manipulate the "Mist," making mortals see what you want them to see.
14. **A Drachma:** A golden coin, the currency of the gods. It can be used to create a magical, long-distance call.
15. **A Stick:** A stick. Just a normal stick. Annabeth once convinced a cyclops it was a legendary, magical weapon.
16. **A Copy of "The Odyssey," Autographed by Odysseus:** The book is real. The autograph is a forgery.
17. **A "Godly Parent Approval Form":** A form from Hephaestus's TV shopping network, required for all major purchases.
18. **A "Get Out of Tartarus Free" Card:** A card from Hades. It is a joke. It does not work.
19. **A Single, Shed, Hydra Scale:** A scale from a Hydra. It is incredibly durable and resistant to acid.
20. **A Ballpoint Pen:** It is just a pen. Not every pen is a secret, magical sword.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Belief
The power of the gods and their children is directly proportional to the amount of "belief" in the world.
*   **The Mist:** A magical veil that obscures the mythological world from mortal eyes. A sword fight might look like a gang fight. A monster might look like a rabid dog. The Mist is weaker in areas where belief is stronger.
*   **Godly Wi-Fi:** The more people who are actively thinking about or worshipping a god, the more powerful that god and their children are. A child of Zeus will be more powerful during a thunderstorm. A child of Aphrodite will be more powerful on Valentine's Day.
*   **The Power of a Good Story:** A demigod's actions are their "story." The more heroic, dramatic, and memorable their actions, the more "belief" they generate. This can translate into tangible mechanical benefits, like gaining a point of inspiration, or even a temporary "legendary" status.

### Subsystems: Divine Favor and Prophecy
*   **Divine Favor:** Each player has a "Favor" score with their divine parent, and with other gods. This is affected by their actions. High favor with a god might result in a magical gift or a helpful intervention. Low favor might result in a curse or a new, angry monster showing up.
*   **Prophecy:** The Oracle's prophecies are a core mechanic. They are always cryptic, always come true, and often in a way you don't expect. The party's main quests will be driven by these prophecies. A key part of the game is not just fulfilling the prophecy, but interpreting what it actually means.
