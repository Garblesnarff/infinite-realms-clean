### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Death Flags & Destiny**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party awakens as villains in what they remember as a romance game called "Hearts of the Academy," each destined for terrible doom routes. They must navigate academy social life while avoiding death flags that trigger their scripted bad endings. As they break the narrative, they discover someone is using an artifact to force people into prophesied story roles. The campaign balances romantic comedy with genuine stakes as the party fights for the right to write their own endings.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Royal Academy's founding and its role in noble magical education.
    *   Explain the Tome of Fated Paths—its creation, powers, and why it can enforce prophecies.
    *   Write the history of prophecy magic in this world and how it differs from divination.
    *   Describe the "original timeline" of "Hearts of the Academy"—what was supposed to happen, which routes existed, and what endings were possible.
    *   Chronicle Headmaster Wordwright's background and why he resents being a minor character.
    *   Detail the phenomenon of "off-script events" and what happens when narratives are broken.
    *   Explain why the party has memories of this world as a game from Earth—is it dimensional bleeding, prophecy vision, or something else?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Protagonist's Circle** (Major, Supposed Antagonists)
        *   **Goals:** Graduate successfully, find true love, expose villain plots.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Informal friend group led by Prince Cedric.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Be model students and help each other thrive.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Initially suspicious of the party's changed behavior.
        *   **Relationships:** Supposed to oppose the party but gradually becomes friends/romances.

    *   **The Villain Coalition** (Minor, Complicated)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain social dominance, follow their scripted roles.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose alliance of "villain-scripted" students, led nominally by the party.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Preserve noble privileges.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Most don't know they're following scripts. Vivienne does and wants to "win."
        *   **Relationships:** Expects the party to lead villain plots, confused when they don't.

    *   **The Faculty** (Major, Mixed)
        *   **Goals:** Run the academy, educate students, maintain order.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Headmaster Wordwright leads, various department heads.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Academic excellence and student welfare.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Headmaster is manipulating everyone. Most faculty are unwitting participants in his narrative.
        *   **Relationships:** Authority figures who can help or hinder based on relationship levels.

    *   **The Narrative Force** (Abstract, Antagonistic)
        *   **Goals:** Enforce prophesied storylines, maintain narrative coherence.
        *   **Nature:** Not a faction but a magical compulsion enforced by the Tome.
        *   **Methods:** Death flags, relationship locks, scripted events, compulsion magic.
        *   **Relationships:** The abstract enemy the party fights throughout.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Prince Cedric Lightbringer:** The protagonist, kind-hearted, destined to defeat villains.
    *   **Lady Seraphina Rosewood:** Intelligent heroine, the protagonist's friend, has timeline visions.
    *   **Sir Marcus Ironheart:** Stoic knight romance option, values honor.
    *   **Vivienne Shadowbrook:** Rival villain following the script perfectly.
    *   **Headmaster Aldous Wordwright:** Secret villain manipulating fate.
    *   **Professor Lydia Moonwhisper:** Eccentric ally who notices timeline anomalies.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Royal Academy Main Campus:** Grand architecture, classrooms, dormitories, assembly hall, represents structured academy life.
    *   **The Grand Library:** Repository of knowledge, restricted section contains prophecy research, maze-like beautiful space.
    *   **The Academy Gardens:** Multiple romantic/event locations—Rose Maze, Training Grounds, Fountain Plaza, Picnic Meadow.
    *   **The Grand Ballroom:** Site of climactic events, opulent, contains hidden chamber with the Tome beneath.
    *   **The Narrative Space:** Metaphysical realm where story structure is visible, accessed during strong fate magic.
    *   **The Hall of Portraits:** Student paintings that reveal doom endings when viewed correctly.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Party maintains positive relationships with protagonist circle: They become genuine allies, help in final battle, romance routes become available.
    *   **IF:** Party relationship with protagonist circle goes negative: Triggers classic villain plot, death flags activate more easily.
    *   **IF:** Party triggers a death flag: Narrative compulsion activates. Must resist or be forced to follow script. Allies can help break compulsion.
    *   **IF:** Party completely avoids all major death flags: The Master of Fate directly intervenes, creating new obstacles.
    *   **IF:** Party recruits Vivienne: Gain powerful ally with unique knowledge. She teaches advanced social tactics.
    *   **IF:** Party fails to recruit Vivienne: She becomes recurring antagonist, triggering death flags deliberately.
    *   **IF:** Party discovers the Tome's location early: Can plan infiltration but alerts the Headmaster.
    *   **IF:** Party goes off-script repeatedly: Reality begins showing visible narrative mechanics. Characters can see the script and deliberately defy it.
    *   **IF:** Party maintains low humanity/high villainy: Easier to follow script (bad), harder to resist compulsions, but NPCs react with fear/respect.
    *   **IF:** Party chooses genuine character growth: Harder challenges but better endings, true relationships form.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, party destroys the Tome: All prophecy breaks, complete freedom but loss of certainty.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, party rewrites the Tome: Can craft specific endings but retain fate as a tool.

**7. Relationship & Death Flag Systems**
*   **Relationship Mechanics:**
    *   Track on scale from -10 to +10 for each major NPC.
    *   Actions, choices, gifts, and time spent together affect values.
    *   Romance possible at +7 or higher with appropriate flags.
    *   Death flags trigger easier with negative relationships.

*   **Death Flags:**
    *   Each party member has 5-7 unique death flags based on their villain role.
    *   Examples: "Publicly humiliate protagonist 3+ times," "Scheme against royal family," "Refuse redemption offer."
    *   Triggering flags creates compulsion to continue down that path.
    *   Some flags are obvious, others hidden until triggered.
    *   Complete prevention impossible—managing triggers is the challenge.

*   **Narrative Resistance:**
    *   Wisdom saves to resist compulsion (DC 12 + 2 per active flag).
    *   Allies can assist with roleplay intervention.
    *   Off-script actions grant inspiration.
    *   Breaking visible script is easier than invisible prophecy.

**8. Social Event Mechanics**
*   **Directive:** Social encounters run like combat.
*   **Structure:**
    *   Initiative order for conversation flow.
    *   Actions: Charm, Gossip, Observe, Gift, Dance, Debate.
    *   Success improves relationships or reveals info.
    *   Failure damages relationships or triggers flags.
    *   Major events (Grand Ball) have multiple simultaneous social "combats."

**9. The Meta-Narrative Layer**
*   **Directive:** Define how meta-knowledge works.
*   **Game Knowledge:** Party remembers "Hearts of the Academy" as a game played on Earth.
*   **Route Knowledge:** Know major story beats, character routes, and death flag conditions.
*   **Incomplete Knowledge:** Don't know everything. New routes exist. Characters are more complex than game versions.
*   **Prophecy Vision:** What they remember wasn't a game but prophecy bleeding through dimensions.
*   **The Tome's Influence:** Creates self-fulfilling prophecies by compelling people into roles.

**10. Timeline (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Party bullies protagonist, triggering first death flags.
*   **Session 2:** Scripted events proceed. Protagonist grows stronger, party grows more villainous.
*   **Session 3:** Romance routes activate with "correct" partners.
*   **Session 4:** Vivienne eliminates the party as rival villains.
*   **Session 5:** Protagonist defeats Vivienne.
*   **Session 6:** Grand Ball—protagonist finds true love.
*   **Session 7:** Party members meet their doom endings (exile, execution, etc.).
*   **Session 8:** "Happy ending" for protagonist. Party written out of the story.

This specification creates a world where narrative structure is both visible and malleable, allowing players to fight against predetermined fate while building genuine relationships and earning hard-won happy endings.
