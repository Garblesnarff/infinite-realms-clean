# World-Building Specification: Retrograde Catastrophe

## World Structure: Stellara

Stellara is a disc-shaped world where the twelve zodiac kingdoms are arranged like hours on a clock face. Above the world, the celestial sphere contains all constellations. Below the world lies the Celestial Undercroft - the cosmic machinery that maintains reality.

**Pre-Retrograde Layout:**
- Perfect circular arrangement of twelve kingdoms
- Each kingdom embodies its zodiac archetype cleanly
- Borders are permeable; citizens travel freely
- The sky shows constellations moving forward (east to west)

**Post-Retrograde Layout:**
- Same geographic arrangement but culturally inverted
- Each kingdom is a twisted opposite of itself
- Citizens rarely leave, as other kingdoms are equally disturbing
- The sky shows constellations moving backward (west to east)

## The Omniversal Retrograde

### The Event

Three weeks ago, at precisely midnight across all time zones simultaneously:
1. All twelve constellations stopped moving
2. For twelve seconds, complete celestial stillness
3. Then all constellations began moving backward
4. Every person born under a zodiac sign immediately inverted

**Immediate Effects:**
- Mass personality inversions (95% of population)
- Social structures collapse within hours
- Cusp Children (5%) partially affected but not completely inverted
- Magic begins working backward

**Progressive Effects (Week by Week):**
- Week 1: Chaos and confusion, society breaks down
- Week 2: New inverted norms begin to establish
- Week 3: People start forgetting they were ever different (current)
- Week 4: Inversions deepen, original personality fading
- By Week 5 (30 days total): Inversions become permanent and irreversible

### The Cause

The Omniversal Retrograde was triggered when the Reversal - an entity formed from all rejected zodiac shadow aspects - gained enough power to reverse the celestial machinery. The Reversal didn't cause this out of malice but desperation: it wanted to show the zodiac what they'd become by denying their wholeness.

## The Reversal: Origin and Nature

### Formation

Over thousands of years, each zodiac lord worked to embody their sign perfectly:
- Aries suppressed all cowardice and hesitation
- Taurus suppressed all change and generosity
- Gemini suppressed all singularity and silence
- Cancer suppressed all cruelty and detachment
- Leo suppressed all humility and self-doubt
- Virgo suppressed all chaos and self-interest
- Libra suppressed all decisiveness and extremity
- Scorpio suppressed all transparency and apathy
- Sagittarius suppressed all need for home and boundaries
- Capricorn suppressed all spontaneity and joy
- Aquarius suppressed all tradition and conformity
- Pisces suppressed all harsh reality and boundaries

These suppressed aspects didn't disappear. They accumulated in the Celestial Undercroft, eventually gaining sentience and becoming the Reversal.

### Nature of the Reversal

**Not Evil, But Rejected:**
- The Reversal is the zodiac's unconscious shadow
- It wants integration, not destruction
- It's hurt, lonely, and believes it's showing necessary truth
- It represents psychological wholeness

**Appearance:**
- Twelve shadow forms that shift constantly
- Each form is the dark mirror of a zodiac lord
- Beautiful in its own way, not monstrous
- Reflective eyes that show viewer's own shadows

**Powers:**
- Control over the Retrograde Engine
- Ability to invert any zodiac magic
- Can manifest shadow aspects in others
- Exists partially in cosmic machinery, partially in consciousness

**Motivation:**
- Prove that wholeness requires shadow integration
- Force zodiac lords to acknowledge their rejected selves
- End the cycle of suppression and denial
- Possibly: rejoin the zodiac as integrated aspects

## The Celestial Undercroft

### Structure

Beneath Stellara lies the cosmic machinery that maintains zodiac reality:

**The Descent:**
- Accessed through a reality-thin point in Sagittarius
- Long staircase that moves backward through time
- Each step shows a memory of zodiac suppression
- Party witnesses the creation of the Reversal

**The Machinery:**
- Vast cosmic gears and celestial clockwork
- Stars as physical objects
- Zodiac symbols in three dimensions
- The Retrograde Engine at the center

**The Retrograde Engine:**
- Massive mechanism controlling celestial motion
- The Reversal has inverted its operation
- Can be reset, destroyed, or modified
- Choice point for campaign resolution

**Reality Properties:**
- Belief shapes the environment
- Shadow aspects are visible and tangible
- Time is non-linear
- Integration and wholeness have power here

### The Reversal's Domain

The Reversal dwells in the heart of the Retrograde Engine:
- Chamber of twelve mirrors showing shadow zodiac
- Each mirror contains the suppressed aspect of a sign
- Breaking mirrors = destruction approach
- Accepting reflections = integration approach
- The Reversal will talk, explain, plead its case

## Magic System: Inverted Zodiac Sorcery

### Retrograde Magic Rules

All zodiac magic works backward in inverted kingdoms:
- Aries courage spells cause cowardice
- Taurus stability spells cause chaos
- Gemini communication spells enforce silence
- Cancer healing spells cause harm
- Leo inspiration spells cause despair
- Virgo precision spells cause mistakes
- Libra balance spells cause extremes
- Scorpio secrets spells reveal everything
- Sagittarius freedom spells create prisons
- Capricorn structure spells create anarchy
- Aquarius innovation spells enforce tradition
- Pisces dream spells force reality

**Learning Curve:**
- Party must learn to use inverted magic
- What hurts can heal, what heals can hurt
- Requires mental flexibility and creativity
- Mastering inverted magic helps understand shadows

### Cusp Magic

Cusp Children (like the party) have unique magic:
- Born between signs, they have dual nature
- Can access both a sign and its shadow
- More resistant to retrograde but not immune
- Can facilitate integration through their balanced nature

**Cusp Combinations:**
- Aries-Taurus: Courage with patience
- Taurus-Gemini: Stability with adaptability
- Gemini-Cancer: Communication with emotion
- Cancer-Leo: Nurturing with pride
- Leo-Virgo: Confidence with humility
- Virgo-Libra: Precision with balance
- Libra-Scorpio: Fairness with intensity
- Scorpio-Sagittarius: Depth with freedom
- Sagittarius-Capricorn: Adventure with discipline
- Capricorn-Aquarius: Tradition with innovation
- Aquarius-Pisces: Logic with intuition
- Pisces-Aries: Compassion with courage

### Shadow Integration Magic

When a zodiac lord accepts their shadow:
- New combined magic emerges
- More complex and powerful than original
- Requires accepting both light and dark
- Creates permanent change in zodiac system

## Timeline and Urgency

**Day 1 (Start of Retrograde):** Instant personality inversions
**Day 3:** Society begins breaking down
**Day 7:** New inverted norms establishing
**Day 14:** People forgetting original selves
**Day 21:** Campaign begins, memories very faded
**Day 25:** Warning signs of permanence
**Day 28:** Last chance for reversal
**Day 30:** Inversions become permanent and irreversible
**Day 31+:** If failed, forever retrograde

## Secrets and Hidden Lore

1. **The party is retrograde too:** They exhibit shadow aspects but balanced by cusp nature.

2. **Some people prefer retrograde:** Their shadows were better than their light.

3. **The zodiac lords knew this was coming:** Warnings were ignored.

4. **Integration was always the goal:** The Reversal believes this was necessary intervention.

5. **Destroying the Reversal is impossible:** It's part of the zodiac; suppressing it caused the problem.

6. **One lord has already integrated:** Hidden in plain sight, they're the only balanced one.

7. **The 30-day limit is artificial:** The Reversal set it to create urgency for choice.

8. **Cusp Children were born intentionally:** Some force knew retrograde was coming.

9. **This has happened before:** Ancient texts describe past retrograde events.

10. **Integration changes prophecy itself:** A new zodiac means a new future.

## Philosophical Core

The campaign explores Jungian shadow work: the idea that we must accept our rejected aspects to become whole. The zodiac lords represent archetypes trying to be perfect, but perfection requires rejecting parts of ourselves. The Reversal represents what happens when rejection accumulates.

**Central Question:** Is it better to be a clean archetype or a messy whole person?

**Answer:** The party decides through their actions and choices.
