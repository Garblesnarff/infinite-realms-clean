## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A two-act arc of humiliation and redemption through absurd training.

*   **Act I — The Fall and the Training (Sessions 1–6):** After being humiliated by Thunderleg and bringing shame to their school, the party is sent to train under Beggar So, who lives in squalor but knows the Eight Drunken Immortals style. Each session focuses on learning one of the eight forms through ridiculous and painful training methods: catching fish with their fingers, balancing on poles while being attacked, drinking while fighting, etc. The training is brutal, creative, and darkly comic.
*   **Act II — The Rematch (Sessions 7–10):** The party returns for a rematch with Thunderleg, now armed with their unconventional drunken style. They must use creativity, environmental awareness, and their absurd training to defeat an opponent who uses textbook-perfect traditional martial arts. The final battle showcases how flexibility and adaptation can overcome rigid perfection.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Eight Drunken Immortals Style**
*   Each of the eight forms grants a unique ability or bonus.
*   Players learn one form per session, gradually building a complete style.
*   Forms can be combined for greater effects.
*   Fighting while actually drunk (or pretending to be) grants additional bonuses but also disadvantages.

### 2. **Environmental Combat**
*   Jackie Chan-style use of environment as weapons and obstacles.
*   Any object can become a weapon: ladders, chairs, fish, pottery, lanterns.
*   Bonus damage for creative use of surroundings.
*   Combat encounters are designed with multiple interactive elements.

### 3. **Training Montage Mechanics**
*   Each training session is a skill challenge with increasing difficulty.
*   Failure means taking damage or exhaustion, but also comedic consequences.
*   Success unlocks the next form.
*   Can retry failed forms but Beggar So makes it harder.

### 4. **Physical Comedy**
*   Combat includes slapstick elements—slipping on oil, getting hit in embarrassing ways, exaggerated reactions.
*   These moments grant inspiration or other mechanical benefits.
*   Balances humor with actual danger.

### 5. **The Drinking Mechanic**
*   Characters can drink during combat to power up Drunken Style techniques.
*   Too much drinking imposes disadvantage on attacks but advantage on AC (unpredictable movement).
*   Finding the balance is key to mastering the style.
