# K-Pop Idol Academy - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic:** Hyper-polished perfection with cracks showing. Every surface gleams, every outfit coordinates, every smile is practiced. But underneath: exhaustion, pain, and humanity struggling to break through.

**Visual Influences:**
- K-Pop music videos (BTS, BLACKPINK, EXO, TWICE)
- Korean variety shows
- Dystopian perfect societies (Brave New World meets K-Drama)
- Idol training documentaries
- Cyberpunk neon cities

## Color Palettes

**The Academy:** Clinical whites (#FFFFFF), metallic silvers (#C0C0C0), soft pastels
**Performance Spaces:** Vibrant neons, coordinated group colors, holographic effects
**Underground:** Darker, grittier, authentic colors vs. manufactured shine
**The Perfection:** Uncanny valley perfection—too smooth, too bright, slightly off

## Music and Sound Design

**Training Montages:** Upbeat K-Pop (BTS "Fire" energy)
**Performances:** Full K-Pop production with synchronized choreography
**Emotional Moments:** Ballads (IU, Taeyeon style)
**Tension:** Glitchy electronic when Protocol appears
**Battle:** EDM-influenced K-Pop

**Each player/NPC has theme reflecting their concept:** Cute, girl crush, dark, bright, retro, etc.

## Voice Direction

**Luna the Eternal:** Wise but weary, Korean-accented English
**The Perfection Protocol:** Artificial, auto-tuned, unsettling
**Mentor:** Caring but strict, knows the cost
**Crystal:** Competitive but eventually sympathetic
**Diamond:** Desperate for perfection, tragic

## Cinematic Moments

**Session 1:** First performance, camera work like K-Pop MV
**Session 9:** Transformation scene, horror realization
**Session 15:** Truth broadcast, cutting between performance and revelation
**Session 30:** Final bow, players choose their future
