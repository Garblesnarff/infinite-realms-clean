# Creative Brief: Oath of the Forgotten

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Melancholic Fantasy Realism

Inspired by works like The Ancient Magus' Bride and The Faraway Paladin itself, combining beautiful melancholy with moments of warmth. This style aims to capture the bittersweet beauty of ruins, the gentle love of an undead family, and the journey from twilight into light.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Beauty in Decay:** Ruins should be hauntingly beautiful, not just destroyed. Nature reclaiming civilization, gentle twilight, quiet sadness.
*   **Warmth Despite Darkness:** The undead family should feel loving despite their skeletal/ghostly/mummified forms. Gentle lighting in domestic scenes.
*   **Sacred and Solemn:** Divine moments should feel genuine and awe-inspiring. Grace should be beautiful and terrible, light that transforms.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Melancholic, bittersweet, heartwarming, sacred, gentle, twilight, growth, love, sacrifice, grace, solemn.
*   **Feeling:** A gentle sadness mixed with warm love. The atmosphere should feel like a beautiful sunset—ending, but glorious. Quiet moments matter more than grand spectacles.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Soft, detailed linework for organic elements (nature, cloth, ghosts); sharper lines for architecture and skeletons. Gentle, flowing forms.
*   **Forms:** Ruins that maintain their original beauty despite decay. Characters with expressive body language that conveys emotion despite inhuman features. Architecture that suggests former grandeur.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed fantasy illustration of an ancient skeleton knight in ceremonial armor, teaching a young human to use a sword. The linework is gentle and detailed, showing the skeleton's careful, fatherly body language. The scene is touching despite the undead mentor."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by twilight tones—soft purples, deep blues, warm golds from setting sun. Nature in muted greens and browns. Divine light in pure white and gold.
*   **Ruins:** Stone grays and browns, weathered and overgrown with greenery. Eternal twilight creates purple-blue atmospheric lighting.
*   **Family Scenes:** Warm golden candlelight, soft magical glows, creating cozy spots in the darkness.
*   **Divine Moments:** Pure radiant golds and whites, sometimes overwhelming the gentler twilight colors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of soft twilight purples and deep blues, with warm golden candlelight creating a cozy glow. The ruins are weathered gray stone with overgrown green vines. The atmosphere is melancholic but warm."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** The undead family should look weathered and ancient, but their body language conveys love and gentleness. The party grows from children to young adults over the campaign.
*   **Blood:** Skeleton knight in ancient, battered armor. Stands tall and proud. His skull somehow conveys expression through posture and the glow of his eye sockets.
*   **Mary:** Translucent ghost in flowing priestess robes. Gentle face, sad but kind eyes. She glows softly with moonlight.
*   **Gus:** Mummy wrapped in aged bandages, with kind eyes visible. Wears scholarly robes over his wrappings. Often hunched over books.
*   **Expression:** Despite inhuman features, emotions should be clear through posture, gesture, and atmosphere.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A ghost woman in flowing white priestess robes, translucent and glowing with soft moonlight. Her face is gentle and sad, with kind eyes. She's singing a lullaby to young children sleeping nearby. The scene is touching and maternal despite her spectral nature."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Ruins reclaimed by nature, beautiful in their decay. Eternal twilight creates atmospheric lighting. Sacred places glow with divine presence.
*   **Atmosphere:** Quiet, contemplative, timeless. The City of the Dead feels frozen in a eternal moment between day and night.
*   **Details:** Crumbling stone architecture showing former beauty, flowering vines growing over ruins, broken statues still graceful, old fountains now still, scattered remnants of lost lives.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ancient ruined city at eternal twilight, with crumbling stone buildings reclaimed by flowering vines and moss. A broken fountain sits in a courtyard where a skeleton knight teaches a child swordplay. The sky is deep purple-blue with the last light of sunset. Beautiful and melancholic."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, atmospheric lighting. Heavy use of twilight ambiance, gentle glows, and atmospheric perspective.
*   **Light Sources:** Eternal twilight from the sky, candlelight and lanterns for warmth, Mary's ghostly glow, divine radiance in sacred moments.
*   **Shadows:** Soft, gentle shadows that create depth without menace. Twilight means there are no harsh contrasts except in divine moments.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...softly lit by eternal twilight, creating gentle purple-blue ambient light. Warm golden candlelight from windows creates inviting glows. Long soft shadows add depth. The lighting is atmospheric and melancholic, gentle rather than harsh."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Focus on intimate moments and emotional beats. Wide shots show the beauty of ruins. Close-ups show expressions and gentle touches.
*   **Techniques:** Use architecture to frame characters. Show scale through environmental details. Contrast small figures against vast ruins. Center sacred moments.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide composition showing an ancient ruined city at twilight, with three small figures (skeleton, ghost, mummy) standing with young children in a courtyard, looking up at the stars together. The ruins frame them, emphasizing both the vastness of the dead city and the warmth of the family moment."

## Emotional Beats:

*   **Domestic Life:** Should feel cozy and loving despite the undead nature. Candlelight, shared meals (even if ghosts cooking is impossible), teaching moments, bedtime stories.
*   **Training Moments:** Show progression and growth. The pride of mentors watching students improve. Physical comedy mixed with genuine skill development.
*   **Divine Moments:** Overwhelming and beautiful. Radiant light, sacred atmosphere, sense of something greater than mortals.
*   **Final Goodbye:** Heartbreaking but hopeful. Figures fading into light, embraces that can barely touch, tears and smiles together.

## Voice

A deep, warm male voice that carries both age and gentleness. The tone is that of a grandfather telling a treasured story by firelight—soft, measured, touched with sadness but also deep love. Pacing is slow and deliberate, with meaningful pauses that let emotions breathe. The emotion is bittersweet—mixing sorrow with joy, ending with hope. Audio quality is pristine but with a very subtle, warm reverb suggesting a cathedral or ancient hall. Role: A loving mentor narrating the story of children who became heroes, knowing how it ends but treasuring every moment.
