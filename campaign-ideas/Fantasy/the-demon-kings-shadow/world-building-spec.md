## Dharmic Complexity

**Rama's Hard Choices:**
- Kills Vali from hiding (against warrior code but dharmic because Vali is adharmic ruler)
- Tests Sita's purity (unfair but socially demanded)
- Later banishes pregnant Sita based on rumors (Uttara Kanda, optional epilogue)

- Greatest Shiva devotee
- Unparalleled scholar
- Never forces himself on Sita (has curse preventing it)
- Dies acknowledging Rama's divinity
- Tragic villain, not pure evil

**The Question:** Is following dharma always right? What if dharma demands cruelty?

## Causality Chains

**Ravana's Doom:**
1. Insults sage Narada
2. Told only way to die gloriously is fighting Vishnu
3. Decides to make Vishnu incarnate by becoming so evil God must descend
4. Kidnaps Sita specifically to force confrontation
5. Gets his wish—death by divine hands
6. Achieves moksha (liberation)

**Bridge Construction:**
1. Ocean won't cooperate
2. Rama threatens to destroy ocean with divine arrows
3. Varuna appears, terrified, suggests alternative

**Sri Lanka:** Lanka identified with modern Sri Lanka
**Rama Setu:** Adam's Bridge, actual geological formation between India and Sri Lanka

The campaign asks: **Can perfect righteousness exist in imperfect world?**
Rama must be perfect, but perfection sometimes requires cruelty. Duty demands sacrifice.
