# Scale Shift Awakening - World Building Specification

## Growth Timeline

**Day 1** (Session 1): 28mm (miniature standard) - Awakening
**Day 3** (Session 3): 2 inches - Noticeable growth
**Day 5** (Session 5): 6 inches - Can no longer use table terrain properly
**Day 7** (Session 7): 1 foot - Child-sized, serious problem
**Day 10** (Session 10): 2 feet - Adolescent-sized
**Day 12** (Session 12): 4 feet - Nearly human teen
**Day 14** (Session 14): 6 feet - Full human scale

**Implications**: Each size brings new challenges, opportunities, dangers

## Wargame Programming

Miniatures have:
- **Combat Protocols**: Instinctive battle knowledge
- **Faction Loyalty**: Programmed to fight enemies
- **Heroic Mindset**: Die gloriously, never surrender
- **Tactics**: Real strategic knowledge (Marcus studied actual warfare)
- **No Civilian Skills**: Don't know peace, compromise, daily life

**Crisis**: As consciousness grows, programming conflicts with reality

## The Painted vs. The Awakened

**Painted** (Majority): Still puppets, moved by Marcus, no consciousness
**Awakened** (Players + NPCs): 5-10 miniatures blessed by Sarah
**Dynamic**: Watching yourself as puppet (painted) vs. being free

**Horror**: Realizing you were unconscious puppet for years

## Magic Instability

Sarah's spell is amateur-hour witchcraft, glitching:
- **Growth**: Unintended side effect
- **Consciousness**: Meant to be temporary
- **Variation**: Affects miniatures differently
- **Reversal Risks**: Might kill consciousness, might fail, might make worse

## Marcus's Dilemma

**Emotions**:
- Terror (armed warriors in his home)
- Guilt (played with sentient beings)
- Wonder (impossible magic real)
- Responsibility (they're his creation)
- Love (he painted, cared for them)

**Options**:
- Help them adapt to human world
- Help Sarah reverse spell
- Contact authorities (dangerous for miniatures)
- Hide them (impossible as they grow)

## Real World Threats

As miniatures grow:
- **Parents**: Marcus's family discovers them
- **Authorities**: Armed warriors appearing triggers response
- **Media**: Viral video potential
- **Military**: Interest in combat-ready beings
- **Public**: Fear of unknown

## Faction Dynamics

**Space Marines**: Disciplined, struggling with lack of mission
**Orks**: Adapting well (they love fighting, now it's real!)
**Elves**: Tactical, seeing opportunity
**Chaos**: Some awakened miniatures are literal demons (problem)
**Tyranids**: Alien hive mind miniatures (completely confused)

Different factions adapt differently to consciousness

## Identity Paths

**Embrace Warrior**: Accept combat nature, become mercenaries/soldiers
**Seek Peace**: Learn civilian life, integrate
**Return to Toy**: Choose unconsciousness (if possible)
**New Purpose**: Find different reason to exist
**Destroy Self**: Can't handle consciousness (dark option)

## Reversal Ritual

Sarah's plan:
1. Research original spell
2. Gather magical components
3. Perform counter-spell
4. Hope it works

**Complications**:
- Requires miniatures' consent
- Might be permanent
- Could kill them
- May only stop growth, not reverse
- Timeline: Must complete before Day 14

## Human Scale Implications

At full size:
- **Armor**: Real protection, military-grade
- **Weapons**: Actually lethal (bolters = firearms)
- **Skills**: Trained warriors with superhuman paint job abilities
- **Biology**: Unclear (do they need food? sleep?)
- **Legal Status**: Not human, not animal, undefined
- **Housing**: Where do warrior beings live?

## Victory Scenarios

**Integration**: Adapt to human world, find peaceful purpose
**Stabilization**: Magic stabilized at intermediate size, find niche
**Reversal**: Return to miniatures (lose consciousness but alive)
**Transformation**: Become something new (human-miniature hybrid)

## Defeat Scenarios

**Violent Outcome**: Conflict with humans, miniatures hunted/destroyed
**Lost Identity**: Lose warrior selves, become hollow humans
**Reversal Death**: Counter-spell kills consciousness
**Corruption**: Chaos miniatures corrupt others, horror unleashed

## Philosophical Questions

- Is consciousness gift or curse?
- Can warrior find peace?
- Is purpose fixed or chosen?
- What responsibility does creator have?
- Can toys become real people?

## Campaign Tone

Balance between:
- Absurdist (tiny warriors growing)
- Philosophical (identity, purpose)
- Dramatic (real stakes, real growth)
- Action (they ARE warriors)
- Heartfelt (Marcus and Sarah care)

Final sessions should feel like:
- Coming of age story (toys becoming people)
- Crisis resolution (solve growth/consciousness)
- Moral reckoning (what is right choice?)
