## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of racing glory, item chaos, and saving the spirit of competition.

*   **Act I — Rookie Cup Challenge (Sessions 1-6):** The party joins the Mushroom Cup as rookie racers, learning to master their karts and magical items. They compete in local circuits, face veteran racers, and discover that someone is sabotaging races with cursed items. Their investigation leads them to the Banana Gang—a crime syndicate rigging races for profit.
*   **Act II — The Special Cup Circuit (Sessions 7-13):** Now recognized racers, the party advances to elite tracks across the kingdoms. They compete on Rainbow Road, navigate ghost-haunted circuits, and race through the Bowser Kingdom's lava tracks. The conspiracy deepens—the Banana Gang serves a mysterious sponsor who seeks to control all racing magic. The party must win races while investigating.
*   **Act III — The Grand Star Championship (Sessions 14-20):** The sponsor is revealed as the King of Karts, an ancient racer who was banned centuries ago for cheating with dark star magic. He's returned to challenge the greatest racers for control of the Grand Prix Trophy—an artifact maintaining balance between kingdoms. The party must compete in the ultimate circuit, master legendary items, and defeat the King in a reality-bending final race where the track itself shifts based on who's winning.
