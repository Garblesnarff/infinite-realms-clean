**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Beast's curse isn't punishment for vanity but a deliberate transformation weapon created by an enchantress who turns cruel nobles into monsters and traps them in their castles, feeding on the despair when true love fails to manifest before the last rose petal falls. The party, hired to rescue Belle who vanished into the enchanted castle, discovers she's not a prisoner seeking escape but a scholar studying the curse who believes she can break the cycle affecting hundreds of transformed nobles across the kingdom. They must navigate a castle full of servants transformed into objects who are slowly losing their humanity, confront the enchantress who sees herself as justice incarnate, and decide whether the Beast deserves redemption or if some cruelties can't be loved away.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act Gothic romance where love might not conquer all.

*   **Act I — The Enchanted Prison (Sessions 1–4):** Belle's father Maurice returns from the castle traumatized, claiming his daughter is prisoner of a monster. The party ventures to rescue her but finds Belle living relatively freely, researching curse-breaking in the castle's library. The Beast is genuinely monstrous—physically transformed but also struggling with bestial instincts and rage. Enchanted servants (transformed into furniture and household objects) beg the party to help break the curse before they lose themselves completely. Early investigation reveals the enchantress cursed multiple nobles.

*   **Act II — The Weight of the Past (Sessions 5–8):** They discover the Beast's pre-curse history—he was Prince Adam, genuinely cruel and vain, who mistreated peasants and servants without remorse. The enchantress appeared as beggar woman to test him, and his failure was predictable. Belle is conflicted—she sees glimpses of redemption but also his monstrous nature emerging. The rose timer is revealed—each petal that falls makes one transformation permanent. They learn of other cursed nobles: some became worse monsters, some found redemption, most withered in despair. The enchantress still watches.

*   **Act III — The Beast's Choice (Sessions 9–12):** The party learns the curse was designed to be almost impossible to break—who could genuinely love someone who imprisoned their father? The enchantress believes nobles are irredeemable and uses the curse to prove it. Belle argues that people can change if given the chance. They discover the Beast is genuinely changing but also that his bestial nature is winning—he's becoming permanent monster not because time runs out but because transformation is consuming his humanity. Previous "successes" at breaking curses are revealed to be compromises—the nobles became better but never fully human again.

*   **Act IV — The Last Petal (Sessions 13–16):** The final rose petal is falling. The party must choose: help Belle break the curse through declared love (risking it's false and everyone transforms permanently), kill the Beast (saving servants but confirming enchantress's worldview), confront the enchantress (potentially ending all curses but she's incredibly powerful), or find alternative redemption not based on romantic love. The enchantress arrives for final judgment, servants are transforming into true objects, and the Beast must choose between clinging to humanity or accepting monstrosity. Success means finding middle ground where redemption doesn't require romance, punishment doesn't require transformation, and justice doesn't require cruelty.

## Central Conflict

Redemption versus punishment and whether love can or should cure all wounds. The Beast was genuinely cruel—he hurt people without remorse—but the curse transforms him into literal monster potentially forever. The enchantress believes cruel nobles deserve their fates and that true change is impossible. Belle represents hope that people can grow beyond their worst selves. The party must weigh whether redemption requires romantic love (problematic given imprisonment dynamics), if punishment through transformation is justice or cruelty, and whether breaking one curse means absolving genuine wrongs. The servants suffer for their master's crimes, adding innocent victims to moral calculation.
