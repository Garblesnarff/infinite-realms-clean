### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Curse of Thorns and Roses**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When the party ventures to rescue Belle from an enchanted castle, they discover the Beast's transformation curse is a deliberate punishment created by an enchantress who tests cruel nobles across the kingdom, and that Belle freely stays to research curse-breaking while servants slowly lose their humanity transforming into objects as an enchanted rose counts down petals until all transformations become permanent.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Prince Adam's pre-curse cruelty and what he did to deserve punishment
    *   Explain the enchantress's origin and her mission to punish cruel nobility
    *   Describe the mechanics of the transformation curse and why it's designed to fail
    *   Write about the rose timer and what each falling petal means for transformations
    *   Detail the curse's conditions—true love breaking it—and why that's nearly impossible
    *   Explain how servants were transformed into household objects and stages of losing humanity
    *   Describe other cursed nobles across the kingdom and their various fates
    *   Write about Belle's background and why she chose to stay researching curse-breaking
    *   Detail the complexity of love developing in imprisonment context
    *   Explain the enchantress's ongoing monitoring and judgment of cursed nobles

**5. Location Blueprints**

*   **The Gallery of Mirrors** - Showing Beast's true face and all other transformation victims
*   Each location represents different aspects of curse, redemption, and losing humanity

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the last rose petal falls THEN all transformations become permanent forever
*   IF true love is declared genuinely THEN curse might break for castle residents
*   IF Belle is forced to love Beast THEN curse cannot break (love must be freely given)
*   IF Beast dies THEN servants remain objects permanently
*   IF servants fully transform THEN they lose consciousness becoming true objects
*   IF the enchantress is confronted THEN she might adjust curse terms or defend her judgment
*   IF Beast's pre-curse cruelty is revealed fully THEN redemption becomes questionable
*   IF alternative curse-breaking is found THEN romantic love requirement might be bypassed
*   IF the village mob attacks THEN Beast's bestial nature might win over humanity
*   IF other cursed nobles are contacted THEN different redemption approaches are revealed
*   IF Belle leaves voluntarily THEN curse countdown accelerates
*   IF Beast releases Belle freely THEN that selflessness might be curse-breaking moment
*   IF enchantress's motives are understood THEN negotiation becomes possible
*   IF servants' transformation is reversed THEN they remember everything they experienced as objects
*   IF curse breaks THEN all other enchantress-cursed nobles face judgment based on precedent
