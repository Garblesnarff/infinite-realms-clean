### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the war-torn realm of the Five Great Villages, powerful shinobi clans master elemental arts and house Nine Sealed Beasts within chosen vessels. Young shinobi from rival villages must overcome generations of hatred to prevent the Akatsuki—a rogue organization—from capturing all beast vessels and unleashing the primordial Ten-Tails. Through bonds forged in battle, they will determine whether the shinobi world finds peace or endless war.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player uses Jinchuriki transformation abilities.
    *   **THEN:** Their beast form grows more pronounced and harder to control. Generate a scene where they must make a Wisdom save or the beast takes over temporarily, attacking friend and foe alike. NPCs react with increased fear or awe.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully protects a Jinchuriki from Akatsuki capture.
    *   **THEN:** That Jinchuriki becomes a loyal ally and teaches the party to access beast chakra. However, the Akatsuki escalates their tactics, attacking with larger forces and more deadly members.
    *   **IF:** The party exposes the Akatsuki's true plan to the Five Villages.
    *   **THEN:** The villages begin forming the Shinobi Alliance, pooling resources and intelligence. However, paranoid elders demand all Jinchuriki be secured or executed for safety, forcing the party to choose sides.
    *   **IF:** A party member learns Sage Mode successfully.
    *   **THEN:** They gain powerful abilities but must meditate regularly to maintain balance. If they skip meditation, natural energy petrifies them temporarily. NPCs recognize them as a legendary-tier warrior.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats multiple Akatsuki members, capturing their rings.
    *   **THEN:** The Akatsuki leader Pain appears personally to test the party. If they survive, he shares his tragic philosophy about bringing peace through shared suffering, potentially swaying party member loyalties.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to execute the Jinchuriki member to prevent Akatsuki's plan.
    *   **THEN:** The Akatsuki's plan is delayed but not stopped. The party loses access to beast chakra abilities and suffers morale penalties. One member may leave the party in disgust. Villages praise them but guilt haunts their dreams.
    *   **IF:** The party protects their Jinchuriki friend and defies the villages.
    *   **THEN:** They become rogue ninja hunted by their former homes. However, they gain powerful Jinchuriki allies and the moral high ground. This leads to the alliance forming around them instead of the Kage.
    *   **IF:** During the final battle, the party performs the ultimate sealing jutsu.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a dramatic sacrifice moment where the Jinchuriki member can either seal the Ten-Tails at the cost of their life, or the entire party channels their chakra together, each losing some power permanently but all surviving. The choice determines the epilogue's tone.
