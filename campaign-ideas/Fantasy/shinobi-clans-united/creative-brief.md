# Creative Brief: Shinobi Clans United

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dynamic Anime Action with Elemental Effects (Naruto/Avatar-inspired)

Inspired by the kinetic combat and elemental mastery of *Naruto* and the fluid martial arts and visual effects of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. This style captures the intense ninja action, powerful jutsu effects, bonds of friendship, and the distinctive aesthetic of hidden shinobi villages where young warriors train to master elemental powers.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Motion and Impact:** Scenes should convey speed, power, and the dramatic moments of ninja combat with blurred motion lines, dynamic poses, and environmental destruction
*   **Elemental Visual Language:** Each element (Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Lightning) has a distinct visual signature with particles, energy flows, and environmental interaction
*   **Expressive Characters:** Characters wear distinctive shinobi gear and use exaggerated, expressive body language to convey emotion and determination
*   **Hidden Village Aesthetics:** Architecture blends traditional Japanese design with fantastical elements—massive gates, hidden training grounds, and dramatic natural settings

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dynamic, heroic, elemental, brotherhood, determination, ninja action, sacrifice, coming-of-age, village pride, ancient power
*   **Feeling:** High-energy combat mixed with moments of deep emotional connection. The weight of responsibility and the power of friendship. Ancient traditions meeting youthful innovation.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, bold linework with strong silhouettes for characters. Motion lines and speed effects during action. Sharp angles for dramatic moments, flowing curves for elemental effects
*   **Forms:** Characters have exaggerated proportions (slightly oversized hands/feet for combat emphasis). Clothing has flowing elements (scarves, cloaks) that trail dramatically. Elemental effects are organic and fluid.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic anime-style digital painting of a young shinobi mid-leap, their fist wreathed in crackling lightning chakra. Bold motion lines convey speed. Their headband gleams, village symbol prominent. Background shows the opponent's shocked expression as electricity arcs through the air."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and saturated colors for elements and energy effects, contrasted with more natural tones for environments and clothing
*   **Elemental Colors:** Fire (orange-red-yellow gradients), Water (blue-cyan-white), Earth (brown-gray-green), Wind (white-silver-pale green), Lightning (blue-white-purple)
*   **Village Themes:** Each village has signature colors—Fire Village (red/orange), Earth Village (red-brown), Lightning Village (white/blue), Water Village (blue/gray), Wind Village (tan/white)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant color palette with intense orange and red flames contrasting against deep blue water effects. The Fire Village's red-roofed buildings frame the background. Bright chakra auras glow around the combatants—one blue, one crimson."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Anime proportions with distinctive shinobi gear—headbands with village symbols, kunai pouches, scrolls, tactical vests over traditional clothing
*   **Ninja Aesthetic:** Characters show their personality through outfit customization while maintaining village identity. Scars, bandages, and battle damage tell stories
*   **Signature Elements:** Each character has a signature color scheme and visual motif reflecting their element or personality
*   **Beast Forms:** Jinchuriki transformation states show partial animal features—tails, claws, glowing eyes, chakra cloaks with beast-like shapes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A determined young shinobi with spiky dark hair and a scarred headband bearing the Leaf Village symbol. They wear an orange and black jacket over mesh armor, kunai holsters on their legs. Multiple fox-like chakra tails made of golden energy swirl behind them, and their eyes glow red with slit pupils."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Hidden villages nestle in dramatic natural settings—massive trees, rocky mountains, desert canyons, misty islands
*   **Architecture:** Traditional Japanese buildings with fantastical scale—enormous gates, mountain-carved faces, underground training facilities
*   **Battle Arenas:** Training grounds show environmental destruction—craters, scorch marks, shattered stone, water-filled pits
*   **Details:** Cherry blossoms, traditional lanterns, rope barriers, stone monuments, training posts, ancient sealing shrines
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Hidden Leaf Village at sunset, massive trees towering above traditional buildings with red and brown roofs. Carved stone faces of past leaders watch over the village from the mountain cliff. Training grounds in the foreground show craters and wooden posts. Cherry blossoms drift through the air."

**6. Jutsu and Combat Effects:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, oversized elemental effects that dominate the scene. Energy trails, particle effects, environmental interaction
*   **Hand Seals:** Characters weave complex hand positions, chakra visibly flowing around their hands
*   **Impact Frames:** Key moments of connection use high-contrast, simplified art with strong impact lines
*   **Elemental Interactions:** Fire evaporates water creating steam, wind feeds flames, earth blocks lightning, water conducts electricity
*   **Summons:** Massive creatures (toads, snakes, slugs, birds) appear in swirls of smoke and arcane symbols
*   **Prompt Example:** "A shinobi performs hand seals, blue chakra swirling around their hands. They exhale a massive water dragon jutsu—a serpentine form of rushing water and white foam that towers three stories high. The dragon's eyes glow cyan. Water droplets and mist fill the air. Their opponent counters with an earth wall jutsu rising from the ground, stone and soil erupting upward with trailing debris."

**7. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Bold cel-shading with dramatic shadows. Strong light sources from elemental effects (glowing flames, crackling lightning, radiant chakra)
*   **Chakra Glow:** Characters emanate colored light based on their element or emotional state. More intense during power-ups
*   **Atmospheric:** Dust particles in sunbeams, mist in training grounds, smoke from jutsu, lens flare from metal headbands
*   **Purpose:** Create dynamic contrast during combat, highlight emotional moments with dramatic lighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the orange glow of flames and blue lightning crackling between combatants. Strong cel-shaded style with deep shadows. Dust and smoke fill the air, backlit by the setting sun. Characters' chakra auras create halos of colored light around them."

**8. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic diagonal compositions for action, rule-of-thirds for character moments, low angles for power shots, high angles for vulnerable moments
*   **Techniques:** Speed lines radiating from action centers, floating debris to show impact, layered foreground/background for depth
*   **Iconic Moments:** Back-to-back allies facing overwhelming odds, dramatic silhouettes against sunsets, close-ups of determined eyes
*   **Team Formations:** Characters posed together showing their bonds—hands on shoulders, synchronized stances, combined jutsu
*   **Prompt Example:** "Wide cinematic shot from a low angle. Four shinobi stand back-to-back in a diamond formation on a crater-marked battlefield. Each glows with their elemental chakra—fire, lightning, water, wind. Surrounding them are dozens of enemies in shadow. The sky roils with storm clouds. Emphasis on their determined expressions and unified stance."

## Voice

A young, energetic voice full of determination and barely-contained excitement, like a teenage hero who refuses to give up. The pacing is quick and intense during action, slower and more emotional during character moments. The tone shifts between playful banter, serious determination, and raw emotion. There's an underlying theme of "never giving up" and "protecting precious people." The voice should convey both the lightness of youth and the weight of sacrifice. Slight breathlessness during intense moments. Role: The voice of the party's bond—their collective will and shared determination.
