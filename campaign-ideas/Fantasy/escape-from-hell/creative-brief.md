# Creative Brief: Escape from Hell

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Supernatural Noir with Infernal Edge (Sandman Slim-inspired)

Inspired by the ultra-violent urban fantasy of *Sandman Slim* where LA noir meets Hell's arena survivor with angelic conspiracies. This style captures scarred survivors, brutal combat, dimensional weirdness, and the dark glamour of supernatural LA.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scarred Survivor:** Battle damage, infernal modifications, someone who's been through Hell literally
*   **LA Noir with Supernatural:** Dark alleys, neon signs, hidden magical society, noir detective aesthetic
*   **Hell as Alien Realm:** Not Christian fire—bizarre alien dimension with strange rules
*   **Violence and Magic:** Raw, brutal combat combined with reality-warping powers

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Escaped from Hell, supernatural noir, brutal survivor, LA underworld, revenge, angelic conspiracy
*   **Feeling:** Someone made dangerous by trauma but retaining humanity. Violence as language. Noir aesthetic with cosmic horror.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **LA Noir:** Dark blues, blacks, neon highlights in red/pink/blue
*   **Hell:** Alien colors—purples, strange oranges, unnatural geometries
*   **Magic:** Reality distortion visible as color aberration and spatial warping
*   **Prompt Example:** "...Los Angeles alley at night, neon signs reflecting in wet pavement. A scarred survivor in black coat stands ready for violence. Purple-black hellfire flickers around their hands. Noir aesthetic with supernatural edge. Dark, dangerous atmosphere."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Protagonist:** Heavily scarred, black coat, practical clothes, weapons always visible, eyes seen too much
*   **Kasabian:** Disembodied head on shelf, still sarcastic somehow
*   **Candy/Jade:** Punk aesthetic, demon possession shows in subtle ways
*   **Prompt Example:** "A male survivor in black coat, face scarred from years of arena combat. Cold eyes that have seen Hell. Weapons holstered. Purple-black energy crackles around hands—infernal powers. Behind him, LA noir street. Dangerous, competent, barely human."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **LA Streets:** Noir aesthetic, neon, shadows, hidden doors to supernatural world
*   **Room 8:** Video store that's bigger inside, shelves that lead elsewhere
*   **Hell:** Alien landscape—impossible architecture, bizarre physics, arena visible
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of Room 8—video store with impossible geometry. Shelves extend beyond normal space. A disembodied head sits on counter. Through the back door, glimpses of other dimensions. Reality bends here. Supernatural LA safe house."

**5. Magic and Combat:**
*   **Hellion Powers:** Reality warping, supernatural strength, regeneration visible as wounds closing
*   **Brutal Combat:** Close quarters, knives, guns, magic as weapon
*   **Angelic/Demonic:** Divine and infernal powers clash, reality distorts
*   **Prompt Example:** "Brutal combat scene—protagonist fights demons in LA alley. Purple hellfire from their hands meets demonic energy. Close quarters knife work combined with reality-warping magic. Neon signs illuminate violence. Noir supernatural battle."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Noir Shadows:** High contrast, deep blacks, single light sources
*   **Neon Highlights:** LA neon providing colored illumination
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by single neon sign, creating noir shadows. The protagonist emerges from darkness, scarred face half-illuminated. Purple energy provides additional light source. Deep blacks and bright highlights. Supernatural film noir aesthetic."

## Voice

A hard-boiled, sarcastic voice masking trauma and rage. The pacing is quick and violent with dark humor. The tone shifts between noir narration, brutal combat description, and surprisingly philosophical moments. There's an underlying theme of surviving Hell and maintaining humanity. Profane but poetic. Role: The voice of someone who fought their way out of Hell.
