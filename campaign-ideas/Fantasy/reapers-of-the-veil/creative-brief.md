# Creative Brief: Reapers of the Veil

## Art Style: Supernatural Afterlife with Sword Spirits (Bleach-inspired)

Inspired by *Bleach*'s distinctive aesthetic blending samurai, Gothic, and supernatural elements with emphasis on sword transformations and spiritual energy visualization.

### Core Principles:

*   **Zanpakuto Transformations:** Dramatic weapon changes with unique designs per character
*   **Spirit Energy:** Visible colored auras and pressure waves
*   **Afterlife Aesthetic:** Soul Society blends feudal Japanese with Gothic architecture
*   **Hollow Design:** Bone-white masks, grotesque monster forms, hole in chest

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Soul Reapers:** Black kimono uniforms (shihakusho) with white haori for captains
*   **Spiritual Energy:** Each character has signature reiatsu color (blue, red, white, purple, etc.)
*   **Hueco Mundo:** Stark white and deep shadows, eternal night sky
*   **Hollows:** Bone white masks with red or yellow eyes

**Character Design:**
*   **Soul Reapers:** Black robes, zanpakuto at hip, captain haori with squad number
*   **Zanpakuto:** Each sword has unique design, some are katanas, others are scythes, staffs, or stranger forms
*   **Shikai Forms:** Dramatic transformations—swords split, extend, change element
*   **Bankai:** Massive changes—summoning armies, becoming armor, environmental effects

**Spiritual Effects:**
*   **Reiatsu:** Colored auras expanding from characters, pressure waves distorting air
*   **Flash Step:** After-images and motion blur
*   **Kido:** Numbered spells with geometric arrays and elemental effects
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Soul Reaper holding their katana vertical, calling its name. The blade glows white and splits into two identical swords as cherry blossom petals swirl around them. Pink-white reiatsu explodes outward in a pressure wave. Their eyes show fierce determination."

## Voice

A solemn yet determined voice carrying the weight of death and duty. Formal when discussing Soul Society, passionate when protecting friends. Theme of "protecting both the living and the dead" and "finding your own justice." Role: The voice of the boundary between life and death.
