# Concrete Dreams - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

### Art Direction

**Primary Aesthetic**: Dogtown and Z-Boys meets Street Fighter meets Avatar: The Last Airbender
- Gritty urban realism with supernatural elements bleeding through cracks
- Heavy graffiti presence—every surface tells a story
- Worn concrete, chipped paint, rust as badges of honor
- Earth spirit manifestations: Stone flowing like water, vines erupting through asphalt
- VHS skate video aesthetic mixed with magical realism

**Color Palette**:
- **Street Colors**: Concrete gray, rust orange, aged brick red, asphalt black
- **Crew Colors**: Each crew has signature palette (Pit Crew = blue/white, Arte Crew = rainbow spectrum, West Side = red/gold)
- **Spirit Colors**: Earth tones that glow—moss green, clay brown, sandstone yellow, obsidian black with inner light
- **Magic Effects**: Grinding creates elemental trails matching trick type

**Key Visual Motifs**:
- Layered graffiti showing history (tags on top of tags spanning decades)
- Cracks in pavement glowing with spirit energy
- Skateboards as totemic objects—unique designs, battle damage, stickers with meaning
- Motion blur and freeze-frame to capture tricks
- Urban decay contrasted with natural reclamation (plants through concrete)

### Environmental Design

**The Pit**:
- Empty swimming pools in various states of decay
- Graffiti masterpieces covering every surface
- Wooden improvised ramps and obstacles
- Spirit energy pooling in deep ends like water
- Sunset lighting creates long shadows perfect for dramatic sessions

**The Rails of Remembrance**:
- Endless industrial metal structures rusting but solid
- Memorial graffiti for fallen skaters
- Ghostly echoes of past sessions visible at night
- Dangerous drops into machinery below
- Orange rust contrasting with silver grinding patches

**Skyline Plaza**:
- Pristine corporate architecture—glass, steel, sharp angles
- Security cameras everywhere
- Perfectly smooth marble ledges (tempting targets)
- Rooftop gardens and gaps between buildings
- Sterile beauty hiding authoritarian control

**The Quarry**:
- Raw earth exposed, ancient and scarred
- Massive stone formations and dangerous drops
- Visible layers of geological history
- Spirit energy strongest here—rock formations shift subtly
- Dust and heat haze creating surreal atmosphere

**Underground Network**:
- Storm drains with graffiti glowing via bioluminescent paint
- Improvised lighting from stolen equipment
- Hidden shrines to skate legends
- Flowing water creating natural half-pipes
- Secret spots known only to initiated

## Audio Design

### Music Direction

**Soundtrack Vibe**: 90s/2000s skate punk and hip-hop with mystical undertones
- **Action**: Bad Religion, NOFX, Dead Kennedys, Rage Against the Machine
- **Emotional**: Atmosphere, Nujabes, Mos Def
- **Magical**: Tribal drums mixed with distorted guitars
- **Boss Fights**: Heavy metal with earth-shaking bass

**Dynamic Scoring**:
- Music layers add as tricks combo
- Landing tricks triggers musical "hits"
- Perfect grinds sustain melodic lines
- Bailing drops out all music except single sad string
- Sacred Grind moments get full orchestral swell

### Sound Effects

**Skateboarding Sounds**:
- Wheels on different surfaces (smooth concrete, rough asphalt, metal rails, wooden ramps)
- Board slapping ground after tricks
- Grinding metal-on-metal screeches
- Bearings clicking during rolls
- Grip tape scratching
- Board snapping (devastating sound)

**Magic Sounds**:
- Earth spirits rumbling like distant thunder
- Grind trails leaving tonal resonances
- Spirit manifestations: Stone cracking, vines growing (creaking), water flowing from concrete
- Trick magic: Each trick type has unique arcane sound
- Sacred Grind completion: Deep gong mixed with skateboard sounds

**Environmental Ambience**:
- Urban soundscape: Distant traffic, sirens, voices
- Wind through industrial structures
- Water dripping in underground
- Corporate plaza muzak and security announcements
- The Pit's acoustic echo chamber effect

**Emotional Cues**:
- Silence before attempting dangerous trick

## Tone & Atmosphere Summary

**Primary Feeling**: Authentic skateboard culture rebellion
**Secondary Feeling**: Spiritual awakening through sport
**Tertiary Feeling**: Found family against the world

The campaign should feel like a documentary about real skate culture that slowly reveals it's actually an epic fantasy. Keep it grounded—the magic emerges from genuine love of skating, not the other way around. Respect the culture, honor the history, and let the supernatural elements amplify rather than replace the authentic emotional core.

Every session should make players feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves, like they're writing themselves into a living history, like their tricks matter beyond the moment. This is about legacy, community, and fighting for the right to exist in spaces that weren't designed for you.

Make them feel the concrete under their wheels.
