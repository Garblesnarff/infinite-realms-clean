### **World-Building Specification Brief: Secrets of the Archives**

**Core Concept:** At the University, students master sympathy (binding magic), alchemy, artificing, and forbidden Naming while investigating the Chandrian—immortal beings who destroy all who know of them—risking becoming tragic legends themselves.

**Key Factions:**
- **The University Masters:** Teachers guarding knowledge and students, each with specialties and politics.
- **The Archives Librarians:** Guard dangerous knowledge, led by Master Lorren.
- **The Chandrian:** Seven immortals erasing all mention of themselves and their ancient crime.
- **The Amyr:** Legendary heroes (possibly still operating in secret) who committed atrocities "for the greater good."
- **Noble Houses:** Wealth and power, often cruel to poor students.

**Key Locations:**
- **The University:** Medieval academy with the Archives, lecture halls, student housing, Masters' quarters.
- **The Archives:** Vast underground library with banned sections.
- **Imre and the Eolian:** Town with legendary music hall.
- **Fae Realm:** Twilight world where time is strange and beings are beautiful and deadly.

**Magic Systems:**
- **Sympathy:** Binding similar things to transfer forces/energy. Requires Alar (mental strength). Creates heat from friction.
- **Naming:** Speaking true names to command reality. Requires quiet mind and deep understanding. Cannot be practiced deliberately.
- **Alchemy/Artificing:** Practical creation of magical items and compounds.

**Unique Mechanics:**
- Tuition economy forcing choices between study and survival.
- Sympathy binding with energy conservation and heat generation.
- Naming through achieving Sleeping Mind state.
- The Cthaeh curse ensuring tragic outcomes for those who speak to it.
- Investigation mechanics for researching Chandrian while avoiding their notice.
