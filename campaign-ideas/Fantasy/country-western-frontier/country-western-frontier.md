# Country Western Frontier
**Tagline:** *Where the honky-tonks are eternal and every road leads home*

## Campaign Overview

Welcome to The Endless Prairie, the Country Western Frontier—a dimension where country music shapes the land itself, where honky-tonks serve as power sources, and where every sunset lasts just long enough for one more song. This realm stretches infinitely in all directions: rolling plains, dusty towns, winding roads that always lead somewhere meaningful, and skies that shift between golden twilight and starlit night depending on the song playing.

In The Endless Prairie, life operates on country music logic: broken hearts literally break and must be mended, lost loves create phantom roads leading nowhere, drinking heals wounds but creates new ones, and mama's wisdom is actual magical prophecy. The dimension is ruled by The Grand Ole Council—twelve legendary country musicians representing different eras and sub-genres, from classic honky-tonk to modern stadium country. They maintain reality through The Song of the Open Road, an ever-evolving ballad about freedom, heartbreak, home, and the journey between them.

But paradise has thorns. The Council is deeply divided between Traditionalists who want to preserve classic country and Modernists who embrace pop-country evolution. Meanwhile, The Nowhere is spreading—empty spaces where no roads lead, no songs play, and travelers vanish into eternal loneliness. Worse, someone is stealing the Heartbreak Stones—crystallized emotions that power the honky-tonks and maintain reality. Players arrive as travelers from another dimension seeking refuge, only to find themselves caught in a conflict that threatens to silence the music forever.

## Core Themes
