## Location Details

### Nashville Prime
Capital city at dimension's heart. Eternal twilight. Grand Ole Opry dominates skyline. Council Hall shaped like giant guitar. Population ~500,000. Mix of all factions. Neutral ground mostly respected.

### The Last Chance Saloon
Iconic honky-tonk on major crossroads. Run by Dolly. All factions welcome. Best chicken fried steak in dimension. Stage where legends performed. Heartbreak Stone visible behind bar, pulsing with emotion.

### Traditional Heartland
~100 settlements preserving 1950s-60s aesthetic. Everything handmade. Technology limited. Music strictly classic country. Beautiful but restrictive. ~1 million residents.

### Modern Skyline
~50 stadium venues and production centers. Latest technology. Music fusing country with pop/rock. Exciting but commercialized. ~2 million residents.

### Outlaw Territory
Lawless frontier where rules don't apply. Individual freedom absolute. Dangerous but authentic. ~500,000 residents who choose freedom over safety.

### The Endless Highway
Literal endless road connecting everything. Always leads somewhere meaningful based on traveler's need. Can't get lost but can be late. Changes length based on journey's importance.

### The Nowhere
Expanding void where connection fails. Roads lead in circles. No sound. No color. Growing wherever division deepens. Will consume dimension if not healed.

## Historical Causality

### The First Song (200 years ago)
Dimension created by traveling musicians seeking freedom. Used country music to code reality. Based on simple values: honesty, hard work, home, journey, heartbreak, and healing. Initially perfect harmony.

### The Division Begins (100 years ago)
As population grew, different interpretations emerged. Some wanted to preserve original ways. Others wanted evolution. First factional split. Still friendly competition initially.

### The Commercial Era (50 years ago)
Modern country emerged. Crossover appeal. Money and fame entered equation. Traditionalists saw this as selling out. Modernists saw it as survival. Division deepened. Respect eroded.

### Hank's Disappearance (50 years ago)
Hank Williams vanished. Searched everywhere. Never found. Actually died of heartbreak, became The Nowhere. First empty spaces appeared. Blamed on various causes. Real cause unknown until now.

### The Current Crisis (Recent)
Heartbreak Stones stolen. The Nowhere expanding. Council divided. Civil war approaching. Players arrive at tipping point.

## Additional Lore

### Heartbreak Stones
Crystallized emotions from genuine heartbreak. Form naturally when someone truly hurts. Can be harvested ethically (with consent) or stolen (painfully). Power honky-tonks and magic. Limited supply. Very valuable.

### Country Magic System
Songs create effects based on emotion and authenticity. Ballads heal. Uptempo songs energize. Laments protect. Requires genuine feeling. Faking it fails. Best magic from real experience.

### The Honky-Tonk Haven
Special property of honky-tonks. Inside, wounds heal faster. Arguments resolve easier. Music sounds better. Powered by Heartbreak Stones. Safe havens in dangerous world.

### Road Trip Logic
Journey is as important as destination. Random encounters always meaningful. Campfire conversations reveal truth. The longer the road, the more you learn. Never truly lost, just taking longer way.

### Mama's Wisdom
Mothers in this dimension have minor prophetic powers. Their advice is magically insightful. "Mama knows best" is literal truth. Ignoring mama's wisdom brings bad luck.

### The Lonesome Debuff
Isolation in this dimension hurts physically. Being alone too long causes actual damage. Healed by community and connection. Mechanic reinforces country music's emphasis on togetherness.

### The Truth About Progress
Campaign's philosophical core: both sides are right and wrong. Tradition preserves wisdom but prevents growth. Innovation enables evolution but risks losing soul. Synthesis is ideal but difficult. No perfect answer, only continuous negotiation.

This world-building creates dimension where country music's themes—home, heartbreak, journey, and healing—are literal reality.
