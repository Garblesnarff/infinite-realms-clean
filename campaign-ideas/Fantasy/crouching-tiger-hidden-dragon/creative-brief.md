This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Elegant Wuxia with Ethereal Movement (Ang Lee-inspired)

Inspired by the breathtaking cinematography of *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*, with its graceful aerial combat, natural beauty, and emotional depth. This style captures the romantic, poetic quality of wuxia while grounding it in realistic historical settings and internal emotional conflict.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Graceful Motion:** Emphasize flowing, balletic movement in combat scenes, with characters defying gravity in elegant poses.
*   **Natural Beauty:** Showcase stunning landscapes—bamboo forests, desert vistas, misty mountains—as active participants in the story.
*   **Emotional Intimacy:** Balance action with quiet moments of longing, reflection, and romantic tension.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Graceful, romantic, melancholic, poetic, philosophical, restrained emotion, aerial freedom, tragic beauty.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of yearning and unfulfilled desire permeates every scene. Beauty is tinged with sadness, freedom with consequence. The aesthetic is refined and classical, emphasizing control and restraint.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Flowing, elegant lines for characters and movement. Natural elements rendered with delicate detail. Combat poses emphasize grace over brutality.
*   **Forms:** Slender, graceful character silhouettes. Robes that flow and billow. Landscapes with sweeping vistas and verticality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A watercolor-style digital painting in the aesthetic of wuxia cinema. A female warrior in flowing green robes mid-leap through a bamboo forest, her sword extended gracefully, hair streaming behind her."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, natural tones with occasional vibrant accents. Earth tones (browns, tans) for deserts, greens and grays for bamboo and mountains, rich jewel tones (jade green, deep blue) for aristocratic settings.
*   **Emotional Coding:** Warm tones for romance scenes, cool tones for duty and sadness, vibrant greens for freedom and nature.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of muted greens and soft grays for the bamboo forest, with morning mist diffusing the light. The warrior's robes are a vibrant jade green, the only saturated color in the scene."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Period-accurate Qing Dynasty clothing with flowing robes, elaborate hairstyles, and elegant weapons.
*   **Li Mu Bai:** Austere gray and blue robes, simple topknot, refined features showing age and weariness.
*   **Jen Yu:** Aristocratic gowns in rich colors (red, purple) for court scenes; practical warrior garb (green, brown) for action scenes. Hair transitions from elaborate pins to loose and free.
*   **Jade Fox:** Dark, practical clothing with subtle patterns suggesting age and cunning.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elegant female warrior in flowing crimson and gold aristocratic robes, hair adorned with jade pins, holding the legendary Green Destiny sword. Her expression is conflicted, yearning for freedom."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Stunning natural landscapes that serve as emotional mirrors for characters.
*   **Bamboo Forest:** Towering green stalks creating vertical lines, dappled light, leaves rustling in wind.
*   **Desert:** Vast, open spaces with red rock formations, suggesting both freedom and loneliness.
*   **Wudang Mountain:** Misty peaks with monastery buildings emerging from clouds, suggesting transcendence.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast bamboo forest on a misty morning. Towering bamboo stalks rise 100 feet into soft gray sky, their canopy filtering green-tinted light. The ground is carpeted with fallen leaves. The scene is serene but suggests hidden movement."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, natural lighting with emphasis on atmospheric effects—mist, dust, dappled sunlight.
*   **Aerial Scenes:** Rim lighting on characters mid-leap to emphasize their forms against sky or foliage.
*   **Emotional Scenes:** Soft, diffused light suggesting introspection and melancholy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by soft morning light filtering through bamboo leaves, creating dappled patterns on the warrior's face. Rim lighting outlines her form as she leaps, appearing almost weightless against the misty background."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Vertical compositions for aerial combat (showing the height of leaps), horizontal for landscapes (emphasizing vastness), intimate close-ups for emotional moments.
*   **Techniques:** Use of negative space to create breathing room, symbolic framing (characters framed by doorways, windows, or natural elements), rule of thirds for balanced scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vertical composition showing a warrior mid-leap between bamboo stalks, photographed from below to emphasize height. The bamboo creates natural framing lines leading the eye upward to the warrior's graceful form against white sky."

## Voice

A soft, contemplative voice with gentle pacing, like a scholar or philosopher reflecting on life's complexities. The tone carries deep emotion restrained by cultural propriety—sadness that doesn't become weeping, love that remains unspoken. There's a musical quality to the cadence, like classical Chinese poetry. Audio quality is warm and intimate, with subtle reverb suggesting open spaces. Role: A narrator reflecting on the story, or the voice of Li Mu Bai in his philosophical moments.

## Music & Sound Design

*   **Main Theme:** Traditional Chinese instruments (erhu, guzheng, dizi flute) creating melancholic, sweeping melodies.
*   **Action Themes:** Percussion builds tension, but even combat music retains grace—think dancing rather than battling.
*   **Romance Themes:** Solo erhu (Chinese violin) for longing and unfulfilled love.
*   **Desert Music:** Sparse, with wind sounds and occasional percussion suggesting isolation.
*   **Sound Effects:** Silk robes rustling, bamboo creaking and swaying, the distinctive *swoosh* of wire-fu movement, the crystalline ring of sword against sword, wind through mountain peaks.
