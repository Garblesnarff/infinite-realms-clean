## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

A four-act arc of pursuit, revelation, romance, and ultimate choice.

*   **Act I — The Theft (Sessions 1–4):** The Green Destiny is stolen from Li Mu Bai's estate. The party, hired as investigators or as Li's students, begin tracking the thief. Early clues point to the aristocratic Jen Yu, but the investigation reveals she had help from a mysterious desert bandit and a hidden master teaching her forbidden techniques.
*   **Act II — The Desert Romance (Sessions 5–9):** The trail leads to the Gobi Desert, where Jen Yu once spent time with Lo, a charismatic bandit chief. The party must navigate desert politics, bandit clans, and learn of the forbidden romance that drives Jen Yu's rebellion against her arranged marriage. They discover that Jade Fox, a criminal master, has been teaching Jen Yu in secret.
*   **Act III — Jade Fox's Revenge (Sessions 10–14):** The true antagonist emerges: Jade Fox, who was denied training by Li Mu Bai's master decades ago because she was a woman. She killed Li's master and stole the Wudang manual of secret techniques, but couldn't fully read it. She's been using Jen Yu to perfect these techniques while planning her final revenge against Li Mu Bai and the martial arts establishment.
*   **Act IV — The Choice (Sessions 15–20):** The climax occurs at Wudang Mountain, where all parties converge. Jen Yu must choose between love (Lo), duty (her arranged marriage), freedom (the warrior's path), or death (rejecting all). Li Mu Bai confronts Jade Fox, and the party must decide whether to enforce tradition or allow Jen Yu her freedom, knowing she wields the power of Green Destiny.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the tension between duty and desire, tradition and freedom, vengeance and forgiveness. The central conflict is whether individuals should sacrifice personal happiness for societal expectations, and whether those who are denied opportunity (like Jade Fox) deserve sympathy even when they turn to crime.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Wire-Fu Aerial Combat**
*   All characters gain enhanced jumping and aerial mobility, allowing combat in bamboo forests, across rooftops, and down cliff faces.
*   Characters can spend ki points or bonus actions to make "wire-fu leaps" of up to 60 feet, moving vertically or horizontally.
*   Falling damage is reduced for trained characters who know how to land gracefully.
*   Combat encounters are designed with three-dimensional terrain (bamboo tops, rooftops, cliff ledges).

### 2. **The Green Destiny Sword**
*   An artifact weapon that grants wielders enhanced abilities but also a burden.
*   Mechanically: +3 weapon, deals extra radiant damage, allows the wielder to cast certain spells.
*   Narrative: The sword "chooses" its wielder. In Jen Yu's hands it's powerful but chaotic; in Li Mu Bai's hands it's balanced; in Jade Fox's hands it rejects her.
*   Recovering the sword is the main quest, but deciding who should ultimately wield it is a moral choice.

### 3. **Romance and Relationship Mechanics**
*   The campaign tracks relationship scores between major NPCs (Li and Shu Lien, Jen and Lo, Jen and Li as student-master).
*   Party actions influence these relationships: supporting Jen's freedom raises her relationship with Lo, enforcing tradition raises it with Li.
*   The ending changes based on these relationship scores and who the party supports.

### 4. **Wudang Manual Techniques**
*   Throughout the campaign, the party can learn secret techniques from the stolen manual if they find pages.
*   These are represented as special maneuvers or ki abilities usable by monk and fighter classes.
*   Learning forbidden techniques has consequences: monastery monks distrust the party if they use stolen knowledge.

### 5. **Poison & Medicine**
*   Jade Fox's signature poison is a slow-acting toxin requiring Constitution saves over multiple sessions.
*   The party must seek rare ingredients for antidotes, creating side quests.
*   Medicine checks and herbalism proficiency become crucial skills.
