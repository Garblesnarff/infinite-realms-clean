## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Lightless Gardens
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Ecological Drama / Conservation vs. Exploitation / Druidic Conflict / Underground Ecosystem
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 16–24 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **12–13**
**Tone (keywords):** ecological, precious, balanced, threatened, political, natural, darkness-adapted
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Lightless Gardens are a miraculous underground ecosystem evolved over millions of years in complete darkness—strange flora and fauna adapted to the lightless void, maintained by a delicate balance. When the party is hired as guides for the Circle of Eternal Night (druids who protect the ecosystem), they discover a surface mining company has begun operations that are destroying unique species and disrupting the balance. Caught between the Circle's increasingly radical eco-terrorism, the mining company's profit-driven destruction, and local cave-dweller communities who depend on both for survival, the party must navigate ecological ethics, economic reality, and decide what—if anything—is worth destroying to protect.
