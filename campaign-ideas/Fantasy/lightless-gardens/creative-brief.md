# Creative Brief: Lightless Gardens

## Art Style: Dark Ecology meets Industrial Invasion

Inspired by deep cave ecosystems, Avatar's Pandora (but in darkness), eco-activist movements, and the contrast between natural beauty and industrial scarring. Emphasizes darkness-adapted life and the violence of light.

### Visual Principles:
* **Darkness as Natural**: Most scenes in complete darkness or minimal bio-luminescence.
* **Alien Beauty**: Creatures adapted to darkness—eyeless, pale, strange but magnificent.
* **Industrial Scarring**: Mining equipment and lights as invasive, almost violent presence.
* **Light as Weapon**: When light appears, it's painful and destructive to ecosystem.

### Color Palette:
Dominated by darkness—blacks and dark grays. Minimal bio-luminescence in cold blues and greens. Mining areas have harsh electric white and industrial yellow—unnatural and jarring. Druids use soft, minimal natural light.

### Character Design:
* **Druids**: Earth-toned, adapted to darkness, some with eyes evolved for lightless environment.
* **Miners**: Practical clothes, heavy equipment, bright headlamps that hurt to look at.
* **Cave Dwellers**: Pale, darkness-adapted, caught between two worlds.
* **Creatures**: Magnificent darkness-adapted fauna—eyeless fish, pale insects, unique species.

## Music Direction:
Quiet, minimal. Natural cave sounds—dripping water, creature movements, echo. When mining starts, harsh industrial noise invades. Druid music is whispers and natural percussion. Eco-terrorist moments have discordant intensity.

## Voice Acting:
Archdruid Nightbloom speaks with weary passion, losing hope. Director Copper-Vein isn't villainous—practical, defensive, has families depending on him. Shadow-Runner speaks with fanatical intensity. Elder Darkwhisper shows torn loyalties in every word.
