# Heavy Metal Hell
**Tagline:** *Where the riffs are eternal and the mosh pit never ends*

## Campaign Overview

Welcome to Infernum Rex, the Heavy Metal Hell—a dimension forged from distortion, rebellion, and pure sonic fury. This is not a metaphorical hell; it's a literal infernal realm where the laws of physics respond to power chords, where demons shred on flaming guitars, and where the weak are consumed by the eternal mosh pit. The sky burns with red lightning, volcanoes erupt to drum solos, and mountains of amplifiers stretch to the horizon, forever blasting the Symphony of Suffering.

In this realm, might makes right, but might is measured by your ability to ROCK. Warriors don't swing swords—they play solos that manifest as blade winds. Mages don't cast spells—they scream incantations that shatter reality. The social hierarchy is determined by Battle of the Bands competitions where losers are literally consumed by the crowd. Seven Demon Lords rule the seven regions, each representing a sub-genre of metal: Thrash, Death, Black, Doom, Power, Progressive, and Nu-Metal. They wage eternal war for supremacy, and the landscape is scarred by their conflicts.

Players arrive in Infernum Rex during the Millennium of Screams—a prophesied time when a mortal band will challenge the demon lords and either conquer hell or be destroyed utterly. The realm has recently been thrown into chaos by the assassination of Lord Metallicus, the Thrash Demon who maintained the balance of power. Now the remaining six lords scramble for control, and a mysterious force called the Silence is spreading through hell, turning eternal flames into cold ash and silencing the metal. The party must navigate this brutal world, forge alliances with demons, and ultimately decide whether to rule hell, save it, or destroy it completely.

## Core Themes

- **Power Through Performance:** Musical skill equals literal power; the best musician commands reality itself
- **Controlled Chaos:** Metal appears chaotic but has strict rules and codes of honor
- **Rebellion and Hierarchy:** Everyone fights authority, but everyone wants to be authority
- **Brotherhood in Battle:** Your bandmates are your family; loyalty unto death
- **Beautiful Destruction:** Finding artistry in violence, creation in obliteration
- **The Price of Fame:** Every bit of power costs something, often your humanity or sanity

## Unique Mechanics

### Metal Magic System

**Volume = Power:**
- Whisper: Cantrip equivalent
- Speaking: 1st-3rd level spells
- Shouting: 4th-6th level spells
- Screaming: 7th-9th level spells
- Beyond: Legendary effects that damage caster

**Genre Specialization:**
Players choose a metal sub-genre that determines their spell list and abilities:
- **Thrash:** Speed and aggression (haste, multi-attack, frenzy)
- **Death:** Undead and decay (necromancy, disease, corruption)
- **Black:** Cold and blasphemy (frost magic, anti-divinity, darkness)
- **Doom:** Slow power and despair (crushing damage, fear, time dilation)
- **Power:** Heroic might (buffs, summons, holy-but-evil magic)
- **Progressive:** Complexity and change (transmutation, time magic, meta-magic)
- **Nu-Metal:** Chaos and rage (wild magic, emotional manipulation, urban powers)

**Performance Casting:**
Instead of normal spellcasting, describe your musical performance:
- Quality of description affects power
- Musical knowledge (real-world) grants bonuses
- Can combine with allies for Band Magic
- Improvisation vs. prepared songs trade-off

### Combat as Concert

**Initiative = Tempo:**
- Each round has a time signature (4/4, 3/4, 7/8, etc.)
- Acting on strong beats grants advantage
- Off-beats create surprise but risk failure
- DM can change tempo mid-combat

**Stage Presence:**
New ability score/skill
- Affects NPC reactions
- Determines crowd reactions in battles
- Can intimidate or inspire
- Builds over campaign as fame increases

**Instrument Weapons:**
All weapons are instruments, all instruments are weapons:
- Guitar = Axe (slashing damage)
- Drums = Hammers (bludgeoning)
- Bass = Staff (bludgeoning/reach)
- Microphone = Whip (thunder damage)
- Keyboards = Crossbow (force bolts)

### Band Mechanics

**Unity Points:**
Pool shared by party, gained through:
- Successful collaborative performances
- Supporting each other in combat
- Making personal sacrifices for the band
- Defeating enemies together

**Spent for:**
- Combo attacks (multiple players attack as one)
- Perfect Harmony (auto-success on one check)
- The Power of Friendship (refuse death once per session)
- Genre Fusion (combine two members' specializations)

**Band Reputation:**
Tracked separately from individual fame:
- Determines NPC reactions to group
- Unlocks territory access
- Affects demon lord negotiations
- Can be positive or negative depending on actions

### Corruption and Redemption

**Infernal Corruption:**
Using hell's power corrupts the soul:
- Track Corruption Points (gained from demonic bargains, evil acts, dark magic)
- At certain thresholds, gain dark powers but lose humanity
- Manifests physically (demonic features grow)
- Can be reversed through redemption arcs

**Redemption Challenges:**
Special quests to reduce corruption:
- Acts of selfless heroism
- Resisting temptation
- Helping the damned
- Sacrificing power for principle

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **Player is Prophesied:** One PC is specifically named in the Millennium of Screams prophecy
2. **Demon Heritage:** One PC is actually part-demon, has family in hell
3. **Metallicus Lives:** The assassination was faked; he's building the Silence army
4. **Heaven's Plan:** Angels are helping the Silence to "mercy kill" hell's residents
5. **Hell is Prison:** Discover this dimension exists to contain something worse
6. **Band Betrayal:** One NPC ally is secretly working for a demon lord
7. **The Silence is Right:** Philosophical crisis—is eternal torment worse than oblivion?
8. **Home is Hell:** Players' home dimension is slowly becoming hell
9. **We Are the Lords:** Players are reincarnations of ancient demon lords
10. **The True Enemy:** The Silence isn't the real threat—something uses it as cover

## Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory:** Stop the Silence from consuming Infernum Rex
- Defeat or redeem Metallicus
- Perform the Eternal Concert successfully
- Make choice about hell's future

**Epilogue Rewards Based on Ending:**

- **Harmony:** Balance chaos and silence, become dimensional mediators

## Defeat Conditions

- Players are corrupted and become demon lords (bad ending)

- The Silence is defeated but spreads to other dimensions
- Band succeeds but loses their humanity completely

## Campaign Themes in Action

Heavy Metal Hell is about finding beauty in brutality, order in chaos, and meaning in noise. It explores whether eternal punishment is justice or cruelty, whether rebellion against tyranny matters when the rebels would become tyrants, and whether the end of suffering is worth the end of existence.

Players will face constant moral complexity: demon lords are evil but also victims, the Silence offers peace through oblivion, power requires corruption but powerlessness means victimhood. The ideal solution requires accepting that some dissonance is necessary—perfect silence and eternal screaming are both hells. The answer is the music itself: controlled chaos, beautiful violence, the eternal concert where even demons can find transcendence.

This campaign is loud, brutal, and unapologetically metal. But underneath the thunder and fury lies a surprisingly emotional core about found family, artistic expression, and whether anything matters in the face of entropy. The answer: it matters because we say it does, and we'll scream that truth until reality itself listens.
