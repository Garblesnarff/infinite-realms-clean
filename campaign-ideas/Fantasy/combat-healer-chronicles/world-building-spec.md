**Combat Healer Chronicles**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The kingdom of Aeloria summons heroes to defend against demon invasion, but traditional healing magic keeps healers in the rear while soldiers die. Commander Roswen Stormblade, a scarred veteran, recruits party members into her experimental Combat Healer Corps, teaching them to weaponize healing magic and fight on the front lines. Through brutal training and desperate battles, the party must prove that healers who fight where they're needed most can turn the tide of war.

    *   Write Roswen's backstory—her tragedy as a rear-line healer, her revolutionary philosophy, her struggles against tradition.

**7. Combat Healing Magic System**
*   **Philosophy:** Healing magic preserves life. Those who preserve life have greatest reason to defend it. Front-line positioning means being where you're needed most.

*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Overhealing:** Healing beyond max HP grants temporary HP. Represents pushing bodies past normal limits.
    *   **Healing Strike:** Melee spell attack that heals allies or harms fiends/undead. Weaponized life force.
    *   **Regenerative Armor:** Grant temporary HP that regenerates each turn. Sustained combat enhancement.
    *   **Vital Surge:** Reaction to boost ally's attack or save. Perfect timing support.
    *   **Life Burst:** Area heal allies/damage fiends simultaneously. Purifying life energy explosion.
    *   **Martyr's Stand:** Transfer damage from ally to self. Ultimate protective sacrifice.
    *   **Ultimate Technique - Undying Army:** Mass enhancement making entire force temporarily unstoppable.

*   **Training Requirements:** Brutal physical conditioning, learning to heal while taking damage, overcoming traditional doctrine, mastering tactical medicine.

*   **Costs:** Spell slots as normal, but positioning risks, exhaustion from overuse, moral weight of combat decisions.

**8. The War Timeline**
*   **30 Years Ago:** Demon rift opens in Blasted Wastes. Initial incursions defeated.
*   **25 Years Ago:** Demons grow stronger. First major cities fall. Aeloria mobilizes.

*   **Phase 3 - Proving:** Final test keeping NPCs alive under overwhelming assault. Graduation or repeat training.
*   **Ongoing Development:** Between battles, research personal techniques combining class abilities with combat healing.

**10. The Demon Threat**
*   **Nature:** Corrupted beings from lower planes, seeking to destroy life and spread darkness.
*   **Malakor the Desolate:** General leading invasion. Views healers as cowards hiding behind warriors. Shocked when party fights back.
*   **Demon Types:** Shock troops (fast, deadly), Corrupted (ex-humans), Spellcasters (necrotic magic), Siege Beasts (massive destroyers).
*   **Tactics:** Overwhelming numbers, targeting healers first, corruption magic preventing healing.
