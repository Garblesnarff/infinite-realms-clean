### Origin Myth
The world is a machine. An impossibly complex, continent-sized "Divine Construct" built by forgotten creator-gods. Its purpose is to generate and observe the endless cycle of life and civilization. But like any machine, it requires maintenance. Every ten thousand years, the Construct becomes "cluttered" with the detritus of history, magic, and mortal ambition. When this happens, it initiates a "defragmentation protocol" to scour the system clean. This protocol is the Calamity, a being of pure, destructive energy that manifests with the sole purpose of resetting civilization to a baseline state. Ten thousand years ago, a hyper-advanced civilization, the Sheikah, discovered the world's true nature. They attempted to "hack" the system, building four colossal "Divine Beasts" and a legion of autonomous "Guardians" to fight the Calamity. They chose a peerless warrior, the Hero, and a princess with the blood of the creator-gods to command this defense. They failed. The Calamity, a learning program, "hacked" their machines back, turning them against their masters. In a last, desperate act, the princess sealed the Calamity and herself in the central castle, while the dying Hero was placed in a "Shrine of Resurrection"—not a healing device, but a stasis pod designed to preserve him as a "system restore point" for the world's operating system. One hundred years have passed. The Hero is now awake, but the seal is weakening, and the Calamity has had a century to study its enemy and adapt.

### Timeline
1.  **The Great Construction (The Beginning):** The creator-gods build the world-machine and seed it with life.
2.  **The First Cycle (c. -100,000 to -10,000 years):** Several cycles of civilization rise and fall, each erased by a Calamity event. These are the "pre-history" civilizations, lost to time.
3.  **The Age of Revelation (c. -10,500 years):** The Sheikah civilization reaches its zenith. Through a combination of technological prowess and mystical insight, they discover the true nature of the world and the Calamity cycle.
4.  **The Age of Hubris (c. -10,400 years):** The Sheikah build the Divine Beasts, the Guardian army, and the network of Shrines, believing they can break the cycle and control the system.
5.  **The First Calamity War (c. -10,000 years):** The Calamity appears as scheduled. It "hacks" the Sheikah's network, turning the Guardians and Divine Beasts against them. The kingdom is annihilated in a single day. The Hero is mortally wounded, and the Princess seals herself and the Calamity in Hyrule Castle.
6.  **(Surreal) The Silent Century (c. -9,999 to -9,900 years):** For one hundred years after the Calamity, the world is utterly silent. No wind blows, no birds sing, no one speaks above a whisper. This is the "cooldown" phase of the defragmentation protocol.
7.  **The Re-Seeding (c. -9,800 years):** Life begins to return. New races—the proud Rito, the aquatic Zora, the stoic Gorons, the desert-dwelling Gerudo—emerge or re-emerge, with no memory of the Sheikah or the Calamity. A new Kingdom of Hyrule is founded.
8.  **(Surreal) The Day of a Thousand Moons (c. -500 years):** For one night, the sky is filled with a thousand identical, full moons. Each moon shines a different color, and beneath its light, strange, temporary ecosystems bloom and die before dawn. This is the world-machine running a "diagnostic test."
9.  **The Second Calamity (c. -100 years):** The Calamity begins to stir again. The new Kingdom of Hyrule, having rediscovered the Divine Beasts, attempts to use them. The Calamity, remembering the last cycle, instantly corrupts them again. The Champions are killed, the King is slain, and the kingdom is laid to waste. The Hero is placed in the Shrine of Resurrection. The Princess again seals the Calamity in the castle.
10. **(Surreal) The Blood Moon's First Rise (c. -99 years to present):** The Calamity, unable to fully manifest, creates the "Blood Moon" phenomenon. Once a month, it directly injects its power into the world's "source code," resurrecting all its slain monsters. It is not just bringing them back to life; it is patching their AI and making them stronger.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle between a living, breathing civilization and the cold, impersonal maintenance schedule of the universe. The Calamity is not a villain; it is a force of nature, as impersonal as a hurricane or an earthquake. The players are not just fighting a monster; they are fighting against the very laws of their reality. The central question is one of persistence. Can mortals prove that their "clutter"—their art, their history, their love, their messy, inefficient lives—is worth preserving? Can they find a way to "defrag" the system without destroying themselves? Or are they destined to be a footnote in the log files of a cosmic machine, another failed program awaiting deletion?

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Master Sword
**Type:** Legendary Longsword
**Description:** The Blade of Evil's Bane. A beautiful, ancient sword that holds a sentient, divine spirit. It is the only weapon that can truly harm the Calamity.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 longsword. It deals double damage to any creature corrupted by the Calamity. When the wielder is at full health, it can fire a "sword beam" as a ranged attack. The sword's spirit can communicate with the wielder, offering advice and encouragement. If the wielder is not "worthy" (has not proven their courage), they cannot wield the sword.

### 2. The Bow of Light
**Type:** Legendary Longbow
**Description:** A bow made of pure, golden light, created by Princess Zelda's sealing magic.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 longbow. It does not require arrows; it creates its own arrows of pure light. Its attacks deal radiant damage and are "super-effective" against the Calamity, dealing triple damage. It only appears during the final battle against the Calamity.

### 3. The Sheikah Slate
**Type:** Artifact (Wondrous Item)
**Description:** A multi-functional, magical tablet created by the ancient Sheikah. It is Link's most valuable tool.
**Mechanics:** The Slate can be upgraded with several "runes" that mimic spells: a "Magnesis" rune that can manipulate metal objects, a "Stasis" rune that can freeze objects in time, "Cryonis" that can create pillars of ice from water, and "Bomb" runes that create remote-detonated explosives. It also functions as a map, a camera, and a compendium of the world's flora and fauna.

### 4. The Paraglider
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A simple, but essential, glider given to Link by the ghost of King Rhoam.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use it to glide safely from any height, as long as they have the stamina to hold on. It effectively makes the wielder immune to falling damage, as long as they have a chance to deploy it.

### 5. The Champion's Tunic
**Type:** Legendary Armor (Light Armor)
**Description:** A simple, blue tunic, worn by all the Champions of Hyrule. It is imbued with the hopes of the kingdom.
**Mechanics:** This is +2 studded leather armor. It allows the wearer to see the exact hit point total of any enemy. When the wearer is at full health, it provides resistance to all damage. It is a symbol of hope, and wearing it grants advantage on all Charisma checks when dealing with the people of Hyrule.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]

2.  **A Korok Leaf:** A large, magical leaf that can be used to create a gust of wind.
3.  **A Dubious Food:** A meal cooked so poorly, it is a pixelated, censored mess. Eating it will probably hurt you.
4.  **A Rock-Hard Food:** A meal cooked by a Goron. It is inedible to anyone but a Goron.
5.  **A Fairy in a Bottle:** A small fairy, captured in a bottle. If you die while it is in your inventory, it will automatically resurrect you with a small amount of health.
6.  **A Star Fragment:** A piece of a fallen star. It glows faintly and hums with a celestial energy.
7.  **An Ancient Screw:** A screw salvaged from a Guardian. It feels ancient and important.
8.  **A Monster Extract:** A strange, bubbling liquid sold by Kilton. When added to a recipe, it makes the meal's effects random and unpredictable.
9.  **A Bottle of "Noble Pursuit":** The signature drink of Gerudo Town. A fruity, potent cocktail.
10. **A Silent Princess Flower:** A rare, beautiful flower that glows with a soft, blue light. It is a key ingredient in many powerful recipes.
11. **A "System Restore" Potion:** A potion from a Glitch-Hunter that, when drunk, makes you forget the last 10 minutes.
12. **A Can of "Scenery":** A can sold by a cynical Scavenger. The label says "Scenery." It's empty.
13. **The "Developer's Commentary" Scroll:** A scroll found in a glitched area. When read, a disembodied voice complains about the difficulty of programming the water physics.
14. **A Single, Perfect, Un-corrupted Strawberry:** In a world of fading tastes, this is the most delicious thing you have ever eaten.
15. **A Yiga Clan Disguise:** A ridiculous-looking outfit that somehow fools most people into thinking you are a member of the Yiga Clan.
16. **A "Certificate of Bravery" from Yunobo:** A crayon drawing of you fighting a monster, signed by Yunobo.
17. **A Love Letter from Prince Sidon:** A very passionate, very heroic, and very well-written love letter. It is not addressed to you.
18. **A Rito Feather:** A feather from a Rito warrior. It can be attached to an arrow to make it fly farther and straighter.
19. **A Single, Unbreakable Pot:** A ceramic pot that, no matter how many times you throw it, will not break. This is deeply unsettling to Link.
20. **A Chicken Egg:** A normal chicken egg. But you have a bad feeling about what will happen if you attack the chicken it came from.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Entropy
The world is a machine, and it is slowly breaking down. This is a fundamental law.
*   **Weapon Durability:** All weapons and shields have "durability points." Each time they are used to attack or defend, they lose a point. When they reach zero, they shatter. This forces players to be creative and constantly seek out new equipment.
*   **The Blood Moon:** Once every 28 days (or more frequently, at the DM's discretion), a "Blood Moon" rises. When it does, the Calamity "resets" all of its slain minions. Every monster the players have killed in the world respawns in its original location. This is not just a respawn; the monsters are "patched," their AI slightly improved.
*   **Sheikah Technology:** The ancient technology of the Sheikah is powerful, but it is also a "foreign program" in the world-machine. Using it can cause "glitches." Every time a player uses a Sheikah Slate rune, the DM can have them roll a d100. On a 1, a "glitch" occurs (e.g., the bomb explodes in their hand, the magnesis rune picks up all metal in a 100-foot radius, the stasis rune freezes the player instead).

### Subsystems: Survival and Discovery
*   **Cooking:** The world is full of ingredients. Players can cook these ingredients at a cooking pot to create meals and elixirs that grant temporary hit points, status buffs, and other benefits. Experimenting with different ingredients can lead to the discovery of powerful new recipes.
*   **Exploration as Progression:** The world is open and non-linear. The main way players gain power is not through killing monsters, but through exploration. Discovering and solving the puzzles in the ancient Sheikah Shrines grants them "Spirit Orbs," which can be traded for more heart containers or stamina vessels. The campaign is driven by the player's own curiosity.
