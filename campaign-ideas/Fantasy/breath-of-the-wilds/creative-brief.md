# Creative Brief: Breath of the Wilds

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Painterly Post-Apocalyptic Fantasy (Zelda: Breath of the Wild-inspired)

Inspired by the watercolor-meets-cel-shading aesthetic of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*. This style captures nature reclaiming civilization, ancient technology sleeping in ruins, sweeping vistas of exploration, and the beautiful melancholy of a world that has fallen but not died.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Natural Beauty:** Rolling fields, mountain peaks, forests, waterfalls, dramatic weather, visible distance
*   **Ancient Meets Organic:** Mechanical guardians overgrown with vines, shrines covered in moss, ruins becoming part of the landscape
*   **Soft Yet Vibrant:** Painterly textures, saturated colors, gentle lighting that suggests hope despite decay
*   **Sense of Scale:** Vast open spaces, tiny figures against massive landscapes, climbable everything

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Exploration, freedom, post-apocalyptic beauty, ancient mystery, nature reclaiming, melancholy hope, adventure
*   **Feeling:** Standing on a cliff overlooking endless possibilities. The bittersweet beauty of ruins where people once lived. Quiet moments before discovering something wondrous. Wind in the grass.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Landscape:** Vibrant greens and blues dominating, golden wheat fields, white snow peaks, red clay canyons
*   **Ancient Tech:** Blue-cyan glow of Sheikah technology, orange malice corruption, golden divine beast metal
*   **Atmosphere:** Soft morning light, dramatic sunset oranges and purples, cool night blues with stars
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant green fields dotted with blue wildflowers, golden wheat swaying in wind. Ancient stone ruins covered in moss. In the distance, snow-capped mountains under a painterly blue sky with soft white clouds. A cyan glow emanates from a shrine partially buried in the hillside."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Hero Aesthetic:** Practical adventuring gear with ancient technology (Sheikah Slate), weathered traveler's clothes, Champion's tunic, Master Sword
*   **Cultural Diversity:** Zora (elegant fish-people), Gorons (rock-skinned giants), Rito (bird warriors), Gerudo (desert amazons), Sheikah (ninja aesthetic)
*   **Champions:** Each has distinct color schemes and weapons (blue spear, red sword, green bow, yellow sword and shield)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hero in a blue champion's tunic with leather armor pieces, sandy blonde hair, carrying a worn shield and rusty sword. Sheikah Slate glowing cyan on their hip. Determined but weary expression. Standing in a field of ruins with overgrown stone columns."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Open Vistas:** Emphasize depth, layers of mountains fading to blue, visible landmarks on horizon
*   **Ruins Everywhere:** Crumbled castles, abandoned villages, half-buried shrines, overgrown roads
*   **Living World:** Wildlife (deer, birds, foxes), weather effects (rain, lightning, wind-blown grass), day-night cycle
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sweeping vista from a mountain peak showing three distinct biomes: lush green forests in the foreground with ancient pillars toppled among trees, a vast grassy plain in the middle distance with the silhouette of Hyrule Castle surrounded by purple malice clouds, and snow-covered mountains on the horizon. Painterly style with visible brush strokes. Golden hour lighting."

**5. Ancient Technology & Guardians:**
*   **Sheikah Tech:** Blue-cyan holographic interfaces, geometric patterns, eye symbols, stone pedestals with glowing technology
*   **Guardians:** Spider-like machines with glowing cyan eyes (or orange/pink when corrupted), mechanical legs, articulated bodies
*   **Divine Beasts:** Massive mechanical animals (elephant, salamander, bird, camel) made of golden metal with blue accents
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ancient Guardian machine with eight mechanical spider legs, octagonal body, single glowing orange eye charging a laser. Weathered metal with patches of rust and overgrown moss. Collapsed stone pillars around it. Dramatic low-angle view emphasizing its threat. Orange laser targeting beam cutting through misty morning air."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Soft Cell-Shading:** Defined shadows but not harsh, slightly painterly edges
*   **Atmospheric Perspective:** Distant objects fade to blue-gray, creating depth
*   **Dramatic Sky:** Often the most colorful element, sunsets and sunrises especially vibrant
*   **Prompt Example:** "...soft cel-shaded style with painterly textures. Morning sun breaks through clouds, creating volumetric god rays. Long shadows cast across grass. Distant mountains fade to soft blue. Warm golden light on the hero's side, cool blue shadows on the other."

## Voice

A gentle, mysterious voice carrying both hope and ancient sorrow, like wind through ruins. The pacing is calm but purposeful, never rushed. The tone shifts between wonder at natural beauty, melancholy for what was lost, and determined hope for restoration. There's an underlying theme of memory and forgetting, of things sleeping but not dead. Slightly echoing, as if calling across great distances. Role: The voice of a world waiting to be saved again.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Piano-forward melodies that are simple but emotionally resonant. Minimalist approach during exploration, swelling to full orchestration for discoveries and battles. Celtic and Japanese instruments blending.
*   **Exploration:** Sparse, allowing ambient sounds to dominate. Occasional soft piano notes. Wind, birds, flowing water.
*   **Discovery:** Bright ascending scales when finding shrines or solving puzzles. Triumphant fanfare for major discoveries.
*   **Combat:** Percussion-heavy, urgent strings, but stops immediately when threats are eliminated returning to ambient exploration.
*   **Memories:** Melancholy piano with strings, nostalgic and bittersweet, like remembering something beautiful that's gone.
*   **Divine Beasts:** Mechanical sounds blended with orchestral boss themes, each Beast having a unique instrument (water, drums, flute, strings).
*   **Final Battle:** Full orchestra, choir, callback to series themes, triumphant and desperate simultaneously.
