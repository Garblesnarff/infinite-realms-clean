# Creative Brief: The Academy of Three Lions

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Tactical Medieval Fantasy with Anime Aesthetics (Fire Emblem-inspired)

Inspired by the strategic medieval fantasy of *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* with anime character design and dramatic war tableaus. This style captures the bittersweet beauty of academy life, the tragedy of war between friends, distinct house identities, and the contrast between pastoral school days and brutal battlefield realities.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Character Expression:** Detailed character faces showing complex emotions, dramatic poses, flowing capes and hair
*   **House Identity:** Each house has distinctive colors (red/black, blue/yellow, yellow/green) and heraldry
*   **Medieval Military:** Knights, cavalry, archers, and mages in formation; siege weapons and castle warfare
*   **Dual Tone:** Bright academy days contrasted with dark, rain-soaked battlefields in Act IV

[Post-timeskip]: dramatically lit by lightning flashes during a stormy battle, harsh shadows on rain-soaked armor, burning buildings cast orange glow on desperate soldiers' faces."

## Voice

A voice that begins youthful and hopeful like a student discussing strategy and friendship, then matures into a war-weary commander carrying the weight of impossible choices. The pacing starts energetic and curious, becoming measured and heavy with tragedy. The tone shifts between fond reminiscence of academy days ("Remember when we were just students?"), tactical leadership ("Form up! Protect the flank!"), and deep sorrow ("Why did it have to end this way?"). There's an awareness that former friends may die by your hand. Slightly broken with emotion when discussing fallen comrades. Role: The voice of tragic necessity.
