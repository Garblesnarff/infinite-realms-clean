## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-40 sessions)

A four-act arc of academy life, conspiracy, time skip, and tragic war.

*   **Act I — Academy Days (Sessions 1-12):** The party arrives at Garreg Mach Monastery and chooses which house to lead/join. They teach students, compete in monthly tournaments, conduct missions against bandits and monsters, and slowly uncover hints of conspiracy. Friendships form across house lines. They investigate the Flame Emperor, a masked figure orchestrating incidents, and discover the existence of "Those Who Slither in the Dark"—a shadow organization.
*   **Act II — Conspiracy Revealed (Sessions 13-18):** The party uncovers the truth: Edelgard, leader of the Black Eagles, is the Flame Emperor planning to overthrow the Church and reunify the continent under imperial rule. Her reasons are complex—exposing Church corruption and ending the Crest system that has enslaved her family. The climax occurs at the Holy Tomb where Edelgard seizes power, triggering war. The party must choose: side with Edelgard, oppose her, or forge a third path.
*   **Act III — The Time Skip (Session 19):** Five years pass. The continent is engulfed in war. The Empire has conquered much territory, the Kingdom is in civil war, the Alliance is fractured. The party's students are now hardened soldiers. Former friends lead enemy armies. The party reunites their scattered house and establishes a base of operations. The tone shifts from school anime to dark fantasy war.
*   **Act IV — War of Three Lions (Sessions 20-40):** The party leads their house in a campaign to end the war and unify Fodlan according to their vision. Each path faces different enemies: Imperial path fights Church and Kingdom, Kingdom path fights Empire and Alliance splinter, Deer path fights all sides seeking neutral peace, Church path opposes Empire's tyranny. Major battles include fortress sieges, naval operations, and confrontations with former students. The final arc reveals the true enemy: Those Who Slither in the Dark, seeking to awaken ancient weapons. The ending differs dramatically based on choices made throughout.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of perspective in war, the cost of revolution vs. tradition, whether ends justify means, and the tragedy of former friends as enemies. It asks: Is it right to destroy an unjust system if innocents suffer? Can vengeance ever lead to peace? How do you choose between people you love when they oppose each other? The central conflict pits three noble visions for Fodlan's future against each other—meritocratic revolution, chivalric tradition, and open borders—while a hidden enemy manipulates all sides.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **House Selection & Path Divergence**
*   At session 1, party chooses which house to lead (or splits between them)
*   Choice determines which students become allies, which become enemies
*   After session 18, choose to side with Edelgard, oppose her, or seek third path
*   Four main routes: Crimson Flower (Empire), Azure Moon (Kingdom), Verdant Wind (Alliance), Silver Snow (Church)
*   Each path has unique story, different final boss, different ending

### 2. **Instruction & Student Growth**
*   Between main sessions, party instructs students in skills
*   Students have goals: weapon proficiencies, magic training, mounted combat

*   Support levels: build relationships through shared activities and battles
*   Students can multiclass based on training: Soldier → Cavalier → Paladin

### 3. **Combat Arts & Gambits**
*   Weapon-based special attacks (Combat Arts): cost durability for powerful effects

*   Each character learns unique arts based on weapon proficiency
*   Examples: Windsweep (Swift Strike), Wrath Strike (High damage), Healing Focus (Restore HP)

### 4. **Crest System**

*   Major theme: Crest-less students face discrimination; some seek artificial Crests
*   Crests are revealed to be dragon blood from ancient genocide
