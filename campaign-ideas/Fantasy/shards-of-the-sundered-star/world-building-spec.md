### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**Shards of the Sundered Star**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Long ago, the star goddess Hydaelia shattered the world into fourteen reflection shards to save it from the void-god Zodiark. Now, the immortal Ascians seek to rejoin all shards through catastrophic Calamities. The players are Warriors of Light with the power to absorb primals and travel between shards, caught between saving their world or resurrecting the lost ancient paradise.

    *   Write the history of Hydaelia's sundering and the creation of fourteen shards.
    *   Describe the creation of Zodiark and Hydaelia as primal gods through massive sacrifices.
    *   Explain the nature of primals—beings summoned through prayer and faith that temper worshippers.
    *   Detail the Ascians' origins as unsundered ancients and their millennia-long plan to rejoin shards.
    *   Write about the Echo—the power that marks Warriors of Light and grants immunity to tempering.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players absorb all five Lightwardens on the First.
    *   **THEN:** Night returns to the First. One player risks becoming a Lightwarden themselves. Generate a crisis where Scions must decide whether to strike them down.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully negotiate peace with a beast tribe without killing their primal.
    *   **THEN:** That tribe becomes an ally, providing unique resources and support. Ascians attempt to re-temper the tribe.
    *   **IF:** A player becomes too corrupted by Light or Darkness.
    *   **THEN:** They risk transformation or death. Generate a purification quest involving sacrifice from other party members.
    *   **IF:** The players defeat Emet-Selch without understanding his perspective.
    *   **THEN:** They miss crucial information about how to truly end the cycle. The final confrontation becomes harder.
    *   **IF:** The players achieve high trust with all Scions before the final battle.
    *   **THEN:** Scions can combine their power to create a protective barrier during the climax, preventing casualties.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to rejoin shards to resurrect the unsundered world.
    *   **THEN:** Their world ends. Generate an epilogue where they exist in the resurrected paradise but haunted by the billions they sacrificed.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to break the cycle by rejecting both Hydaelia and Zodiark.
    *   **THEN:** They must fight both primal gods. Victory frees all shards from the cycle but removes divine protection. Generate an epilogue of uncertain but free future.
