## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 18+ sessions)

A tale of cosmic cycles, sacrifice, and the burden of being a world's champion.

*   **Act I — Warriors of Light (Sessions 1–6):** The party begins as adventurers who discover they can absorb primal entities—god-like beings summoned by faith and desperation. They join the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, a group fighting both primals and the mysterious robed Ascians. They learn of the First Umbral Calamity and that more are coming.
*   **Act II — The Sundered Truth (Sessions 7–13):** The players discover the truth: their world is only one shard of a greater whole. The Ascians were citizens of the unsundered world and seek to restore it by causing Calamities that merge shards. The party must travel to another shard—the First—which is being consumed by overwhelming Light. They must restore balance without causing a rejoining.
*   **Act III — The Final Days (Sessions 14–18+):** The players confront the ultimate truth: both Hydaelia and Zodiark were created by ancient sacrifices, and both seek to perpetuate the cycle. The party must gather allies from across shards, defeat the remaining Ascians, and find a third path—breaking the cycle entirely by defeating both primal gods and allowing mortals to determine their own fate.

This campaign explores themes of sacrifice, the nature of existence, and breaking cycles of trauma. The central conflict is philosophical: is it better to preserve an imperfect present or sacrifice it to resurrect a perfect past? The players must navigate moral complexity where even villains have understandable motivations.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Primal Absorption System**
*   When the party defeats a primal, they absorb its essence rather than killing it permanently.
*   Each absorbed primal grants the party access to a unique power usable once per long rest.
*   Examples: Ifrit's Hellfire (massive fire damage), Titan's Earthen Ward (temporary HP), Ramuh's Judgment Bolt (chain lightning).
*   The DM can create custom primals with thematic abilities based on their domain.

### 2. **The Echo Visions**
*   Players periodically experience visions of the past triggered by specific locations or items.
*   These visions are playable flashbacks where players take on the roles of ancient characters.
*   Flashbacks reveal crucial lore and allow players to influence the present by understanding the past.
*   Success in flashback challenges grants mechanical bonuses (inspiration, temporary abilities).

### 3. **Light/Dark Corruption**
*   Absorbing too many Light-aspected primals (Lightwardens) risks corruption toward stasis and sainthood.
*   Absorbing too many Dark-aspected beings risks corruption toward chaos and void.
*   The party must balance their essences or find ways to purge excess through special rituals.
*   High corruption in either direction changes appearance and eventually transforms the character.

### 4. **Shard Travel**
*   The party can travel between shards using special crystals at narrative milestones.
*   Each shard has unique rules, environments, and challenges.
*   Actions in one shard can affect others—rejoinings merge regions, creating bizarre hybrid zones.
*   The party must manage multiple world-states simultaneously in late game.

### 5. **Trust System**
*   Build trust with Scions and allies through side quests and dialogue choices.
*   High trust unlocks powerful support abilities in major battles.
*   Certain story revelations test trust—characters may leave or even oppose the party if trust is too low.
