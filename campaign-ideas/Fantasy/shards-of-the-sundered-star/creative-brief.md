# Creative Brief: Shards of the Sundered Star

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: High Fantasy Anime Realism (Final Fantasy-inspired)

This style captures both the epic scope of world-spanning adventure and the intimate emotional journeys of its characters.

*   **Purpose:** Lighting conveys both spectacle and emotion—warmth in safe moments, cold in threatening ones.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by soft golden light filtering through crystal structures, with glowing blue magical energy swirling around the characters, creating an ethereal and hopeful atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic and emotionally focused. Wide shots for spectacle, close-ups for character moments.

*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic shot of the Warriors of Light standing together on a crystalline platform, silhouetted against a massive rift in reality showing both Light and Darkness colliding, their cloaks billowing in magical wind."
