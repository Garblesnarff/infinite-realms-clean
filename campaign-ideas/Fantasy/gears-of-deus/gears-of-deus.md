### Core Premise
The players discover they are reincarnations of ancient warriors trapped in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, manipulated by the Church of Solaris and its hidden god-weapon, Deus. The world is divided into surface nations and the sky city of Solaris, which secretly controls everything through religion and giant mechanical warriors called Gears. As the players uncover their past lives and the conspiracy spanning millennia, they learn that Deus - a biological superweapon that crashed on this planet 10,000 years ago - has been orchestrating all of history to resurrect itself. The campaign builds from political intrigue and mech battles to metaphysical revelations about the nature of humanity, god, and free will, culminating in a battle to break the cycle and destroy a false god.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Surface War (Sessions 1-10)**
- The players begin as Gear pilots in various surface nations embroiled in conflict. They uncover evidence that the wars are being manipulated by Solaris, the mysterious sky nation. A rebel group called Ethos (later revealed to be another Solarian front) recruits them. As they investigate, the players experience strange visions and déjà vu, suggesting past lives. They discover the Gazel Ministry - disembodied consciousnesses of ancient rulers who serve Solaris. Their investigation leads them to raid Solaris itself, where they learn horrifying truths about "Lambs" (surface dwellers) and "Shepherds" (Solarians).

**Act 2: The Past Unveiled (Sessions 11-20)**
- The players experience vivid flashbacks to their past lives across multiple eras: as scientists aboard the crashed ship Eldridge 10,000 years ago, as warriors during the ancient Zeboim civilization, as victims of previous genocides. They learn about the "Contact" - one specific reincarnation who can communicate with Deus - and the "Antitype" - the eternal mother figure. They discover that Deus is a biological superweapon that merged with the Eldridge's crew, creating the first humans on this planet. All humanity descends from Deus and serves as parts waiting to be reclaimed. The Church orchestrates wars to accelerate evolution and harvest souls. The players must grapple with the revelation that they are pawns in a 10,000-year resurrection plan.

**Act 3: Breaking the Cycle (Sessions 21-30)**
- Armed with terrible knowledge, the players assault Deus's cathedral beneath Solaris. They fight through manifestations of humanity's collective sins (the Elements), confront the Gazel Ministry, and face the religious leader who believes resurrecting Deus will bring paradise. The battles occur both in Gears (mech combat) and on foot (personal stakes). The climax involves entering Deus itself - a massive biomechanical god-ship - and confronting the Wave Existence, a higher-dimensional being trapped within Deus who has been suffering for millennia. The players must choose: destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence, potentially ending all life descended from it, or find a third path that preserves humanity while breaking the cycle. The final battle spans physical, psychological, and metaphysical dimensions.

### Key Locations

- **Ignas - Surface Nations**: Various kingdoms and republics engaged in seemingly endless wars, unaware of Solarian manipulation.
- **Solaris**: The floating sky city hidden by optical camouflage, where genetically engineered elites live in luxury while controlling the surface.
- **The Ethos Headquarters**: A sprawling compound disguised as an archaeological organization, actually a Solarian front for Gear excavation and control.
- **Shevat**: A rival sky city opposing Solaris, home to rebels and descendants of those who refused Deus's call.
- **Zeboim Ruins**: Underwater remains of the advanced civilization destroyed 4,000 years ago, containing clues to the cycle.
- **The Cathedral**: Massive underground complex beneath Solaris where religious ceremonies and Gear production occur. Houses the entrance to Deus.
- **The Eldridge Crash Site**: The original interstellar transport ship, partially embedded in the planet's crust, where Deus first awakened.
- **Deus's Core**: The interior of the god-weapon, a biomechanical nightmare of flesh, machinery, and absorbed souls. Reality functions differently here.
- **The Tree of Sephirot**: A metaphysical structure representing Deus's system for absorbing and processing human souls.

### Central Conflict
The players fight against predestination itself. They must overcome the conspiracy that has controlled all of human history while grappling with the revelation that they are reincarnations in an endless cycle. The conflict spans the political (Solaris vs. surface nations), personal (breaking free of fated tragic relationships), and cosmic (humanity's right to exist independently of its creator). Core themes include free will vs. determinism, the nature of god and humanity, whether suffering is inherent to existence, and if it's possible to escape cycles of trauma that span millennia.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Gear Combat System**: Players pilot massive biomechanical warriors called Gears. When the party acquires Gears, combat can occur at two scales: personal (character-level) or Gear (vehicle-level). Gears have their own HP, abilities, and fuel systems. Some battles require Gears (giant monsters, enemy Gears), others require exiting Gears for infiltration. Players can customize Gears with parts found or purchased.
- **Past Life Flashbacks**: At dramatically appropriate moments, the DM narrates flashbacks where players experience scenes from their past lives. These are semi-interactive - players can make choices but know the outcome is predetermined (since it's the past). Use these to foreshadow future revelations, build tragic romance, and explain the cycle's nature. Each PC should have at least 2-3 significant past lives explored.
- **The Personality System**: One PC (ideally the Contact) has multiple personalities representing different incarnations. Mechanically, these can be different subclasses or ability sets the player switches between. Triggers cause personality shifts - trauma, specific enemies, key locations. The player must track which personality is dominant and how they interact/conflict.
- **Existential Horror Saves**: When players learn universe-shattering truths (they are pieces of Deus, their ancestors were artificial, their relationships are fated to repeat tragedy), require Wisdom saves against despair. Failure causes temporary debuffs representing existential crisis. Success reflects the character finding meaning despite cosmic horror.
- **Gnosis Meter**: Track a hidden "understanding" score as players uncover the conspiracy. At certain thresholds, unlock new abilities representing spiritual/mental evolution but also trigger harder enemy responses as Deus recognizes the threat. Higher gnosis allows perceiving hidden truths, communicating with the Wave Existence, and accessing ultimate techniques.
- **Anima Power**: Characters have latent energy from past lives called Anima. In desperate situations, players can call upon this power for dramatic moments - temporary massive power boosts, perfect defense, or reality-bending effects. Each use reveals more of their past and brings them closer to their fated role in Deus's resurrection, creating a risk-reward dynamic.
- **The Final Choice**: Unlike typical campaigns, there is no clearly "correct" ending. Destroying Deus might annihilate all life descended from it. Allowing resurrection creates a false paradise but destroys free will. Players must debate and choose, with consequences reflecting their decision. The DM should present each option as philosophically valid.
