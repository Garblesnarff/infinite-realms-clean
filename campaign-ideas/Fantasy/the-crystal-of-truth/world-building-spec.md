### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Crystal of Truth**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** As the last of the Gelflings in a dying world ruled by cruel Skeksis, the party must fulfill an ancient prophecy to heal the shattered Dark Crystal during the Great Conjunction, reunifying a split species and saving their world from complete corruption and death.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the urSkeks' arrival, the Crystal's shattering, and the split into Skeksis and urRu
    *   Explain the Great Conjunction—when three suns align and reality becomes malleable
    *   Describe the Gelfling civilization before the Skeksis' genocide and current hiding survivors
    *   Write about the Dark Crystal's nature—a living source of planetary power now corrupted
    *   Detail how the Skeksis drain life essence to extend their lives and what this does to the world
    *   Explain the prophecy in full and previous failed attempts to fulfill it

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **The Skeksis Empire** (Major) - Vulture-lords ruling through fear, goal: maintain power and immortality
    *   **The urRu (Mystics)** (Major) - Gentle counterparts seeking harmony, goal: await prophecy fulfillment passively
    *   **The Gelflings** (Major) - Party and hidden survivors, goal: fulfill prophecy and restore world
    *   **The Pod People** (Minor) - Simple peaceful creatures hiding underground, goal: survive
    *   **The Garthim** (Minor) - Beetle warriors serving Skeksis, goal: destroy Gelflings on command
    *   **The urSkeks** (Background) - Original unified species, may return if Crystal heals

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Skeksis Emperor, The General, The Chamberlain, Aughra, urSu the Master, Kira (if applicable)
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "The Scientist (skekTek)," "The Ritual Master (skekZok)," "The Slave Master," "urZah the Ritual Guardian," "Pod Person Elder," "Garthim Commander," "Hidden Gelfling Survivor," "Lesser urRu"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Gelfling Village** - Hidden settlement in forest, destroyed early to establish stakes
*   **The Valley of Stones** - Dying wasteland showing planetary corruption
*   **Aughra's Observatory** - Ancient cosmic observatory with orreries showing the conjunction
*   **The Valley of the urRu** - Hidden mystical valley where Mystics dwell in harmony
*   **The Castle of the Crystal** - Dark gothic fortress built around the corrupted Crystal chamber
*   Each location shows the dying world's state and the Skeksis' corruption

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the party reaches the Crystal during the Great Conjunction THEN they can attempt to heal it
*   IF they place the shard correctly THEN Skeksis and urRu reunify into urSkeks
*   IF they fail during the Conjunction THEN the world continues dying for another thousand years
*   IF they kill a Skeksis THEN its urRu counterpart dies, and vice versa
*   IF the Skeksis capture them THEN they're drained of life essence in the Crystal chamber
*   IF Aughra trusts them THEN she provides crucial knowledge about the shard's location
*   IF they undergo the urRu trials THEN they gain mystical insights and possible powers
*   IF the Crystal heals THEN the world begins regenerating and Gelflings can rebuild their civilization
