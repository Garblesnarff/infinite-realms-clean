# Colossus Ascent
## *Climb the Living Mountains. Strike at Their Hearts.*

### Campaign Overview

In a world shrouded in perpetual twilight, sixteen ancient Colossi roam a desolate landscape—living monuments of stone, moss, and mystery. Each is a walking ecosystem, a mountain given breath and purpose by forgotten gods. The party has been marked by an ancient pact: to climb these impossible beings, traverse their massive forms like mountaineers scaling cliff faces, and strike at the magical sigils that sustain their immortal existence. But with each Colossus felled, the land trembles, the sky darkens, and a terrible truth emerges—these giants were not guardians keeping evil imprisoned, but seals keeping something far worse at bay.

The campaign combines the melancholic beauty and puzzle-boss mechanics of Shadow of the Colossus with D&D's collaborative storytelling. Players must work together to identify climbing routes, avoid devastating attacks from creatures who barely notice their presence, and make impossible leaps of faith across living landscapes. Each Colossus is a self-contained adventure featuring environmental puzzles, dramatic chase sequences, and the haunting question: are we the heroes, or are we dooming the world?

The scale is overwhelming—a single finger of a Colossus might be as tall as a tower. The party feels insignificant, yet their actions literally reshape the world. As the campaign progresses, the moral weight grows heavier. The Colossi are magnificent, tragic, and their deaths are both triumph and tragedy.

### Core Themes

**The Majesty of Scale**: Every encounter emphasizes the incomprehensible size difference. Colossi move in slow motion from the party's perspective, but each step shakes the earth. A casual swipe of a hand creates hurricanes. Players navigate terrain that is literally alive—moss-covered shoulders, ancient armor plates, exposed stone sinew.

**Insignificance and Courage**: The party is flea-like compared to their targets, yet they possess the one thing that matters—agency. The Colossi are powerful but bound by ancient programming. The party is small but free.

**The Weight of Destruction**: Each Colossus death is a spectacle and a funeral. These beings are ancient, beautiful, and irreplaceable. The campaign asks: is killing necessary? Is it justified? What are we willing to sacrifice for our goal?

**Climbing as Combat**: Traditional D&D combat is reimagined. Success isn't about dealing damage—it's about reaching weak points, maintaining grip during earthquakes of movement, and timing strikes perfectly. It's Dark Souls meets rock climbing.

**Melancholic Wonder**: The world is beautiful in its desolation. Ruins speak of lost civilizations. The Colossi are tragic figures. Victory feels hollow. The campaign embraces bittersweet emotions.

### Session Breakdown (25-40 Sessions)

**Act I: The First Steps (Sessions 1-8)**
- **Session 1-2: The Marked Ones**: Party awakens in the Forbidden Lands with no memory of how they arrived. A mysterious voice speaks of a pact—destroy the sixteen Colossi to lift a curse. They discover magical brands on their bodies that glow when near a Colossus. First exploration of the desolate world reveals ancient ruins and a central temple.

- **Session 3-4: Colossus I - The Grazing Giant (Valus)**: The party encounters a massive quadruped Colossus grazing peacefully in a meadow. Learning the basics: identifying glowing sigils, using the environment to reach its legs, climbing fur and stone plating, and delivering the killing blow to the head sigil. The earth trembles as Valus falls, and a beam of dark light shoots into the sky.

- **Session 5-6: Colossus II - The Bull of the Lake (Quadratus)**: A more aggressive Colossus guards an ancient bridge. Players must lure it to destructible platforms, leap from bridge to body, and navigate its armored back while it attempts to shake them off underwater. First underwater climbing sequence.

- **Session 7-8: Shadows Gathering**: After two deaths, the party experiences shared nightmares. Shadow tendrils appear on their bodies, spreading from the brands. NPCs begin appearing—other marked ones who failed, now twisted into shadow creatures. The temple becomes more ominous. Something is feeding on the Colossus deaths.

**Act II: The Hunt Intensifies (Sessions 9-20)**
- **Session 9-10: Colossus III - The Knight Errant (Gaius)**: A sword-wielding humanoid Colossus that actively hunts the party. First truly hostile encounter. Players must break its armor, climb its sword mid-swing, and navigate its aggressive arena filled with ancient columns.

- **Session 11-12: Colossus IV - The Burrowing Dune (Phaedra)**: An underground Colossus in a desert temple. Players must lure it above ground using ancient bells, then navigate tunnels inside its body. Claustrophobic horror mixed with massive scale.

- **Session 13-14: The Price of Power**: A former marked warrior, now half-shadow, attacks the party to steal their brands. Reveals the truth: the Colossi are prisons for fragments of an ancient dark god. Each death releases a piece, and the brands absorb the darkness. The party is becoming vessels.

- **Session 15-16: Colossus V & VI - The Flying Serpent (Avion) & The Bearded Giant (Barba)**: Back-to-back challenges. Avion requires aerial combat using its wings as platforms. Barba guards a flooded arena, requiring swimming, climbing, and careful timing. Both introduce multi-stage weak points.

- **Session 17-18: Colossus VII - The Aquatic Leviathan (Hydrus)**: Entirely underwater Colossus. Players need magical assistance for water breathing. Navigation through flooded ruins while riding the Colossus's body through tunnels.

- **Session 19-20: The Rebel's Path**: The party discovers an ancient library revealing an alternative—use magic to absorb the darkness without killing the Colossi. But it requires a ritual that will trap one party member forever as a living seal. Moral crisis and party conflict.

**Act III: The Titans of Legend (Sessions 21-32)**
- **Session 21-22: Colossus VIII - The Wall Crawler (Kuromori)**: A four-legged Colossus that climbs walls and ceilings in a massive underground cavern. Inverts expectations of gravity. Introduces lightning attacks.

- **Session 23-24: Colossus IX - The Geysered Tortoise (Basaran)**: A turtle-like Colossus in a geothermal area. Players must use geysers to flip it, exposing its vulnerable underside. Environmental hazard management.

- **Session 25-26: Colossus X - The Sand Serpent (Dirge)**: Hunts through desert dunes. Players must drive sand vehicles while it pursues, then leap onto it mid-chase. High-speed action sequence.

- **Session 27-28: The Shadow Consumes**: A party member is temporarily possessed by the accumulating darkness. They attack the others and must be subdued. The temple shows visions of the dark god's imprisonment and the original heroes who created the Colossi-prisons. The party realizes they're undoing ancient sacrifice.

- **Session 29-30: Colossus XI & XII - The Roaring Lion (Celosia) & The Electric Titan (Pelagia)**: Environmental puzzles intensify. Celosia must be herded using fire through ancient structures. Pelagia swims through a flooded city, attacking with lightning.

- **Session 31-32: The Final Choice**: All evidence gathered. The dark god will reconstitute when all Colossi fall. Three paths emerge:
  1. Stop now, trapping the remaining Colossi forever (and leaving the curse partially active)
  2. Complete the ritual sacrifice, saving one party member as the new seal
  3. Continue to destroy all Colossi and prepare to fight the dark god directly

**Act IV: The Last Giants (Sessions 33-40)**
- **Session 33-34: Colossus XIII - The Flying Fortress (Phalanx)**: Massive aerial serpent. Players navigate its segmented body while it flies through canyons. Longest single Colossus encounter.

- **Session 35-36: Colossus XIV & XV - The Ruined Guardians (Cenobia & Argus)**: The most aggressive Colossi, appearing as deteriorating giants. Both attack simultaneously in the temple grounds. Players must divide and conquer.

- **Session 37-38: Colossus XVI - The Final Guardian (Malus)**: The largest and most powerful. A complete fortress-city built into a walking giant. Multiple stages: breach the outer walls, climb tower-legs, navigate interior architecture, and finally confront the heart. Epic multi-session battle.

- **Session 39-40: The Dark God Awakens / The New World**:
  - **If all Colossi killed**: The dark god emerges. Final battle against a cosmic horror. Victory requires the party to become living seals together, creating a new Colossus from their combined essences.
  - **If ritual performed**: The sacrificed party member becomes the 17th Colossus, a guardian that will watch over the reformed world. Bittersweet ending.
  - **If some remain**: An unstable world where remaining Colossi now actively hunt the party, attempting to reclaim the released darkness. The campaign continues into a new phase.

### Key NPCs

### Major Locations

**The Forbidden Lands (Central Hub)**
Vast, desolate wilderness where time moves strangely. Beautiful but empty. Ancient ruins dot the landscape—crumbled cities, fallen temples, shattered monuments. Each region has distinct biomes: grasslands, deserts, forests, lakes, canyons, and subterranean spaces. Fast travel points at defeated Colossus locations.

**The Shrine of Worship (Temple Base)**
The party's respawn point and sanctuary. A stone temple with a glowing altar and mysterious magical properties. As Colossi fall, the temple darkens and shadow tendrils spread across its walls. Contains murals that update with each death, telling the story of ancient imprisonment.

**Colossus Arenas (16 Unique Locations)**
Each Colossus inhabits a carefully designed encounter space:
- **The Meadow of Valus**: Rolling plains with ancient stone platforms
- **The Bridge of Quadratus**: Lake with massive stone bridge and destructible platforms
- **The Sunken Coliseum of Gaius**: Ancient fighting arena partially buried
- **The Desert Temple of Phaedra**: Dune-covered ruins with underground chambers
- **The Sky Cliff of Avion**: Towering stone pillars over a lake
- **The Flooded Ritual Site of Barba**: Ancient temple with rising water levels
- **The Drowned Cathedral of Hydrus**: Fully submerged palace complex
- **The Ceiling Maze of Kuromori**: Inverted underground cavern system
- **The Geyser Fields of Basaran**: Geothermal wasteland with explosive vents
- **The Endless Dunes of Dirge**: Vast desert with minimal cover
- **The Flame Halls of Celosia**: Underground temple with fire hazards
- **The Sunken Metropolis of Pelagia**: Flooded city ruins with lightning hazards
- **The Canyon of Phalanx**: Winding stone canyons perfect for flight
- **The Underground Arena of Cenobia**: Tight quarters, aggressive environment
- **The Cliff City of Argus**: Vertical architecture carved into canyon walls
- **The Final Citadel of Malus**: Massive temple-fortress, largest encounter space

**The Library of Eternity (Hidden Location)**
Discovered mid-campaign. Contains the true history: the dark god Dormin was sealed by sixteen heroes who sacrificed themselves to become the Colossi. The brands are the key to releasing the seal, and wielders are drawn by Dormin's manipulative call.

**The Shadow Realm (Alternate Dimension)**
Accessed through dreams and certain rituals. Here, the party sees echoes of the past—the original sealing, the Colossi's creation, and visions of what will happen if Dormin is freed. Populated by shadow creatures and corrupted former marked ones.

**The Garden of Creation (Final Location)**
If all Colossi fall, the party is drawn here—the place where Dormin was originally defeated. Now corrupted, it serves as the arena for the final confrontation. Reality breaks down here; scale becomes meaningless, and the environment shifts based on the dark god's whims.

### Unique Mechanics

**Climbing System**
- Players use Athletics/Acrobatics with advantage/disadvantage based on surface (fur, stone, metal)
- Grip Meter: Each player has stamina that depletes while climbing. Must rest on flat surfaces
- Dynamic Surfaces: Colossi move, requiring Dexterity saves to maintain grip
- Fall Damage Scaling: Based on height, but environmental features allow for breaking falls
- Teamwork: Players can create rope lines, brace each other, or distract the Colossus

**Weak Point System**
- Each Colossus has 2-5 glowing sigils (magical weak points)
- Only attacks on sigils deal meaningful damage
- Sigils are in difficult-to-reach locations requiring puzzle-solving
- Critical hits on sigils trigger cinematic moments
- Final sigil (usually head or heart) requires specific positioning

**Scale Physics**
- Movement speed relative to Colossus creates time dilation effects
- A Colossus taking a "step" might be 1 round, but that step covers 100 feet
- Area effects from Colossus attacks (stomps, swipes) affect huge zones
- Environmental destruction: Colossi reshape terrain during encounters

**Brand Corruption**
- Each Colossus death increases party's shadow corruption
- Mechanical effects: gain dark magic abilities but suffer periodic Wisdom saves
- Narrative effects: physical changes, disturbing dreams, NPC reactions
- Can be cleansed temporarily through rituals but never fully removed
- At high corruption, players gain powerful shadow forms (risk vs. reward)

**Emotional Weight**
- After each Colossus death, players describe their character's feelings
- NPCs react with horror/awe to the party's actions
- The Colossi never speak but express emotion through sound and movement
- Killing a Colossus grants experience but also trauma (mechanical debuffs cleared only through roleplay)

**Environmental Puzzle Combat**
- Each Colossus is a multi-stage puzzle:
  1. Identify climbing route
  2. Reach first weak point
  3. Trigger behavior change
  4. Reach final weak point
- Requires creative use of environment, items, and teamwork
- No "correct" solution—reward player creativity

**Cinematic Moments**
- Automatic success on rule of cool actions if narratively appropriate
- Slow-motion descriptions for critical strikes on sigils
- Musical cues (if playing with soundtrack)
- Players encouraged to describe climbing actions dramatically

**Size Comparison**
- Colossi range from 40 feet (Celosia) to 300+ feet (Malus)
- Party is Medium-sized (5-6 feet tall)
- A single Colossus finger might be 10-15 feet long
- Maps use unconventional scale: 1 inch = 50 feet for Colossus encounters

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Colossi Are Prisons** (Mid-Campaign)
The Colossi aren't guardians—they're seals. Each contains a fragment of Dormin, the dark god. The party isn't killing monsters; they're releasing an ancient evil piece by piece.

**Twist 2: The Voice Is Dormin** (Act III)
The mysterious entity guiding the party is Dormin itself, using the brands to manipulate marked ones into releasing it. The "curse" being lifted is Dormin's imprisonment.

**Twist 3: The Colossi Were Heroes** (Library Discovery)
The sixteen Colossi were once heroes who voluntarily transformed themselves into living prisons. Their sacrifice saved the world, and the party is undoing that sacrifice.

**Twist 4: The Brands Are Containers** (Act II)
The brands don't just mark the party—they absorb Dormin's released essence, making the party into potential vessels. If all Colossi fall, Dormin will reconstitute using the party's bodies.

**Twist 5: There Have Been Others** (Recurring Discovery)
The party finds evidence of previous marked ones throughout history. All failed or completed the task and vanished. The cycle repeats whenever someone tries to use Dormin's power for personal reasons.

**Twist 6: One Party Member Is a Plant** (Optional)
One party member might have been marked before the others, sent to ensure the task is completed. They must choose between their original mission and their new loyalty.

**Twist 7: The World Is Dying** (Environmental)
The Forbidden Lands exist in a pocket dimension. Killing Colossi destabilizes it. By the final battles, reality itself is breaking down—gravity fluctuates, time loops, terrain shifts randomly.

**Twist 8: Resurrection Price** (If player dies)
Death is temporary in the Forbidden Lands—players respawn at the temple. But each death spreads the shadow corruption faster. Frequent death = accelerated vessel transformation.

**Twist 9: The Colossi Can Communicate** (Late Game)
Using special magic or at high corruption, the party can hear the Colossi's thoughts. They're fully sentient, aware of their purpose, and accepting of death but deeply sad. Makes future kills emotionally devastating.

**Twist 10: Alternative Sealing** (Final Act)
The original sixteen heroes aren't dead—their consciousness lives within the Colossi. If the party can communicate with them, they might learn a ritual to reseal Dormin without the Colossi dying. Requires sacrificing the party's mortality instead.

### Victory Conditions

**Path of the Warrior (Complete All Sixteen)**
- All Colossi defeated, Dormin fully released
- Final battle against the dark god
- Victory: Party becomes the new seal, transforming into a 17th Colossus together or individually
- Reward: Save the world but lose mortal form; become legendary guardians
- Outcome: The Forbidden Lands open to the world, now a place of pilgrimage

**Path of Sacrifice (Ritual Alternative)**
- Kill 8-15 Colossi, learn the ritual, perform the sealing
- One party member volunteers to become a living seal
- No final battle, but emotional resolution
- Reward: World saved, party mostly intact, sacrificed member becomes NPC guardian
- Outcome: Remaining Colossi go dormant; the world slowly heals

**Path of Rebellion (Stop Early)**
- Kill 5-10 Colossi, refuse to continue
- Leave remaining Colossi alive, accepting partial corruption
- Long-term consequence: the curse remains, but Dormin stays sealed
- Reward: Party keeps mortality and free will; become wanderers seeking cure for corruption
- Outcome: Ambiguous; setting up for future campaigns where they must deal with consequences

**Path of Transcendence (Secret Ending)**
- Discover all hidden lore, max corruption, defeat all Colossi
- In final moments before Dormin manifests, party performs counter-ritual
- Bind Dormin into their own bodies voluntarily but maintain control
- Reward: Party becomes immortal god-slayers with shadow powers
- Outcome: They become new guardians of the world, hunting other ancient threats

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Party Kill During Colossus Fight**
- Respawn at temple but lose all progress on that Colossus
- Corruption increases from death
- Colossus regains health and repositions

**Corruption Overwhelms Party**
- If corruption reaches maximum without completing quest
- Party becomes shadow creatures, controlled by Dormin

**Refusal to Continue**
- Party refuses to kill more Colossi but doesn't seek alternative
- The Voice withdraws support
- Party trapped in Forbidden Lands forever, slowly deteriorating
- Potentially salvageable if they later change their minds

**Failed Final Battle**
- If fighting Dormin and party loses
- Dark god freed completely
- World begins transformation into shadow realm
- Potential continuation: play as the next generation trying to fix what happened

### Campaign Themes Summary

This campaign explores **the price of power**, **the nature of sacrifice**, and **what it means to be a hero when the lines between good and evil blur**. Players will experience **awe-inspiring scale**, tactical puzzle-solving, and profound moral choices. Every victory feels like loss; every Colossus death is beautiful and tragic.

The core emotional journey moves from excitement (epic monster hunts) to unease (these creatures aren't evil) to dread (we're making a terrible mistake) to determination (we must fix what we've broken or see it through to the end).

Scale creates gameplay: the party must think creatively when traditional combat is meaningless. Climbing a living creature while it moves creates dynamic, cinematic moments impossible in standard D&D. The campaign rewards cooperation, puzzle-solving, and emotional engagement over combat optimization.

This is **Dark Souls meets Shadow of the Colossus in D&D form**—melancholic, beautiful, challenging, and emotionally resonant.
