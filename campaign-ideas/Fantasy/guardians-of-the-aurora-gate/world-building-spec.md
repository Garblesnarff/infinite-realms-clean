# Guardians of the Aurora Gate - World-Building Specification

## The Aurora Gate

### Nature
- Living dimensional barrier
- Consciousness born from ancient magic
- Exists in upper atmosphere and across dimensional boundaries
- Visible as aurora borealis (and australis)
- Sentient but alien psychology
- Dying slowly over millennia

### Function
- Separates stable reality from The Outside
- Prevents cross-dimensional contamination
- Self-repairing (when healthy)
- Requires guardian maintenance (when weakening)
- Both protection and prison

### Current State
- 3,000 years old, designed for 2,000-year lifespan
- Critically degraded
- Cracks appearing monthly
- Repair possible but requires sacrifice
- Complete failure imminent (within decades)

## The Outside

### What It Is
Dimension where physics is negotiable:
- Consciousness shapes matter
- Time flows differently
- Multiple states exist simultaneously
- Thoughts become real
- Reality is fluid, not fixed

### Not Evil, Just Incompatible
- Outside entities aren't malicious
- They simply operate on different rules
- Their existence here destabilizes our reality
- Like matter and antimatter—contact is catastrophic
- They want to exist here, not understanding the cost

### Manifestations
When Outside touches reality:
- Physics breaks locally
- Impossible colors appear
- Geometric impossibilities form
- Consciousness becomes contagious
- Matter becomes negotiable
- Sanity strains

## The Guardian Order

### History
Founded during Dimensional War 3,000 years ago:
- Original Guardians were warriors fighting Outside invasion
- Created aurora barrier as emergency measure
- Established watch to maintain it
- Order passed down through generations
- Current Guardians are 112th generation

### Organization
- **Polar Station**: Arctic headquarters, 200 personnel
- **The Seven**: Senior Guardians bonded to specific aurora colors
- **Initiates**: New recruits undergoing bonding
- **Support Staff**: Scientists, logistics, normal humans
- **The Transformed**: Former Guardians who became aurora (ultimate price)

### Training
Recruits learn:
- Dimensional theory
- Aurora bonding techniques
- Breach sealing methods
- Outside entity recognition
- Reality stabilization
- Ultimate sacrifice protocols

### The Secret
Order knows:
- Gate is failing
- No permanent solution exists
- Final Transformation may be required (Guardians become aurora)
- This buys centuries, not eternity
- Eventually, everything ends

## The Dimensional War

### Ancient Conflict
3,000 years ago:
- Outside discovered Earth dimension
- Began crossing over
- Didn't realize contact was destructive
- Humans fought back
- Both sides suffered massive casualties

### The Barrier Solution
Neither side could win:
- Earth wizards created aurora gate
- Sacrificed first Guardians (became the Lights)
- Trapped some Outside entities in reality (still here)
- Trapped some humans Outside (still there)
- Established eternal stalemate

### Survivors
Both sides have remnants:
- **Outside entities trapped in reality**: Disguised, hiding, seeking home
- **Humans trapped Outside**: Changed beyond recognition, adapted
- **Neither fully committed to new war**: Both remember the cost
- **Some seeking peaceful solution**: Merge dimensions safely
- **Others seeking completion**: Finish what was started

## Factions

**Guardian Traditionalists**
- Maintain gate at all costs
- Accept final transformation if needed
- View Outside as existential threat
- Commander North's faction

**The Reformers**
- Seek alternative solutions
- Believe merger is possible
- Want to save Guardians from sacrifice
- Dr. Spectrum initially, before possession

**The Outsider Embassy** (Secret)
- Outside entities seeking peaceful contact
- Disguised as humans (poorly)
- Want negotiated merger
- Some genuine, some deceptive

**Reality Purists**
- Want Outside completely sealed
- Willing to destroy remaining aurora if needed
- Human supremacists
- See dimensional mixing as contamination

## Resolution Options

**1. The Final Transformation**
All Guardians sacrifice, become aurora, repair gate for centuries more

**2. The Merger**
Carefully blend dimensions, create new reality accepting both physics

**3. The Evacuation**
Move Earth to dimensional safe zone, abandon current location

**4. The Sealing**
Use ancient weapons to permanently close gate (kills aurora, ends Outside contact forever)

**5. The Acceptance**
Let gate fail, adapt to merged reality, accept dimensional chaos

Each has 50-100 year consequences shown in epilogue.
