### **World-Building Specification Brief: Chronicles of the Damned**

**Core Concept:** The Black Company, last Free Company of Khatovar, serves the Lady (evil sorceress-tyrant) as mercenaries, recording their deeds through the Annals while navigating loyalty versus redemption when they discover they're helping resurrect the Dominator (ancient dark lord).

**Key Factions:**
- **The Black Company:** Mercenary band four centuries old, loyal to each other and their contracts, serving evil but maintaining honor.
- **The Lady and Her Empire:** Sorceress-tyrant building empire, one of the Ten Who Were Taken, complex evil possibly seeking freedom.
- **The Taken:** Eleven immortal sorcerers enslaved to serve the Lady, inhuman and powerful.
- **The Circle/White Rose:** Rebels fighting the Lady's tyranny, led by reincarnated hero.
- **The Dominator:** Ancient dark lord imprisoned in Barrowland, ultimate evil seeking return.

**Key Locations:**
- **Northern Empire:** Territory conquered by the Lady, campaign grounds.
- **The Barrowland:** Ancient burial ground of Dominator and Taken, seals weakening.
- **Juniper:** Rebel stronghold, where White Rose offers redemption.
- **Plain of Fear:** Magical wasteland neutral to both sides.
- **Khatovar:** Legendary Company homeland, possibly mythical, tied to original sin.

**Magic Systems:**
- **Taken Sorcery:** Immortal sorcerers with vast power, inhuman perspective, enslaved but still dangerous.
- **Company Wizards:** One-Eye and Goblin provide limited magical support, bickering constantly.
- **The Lady's Power:** Centuries of sorcery, empire-building magic, complex motivations.
- **Ancient Bindings:** Magic that enslaved the Taken, seals holding the Dominator.

**Unique Mechanics:**
- **The Annals:** Players record campaign events, affecting Company morale and becoming permanent record.
- **Company Cohesion:** Loyalty system granting bonuses but requiring adherence to Company law.
- **Mercenary Pragmatism:** Attempting neutrality until personal investment makes it impossible.
- **Asymmetric Power:** Enemies vastly stronger, requiring cunning over direct combat.
- **Dark Humor:** Using banter to restore morale and remove fear.
