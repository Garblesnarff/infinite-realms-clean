# Creative Brief: Empire in Flames

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grimdark Renaissance (Warhammer Fantasy-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal aesthetic of *Warhammer Fantasy*, medieval warfare combined with body horror, and the darkness of Bosch paintings. This style captures the Old World's desperate struggle, Chaos corruption made visible, and the grim reality that in this universe, darkness is winning.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Grimdark:** Nothing is clean, hope is rare, survival is victory
*   **Corruption Visible:** Mutations, decay, reality warping, tentacles and eyes where they shouldn't be
*   **Renaissance Warfare:** Plate armor, halberds, gunpowder weapons, massive battles
*   **Chaos Iconography:** Eight-pointed stars, daemon imagery, corrupted symbols

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grimdark, Chaos corruption, desperate survival, body horror, apocalyptic war, mutation, despair with defiance
*   **Feeling:** The weight of fighting unwinnable war. Horror of corruption from within. Grim satisfaction of surviving another day against impossible odds.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Empire Colors:** Muddy browns, steel gray, blood red, tarnished gold
*   **Chaos Corruption:** Sickly greens (Nurgle), blood red (Khorne), purple-pink (Slaanesh), blue-purple (Tzeentch)
*   **Darkness:** Deep blacks, shadows that hide horrors
*   **Battle:** Smoke, fire, blood everywhere
*   **No Bright Hope:** Even "good" colors are muted and dirty
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of muddy browns and steel grays. Blood red dominates—on weapons, ground, clothing. Sickly green Chaos corruption spreads across one character's skin. Purple-pink warpfire in distance. Deep black shadows hide beastmen. Everything is dirty, worn, blood-stained. No clean or bright colors."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Witch Hunters:** Black leather coats, wide-brimmed hats, holy symbols, pistols and swords, grim expressions
*   **Imperial Soldiers:** Plate and mail armor, halberds, gunpowder weapons, religious iconography
*   **Chaos Warriors:** Massive spiked armor, mutations visible, daemon symbols, inhuman proportions
*   **Mutants:** Body horror—extra limbs, tentacles, eyes everywhere, skin diseases, bestial features
*   **Beastmen:** Goat-headed bray with human bodies, savage and corrupted
*   **Prompt Example:** "A witch hunter in black leather coat and wide-brimmed hat. Face is grim, scarred. Holds holy symbol and pistol. Behind them, an Imperial soldier in battered plate armor with halberd. Facing them: a Chaos warrior in massive spiked armor with tentacles growing from shoulders. A mutant cultist shows extra eyes and wrong-colored skin. Grimdark aesthetic throughout."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Empire Cities:** Medieval-renaissance architecture, cramped streets, mud, smoking chimneys
*   **Battlefields:** Corpses everywhere, smoke and fire, broken weapons, desperate fighting
*   **Chaos Wastes:** Reality breaking down—wrong angles, floating rocks, sky colors that don't exist
*   **Forests:** Dark, ancient, twisted trees, beastmen lurking, corruption spreading
*   **Sieges:** Massive walls, siege equipment, cities burning, defenders outnumbered
*   **Prompt Example:** "The siege of Middenheim. Massive stone walls topped with desperate defenders. Below, Chaos horde—thousands of warriors, beastmen, daemons. The city burns in multiple places. Bodies litter the ground. Daemon engines tower above normal troops. The sky swirls with unnatural colors. In foreground, exhausted Imperial soldiers hold a breach point. Everything is mud, blood, and desperation."

**5. Chaos and Corruption:**
*   **Mutations:** Extra limbs, tentacles, eyes, mouths, unnatural colors, bestial features
*   **Daemons:** Each Chaos God has distinct daemon types—bloodletters (Khorne), plaguebearers (Nurgle), horrors (Tzeentch), daemonettes (Slaanesh)
*   **Warpstone:** Glowing green-black stone that corrupts everything near it
*   **Reality Warping:** Gravity fails, colors wrong, geometry impossible near Chaos
*   **Body Horror:** Transformations shown in painful, disturbing detail
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Nurgle plague cultist showing advanced corruption. Skin green-gray and rotting. Extra mouths grow from stomach. One arm is tentacle. Flies swarm around them. Standing in ritual circle with warpstone at center—glowing sickly green. Behind them, plaguebearers (daemons) manifest—bloated, diseased, single horned. Reality warps around the ritual."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Chiaroscuro:** Deep shadows hiding horrors
*   **Fire Light:** Most light from burning buildings, torches, muzzle flashes
*   **Unnatural Glow:** Warpstone green, Chaos energies in wrong colors
*   **Overcast:** Rarely clear skies, usually smoke or storm clouds
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by burning city in background—orange and red firelight. Deep black shadows hide lurking threats. Warpstone glows sickly green, casting unnatural shadows. Overhead, storm clouds in wrong purple-pink tones. A Chaos sorcerer's spell provides harsh blue-purple illumination. Everything in high contrast—dramatic light and shadow."

## Voice

A battle-weary veteran's voice, scarred by what they've witnessed. The pacing is measured but carries urgency of impending doom. The tone shifts between grim determination and dark gallows humor. Occasional religious invocations to Sigmar. Underlying theme that victory means survival, not triumph. The voice carries weight of fighting unwinnable war. Whispers "in the grim darkness of the Old World, there is only war." Role: The voice of desperate defiance against inevitable darkness.
