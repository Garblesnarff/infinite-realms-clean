---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Empire in Flames
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Grimdark Fantasy / Chaos War / Survival Horror
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 20-26 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **14-17**
**Tone (keywords):** grimdark, Chaos corruption, Old World under siege, beastmen, daemons, witch hunters, mutation, despair
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In the Empire—humanity's last bastion in the Old World—the party are witch hunters, mercenaries, and desperate survivors facing the Storm of Chaos: a massive Chaos invasion led by Archaon the Everchosen, champion of the Dark Gods. Corruption spreads through mutation, beastmen emerge from forests, daemons breach reality, and cultists betray from within while greenskins and ratmen take advantage of humanity's weakness. The party must navigate a world where anyone could be corrupted, trust is fatal, and even victory means merely surviving another day in a universe where Chaos will eventually consume all—but perhaps they can delay it long enough for one more generation.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-26 sessions)

A four-act descent into grimdark war and corruption.

*   **Act I — Signs of Corruption (Sessions 1-6):** The party, working as witch hunters or mercenaries in the Empire, investigates reports of mutation in a rural village. They discover a Chaos cult worshiping the Dark Gods—Khorne the Blood God, Nurgle the Plague Father, Tzeentch the Changer, Slaanesh the Prince of Pleasure. First exposure to Chaos corruption: mutation, madness, daemon summoning. They learn the Empire is infiltrated at all levels. Cleansing the cult earns them notice from the Order of Witch Hunters, who recruit them for a larger investigation. Archaon's name is whispered in captured cultists' babble.
*   **Act II — The Gathering Storm (Sessions 7-13):** Intelligence suggests Archaon Everchosen is uniting Chaos warbands for the prophesied Storm of Chaos. The party travels across the Empire investigating corruption: nobles secretly worshiping Slaanesh, plague cults spreading Nurgle's rot, scholars corrupted by forbidden Tzeentch knowledge. They witness the Empire's decay: incompetent nobles, corrupt officials, witch hunters sometimes killing innocents. Beastmen raids increase from forests. Skaven (ratmen) undermine cities literally. Greenskin tribes mass at borders. As Chaos unites, the Old World fragments.
*   **Act III — The Storm Breaks (Sessions 14-20):** Archaon's horde crashes into the Empire. Cities burn, armies slaughter, daemons walk openly. The party must survive the apocalyptic war while completing critical missions: defend vital cities, assassinate Chaos champions, prevent daemon summoning rituals, uncover traitors. They witness horrors: entire populations corrupted, daemon princes leading legions, reality itself warping. Mutations spread—even party members risk corruption. Hope fades as the Empire loses ground, but Karl Franz, the Emperor, rallies defenders for desperate last stands.
*   **Act IV — The Last Stand (Sessions 21-26):** Archaon marches on Middenheim, the City of the White Wolf. If it falls, the Empire falls. The party joins the desperate defense alongside Imperial soldiers, dwarven allies, and even greenskins fighting their own battles against Chaos. They face Archaon's champions, prevent the summoning of greater daemons, and fight through streets turned hellscape. Final mission: reach Archaon himself. They can't kill him (he's beyond mortal power), but delaying him long enough for Magnus the Pious to arrive might turn the tide. Grimdark ending: victory means survival, not triumph. Chaos is pushed back but not defeated, the Empire survives but broken, and the party knows this will happen again.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores humanity's struggle against inevitable cosmic evil, the corruption of good intentions, whether victory is possible against overwhelming darkness, and if survival alone is enough. It asks: Can you fight evil without becoming it? Is delaying doom enough if doom is inevitable? Would you accept corruption to save others? The central conflict pits human determination against Chaos—literal embodiment of evil that cannot be permanently defeated.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Corruption & Mutation**
*   Exposure to Chaos causes corruption points
*   Accumulate through: witnessing daemons, touching warpstone, using Chaos weapons, dark magic
*   High corruption causes physical mutations—extra limbs, changed skin, tentacles
*   Must hide mutations or face execution by witch hunters
*   Zero corruption is nearly impossible in extended Chaos exposure
*   Can embrace corruption for power or resist at cost of effectiveness

### 2. **Insanity & Horror**
*   Witnessing Chaos horrors requires sanity checks
*   Failures cause mental disorders: paranoia, nightmares, obsessions
*   Accumulated insanity makes character unpredictable
*   PTSD is realistic consequence of war
*   Party members may go insane permanently

### 3. **Critical Hits & Gritty Combat**
*   Combat is brutal and deadly
*   Critical hits can sever limbs, cripple permanently
*   No guaranteed healing—wounds may never fully heal
*   Characters can be permanently maimed
*   Encourages caution and makes combat terrifying

### 4. **Trust No One**
*   NPCs might be secret cultists
*   Friendly faces could be corrupted
*   Party must investigate before trusting
*   Witch hunters sometimes kill innocents out of paranoia
*   Creates tense social situations

### 5. **Grimdark Tone**
*   Victory means survival, not triumph
*   No "good" choices, only lesser evils
*   Innocents die despite best efforts
*   World is unfair and cruel
*   Hope is fleeting but precious

### 6. **Chaos Alignment**
*   Four Chaos Gods offer different corruptions:
    *   **Khorne:** Bloodlust, martial prowess, mindless rage
    *   **Nurgle:** Disease resistance, horrific rot, accept decay
    *   **Tzeentch:** Magical power, scheming, change and madness
    *   **Slaanesh:** Enhanced senses, hedonism, obsessive excess
*   Each offers power at terrible cost
*   Undivided Chaos: serve all four, no specialty
*   Resisting all is heroic but weakening
