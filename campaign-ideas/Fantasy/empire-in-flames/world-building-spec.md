### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Empire in Flames**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the Empire—humanity's last bastion—witch hunters and soldiers face the Storm of Chaos: Archaon's massive invasion of Chaos warriors, daemons, and beastmen. Corruption spreads through mutation, trust is fatal, and victory means merely surviving in a grimdark world where Chaos will eventually consume all.

    *   Write the history of Magnus the Pious defeating previous Chaos invasion.
    *   Describe Archaon the Everchosen's rise as supreme Chaos champion.
    *   Explain the Empire's structure—fractious provinces united under Emperor Karl Franz.
    *   Detail the Old World's other threats: greenskins (orks/goblins), skaven (ratmen), undead, dark elves.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Character exposed to Chaos → **THEN:** Accumulates corruption, risks mutation.
*   **IF:** Mutation becomes visible → **THEN:** Witch hunters hunt character for purging.
*   **IF:** Chaos cultists left alive → **THEN:** Corruption spreads, more daemons manifest.
*   **IF:** Critical locations fall → **THEN:** Chaos advance accelerates, Empire fragments.
*   **IF:** Archaon reaches Middenheim → **THEN:** Final battle determines Empire's survival.
*   **IF:** Party embraces Chaos corruption → **THEN:** Gains power but eventually loses character to madness.
