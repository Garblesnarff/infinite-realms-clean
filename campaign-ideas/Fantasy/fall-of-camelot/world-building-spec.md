### **World-Building Specification Brief: Fall of Camelot**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** As newly appointed Knights of the Round Table, the party witnesses Camelot's golden age crumble from within—Lancelot and Guinevere's forbidden love, Mordred's treacherous plots, the deadly Grail Quest, and Morgan le Fay's vengeance—discovering that even perfect virtue cannot prevent tragedy when chivalric ideals force impossible choices between honor, love, and duty, ultimately determining what legacy survives Arthur's inevitable fall.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**

    *   Write about Mordred's origin (Arthur's incestuous son) and his claim to the throne
    *   Detail Morgan le Fay's grudges and magical opposition to Arthur's rule
    *   Explain the Holy Grail's nature and why its quest destroys more knights than it saves
    *   Describe Merlin's role, imprisonment by Nimue, and absence during Camelot's fall
    *   Detail the Round Table's significance—equality among knights and Arthur's vision
    *   Explain Excalibur's origin from the Lady of the Lake and its eventual return
    *   Describe Avalon and the prophecy that Arthur will return when Britain needs him

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Camelot** - Arthur's castle and court, the Round Table hall, peak of medieval civilization
*   **The Round Table Hall** - Where knights sit as equals, symbol of Arthur's justice and vision
*   **Avalon** - Mystical island of healing and magic, Arthur's origin and final destination
*   **The Grail Castle** - Impossible fortress appearing only to worthy seekers, deadly tests
*   **The Forest Perilous** - Enchanted wilderness with magical challenges and dark secrets
*   **Joyous Gard** - Lancelot's castle where forbidden lovers take refuge
*   **Morgan's Tower** - Sorceress's fortress where magic opposes Camelot's order
*   **Camlann** - Fateful battlefield where the dream dies in civil war
*   Each location represents different aspects of Arthurian legend and chivalric tragedy

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Lancelot and Guinevere's affair is exposed THEN Arthur must choose between love and justice
*   IF Arthur pursues justice against Guinevere THEN Lancelot rescues her causing civil war
*   IF the Grail Quest continues THEN more knights die or are corrupted by impossible standards
*   IF Galahad achieves the Grail THEN his perfection highlights others' failures
*   IF Mordred's plots succeed THEN Arthur's court fractures from within
*   IF Morgan's magic isn't countered THEN supernatural threats compound political chaos
*   IF knights choose sides THEN former friends face each other in battle
*   IF Arthur pursues Lancelot THEN Mordred seizes the throne in his absence
*   IF the party supports one faction THEN they make enemies of others permanently
*   IF chivalric ideals are maintained rigidly THEN human weakness causes tragedy
*   IF ideals are abandoned for pragmatism THEN Camelot's dream dies before the kingdom
*   IF Excalibur is returned to the lake THEN Arthur can pass to Avalon for healing
*   IF the party preserves key ideals THEN the Round Table's legacy survives the fall
*   IF they choose love over duty or duty over love THEN tragedy follows either path
*   IF they find middle ground THEN perhaps a new, wiser Camelot can eventually rise
