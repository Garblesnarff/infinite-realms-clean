## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Fall of Camelot
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Arthurian Legend Epic / Chivalric Romance / Political Tragedy

**Tone (keywords):** chivalric, romantic, tragic, noble ideals, courtly intrigue, doomed glory, legend becoming myth
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party serves as newly appointed Knights of the Round Table during Camelot's golden age, but beneath the surface, rot spreads through Arthur's kingdom—Lancelot and Guinevere's forbidden love, Mordred's plots for the throne, Morgan le Fay's sorcerous vengeance, and the corrupting influence of the Grail quest that destroys more knights than it saves. They must undertake legendary quests while navigating the impossible contradictions of chivalric ideals, discovering that even perfect virtue cannot prevent tragedy when honor, love, and duty conflict. As Camelot crumbles, they'll determine whether the dream of a just kingdom dies with Arthur or survives through new champions who learn from the fallen king's failures.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions)

A five-act tragedy following Camelot from glory to inevitable fall.

*   **Act I — The Golden Age (Sessions 1–4):** The party joins the Round Table at Camelot's height. They complete chivalric quests, defend the realm, and witness the beginning of forbidden love between Lancelot and Guinevere. The Grail appears in a vision, promising salvation.
*   **Act II — The Grail Quest (Sessions 5–9):** Knights depart seeking the Holy Grail. The party witnesses friends corrupted, killed, or driven mad by the impossible quest. Only the pure find the Grail, and purity proves rarer than believed. The Round Table begins fracturing.
*   **Act III — Love and Betrayal (Sessions 10–13):** Lancelot and Guinevere's affair is exposed. Arthur must choose between love and justice. Mordred uses the scandal to gather support for rebellion. Morgan le Fay's plots reach fruition. The party must choose sides as Camelot tears itself apart.
*   **Act IV — Civil War (Sessions 14–17):** Knights battle knights as Mordred raises rebellion. The party faces former friends in combat. Arthur pursues Lancelot while Mordred claims the throne. Every victory feels like defeat as the dream dies.
*   **Act V — The Last Battle (Sessions 18–20):** At Camlann, Arthur and Mordred fight their fated duel. The party determines what survives—the ideals, the legend, or the people. Excalibur returns to the lake, Arthur passes to Avalon, but the Round Table's legacy depends on the party's choices and sacrifices.

## Central Conflict

Impossible ideals versus human nature. Arthur built Camelot on chivalric perfection—knights must be honorable, just, brave, and pure. But humans cannot sustain perfection. Love conflicts with duty, mercy with justice, loyalty with truth. The tragedy is inevitable not because of evil, but because good people in impossible situations make understandable choices that compound into catastrophe. The party must decide if ideals that demand the impossible should be abandoned or if imperfect pursuit of perfect virtue still has meaning.
