# Dice of Dominion
*"Forty-two territories. Six continents. Millions of troops. Roll the dice—fate decides who conquers the world."*

## Campaign Overview

The world of Dominia is divided into exactly 42 territories across six continents (Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Australia). Control is determined by military occupation—each territory has armies (represented by troop counts) and borders with adjacent territories. The only way to expand is through Conquest: rolling dice in combat where luck determines victory.

Reality itself runs on Risk rules: when attacking, roll up to three dice (one per attacking army, max 3). Defenders roll up to two dice. Compare highest rolls—highest wins, ties go to defender. Each lost die eliminates one army. Repeat until attacker retreats or defender is eliminated and territory conquered. Turn structure is sacred law: Deploy reinforcements → Attack territories → Fortify one border. Breaking these phases causes cosmic disruption.

The campaign begins during the annual World Conquest Tournament where six major factions (one per continent) battle for global domination. But the impossible occurs: a territory is conquered without dice being rolled. Then armies move without a turn being taken. The fundamental laws of Risk are breaking down. Someone is manipulating the Dice of Fate, allowing them to conquer without chance, deploy without rules, and bypass the turn structure.

The party must investigate this Reality Breach while participating in the conquest themselves. They'll control territories, marshal armies, make and break alliances, achieve continental bonuses, turn in matched card sets for reinforcements, and engage in massive dice-based warfare. The mystery leads to a conspiracy at the highest level: the Game Master who oversees all conquest is trying to end the eternal war by making one faction so powerful they achieve total world domination—but at the cost of destroying free will and turning all future battles into predetermined outcomes.

## Core Themes

- **Global Conquest**: Imperial expansion and territorial control
- **Dice as Destiny**: Luck versus strategy in warfare
- **Alliance and Betrayal**: Temporary partnerships that inevitably break
- **Resource Management**: Army deployment and reinforcement calculation
- **Continental Power**: Controlling entire continents grants bonuses
- **The Eternal War**: Conflict that never truly ends, only shifts borders

## Campaign Sessions (30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Border Skirmishes (Sessions 1-8)
Party starts controlling one territory each. Learn Risk mechanics through small-scale conflicts. Witness the first Reality Breach—a territory conquered without dice. Investigation begins. First alliances and betrayals. Introduction to the six continental factions and their leaders.

### Arc 2: Continental Conquest (Sessions 9-18)
Party expands across borders, attempting to control at least one continent for bonus reinforcements. Massive battles using dozens of dice. Card set mechanics introduced—turn in matched sets (three infantry, three cavalry, three artillery, or one of each) for reinforcement armies. Discovery that the Dice of Fate are being loaded by someone with access to probability manipulation.

### Arc 3: The Alliance Wars (Sessions 19-25)
All six factions form temporary alliances. The party must navigate shifting loyalties, knowing all alliances will eventually collapse. Discovery of the Game Master's conspiracy. Must decide whether to support total conquest (one faction wins permanently) or eternal war (balanced conflict continues forever).

### Arc 4: World Domination (Sessions 26-30)
Final push for global control. Massive battles across all six continents. The party's faction (or the party themselves) must either achieve total domination of all 42 territories or prevent anyone from achieving it. Climax involves confronting the Game Master. Multiple endings based on conquest outcomes.

## Key NPCs

### The Game Master (Overseer of Conquest)
Cosmic entity that referees all warfare, enforces turn structure, and validates dice rolls. Revealed to be manipulating the Dice of Fate to end the eternal war by creating an unstoppable conqueror.

### Empress Austral (Australia Warlord)
Controls the smallest continent (4 territories) but receives +2 armies per turn—the best reinforcement-to-territory ratio. Tactical genius who uses Australia's defensibility (only one border) to build massive armies then explode outward.

### Shogun Sino (Asia Emperor)
Controls the largest continent (12 territories) granting +7 armies per turn—powerful but hard to defend due to numerous borders. Commands the most troops but struggles with overextension.

### General Europa (Europe Commander)
Controls 7 territories for +5 army bonus. Moderate size, central location. Master of alliance politics—always has temporary partners until the moment of betrayal.

### High Chief Gondwana (Africa Leader)
Controls 6 territories for +3 armies. Defensive position with only 3 external borders. Patient strategist who builds slowly and strikes decisively.

### Conquistador Americas (Combined Americas Ruler)
Controls both North and South America (9 and 4 territories respectively). Attempting to hold both continents simultaneously for +9 armies total—extremely powerful if successful, vulnerable if broken.

### The Dice Prophet (Probability Seer)
Can see all possible die roll outcomes before they occur. Being used by the Game Master to load dice and determine battles before they're fought. Moral crisis between power and fairness.

### The Card Keeper (Set Master)
Guardian of the Risk cards that grant reinforcement armies. Each territory captured grants one card. Three matched cards can be turned in for escalating reinforcements (4, then 6, then 8, then 10, increasing infinitely). The Card Keeper knows the value of accumulated cards.

### The Border Guards (Fortification Spirits)
Entities that exist on territory borders. Enforce the Fortification Rule (move armies from one territory to another adjacent territory you control, once per turn). Can be bribed or negotiated with.

### The Reinforcement Calculator (The Counter)
Cosmic accountant who calculates bonus armies: territories controlled ÷ 3, plus continental bonuses, plus card sets. Absolutely precise, incorruptible, mathematical. The only NPC who cannot be manipulated.

## Major Locations

### The 42 Territories
Each has distinct character: Iceland (isolated, defensible), Ukraine (seven borders, contested), Siam (choke point to Australia), Congo (interior Africa), etc. Controlling specific territories provides strategic advantages.

### The Six Continents
- **Australia**: Smallest, most defensible, best ratio
- **South America**: Small, two entry points, solid bonus
- **Africa**: Medium size, three entry points, balanced
- **North America**: Large, three entry points, valuable
- **Europe**: Medium, many borders, political center
- **Asia**: Largest, hardest to hold, maximum bonus

### The Dice Crucible
Where the Dice of Fate are forged. A massive cosmic foundry where probability is literally manufactured. The party discovers it's being manipulated to create loaded dice.

### The War Room
Central command where the Game Master oversees all conflicts. A massive map showing all 42 territories with armies represented by colored pieces. The board updates in real-time.

### The Card Vault
Where Risk cards are stored. Each territory has a corresponding card showing infantry, cavalry, or artillery. Matched sets can be turned in here for reinforcement armies.

### Fortification Highways
The border connections between territories. Armies can march along these during the Fortify phase. Some connections are one-way (sea routes) while others are two-way (land borders).

### The Eternal Battlefield
A neutral ground where disputes are resolved through pure dice combat without territory stakes. The party can challenge NPCs here to test strategies.

## Unique Mechanics

### Army Deployment
Each turn, receive reinforcement armies based on: territories controlled ÷ 3 (minimum 3), continental bonuses, and card sets turned in. Must strategically place armies where they're most needed.

### Dice Combat
Attacker rolls 1-3 dice, defender rolls 1-2 dice. Compare highest rolls. Highest wins, ties to defender. Each lost die = one eliminated army. Repeat until territory is conquered or attacker retreats.

### Continental Bonuses
Controlling all territories in a continent grants bonus armies each turn: Asia +7, North America +5, Europe +5, Africa +3, South America +2, Australia +2.

### Card Mechanics
Capturing a territory grants a Risk card. Cards show infantry, cavalry, or artillery. Turn in three matched cards (three infantry, three cavalry, three artillery, or one of each) for escalating reinforcements.

### Fortification
Once per turn, move any number of armies from one controlled territory to an adjacent controlled territory. This allows repositioning forces without combat.

### Alliance System
Players can form temporary alliances with NPCs or each other. Alliances grant bonuses but can be broken at any time. Breaking an alliance imposes trust penalties.

### Elimination
If a player loses all territories, they're eliminated from the game. Their cards go to whoever eliminated them. This is permadeath unless resurrected through special means.

### Strategic Objectives
Instead of total conquest, players can win by achieving specific objectives (control Asia and South America, control 24 territories, etc.).

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: The Dice Are Sentient
The Dice of Fate have consciousness and are intentionally creating inequality because they feed on the drama of warfare and the emotions of conquest.

### Twist 2: All Factions Are Puppets
The six continental leaders are all controlled by the Game Master—there are no real independent actors, just the illusion of choice.

### Twist 3: The World Is Flat
The map is not a globe but a flat plane. The edges are actual boundaries beyond which is void. Australia's isolation is literal—it's on the edge of existence.

### Twist 4: Cards Control Reality
The Risk cards don't represent armies—they are armies. Turning in a card set doesn't grant reinforcements; it creates them from nothing, generating matter from information.

### Twist 5: Total Conquest Is Impossible
The game is mathematically designed to never allow total world domination. When someone gets close, Reality Breaches occur to rebalance power.

## Victory Conditions

### Total World Domination
Conquer all 42 territories. Achieve the ultimate Risk victory. Become the sole ruler of Dominia. This may break reality by completing a game meant to be eternal.

### Continental Supremacy
Control at least four continents simultaneously. Achieve dominant but not total power. This is stable victory that allows the eternal war to continue.

### Assassination Victory
Instead of conquering territories, eliminate all rival faction leaders. Leaderless factions collapse, granting territory control without battle.

### Diplomatic Unity
Convince all six factions to form a permanent alliance rather than continuing conquest. End the eternal war through cooperation rather than domination.

### Destroy the Dice
Shatter the Dice of Fate, removing chance from combat. This either makes warfare deterministic (stronger always wins) or impossible (can't resolve conflicts).

## Defeat Conditions

### Total Elimination
Lose all territories, all armies, all cards. Removed from the game. Permadeath unless resurrected.

### Dice Betrayal
The Dice of Fate turn against the party, making all their rolls minimum while enemies roll maximum. Mathematically impossible to win battles.

### Continental Collapse
Lose continents faster than you can gain them, spiraling into resource deficit. Unable to generate enough reinforcements to defend.

### Alliance Annihilation
All allies simultaneously betray the party, attacking from multiple fronts. Surrounded and crushed by coordinated assault.

### Reality Breach
If too many Risk rules are broken, reality itself fragments. The 42 territories dissolve into chaos and war becomes meaningless.
