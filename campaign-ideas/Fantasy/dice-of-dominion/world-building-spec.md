# World-Building Specification: Dice of Dominion

## Faction Details

### The Australian Compact (Empress Austral)
**Territories**: 4 (Indonesia, New Guinea, Western Australia, Eastern Australia)
**Bonus**: +2 armies per turn
**Strategy**: Turtle in defensible position, build massive army, explode outward into Asia
**Philosophy**: "Patience and preparation. We are few, so each soldier must count."
**Weakness**: Small base means any loss is proportionally devastating

### The Asian Supremacy (Shogun Sino)
**Territories**: 12 (Afghanistan, China, India, Irkutsk, Japan, Kamchatka, Middle East, Mongolia, Siam, Siberia, Ural, Yakutsk)
**Bonus**: +7 armies per turn
**Strategy**: Dominate through sheer numbers, control the center of the map
**Philosophy**: "Size is strength. We are many, therefore we are mighty."
**Weakness**: Too many borders to defend, constant pressure from all sides

### The European Federation (General Europa)
**Territories**: 7 (Great Britain, Iceland, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Southern Europe, Ukraine, Western Europe)
**Bonus**: +5 armies per turn
**Strategy**: Political maneuvering, temporary alliances, central position for rapid response
**Philosophy**: "Diplomacy is warfare by other means. A well-timed betrayal wins wars."
**Weakness**: Central location means enemies on all borders

### The African Unity (High Chief Gondwana)
**Territories**: 6 (Congo, East Africa, Egypt, Madagascar, North Africa, South Africa)
**Bonus**: +3 armies per turn
**Strategy**: Defensive consolidation, three chokepoints, patient expansion
**Philosophy**: "Let them fight among themselves. We fortify and strike when they're weak."
**Weakness**: Moderate bonus, not enough to dominate quickly

### The American Empire (Conquistador Americas)
**Territories**: 13 total (North America: 9, South America: 4)
**Bonuses**: +5 (NA) + +2 (SA) = +7 if holding both
**Strategy**: Hold both continents, control entire western hemisphere, maximum bonuses
**Philosophy**: "Two continents, one destiny. Manifest Destiny scales globally."
**Weakness**: Defending two continents simultaneously is extremely difficult

## The Risk Rules as Physical Laws

### Turn Structure is Time
The three phases (Deploy, Attack, Fortify) are not arbitrary—they're how time flows. Deploy phase is dawn, Attack is day, Fortify is dusk. Breaking phase order causes temporal distortion.

### Dice Determine Causality
In normal reality, stronger always defeats weaker. In Dominia, dice introduce true randomness. This makes the universe unpredictable and therefore free-willed.

### Armies Are Souls
Each army unit is a soul given military form. When an army is eliminated, that soul returns to the cosmic reserve until redeployed. Death is temporary; conquest is eternal.

### Borders Are Sacred
Territory borders are not just lines but actual metaphysical barriers. Crossing them without proper turn structure causes reality damage.

### Cards Create Matter
Risk cards literally create armies from nothing when turned in. This violates conservation of mass, proving reality runs on game logic, not physics.

## The Revelation

The eternal war is intentional—it's a cosmic mechanism to prevent stagnation. If one faction achieves total domination, reality freezes (victory condition met, game ends, existence stops). The Game Master's plan to load the dice and force total conquest would end time itself. True wisdom is maintaining eternal conflict at balanced level—enough war to drive change, but never enough for total victory. The party must decide: end the war (and possibly end time) or embrace eternal conflict as the nature of existence.
