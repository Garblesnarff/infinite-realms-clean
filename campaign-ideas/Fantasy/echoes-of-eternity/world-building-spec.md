## Worldline Mechanics and Theory

### Divergence Calculation

**Formula Elements:**
- Number of changed events
- Significance of each change
- Cascade effects triggered
- Time distance from alteration
- Resistance from attractor field

**Divergence Levels:**
- **0.00-0.50%**: Minimal change, barely noticeable
- **0.51-2.00%**: Small changes, party aware but manageable
- **2.01-10.00%**: Significant differences, major events altered
- **10.01-30.00%**: Dramatically different world, major adjustment
- **30.01-50.00%**: Barely recognizable reality
- **50.01%+**: Complete alternate world, party might not exist

**Escape Velocity:**
- Need 1.048596% divergence to escape Shattering attractor
- Precise calculation required
- Too little: pulled back to catastrophe
- Too much: unpredictable consequences
- Sweet spot is narrow

### Attractor Field Theory

**Concept:** Cosmic forces pull timelines toward certain outcomes

**Properties:**
- Like gravity wells in causality
- Stronger around significant events
- Multiple attractors can conflict
- Escaping requires precise divergence
- Some are universal constants

**Major Attractors in Campaign:**
- **The Shattering**: Primary attractor, very strong
- **Convergence Events**: Minor but numerous
- **Fixed Points**: Absolute attractors, cannot escape
- **Character Fates**: Personal attractors affecting individuals
- **Historical Inevitabilities**: Cultural/societal attractors

**Working With Attractors:**
- Cannot fight directly, must redirect
- Find divergence point before attractor forms
- Use attractor's momentum against itself
- Thread needle between multiple attractors
- Accept some things cannot change

### Worldline Stability

**Stable Worldlines:**
- Self-consistent causality
- No major unresolved paradoxes
- Attractor fields balanced
- Reality feels "solid"
- Can persist indefinitely

**Unstable Worldlines:**
- Contradictory causality
- Building paradoxes
- Attractor field conflicts
- Reality feels "wrong"
- Will collapse or merge with stable line

**Stabilization Methods:**
- Resolve causality conflicts
- Accept convergence points
- Lock worldline with ritual
- Remove contradiction sources
- Time and adjustment

### Reading Steiner Development

**Stage 1: Awareness**
- Vague feeling something changed
- Deja vu and confusion
- Occasional dual memories
- Easy to dismiss
- No control

**Stage 2: Recognition**
- Clear memory of changes
- Can identify worldline shifts
- Comparative memory of timelines
- Conscious awareness developing
- Minor headaches

**Stage 3: Full Reading Steiner**
- Complete memory of all experienced worldlines
- Instant recognition of shifts
- Can sense divergence building
- Psychological strain significant
- Risk of timeline confusion

**Stage 4: Overload**
- Too many worldline memories
- Difficulty distinguishing "real" timeline
- Identity crisis
- Possible madness
- Need grounding and support

**Stage 5: Mastery (Rare)**
- Comfortable with multiple timelines
- Use knowledge strategically
- Mental discipline prevents confusion
- Accept fluid nature of reality
- Prophet achieved this but at great cost

### The Bootstrap Paradox Problem

**Campaign Bootstrap:**
- Prophet warns party
- Party tries to prevent Shattering
- Attempts create Prophet (future PC)
- Prophet goes back to warn party
- Loop has no beginning

**Implications:**
- Campaign might be self-creating
- No "original" timeline
- Everything is consequence of itself
- Philosophically troubling
- But functionally stable

**Resolution Options:**
- Accept loop and work within it
- Find way to break loop (risky)
- Discover loop was created intentionally
- Embrace paradox as solution
- Leave ambiguous for players to decide

## The Shattering - Detailed Analysis

### Event Description

**Manifestation:**
- Begins at Convergence Point Plaza exactly at noon
- Reality fractures outward in expanding wave
- Time distortions: areas in stasis, others accelerated
- Massive energy discharge
- Casualties in hundreds of thousands

**Immediate Effects:**
- Central kilometer completely destroyed
- City infrastructure collapse
- Temporal anomalies throughout region
- Survivors experience time distortions
- Communication breakdown

**Long-term Consequences:**
- Kingdom destabilized
- Refugee crisis
- Economic collapse
- Neighboring nations invade
- Civilization setback centuries

### Possible Causes (GM Chooses)

**Option 1: Worldline Convergence Overload**
- Too many timelines trying to exist in same space
- Critical mass of paradoxes
- Reality cannot sustain contradictions
- Catastrophic resolution

**Option 2: Chronograph Side Effect**
- Device damages reality with each use
- Cumulative damage reaches critical point
- Shattering is reality's immune response
- Using it to prevent it makes it worse

**Option 3: Deliberate Act**
- Someone causes it intentionally
- Architect's plan gone wrong
- Assassination on cosmic scale
- Could be prevented with right knowledge

**Option 4: Natural Phenomenon**
- Ley line convergence creates periodic instability
- Happened before in prehistory
- Will happen again in future
- Can only be mitigated, not prevented

**Option 5: Bootstrap Paradox**
- Shattering happens because party tries to prevent it
- Predestination paradox
- Attempts to stop it are what cause it
- Only way to prevent is to not try

### Prevention Strategies

**Direct Prevention:**
- Stop proximate cause
- Evacuate convergence point
- Stabilize ley lines
- High risk of making worse

**Timeline Escape:**
- Reach divergence where Shattering doesn't occur
- Beta worldline strategy
- Requires precise calculations
- Some people won't exist there

**Mitigation:**
- Cannot prevent but can reduce casualties
- Warning system for evacuation
- Magical shielding
- Partial victory

**Acceptance:**
- Some events are inevitable
- Focus on rebuilding after
- Preserving knowledge for survivors
- Philosophical approach
