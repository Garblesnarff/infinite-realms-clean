## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A tale of breaking, training, and reclaiming what was lost.

*   **Act I — The Fall (Sessions 1–5):** The campaign begins with the players witnessing the Nightwatch's brutal defeat at the hands of Shatterbane, a calculating villain who has studied the hero's every weakness. The Nightwatch is left broken—spine shattered, mind traumatized—and barely escapes with the players' help. As the hero recovers in hiding, Shatterbane takes on the Nightwatch's identity, wearing the armor and wielding the symbol, but using fear and brutality instead of justice. The city, desperate for order, accepts this twisted version of their hero.
*   **Act II — The Training (Sessions 6–11):** The Nightwatch realizes they cannot return as they were. They choose a successor—Jean-Paul, a zealous warrior with exceptional skill but dangerous fanaticism. The players must help train Jean-Paul while managing the recovering Nightwatch's mental and physical rehabilitation. But as Jean-Paul fights Shatterbane's criminal empire, he becomes increasingly brutal and uncontrollable, interpreting justice as vengeance. The party faces a dilemma: support Jean-Paul's effective but violent methods, or prepare the original Nightwatch for a return they may not be ready for.
*   **Act III — The Reclamation (Sessions 12–15+):** When Jean-Paul crosses a line the party cannot ignore, the Nightwatch must rise again—not as the hero they were, but as something new. They confront Jean-Paul, reclaim the mantle, and face Shatterbane in a final confrontation that tests whether the hero has truly healed or merely hidden their brokenness. The players must decide: does the city need the old Nightwatch, Jean-Paul's brutal efficiency, or a new kind of hero entirely?

    *   **Personality:** Determined but haunted. They oscillate between hope and despair, questioning whether they can ever truly heal.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They fear that even if their body heals, their mind never will. They wonder if Jean-Paul might be the better hero.

    *   **Role:** The mastermind villain who broke the Nightwatch and now wears their symbol as a twisted tyrant.

3.  **Jean-Paul (Azrael)** — *The Zealous Successor*
    *   **Role:** A warrior trained by a religious order, chosen to temporarily take on the Nightwatch's mantle.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity, trauma, redemption, and what makes a hero. The central conflict is not just between heroes and villains, but between different philosophies of justice: the Nightwatch's hope-driven heroism, Jean-Paul's fear-driven judgment, and Shatterbane's tyrannical order. Can a broken hero truly heal? Can a zealot be tempered? And who has the right to wear the symbol that defines hope for an entire city?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Recovery Track**
*   The Nightwatch has a Recovery score from 0 to 100, representing physical and mental healing.
*   The party's actions (successful therapy, rehabilitation training, emotional support) increase this score.
*   At certain thresholds (25, 50, 75, 100), the Nightwatch regains abilities and can begin training again.
*   Setbacks (Jean-Paul's brutality, Shatterbane's taunts, witnessing civilian deaths) can decrease the score.

### 2. **Jean-Paul's Zeal Meter**
*   Jean-Paul has a hidden Zeal score that increases when he uses brutal tactics or when the party encourages violence.
*   At high Zeal, he gains combat bonuses but becomes uncontrollable and may kill enemies who surrender.
*   The party can reduce Zeal through roleplay (appeals to mercy, showing alternative approaches) or by removing him from duty temporarily.

### 3. **Symbol of the Bat**
*   The Nightwatch's symbol has power in the city—it inspires hope or fear depending on who wears it.
*   When Shatterbane or Jean-Paul wears it, the city's morale shifts. The DM tracks "Public Faith" in the symbol.
*   If Public Faith drops too low, the symbol becomes associated with tyranny. If maintained high, it remains a beacon of hope.
*   The final confrontation's outcome affects whether the symbol can be redeemed.
