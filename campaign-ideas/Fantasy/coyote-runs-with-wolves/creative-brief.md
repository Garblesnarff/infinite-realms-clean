# Creative Brief: Coyote Runs with Wolves

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Pacific Northwest Urban Fantasy with Pack Dynamics (Mercy Thompson-inspired)

Inspired by the practical urban fantasy of *Mercy Thompson* with Pacific Northwest aesthetics meeting shapeshifter pack culture. This style captures the Columbia Basin landscape, werewolf transformation and hierarchy, and the contrast between normal garage work and supernatural violence.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Shapeshifter Nature:** Wolf forms, mid-transformation, pack dynamics through body language
*   **Pacific Northwest Setting:** Columbia River, desert scrubland, Tri-Cities architecture, practical American West
*   **Working Class Heroism:** Mechanic's garage, practical clothing, blue-collar settings meeting supernatural threats
*   **Pack Hierarchy:** Dominance displays, protective stances, wolf body language translated to human interactions

*   **Supernatural Threats:** Vampire pallor, fae otherworldliness, witch magic in dark purples
*   **Prompt Example:** "...Columbia Basin landscape with scrubland in sage green and tan. The Columbia River flows blue-gray in the background. Sunset casts orange light. A VW garage sits in the foreground. Werewolves in human form show protective pack stances."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Werewolves in Human Form:** Strong builds, practical clothing (jeans, work shirts), subtle dominance in posture

*   **Walker (Coyote):** Smaller, more agile, coyote form with clever eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A woman mechanic in practical work clothes—oil-stained coveralls, steel-toed boots, hair tied back. Strong, competent expression. Behind her, a large gray werewolf in protective stance. VW Beetle being repaired in garage background. Columbia Basin visible through garage door."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Garage:** Working VW repair shop with tools, lifts, parts, oil stains—real business

*   **Pack Territory:** Fenced properties, pack house as fortress, defended boundaries
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of VW repair garage. Practical work space with tool chests, car lift, parts shelves. A classic VW Beetle being repaired. Through the office window, Columbia Basin landscape visible. Lived-in, working business atmosphere."

**5. Supernatural Elements:**

*   **River Reflections:** Water light playing across scenes near Columbia River
*   **Pack Protection:** Lighting emphasizes group formation and territory defense
