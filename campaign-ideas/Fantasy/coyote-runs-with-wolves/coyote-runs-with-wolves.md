## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of pack integration, political maneuvering, and defending territory from overwhelming threats.

*   **Act I — Pack Territory (Sessions 1-6):** The party establishes their place in the Tri-Cities supernatural community. They navigate Columbia Basin pack politics, learning about pack hierarchy, dominance challenges, and mate bonds. They encounter the local vampire seethe led by Marsilia and discover the fae reservation nearby, learning why the Gray Lords are feared. A series of supernatural murders threatens to expose all preternatural creatures before the planned coming out. They must solve the crimes while navigating pack justice versus human law.
*   **Act II — Court Politics and Fae Games (Sessions 7-12):** The party becomes entangled with vampire court politics when they witness a crime and must testify before Marsilia's court. They learn about vampiric menaces (feeding, territory, and dominance laws) and face execution if they fail. Meanwhile, the fae reservation's Gray Lords draw them into ancient bargains and cruel games. A party member may owe a debt to the fae or need something only they can provide—every bargain extracts a price. They discover a conspiracy involving rogue werewolves, fae rebels, and a powerful witch.
*   **Act III — The War for the Tri-Cities (Sessions 13-20):** Multiple threats converge: a European werewolf pack challenges the Columbia Basin pack for territory, vampires from other seethe seek to claim Marsilia's domain, and the fae grow active as their reservation boundaries weaken. The party must defend their territory while navigating complex alliances. The vampire master Blackwood arrives with ancient power, the fae River Devil emerges, and a pack of rogue werewolves backed by a witch threaten everyone. The final confrontation requires uniting werewolves, vampires, fae, and others to protect the Tri-Cities. Some may take mates, others may die defending pack territory.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of pack loyalty versus personal conscience, the price of power and alliances, freedom versus security in relationships, and protecting home territory. It asks: What makes a pack family? How do you maintain individuality in hierarchical structures? Can different supernatural species coexist? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect their territory and community against outside forces seeking to claim it, while navigating complex internal politics of pack, seethe, and court.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Pack Hierarchy and Dominance**
*   Werewolf packs have strict hierarchies: Alpha, Beta, enforcers, submissives
*   Dominance challenges can happen anytime; refusing means losing status
*   Pack bonds create supernatural loyalty and connection
*   Lone wolves are vulnerable and often unstable

### 2. **Mate Bonds**
*   Werewolves can form mate bonds—supernatural partnerships
*   Mate bonds create empathic connection and protective instincts
*   Harming a mate drives the other to berserker rage
*   Bonds can form instantly or develop over time

### 3. **Walker Abilities**
*   Walkers (like coyotes) are shapeshifters but not werewolves
*   Can shift without moon influence or pain
*   Natural immunity to magic and mind control
*   Viewed as lesser by werewolves but underestimated

### 4. **Vampire Blood Bonds**
*   Drinking vampire blood once grants healing and awareness
*   Drinking twice creates connection; vampire can find you
*   Drinking thrice creates compulsion; must obey vampire commands
*   Blood bonds fade over time if not reinforced

### 5. **Fae Bargains**
*   Fae cannot lie but excel at exact wording and loopholes
*   Every favor demands payment—often more than expected
*   Breaking fae agreements brings terrible consequences
*   Some debts pass to descendants or last for generations

### 6. **The Gray Lords**
*   Most powerful fae, terrifyingly ancient
*   Enforce fae law with absolute cruelty
*   Can kill with a word or gesture
*   Even other fae fear them completely

### 7. **Preternatural Revelation**
*   Supernatural beings are coming out to human awareness
*   Must control narrative or face extermination
*   Some humans hunt preternaturals; others are fascinated
*   Political maneuvering determines how humans react

### 8. **Territory and Sacred Ground**
*   Supernatural beings claim and defend territories
*   Pack territory is sacred; trespass invites challenge
*   Homes where you're invited become safe havens
*   Neutral grounds exist where all species can meet safely
