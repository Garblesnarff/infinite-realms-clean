**Coyote Runs with Wolves**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the Tri-Cities of Washington's Columbia Basin, supernatural beings navigate pack politics, vampire seethe, and fae reservations. A walker (coyote shapeshifter) mechanic leads the party through werewolf hierarchies, mate bonds, and ancient bargains.

    *   Describe the fae reservation system created after the Gray Lords agreed to treaties with humanity.
    *   Explain vampire seethe structure, the menaces (rules), and how Masters maintain control.
