**Factions of Sigil**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In Sigil—the City of Doors at the center of the multiverse—the party becomes embroiled in a philosophical war between fifteen factions whose beliefs literally shape reality. As newcomers to the planes, they must navigate faction politics, portal networks, and the enigmatic Lady of Pain while discovering that their beliefs have tangible power across the planes.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the creation of Sigil and the Lady of Pain's mysterious origins and authority.
    *   Write the history of the fifteen factions and their competing philosophies.
    *   Describe the Great Upheaval when Aoskar (god of portals) challenged the Lady and was destroyed.
    *   Explain the structure of the outer planes and how alignment shapes reality.
    *   Detail the Blood War between devils and demons and how it affects Sigil's neutrality.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Lady's Ward:** Government center, faction headquarters, Hall of Speakers where factions debate.
*   **The Hive:** Lawless slums where portals open randomly and reality is unstable.

*   **The Mazes:** Infinite personal prisons the Lady creates for troublemakers.
*   **Aoskar's Temple:** Hidden shrine in the Astral where the dead god's corpse floats.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A character commits to a faction philosophy → **THEN:** Gains faction powers but must act according to that belief or lose them.
*   **IF:** The party worships the Lady of Pain → **THEN:** Instant death by flaying (cardinal sin).
*   **IF:** Faction war escalates too far → **THEN:** The Lady mazes faction leaders to restore order.
*   **IF:** Portals begin failing → **THEN:** Sigil becomes isolated from planes; panic spreads.
*   **IF:** Party's belief grows strong enough → **THEN:** They can manifest minor reality alterations and create temporary portals.
