In the City of Doors—Sigil, the impossible metropolis at the center of the multiverse—the party becomes embroiled in the philosophical war between fifteen factions whose beliefs literally shape reality. As Clueless primes (newcomers to the planes), they must navigate dabus architects, portal keys, blood war refugees, and the enigmatic Lady of Pain while discovering that belief is the most powerful force in existence. Their choices will determine which faction philosophy prevails and whether Sigil remains the neutral ground where all planes meet, or becomes dominated by a single ideology.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-30 sessions)

A four-act journey from confused newcomers to shapers of planar philosophy itself.

*   **Act I — The Clueless (Sessions 1-8):** The party arrives in Sigil through random portals, learning its impossible geography and meeting faction recruiters. Each offers a different philosophy: belief creates reality, chaos is truth, order must reign, or nothing matters. They take odd jobs for various factions, exploring the planes through Sigil's infinite portals, and slowly realize their beliefs are manifesting tangible effects. A faction war begins brewing as philosophical tensions escalate.
*   **Act II — Faction Allegiances (Sessions 9-16):** The party must choose which faction(s) to join or oppose as the Faction War intensifies. They travel to outer planes—Mount Celestia's perfection, the Abyss's chaos, Mechanus's clockwork order, and Limbo's raw potential—each demonstrating a faction's philosophy taken to extreme. They uncover a conspiracy: someone is manipulating factions to eliminate the Lady of Pain's neutrality, and several factions have already been secretly compromised.
*   **Act III — The Great Upheaval (Sessions 17-23):** Open warfare erupts in Sigil's streets as factions clash. The party investigates who benefits from destabilizing the city and discovers an ancient power trying to seize control of the portal nexus. They must forge alliances between traditionally opposed factions, navigate the Mazes the Lady of Pain creates for troublemakers, and prevent the City of Doors from sealing forever. The Lady's dabus servants offer cryptic warnings in visual rebuses.
*   **Act IV — Belief Ascendant (Sessions 24-30):** The mastermind is revealed—a dead power seeking resurrection through mass belief generated by faction war. The party must unite the factions under a common philosophy (or impose their own), confront entities from across the planes who have chosen sides, and face the ultimate question: do they preserve Sigil's neutrality, let one faction's philosophy reign supreme, or forge something entirely new? The Lady of Pain watches, and Her judgment will be final.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the power of belief, the nature of truth in a multiverse where philosophy shapes reality, the balance between order and chaos, and whether neutrality or conviction should govern existence. It asks: Is one philosophy superior to all others? Can belief literally change reality? What gives anyone the right to impose their worldview on others? The central conflict pits the party's growing philosophical convictions against a conspiracy that would sacrifice Sigil's neutrality for divine resurrection.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Belief Pool**
*   Characters have a Belief Pool representing the strength of their philosophical conviction
*   Gained by acting according to chosen faction's philosophy, lost by contradicting it
*   Spend belief points to: alter minor reality, resist planar effects, power faction abilities, manifest philosophy
*   In Sigil and on outer planes, belief has tangible mechanical effects

### 2. **Faction Powers**
*   Each faction grants unique supernatural abilities based on their philosophy
*   Sensates (experience seekers) can relive memories and borrow skills
*   Dustmen (death seekers) resist emotion and negative energy
*   Guvners (law students) predict outcomes through universal laws
*   Xaositects (chaos followers) generate random beneficial effects
*   Powers grow stronger as belief in the philosophy deepens

### 3. **Portal Mechanics**
*   Sigil contains infinite portals to every plane, each requiring a unique "key" (object, word, condition)
*   Party must discover keys through investigation, experimentation, and NPC information
*   Random portals appear near the party based on their beliefs and desires
*   Late game: party can create temporary portals through pure belief

### 4. **The Cant (Planar Slang)**
*   Sigil's inhabitants speak the cant—planar slang that affects social interactions
*   Using cant properly grants bonuses to persuasion, deception, and insight with planar beings
*   Includes terms like: berk (fool), bubber (drunk), cutter (tough person), cross-trade (betray), darks (secrets), in the dead-book (dead), jink (money), pike it (leave), sod (unlucky person)

*   Mechanus: absolute law, all randomness fails
*   Party must adapt tactics and philosophy to plane they're on

### 6. **The Lady's Wrath**
*   Breaking certain rules in Sigil attracts the Lady of Pain's attention
*   Cardinal sins: worshiping Her, threatening Sigil's stability, blocking portals, killing dabus
