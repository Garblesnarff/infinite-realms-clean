# Creative Brief: Factions of Sigil

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Planar Surrealism with Philosophical Symbolism (Planescape-inspired)

Inspired by the mind-bending planar aesthetics of *Planescape: Torment* and the surreal architecture of M.C. Escher. This style captures the impossible geometry of Sigil, the visual representation of abstract philosophies, and the otherworldly nature of beings from every plane of existence converging in one city.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Impossible Architecture:** Buildings that defy gravity, streets that loop impossibly, no horizon or sky
*   **Faction Symbolism:** Each faction has distinct visual motifs representing their philosophy
*   **Planar Diversity:** Creatures from every alignment and plane coexisting in strange harmony
*   **Portal Imagery:** Doorways, gates, and rifts leading to impossibly different worlds

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Surreal, philosophical, planar, impossible geometry, belief made manifest, enigmatic, multiversal
*   **Feeling:** The sense of being a small cog in an infinite multiverse where abstract concepts are concrete reality. Wonder mixed with existential dread. Strange beauty in alien philosophies.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Sigil Architecture:** Aged brass, tarnished bronze, weathered stone with impossible angles
*   **Faction Colors:** Each faction has signature colors (Harmonium's red and gold, Dustmen's bone white and ash gray, Sensates' vibrant rainbow, Guvners' geometric blues)
*   **Planar Rifts:** Each plane bleeds its colors through portals (golden light from Celestia, green flame from Baator, swirling chaos from the Abyss)
*   **The Lady's Shadow:** Razor-blade silhouettes, deep shadows, metallic gleams
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette dominated by tarnished bronze architecture with aged brass accents. Red and gold Harmonium banners contrast with bone-white Dustmen robes. A portal glows with golden celestial light while another swirls with abyssal green. Deep shadows suggest the Lady's presence."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Faction Members:** Each faction has distinctive dress reflecting their philosophy—Harmonium armor, Dustmen funeral garb, Sensate fine clothes, Xaositect mismatched chaos
*   **Planar Races:** Tieflings with devil ancestry, githzerai monks, bariaur centaurs, modron geometric constructs
*   **The Dabus:** Floating humanoids with ram horns who speak in visual rebuses
*   **The Lady of Pain:** Towering figure in bladed dress, face hidden by blade crown, leaves razor-sharp shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "A githzerai monk in simple robes with mathematical tattoos representing Guvner philosophy. A tiefling with ram horns and red skin wearing Sensate silks decorated with sensory symbols. A dabus floats nearby, visual rebuses appearing above its head like comic speech bubbles showing pictographic warnings."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Sigil's Impossible Ring:** City wrapped inside a torus, buildings on all sides, no sky, streets curving up impossibly
*   **The Hive:** Crumbling slums with random portals opening to chaotic planes
*   **Lady's Ward:** Grand architecture with Harmonium patrols and faction headquarters
*   **The Planes:** Each outer plane has distinct appearance—Celestia's golden mountains, Baator's iron fortresses, Mechanus's clockwork gears, Limbo's raw chaos
*   **Prompt Example:** "The interior of the ring-city Sigil. Streets curve upward in all directions defying gravity. Buildings hang from the 'ceiling' which is actually more city. No sky—just more architecture in the distance. Portals shimmer as doorways: one shows a golden mountain peak, another a hellish iron fortress. Floating dabus perform maintenance on impossible architecture."

**5. Faction Philosophy Visualization:**
*   **Harmonium (Order):** Geometric patterns, military precision, red and gold, marching formations
*   **Xaositects (Chaos):** Mismatched everything, random color splashes, impossible combinations
*   **Dustmen (Death):** Skeletal imagery, pale colors, emotionless expressions, funeral aesthetics
*   **Sensates (Experience):** Rich textures, vibrant colors, fine details, expressions of emotion
*   **Guvners (Law):** Mathematical symbols, perfect geometry, blue tones, books and calculations
*   **Prompt Example:** "A debate between faction members. The Harmonium officer stands in perfect military stance, red and gold uniform precise, geometric patterns on armor. The Xaositect wears mismatched clothes in clashing colors, hair dyed differently on each side. The Guvner consults a book covered in mathematical formulae, blue robes embroidered with geometric theorems."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Mysterious Ambient:** Sigil has no sun—light comes from buildings, magic, and portal glow
*   **Shadow Play:** The Lady's presence suggested by blade-sharp shadows that shouldn't exist
*   **Planar Light:** Each portal brings its plane's lighting—soft gold, harsh red, chaotic green
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by ambient magical light with no clear source. Sharp, blade-like shadows cut across the scene from impossible angles, suggesting the Lady's presence. A portal bathes one side in soft golden light from Celestia while another casts harsh red light from Baator. The resulting interplay creates surreal lighting effects."

## Voice

A philosophical narrator who speaks in riddles and planar cant, their voice echoing with multiversal authority. The pacing is deliberate, allowing complex ideas to breathe. The tone shifts between sage wisdom, dark mystery, and sardonic humor at mortal confusion. Occasional use of planar slang (cant) adds flavor: "Listen here, cutter, here's the dark of it..." Underlying theme of belief shaping reality. The voice carries weight of infinite planes. Role: The voice of planar wisdom and mystery.
