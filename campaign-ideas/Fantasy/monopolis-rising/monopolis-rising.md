# Monopolis Rising
*"Pass GO, collect your fate. Land on the wrong property, lose everything you own."*

## Campaign Overview

Monopolis is a circular city built on the sacred Board Walk—a looping path of 40 properties that determines all existence. Citizens must constantly walk the circuit, rolling dice each turn to determine how many spaces forward they move. Where you land defines your fortune: landing on owned property means paying rent to landlords, landing on utilities means servitude, landing on railroads means forced travel, and landing on tax spaces means cosmic tribute.

The ultimate power belongs to the Property Barons—oligarchs who own entire color-sets of properties and have built houses and hotels on them. The most feared is the Baron of Boardwalk and Park Place, who charges rent so high that a single landing can bankrupt anyone. The only respite is landing on Free Parking (temporary sanctuary), visiting Just Visiting (prison observation), or passing GO (receiving 200 Monopolis dollars from the Bank).

The campaign begins when the unthinkable happens: someone has rolled triples three times in a row and been sent to Jail permanently. This should be impossible, as the dice are supposed to be random. Then more impossible rolls occur—loaded dice favoring certain properties, doubles that never end, movement that skips spaces entirely. The party discovers someone is manipulating the Dice of Fate, rigging the game to concentrate all property in the hands of a few while bankrupting the masses. They must expose the conspiracy, potentially bankrupt the corrupt Barons, survive Jail, and perhaps build their own property empire—or burn the entire monopolistic system to the ground.

## Core Themes

- **Capitalism and Inequality**: Property ownership creating insurmountable wealth gaps
- **Luck vs. Manipulation**: Random dice rolls versus rigged systems
- **Debt and Bankruptcy**: The crushing weight of rent and financial ruin
- **Property and Power**: Land ownership as ultimate authority
- **The Circular Trap**: Endless loop of the board with no escape
- **Monopoly and Competition**: The drive to own everything versus free market

## Campaign Sessions (25 Sessions)

Party witnesses impossible dice rolls. Investigation reveals the Dice of Fate are being loaded. They must trace the dice manipulation back to its source while surviving rent payments and avoiding bankruptcy. Introduction to basic Monopoly mechanics.

### Arc 2: The Property Wars (Sessions 7-13)
The party enters the property market, attempting to acquire color-sets while battling rival Barons. They must negotiate trades, build houses, and establish their own rental empire or join the resistance movement trying to abolish private property.

Final session: break the loop or become the new monopolist.

## Key NPCs

### The Banker (Infinite Accounts)
Cosmic entity managing all money. Sits at the center of the circular Board Walk. Distributes 200 Monopolis dollars every time someone passes GO. Cold, mathematical, claims perfect neutrality but actually allied with Property Barons.

### Baron Boardwalk (Lord Azure)
Owns both Boardwalk and Park Place—the most expensive properties. Charges rent so astronomical that landing there means instant bankruptcy for 99% of citizens. Lives in a massive hotel (four houses upgraded). Cruel oligarch who enjoys watching people lose everything.

### The Railroad Magnate (Conductor Terminus)
Owns all four railroads (Reading, Pennsylvania, B&O, Short Line). Controls movement across the board. Can transport people instantly or trap them in stations. Speaks in train metaphors and schedule terminology.

### Utility Queen (Electra Hydro)
Owns Electric Company and Water Works. Controls basic necessities of life. Charges variable rent based on dice rolls. Can cut off power/water to properties, making them uninhabitable.

### The Free Parking Vagrant (Nomad)
Lives in the Free Parking space—only location without rent or penalty. Philosopher who has opted out of the property system. Teaches that true freedom is owning nothing and paying nothing.

### The Jail Warden (Iron Bars)
Controls the Jail dimension. Keeps inmates trapped unless they pay 50 Monopolis dollars, roll doubles, or use Get Out of Jail Free card. Revealed to be running a prison-labor scheme.

### The Dice Prophet (Loaded Fate)
Can see future dice rolls through probability manipulation. Hired by corrupt Barons to rig rolls. Torn between her lucrative corruption work and moral disgust at the inequality she enables.

### Chance and Community Chest (Twin Oracles)
Anthropomorphized card decks. Chance is chaotic and unpredictable. Community Chest is benevolent but weak. They issue random blessings and curses to those who land on their spaces. Know secrets of the game's origin.

### The Bankrupt Prophet (Destitute)
A former Property Baron who lost everything. Lives as a warning and a resistance leader. Teaches the party how to survive poverty and how to bring down the propertied class.

### The Token Spirits (Top Hat, Thimble, Boot, Car, Dog, Ship, Iron, Wheelbarrow)
Eight spirits representing different player tokens. Each has unique abilities based on their form. The party can invoke them for temporary powers or form alliances with them.

## Major Locations

### The Board Walk (The Circular Path)
40-space loop that contains all reality. Mediterranean Avenue (cheapest) to Boardwalk (most expensive). Walking it is compulsory—stopping means death. The loop never ends unless you go bankrupt or win.

### Boardwalk and Park Place (The Azure District)
Most expensive dark blue properties. Towering hotels made of sapphire. Landing here without ownership means paying rent equal to annual income. The 1% live here in obscene luxury.

### The Railroads (Transit Nodes)
Reading, Pennsylvania, B&O, Short Line—four stations that allow rapid transit. Also sites of forced labor where the landless work to earn passage fees.

### Electric Company and Water Works (Utility Districts)
Control all power and water. Industrial zones with massive generators and reservoirs. Landing here means paying 4x or 10x dice roll amount depending on ownership monopoly.

### Jail (The Iron Dimension)
Pocket reality where rule-breakers are sent. Three ways out: pay 50 Monopolis, roll doubles, or use Get Out of Jail Free card. Actually a labor camp extracting value from prisoners.

### Free Parking (The Null Space)
Only space with no rent, no penalty, no effect. A philosophical void where capitalism doesn't reach. Occupied by monks and dropouts who've rejected the property system.

### GO (The Starting Line)
Where all journeys begin. Crossing it grants 200 Monopolis from the Banker. Some theorize it's possible to stop here permanently, but no one has figured out how.

### Luxury Tax and Income Tax (The Tribute Squares)
Mandatory payment spaces. Cosmic law requires giving money to the Bank when landing here. The taxes fund nothing—pure extraction.

### Chance and Community Chest Squares
Reality fluctuation zones where random events occur. Drawing from these decks can save or ruin you. The decks live here as sentient entities.

### The Void Beyond
The space outside the circular Board Walk. Most believe it's death. Some theorize it's freedom. Stepping off the path is the greatest heresy and greatest hope.

## Unique Mechanics

### Dice-Based Movement
All actions determined by 2d6 rolls. Movement, events, rent calculations—everything runs on dice probability. Party can attempt to influence rolls through various means (loading, blessing, probability magic).

### Property Ownership
Acquiring properties grants passive income (rent from others). Owning all properties of one color allows building houses (4 max) then hotels. More houses = higher rent = more power.

### Rent Payment
Landing on owned property requires paying rent to owner. Rent scales with houses/hotels. Can negotiate, fight, or go bankrupt. Bankruptcy means losing everything and being removed from the game (death).

### Passing GO
Each complete circuit grants 200 Monopolis from the Banker. This is the only "free" money. Essential for survival. Some abilities grant double GO collection.

### Jail Mechanics
Sent to Jail by landing on "Go to Jail" or rolling triples three times. Must pay 50M, roll doubles, or use special card to escape. While jailed, can't move or act.

### Trading System
Properties can be traded between characters and NPCs. Complex negotiation minigame. Can include money, properties, Get Out of Jail Free cards, and promises.

### House Shortage
Limited number of houses and hotels exist (32 houses, 12 hotels). If supply runs out, no one can build. Creates artificial scarcity and competition.

### Mortgaging
Properties can be mortgaged for half their value to the Bank. Mortgaged properties collect no rent. Can be unmortgaged for 110% of mortgage value. Desperate financial tool.

### Chance and Community Chest Cards
Random events when landing on those spaces. Range from "Bank error in your favor" to "Go directly to Jail" to "You have won second prize in a beauty contest."

### The Auction Rule
If someone lands on property and doesn't buy it, it goes to auction. Highest bidder wins. This rule is often forgotten but can be tactically crucial.

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: The Banker is Stealing
The Banker has been skimming money from every transaction, accumulating a secret fortune. When discovered, the economy collapses.

### Twist 2: The Board is a Prison
The circular path is actually a prison designed by cosmic entities. The "game" is punishment for some ancient crime the citizens have forgotten.

### Twist 3: Bankruptcy is Freedom
Going bankrupt doesn't kill you—it frees you from the Board Walk. The bankrupt enter the Void and discover a larger reality outside the game.

### Twist 4: The Dice Are Alive
The dice have consciousness and have been intentionally creating inequality because they feed on the suffering of the poor and the pleasure of the rich.

### Twist 5: You Can't Win
The game is designed to never end. Even if one player bankrupts all others, new players constantly spawn at GO. The only winning move is to stop playing.

## Victory Conditions

### Total Monopoly
Own all properties, bankrupt all opponents, achieve ultimate capitalist victory. Become the sole landlord of reality—wealthy but alone.

### Abolish Property
Lead revolution that destroys property deeds, shares all land communally, ends rent system. Freedom but economic chaos.

### Escape the Board
Discover how to step off the circular path into the Void beyond. Leave the game entirely, find what exists outside the loop.

### Reform the System
Implement regulations on rent, break up monopolies, create fair wealth distribution. Difficult balance between order and fairness.

## Defeat Conditions

### Bankruptcy
Lose all money and property. Traditional defeat means death/removal from reality.

### Eternal Debt
Owe more than you can ever pay, trapped in permanent indentured servitude to Property Barons.

### Jail Forever
Trapped in Jail dimension with no way to escape, permanent imprisonment.

### Loop Madness
Walking the circular Board Walk for eternity drives characters insane. Losing sense of self from endless repetition.
