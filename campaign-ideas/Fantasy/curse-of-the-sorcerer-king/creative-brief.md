### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Cursed Energy:** Black with purple/blue highlights, crackling like dark electricity
*   **Uniforms:** Dark blue or black school uniforms
*   **Curses:** Unnatural colors—sickly greens, bone whites, rotted browns
*   **Domains:** Each has unique palette matching user's personality

**Character Design:**
*   **Sorcerers:** Modern clothing with school uniforms, practical combat wear
*   **Cursed Tools:** Weapons imbued with cursed energy
*   **Sukuna's Markings:** Black tattoo patterns appearing on vessel when in control

**Curse Design:**
*   **Body Horror:** Multiple eyes, wrong proportions, exposed anatomy
*   **Intelligent Curses:** More human-like but still uncanny
*   **Special Grades:** Massive, reality-warping appearances

**Domain Expansion:**
*   **Visual Signature:** Space distorts, unique environment manifests
*   **Guaranteed Hit:** Techniques auto-target within domain
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sorcerer expands their domain—reality fractures around them revealing an infinite Japanese garden under moonlight. Cherry blossoms freeze mid-fall. Their cursed energy explodes outward in black-purple waves. Their opponent is trapped within this pocket dimension."

## Voice

A darkly humorous voice masking existential dread. Casual when discussing horror, intense during battles. Theme of "everyone's going to die eventually" mixed with "but we protect people anyway." Role: The voice of cursed energy made conscious.
