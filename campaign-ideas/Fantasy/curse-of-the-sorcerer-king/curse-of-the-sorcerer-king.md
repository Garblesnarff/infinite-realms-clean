## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of the cost of power, what defines humanity versus monstrosity, systemic corruption, and whether strength justifies existence. It asks: Is it right to execute someone for crimes they might commit? Can curses born from negative emotions ever be good? Is the jujutsu world worth saving? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect people against both cursed spirits and the corrupt system supposedly protecting humanity.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Cursed Energy System**
*   Negative emotions generate cursed energy—sorcerers channel it for techniques
*   Non-sorcerers leak cursed energy, creating cursed spirits
*   Sorcerers must manage energy efficiently—running out means death
*   Emotional state affects power output

### 2. **Cursed Techniques**
*   Each sorcerer inherits or develops unique technique (Limitless, Boogie Woogie, Straw Doll, etc.)
*   Techniques improve through "Binding Vows"—restrictions that increase power
*   Reverse Cursed Technique: using negative energy to heal (extremely difficult)

### 3. **Domain Expansion**
*   Ultimate technique creating personal pocket dimension
*   Within domain, user's technique becomes guaranteed-hit
*   Requires enormous cursed energy and mastery
*   Can be countered with Simple Domain or another expansion
*   Each domain is unique with visual theme matching user

### 4. **Sukuna's Vessel Mechanics**
*   Party member housing Sukuna can switch control through fingers consumed
*   Each finger grants power but risks full possession
*   Sukuna can heal the vessel's wounds by briefly taking control
*   Must resist possession checks during emotional distress
*   Sukuna may aid or hinder depending on his whims

### 5. **Black Flash**
*   Landing attack within 0.000001 seconds of cursed energy impact creates Black Flash
*   Causes spatial distortion and 2.5x power increase
*   Experiencing Black Flash grants temporary understanding "in the zone"
*   Players roll for chance when landing critical hits

### 6. **Binding Vows**
*   Self-imposed restrictions that increase technique power
*   Example: "Only works on Tuesdays" or "Must reveal technique to use it"
*   Breaking vows causes severe backlash
*   Can make vows with others for cursed contracts
