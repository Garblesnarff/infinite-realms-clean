## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Social Dynamics:** Navigating school politics, popularity versus principles, friendship strained by different choices.
*   **Moral Complexity:** The "villain" is the hero; the "hero" enables tyranny through inaction.
*   **Political Intrigue:** Uncovering the Wizard's propaganda machine and animal oppression.
*   **Reputation Management:** Party's actions determine whether they're seen as heroes or villains.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — School Days (Sessions 1–4):** Party arrives at Shiz Academy. Elphaba (green-skinned outsider) and Galinda (popular student) form unlikely friendship. Discovery that animals are losing ability to speak—systematic oppression.
*   **Act II — Journey to Oz (Sessions 5–8):** Party travels to Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Discover he's a fraud from another world. He offers power if they help suppress animal resistance. Choice point.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Elphaba the Green** — *The Branded Wicked*
    *   Green-skinned, brilliant, passionate about justice, becomes the "Wicked Witch" because she won't submit. Can be party member or major NPC.

2.  **Galinda/Glinda the Good** — *The Popular One*
    *   Beautiful, popular, learns empathy from Elphaba but ultimately chooses safety and approval. Becomes "Glinda the Good" by serving the system.

3.  **The Wonderful Wizard** — *The Fraud*
    *   Not from Oz, uses technology to simulate magic, maintains power through propaganda and fear. Charismatic deceiver.

4.  **Fiyero the Prince** — *The Carefree Noble*
    *   Seemingly shallow prince who reveals unexpected depth. Torn between duty to family and love for an outcast.

5.  **Doctor Dillamond** — *The Last Speaking Goat*
    *   Professor at Shiz, one of the last animals who can speak. His forced silencing catalyzes party's awareness.

6.  **Madame Morrible** — *The Headmistress*

## Key Locations

1.  **Shiz Academy:** Prestigious magic school where party learns craft and discovers injustice.
2.  **The Emerald City:** Gleaming capital built on lies, where the Wizard rules from his throne room.
3.  **The Wizard's Chamber:** Behind the curtain—mundane technology masquerading as magic.
4.  **The Animal Prison:** Where speaking animals are kept and "treated" to remove their voices.
5.  **Kiamo Ko (The Western Castle):** Remote fortress where the resistance makes its final stand.

## Central Conflict

Conformity versus conscience, popularity versus principles, the making of a "villain" through propaganda. The party must choose whether to gain power by serving an unjust system or lose everything by defying it. Friendship fractures when one person chooses safety and another chooses resistance. The question: is it better to be loved as "good" while enabling evil, or hated as "wicked" while fighting for justice?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Reputation Tracks**
*   Two separate reputation scores—Public Opinion and Animal Trust. Actions that raise one often lower the other.

### 2. **Defy Gravity**
*   Magic in Oz is tied to emotional liberation. Characters who embrace their true selves despite social pressure unlock powerful abilities.

### 3. **Propaganda System**
*   The Wizard controls information. Party's actions are reported falsely. Must counter propaganda with truth or accept villain status.

### 4. **Friendship Tests**
*   Regular social encounters where party members with different priorities must reconcile or fracture. Bonds strain under pressure.

### 5. **The Grimmerie**
*   Ancient spellbook with powerful but dangerous magic. Reading it requires wisdom saves—success grants power, failure brings corruption.

### 6. **For Good**
*   When friendships fracture permanently, both sides gain abilities reflecting their parting—bittersweet empowerment through loss.
