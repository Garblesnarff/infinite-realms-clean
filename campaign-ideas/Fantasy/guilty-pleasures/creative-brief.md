# Creative Brief: Guilty Pleasures

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Urban Fantasy with Necromantic Power (Anita Blake-inspired)

Inspired by the power-escalating urban fantasy of *Anita Blake* with St. Louis gothic meeting necromantic imagery and vampire seduction. This style captures the tension between death magic and sensual power, vampire politics, and overwhelming force.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Vampire Seduction:** Beautiful, deadly, sensual but terrifying
*   **Power Escalation:** From street-level to cosmic-level threats, visual power increase
*   **Dark Romance:** Tension between danger and attraction, predator-prey dynamics

## Voice

A tough, sarcastic voice that becomes increasingly powerful and complex. The pacing escalates from procedural to apocalyptic. The tone shifts between hardboiled detective, dark humor, sensual tension, and overwhelming power. There's an underlying theme of power's corruption and cost. Increasingly comfortable with violence and power. Role: The voice of someone becoming a monster to fight monsters.
