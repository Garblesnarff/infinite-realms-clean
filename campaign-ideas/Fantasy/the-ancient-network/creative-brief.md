# Creative Brief: The Ancient Network

## Visual Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Ancient redwood (#8B4513), forest green (#228B22), mycelial white (#F5F5DC), bioluminescent blue (#4FC3F7), root brown (#654321)
- **Visual Style**: Massive scale (trees dwarf everything), organic gothic (nature as cathedral), underground glow (mycelial network), living fractals (root patterns)
- **Key Imagery**: Walking among 300-foot giants, bioluminescent fungal caverns, roots spelling messages, bark growing into patterns

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Deep bass drones (ancient tree resonance), wooden percussion (slow heartbeat of forest), layered harmonics (collective thought)
- **Network Sound**: Whispers overlapping, creating words from echoes
- **Soundscape**: Wind through massive trees, wood creaking (trees communicating), soil shifting (roots moving), fungal hum (network processing)

## Voice Acting
- **Patriarch**: Extremely slow, pauses between words (thinking in centuries), deep as earth
- **Saplingmind**: Multiple voices in unison, younger-sounding, rapid and angry
- **Mycelial Chorus**: Whispering chorus, alien, neither plant nor animal
- **Greensinger Talia**: Calm, speaks tree-language naturally, often translates in real-time
