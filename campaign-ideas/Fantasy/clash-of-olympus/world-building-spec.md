### **World-Building Specification Brief: Clash of Olympus**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Demigod descendants of the Olympians must undertake legendary labors to prevent the Titans' escape from Tartarus, but discover the gods' corruption and conspiracy may be as dangerous as the ancient powers they imprisoned, forcing them to decide whether the Olympian order deserves to survive or if heroes should forge a new age free from divine tyranny.
