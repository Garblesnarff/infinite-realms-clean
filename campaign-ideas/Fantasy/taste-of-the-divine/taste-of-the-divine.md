# Taste of the Divine
## "Every Flavor is a Spell, Every Meal is Magic"

### Campaign Overview

In this world, magic doesn't come from arcane study or divine prayer—it comes from taste. The Five Sacred Flavors (Sweet, Salty, Sour, Bitter, Umami) are the fundamental forces of reality, and those who can perfectly balance and combine them become flavor-mages capable of reshaping the world. The party are newly awakened Taste Adepts who discover they can channel magic through eating and cooking, but they quickly learn that the flavor magic system is breaking down. Food is losing its taste worldwide, and with it, magic itself is fading.

The party must undertake a quest to restore the Five Divine Palates—ancient beings who embody each sacred flavor. These god-like entities have been imprisoned or corrupted by the Flavorless Void, an entity of complete tastelessness that seeks to reduce the universe to bland uniformity. As the party journeys to free each Divine Palate, they'll master the magic of that flavor, face trials that test their understanding of taste, and ultimately confront the philosophical question: Is it better to have intense flavors (good and bad) or peaceful blandness?

This campaign turns eating and cooking into the core magic system, making every meal a spellcasting opportunity and every ingredient a magical component. Combat, exploration, and social interaction all revolve around understanding and manipulating flavor. The party will literally taste their way to power while defending the concept of flavor itself from annihilation.
