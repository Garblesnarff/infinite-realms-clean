# Creative Brief: Academy of Legends

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Superhero with Dynamic Action (My Hero Academia-inspired)

Inspired by the vibrant superhero aesthetics of *My Hero Academia* with Western comic influences. This style captures the energy of superhero academia, unique power expressions, inspirational heroism, and the contrast between heroic idealism and dark villain threats.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Heroic Action:** Dynamic poses, dramatic angles, costume details, action lines showing movement and impact
*   **Quirk Visualization:** Each power has distinctive visual effects—elemental, physical, energy-based, or reality-warping
*   **Modern Urban Setting:** Futuristic cities with hero infrastructure, academy campuses, destroyed urban battlegrounds
*   **Costume Design:** Professional hero costumes blending function with personal style and theme

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Heroic, inspirational, Plus Ultra, modern superhero, coming-of-age, dramatic, hopeful despite darkness
*   **Feeling:** The excitement of becoming a hero mixed with the weight of responsibility. Bright optimism contrasted with real danger. Power used to protect.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Hero Costumes:** Bold primary colors with personalized accents (red/yellow/blue for classic heroes, darker palettes for stealth heroes, elemental colors matching Quirks)
*   **Environmental:** Modern urban grays and steel contrasted with vibrant costume colors
*   **Quirk Effects:** Bright, saturated colors for power manifestations
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant color palette with bold red, blue, and yellow hero costumes standing out against gray urban concrete. Green lightning crackles around one hero, ice-blue frost covers another's arms, and orange explosions burst in the background."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Hero Costumes:** Each character has a unique costume reflecting their Quirk and personality—masks, capes, armor plates, support items
*   **Civilian Clothes:** Modern Japanese school uniforms when at academy, casual contemporary fashion otherwise
*   **Quirk Mutations:** Some characters have permanent physical changes from their Quirks (tails, wings, unusual skin colors, extra limbs)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A student hero with a green and black costume with metal plates over vital areas. Their Quirk manifests as green lightning arcing around their body. Rabbit-ear comm device on helmet. Heavy boots for impact absorption. Determined expression with freckles visible through mask."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Beacon Academy:** Modern campus with training facilities—simulation rooms, obstacle courses, lecture halls, dorms
*   **Urban Battlegrounds:** Cities with hero billboards, damaged buildings from fights, evacuated streets, hero agencies
*   **Prompt Example:** "A modern hero academy campus with sleek architecture, a massive training ground with obstacle courses visible, dormitory buildings, and a central tower. In the distance, the city skyline shows hero agency buildings with giant screens displaying rankings. Clear blue sky with a few clouds."

**5. Quirk Powers and Combat:**
*   **Diverse Visual Effects:** Fire explosions, ice formations, super speed with trailing motion blur, energy beams, gravity manipulation, hardening skin
*   **Environmental Interaction:** Powers affect surroundings—scorch marks, frozen ground, craters, debris
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hero student creates massive explosions from their palms, bright orange-white detonations with black smoke rings expanding outward. The ground cracks beneath them from recoil. Their opponent generates ice pillars to block, blue-white crystalline formations erupting from the ground. Debris and energy effects fill the air between them."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Hero Lighting:** Strong shadows, backlighting, spotlight effects
*   **Power Glow:** Characters glow with their Quirk's color when using abilities
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with strong backlighting creating heroic silhouettes. The main character glows with green energy as they activate their Quirk. Sharp shadows emphasize determined expressions. Debris backlit by explosions adds depth."

## Voice

A young, determined voice full of hope and fighting spirit, like someone who refuses to give up no matter the odds. The pacing builds from uncertain to confident. The tone shifts between inspirational battle cries ("Plus Ultra!"), emotional declarations of resolve, and moments of doubt overcome. There's an underlying theme of inherited will and becoming a Symbol of Hope. Slightly breathless from exertion but never giving up. Role: The voice of heroic determination.
