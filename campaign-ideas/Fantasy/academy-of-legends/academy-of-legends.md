## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of what makes a true hero, the burden of symbols and legacy, rivalry driving improvement, and protecting society at personal cost. It asks: What does it mean to be the Symbol of Peace? Can you be a hero even with a "weak" Quirk? Is society too dependent on powerful individuals? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect people against villains who believe hero society is fundamentally flawed and must be destroyed.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Quirk System**
*   Each character has a unique superpower (Quirk) defining their capabilities
*   Quirks range from simple (enhanced strength) to complex (creating objects, manipulating elements)
*   Overusing Quirks causes strain, temporary loss of function, or physical backlash
*   Quirks can be trained to unlock new applications and overcome weaknesses
*   Some characters are Quirkless but compensate with skill and technology

### 2. **Plus Ultra Points**
*   Characters earn Plus Ultra points for heroic actions, creative Quirk use, and protecting others
*   Spend points to: push past normal Quirk limits, perform dramatic rescues, unlock Super Moves, resist villain abilities
*   Points represent the spirit of going "beyond" one's limits
*   Group pool can be spent for team combination attacks

### 3. **Super Moves**
*   As characters grow, they develop signature Super Moves—ultimate techniques
*   Super Moves combine Quirk mastery with tactical application
*   Each has a cool name and dramatic effect (e.g., "Detroit Smash," "Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall")
*   Unlocked through training arcs and emotional breakthroughs

### 4. **Hero Rankings**
*   Professional heroes are publicly ranked based on achievements, public opinion, and resolved cases
*   Party's actions affect their ranking and public perception
*   Higher ranks grant access to better equipment, information, and authority
*   Maintaining public trust is as important as combat ability

### 5. **Rescue & Civilian Protection**
*   Combat encounters include civilian NPCs who must be protected
*   Bonus experience for minimizing collateral damage and saving bystanders
*   Environmental destruction affects public opinion
*   Heroes who cause excessive damage drop in rankings

### 6. **Quirk Awakening**
*   At dramatic moments, characters can experience Quirk Awakening—evolution of their power
*   Triggered by extreme emotion, near-death, or breakthrough understanding
*   Permanently expands what the Quirk can do
*   Represents character growth beyond just training
