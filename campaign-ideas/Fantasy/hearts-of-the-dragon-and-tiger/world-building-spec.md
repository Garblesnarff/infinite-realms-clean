*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Taiga and Ryuji successfully help each other have one-on-one time with their respective crushes.
    *   **THEN:** Their affection for Kitamura/Minorin increases slightly, but their affection for each other increases more. They feel vaguely disappointed by the results but can't articulate why.
    *   **IF:** The players witness or participate in Ami's arrival and her exposure of social pretenses.
    *   **THEN:** Social dynamics shift across the academy. Ami becomes a catalyst forcing the main characters to confront their true feelings. Relationship progress accelerates but becomes more complicated.
    *   **IF:** The Winter Festival occurs and the characters must decide who to give their handmade gifts to.
    *   **THEN:** The recipient of each character's gift reveals their subconscious feelings. If they give gifts to each other instead of their original crushes, their relationship reaches a tipping point.
    *   **IF:** Kitamura announces his plan to follow Sumire and confesses his unrequited love publicly.
    *   **THEN:** Taiga's fantasy is shattered. She experiences a emotional crisis that Ryuji must help her through, dramatically accelerating their bond.
    *   **IF:** The final confession occurs during the snowstorm.
    *   **THEN:** Both characters achieve true love status with each other. Generate an epilogue showing their life together, Yasuko's tearful happiness, and Minorin's knowing smile as she watches them walk hand-in-hand.
