# The Cathedral of Shadows

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Gothic Fantasy / Religious Horror / Medieval Darkness
- **Estimated Length**: 16-22 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-16
- **Tone**: Dark, Solemn, Religious, Terrifying, Sublime

### Core Premise
The Cathedral of Shadows is a dimension embodying Gothic art philosophy - soaring vertical architecture reaching toward divine light, darkness punctuated by stained glass radiance, religious symbolism made literal, the sublime terror of the divine. The entire realm is one infinite cathedral with wings, transepts, crypts, and spires extending into impossible darkness and impossible heights. The party arrives seeking the Reliquary of Eternal Light, needed to fight encroaching darkness in their world. However, the Cathedral is dying - its divine light fading as shadows consume the structure from below. The party must ascend through architectural theology, confront living gargoyles and embodied sins, and reach the Rose Window of Heaven to rekindle the light or accept that even the divine must end.

### Core Themes
- **Vertical Ascension**: Physical height equals spiritual elevation; the journey upward is salvation
- **Light vs. Shadow**: Divine radiance struggles against consuming darkness
- **Religious Symbolism Manifest**: Sins, virtues, angels, demons are literally real
- **The Sublime and Terrible**: God's presence is beautiful and horrifying
- **Architectural Theology**: The building itself is a prayer in stone

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Crypt Level (Sessions 1-6)**
Party enters through the Cathedral's crypt - burial level beneath earth. Here dwell embodied Sins: Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, Lust. Must navigate moral trials while avoiding shadow creatures rising from below. Meet Brother Grimwald, last living monk, who explains the light is dying. Learn they must ascend to the Rose Window.

**Act 2: The Nave and Transepts (Sessions 7-14)**
Ascend through the Cathedral's main body. Each wing represents a Virtue trial (Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude). Face gargoyle guardians, navigate flying buttress bridges over infinite void, interpret stained glass prophecies. Discover the light is fading because the Architect-God has lost faith in creation. Shadows represent divine doubt.

**Act 3: The Bell Towers and Spires (Sessions 15-20)**
Climb toward heaven through vertical nightmare. Physics distorts - gravity pulls toward divine light above. Face angelic beings who test worthiness. Discover the Reliquary is in the Rose Window but taking it will extinguish the Cathedral forever. Must choose: save home world, save Cathedral, or prove to the Architect-God that creation deserves continued light.

**Act 4: The Rose Window of Heaven (Sessions 21-22)**
Final ascension. The Architect-God manifests as terrifying divine light and consuming shadow simultaneously. Boss encounter is theological debate and combat. Can the party prove existence has meaning? Options: take Reliquary (Cathedral dies, home saved), restore God's faith (both saved, hardest), accept darkness (nihilistic ending).
