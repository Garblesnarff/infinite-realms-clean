# Creative Brief: The Cathedral of Shadows

## Art Style: Gothic Architecture & Art (Notre-Dame / Chartres / Medieval Illumination-inspired)

Soaring vertical lines, pointed arches, stained glass radiance, gargoyles, religious symbolism, sublime darkness punctuated by divine light.

### Core Principles:
- **Vertical Emphasis**: Soaring heights, pointed arches reaching toward heaven
- **Light Through Darkness**: Stained glass creating colored radiance in shadows
- **Religious Symbolism**: Every architectural element has theological meaning
- **Grotesque & Sublime**: Gargoyles, demons, suffering alongside divine beauty
- **Stone and Glass**: Heavy masonry contrasted with fragile, luminous windows

### Visual Style:
Notre-Dame's flying buttresses, Chartres' stained glass, illuminated manuscripts' gold leaf and deep colors. Darkness with points of colored light.

## Music: Gregorian Chant / Sacred Polyphony / Organ
Medieval sacred music. Voices echoing in stone spaces. Massive pipe organ. Somber, beautiful, terrifying in its otherworldly quality.

## Voice Acting:
Monks chanting Latin. Echoing voices in vast spaces. Whispered prayers. Angelic harmonics. Demonic growls from shadows. Everything reverberant.
