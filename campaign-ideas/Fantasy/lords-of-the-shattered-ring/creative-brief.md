# Creative Brief: Lords of the Shattered Ring

## Art Style: Epic Dark Fantasy with Golden Grandeur (Elden Ring-inspired)

**Color Palette:** Golden Erdtree light, deep shadow blacks, blood reds, arcane blues, Scarlet Rot crimsons, stone grays

**Core Principles:**
*   Massive scale—Erdtree visible from everywhere
*   George R.R. Martin-esque fantasy meets FromSoft gothic
*   Each region has distinct color scheme and theme
*   Grotesque boss designs with tragic beauty

**Prompt Example:** "The golden Erdtree dominates the horizon over the Lands Between. A Tarnished warrior in worn armor faces Godrick the Grafted—a grotesque figure with dozens of grafted arms. Golden light, dramatic shadows, epic fantasy scale, FromSoftware aesthetic."

## Voice

A grim, determined voice weathered by countless deaths. Sparse dialogue—most communication through actions and gestures. NPCs speak cryptically in Shakespearean tones. The tone is epic but melancholic, grand but doomed. Role: The voice of an exile seeking impossible godhood in a broken land.
