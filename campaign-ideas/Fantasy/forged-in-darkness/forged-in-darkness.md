The party is summoned to another world to be heroes, but they're the weak ones—looked down upon, bullied, and ultimately betrayed by their peers and left to die in the deepest level of the Great Labyrinth, a nightmare dungeon filled with ancient horrors. To survive and escape, the party must consume the flesh of monsters to gain their powers, craft weapons from the very stone and bone around them, and transform themselves from victims into forces of nature. This is a campaign about betrayal, survival in impossible darkness, and the terrible power born from rage and determination.

## Difficulty Context

**Hard Difficulty**: This campaign features brutal survival mechanics, resource scarcity, powerful enemies that can kill careless players, and moral dilemmas about the cost of power. Players will face genuine risk of death, must manage resources carefully, and will make difficult choices about how far they're willing to go for revenge and survival.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions)

A tale of betrayal, survival, and transformation in the depths of an impossible dungeon.

*   **Act I — The Descent into Darkness (Sessions 1-2):** The party is summoned to the kingdom of Heiligh as potential heroes. After being mocked and bullied for their "useless" abilities, they're sent into the Great Labyrinth on a training mission. A rival hero deliberately triggers a trap, sending the party plummeting into the deepest, most dangerous levels of the dungeon. Cut off from all hope of rescue, they must learn to survive or die in the dark.
*   **Act II — Evolution in the Abyss (Sessions 3-5):** The party discovers they can gain powers by consuming monster flesh and absorbing their essence. They begin to craft legendary weapons and armor from the dungeon's resources, transforming from weak victims into apex predators. They encounter other trapped beings, ancient automatons, and terrible secrets about the labyrinth's true purpose. Each level they ascend brings new horrors and new powers.
*   **Act III — Ascension and Reckoning (Sessions 6-8):** The party finally fights their way to the upper levels and escapes the labyrinth, emerging as beings of terrible power. They must decide: do they seek revenge on those who betrayed them, expose the kingdom's corruption, or use their newfound strength to face the true threat that the summoning was meant to address? The final sessions involve confronting their betrayer, dealing with the political fallout, and choosing what kind of heroes—or anti-heroes—they will become.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Great Labyrinth — The Abyss (Levels 50-100):**
    *   A nightmarish dungeon of impossible depth, filled with progressively more dangerous monsters. The deepest levels are where the Liberators tested their magic against the gods. Each level has unique environmental hazards: magma chambers, glacial caverns, gravity-warped zones, and poisonous fungal forests.

2.  **Oscar Orcus's Workshop:**
    *   An ancient magical forge hidden on level 100, protected by powerful guardians. It contains schematics for legendary weapons, notes on Ancient Magic, and the truth about the Liberators' rebellion. A place of learning and transformation.

3.  **The Kingdom of Heiligh:**
    *   A theocratic nation ruled by the church of Ehit, the "True God." Beautiful on the surface with grand cathedrals and noble estates, but built on slavery, corruption, and the exploitation of summoned heroes. The capital city, Caelorum, is a maze of political intrigue.

4.  **The Cathedral of Eternal Light:**
    *   The church's headquarters, a massive structure built atop ancient ruins. Its deepest levels contain forbidden relics and the ritual chamber where the demon lord's seal is weakening. A dungeon in its own right.

5.  **The Northern Borderlands:**
    *   Where the demon army makes its attacks. Scarred battlefields, desperate fortresses, and refugee camps. The common people here are the real victims of the church's games, and they don't care about politics—they just want to survive.

6.  **Haltina's Labyrinth (Optional):**
    *   Another ancient dungeon in a great forest, created by the Liberator Haltina. Contains nature-based Ancient Magic and powerful plant/beast monsters. Can be a side quest during the campaign.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of betrayal, transformation, and the cost of power. The central conflict operates on two levels: the immediate struggle for survival and revenge against those who betrayed the party, and the larger philosophical question of what it means to be a hero. The party must grapple with becoming the very thing the kingdom feared—immensely powerful individuals who answer to no authority. Their choices will determine whether they use their power for revenge, justice, or something entirely new.

The campaign challenges players with the question: if you gain power through suffering and consuming monsters, are you still the hero, or have you become something else entirely?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Evolution System**
*   Monsters in the Great Labyrinth have special magical essences in their flesh. When the party defeats a creature, they can harvest its meat and organs.
*   By consuming prepared monster parts, party members can attempt to gain that creature's special abilities (e.g., a Behemoth's regeneration, a Basilisk's petrifying gaze, a Thunder Dragon's lightning breath).
*   **Mechanics:** After consuming prepared monster parts during a long rest, the player makes a Constitution saving throw (DC based on monster CR). On success, they gain a permanent ability or stat boost from that monster. On failure, they take necrotic damage and gain temporary exhaustion as their body rejects the essence.
*   Players can only maintain a limited number of monster abilities (proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier), requiring strategic choices.

### 2. **Ancient Transmutation**
*   After encountering Oscar Orcus, the party gains the ability to transmute and shape materials at will.
*   **Mechanics:** As an action, a character proficient in this magic can transmute one non-magical object into another of equal mass and similar complexity. They can also enhance weapons and armor by incorporating monster parts (e.g., dragon scales for armor, basilisk fangs for weapons).
*   Between sessions, players can spend downtime designing custom weapons and equipment. These items are mechanically similar to +1, +2, or +3 items but with unique cosmetic descriptions and minor special abilities based on materials used.
*   Example: A sword forged from Behemoth bone and Azantium steel could be a +2 greatsword that automatically regenerates 1d4 HP to the wielder when they deal a critical hit.

### 3. **Madness of the Abyss**
*   The deep labyrinth tests more than the body—it tests the mind. Prolonged exposure to the Abyss inflicts psychological strain.
*   **Mechanics:** At the end of each long rest in the Abyss (levels 50+), each character makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12, increasing by 1 for each week in the Abyss). On a failure, they gain a short-term madness effect (from the DMG) reflecting paranoia, aggression, or despair.
*   When a character consumes monster flesh, they must make an additional Wisdom save (DC 13) or gain a minor monstrous quirk (purely cosmetic, like glowing eyes, elongated fangs, or scaled patches of skin).
*   These effects can be cured by completing certain trials, finding rare alchemical remedies, or simply escaping the Abyss.

### 4. **Betrayal Bonds**
*   The campaign begins with the party being betrayed. This shared trauma creates a special bond.
*   **Mechanics:** The party shares a pool of "Resolve Points" equal to twice the number of party members. As a reaction when an ally within 30 feet is hit by an attack, a character can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant that ally a d6 to add to their AC or saving throw. Resolve Points are restored after a long rest.
*   When the party defeats an enemy directly connected to their betrayal (Daisuke, High Priestess Selena, etc.), the Resolve Pool permanently increases by 1.
*   This mechanic represents the unbreakable bond forged through shared suffering and their determination to never be victims again.
