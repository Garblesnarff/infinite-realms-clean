# Death and Rebirth - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction

### Aesthetic
- Memento mori meets rebirth symbolism
- Gray twilight transitioning to dawn
- Skeletal beauty, not horror
- Decay as transformation, not rot
- Phoenix and butterfly motifs throughout

### Color Palette
- **Death Realm**: Grays, silvers, twilight purples, ash
- **Judgement Realm**: Dawn golds, resurrection whites, angelic light
- **Undeath Empire**: Frozen blues, stagnant greens, preserved but lifeless
- **Transformation**: Flowing transitions between states, prismatic dissolving
- **Rebirth**: Vibrant life-colors emerging from gray

### Character Evolution
- Party starts corpse-like, gradually becomes radiant
- Each death adds subtle changes
- By endgame, barely recognizable but beautiful
- Eternal appears preserved perfectly but hollow
- Lord Terminus: elegant skeleton in flowing robes

## Music and Sound

### Main Themes
- **Death's Theme**: Peaceful, accepting, gentle strings and soft bells
- **Transformation Theme**: Dissolving sounds, reforming harmonies
- **Undeath Theme**: Frozen notes, stagnant repeating patterns, empty beauty
- **Rebirth Theme**: Building crescendo, dawn chorus, triumphant emergence
- **Eternal's Theme**: Beautiful but hollow, perfect but emotionless

### Soundscape
- Gray Wastes: Wind, whispers of endings, peaceful silence
- Transformation pools: Liquid sounds, dissolving, becoming
- Judgement Valley: Echoing silence, dust settling, awaiting trumpet
- Undeath Citadel: No ambient sound, preserved perfect quiet, eerie
- Angel's trumpet: When finally blown, reality-shaking glory

## Voice Acting

**Lord Terminus**: Kind death, gentle but final, wise acceptance
**Angel of Judgement**: Divine authority, fair evaluation, calling forth
**Eternal**: Beautiful voice hiding terror, immortal emptiness, frozen perfection
**Revenant King**: Sanity slipping, desperate, noble becoming mad
**The First Dead**: Ultimate peace, ancient wisdom, no fear
