**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Player focuses military: Strong army, expensive maintenance, intimidates neighbors, risks triggering defensive alliances against them.
    *   **IF:** Player focuses economy: Rich nation, can hire mercenaries and buy alliances, vulnerable to military attacks.
    *   **IF:** Player focuses diplomacy: Many allies, coordinated strategies possible, individually weaker, complex web of obligations.
    *   **IF:** Player focuses research: Advanced technologies, powerful late game, vulnerable early, requires protection.
    *   **IF:** Player allies with Ironclaw early: Secure borders, trade resources, angers Sylvan Theocracy.
    *   **IF:** Player defeats Sylvan Theocracy militarily: Gains territory but creates lasting enemy, complicates final alliance.
    *   **IF:** Player convinces Sylvan of peaceful intent: Gains powerful magic ally, enables cultural exchange.
    *   **IF:** Player accepts non-demon refugees: Multicultural nation, diplomatic benefits, some demon citizens resist.
    *   **IF:** Player refuses refugees: Pure demon nation, cultural unity, missed opportunities.
    *   **IF:** Player meets other god-kings: Realizes scope of situation, can form meta-alliance of players.
    *   **IF:** Player competes with other god-kings: Stronger individually, weaker against Abyss.
    *   **IF:** Player cooperates fully: Combined strategies, shared resources, overwhelming coordinated power.
    *   **IF:** Player ignores Primordial Seal warnings: Unprepared when Abyss manifests, harder final battle.
    *   **IF:** Player prepares thoroughly: Defenses ready, allies coordinated, research complete, optimized final battle.

**7. Strategic Systems**
*   **Resources:**
    *   **Food:** Sustains population, enables growth, produced by farms/fishing/hunting.
    *   **Materials:** Construction and crafting, produced by mines/quarries/logging.
    *   **Gold:** Economic transactions, produced by trade/markets/taxes.
    *   **Population:** Workforce and military, grows naturally and via immigration.
    *   **Research Points:** Technology advancement, produced by libraries/laboratories.

*   **Buildings:** Various structures providing bonuses: Barracks (military recruitment), Workshops (item crafting), Temples (divine powers), Markets (gold generation), Libraries (research), Farms (food production), etc.

*   **Technologies:** Research unlocks capabilities organized in tech trees: Military (better units), Economic (efficient production), Magical (powerful spells), Diplomatic (better relations).

*   **Units:** Faction-specific forces with strengths, weaknesses, costs. Mynoghra features Ebon Knights, Shadow Weavers, Infantry Legions, Hellforged Automatons. Units gain experience and evolve.

**8. Mynoghra Unique Mechanics**
*   **Sacrificial Resurrection:** Fallen Mynoghra units respawn at capital after battle. Costs resources but enables tactical trading of lives. Powerful but expensive—can bankrupt nation if overused.

*   **Shadow Network:** Superior intelligence gathering. Always know enemy positions, research, and plans. Enables strategic decision-making with better information.

*   **Fear Aura:** Demon units cause morale damage to enemies. Weaker foes may rout without fighting. Psychological warfare advantage.

*   **Adaptive Evolution:** Mynoghra units gain experience faster and improve more significantly than other factions' static forces. Veteran units become elite.

*   **God-King's Vision:** Player character sees strategy game interface showing faction stats, optimization suggestions, warnings, and probabilities. Strategic advantage but relies on player's decision-making.

**9. The God-King Phenomenon**
*   **Selection:** Outstanding strategy game players from Earth are chosen upon death to rule factions.
*   **Purpose:** Train commanders capable of coordinating against Primordial Abyss threat.
*   **Powers:** Divine authority over faction, strategic interface access, limited reality manipulation within domain.
*   **Challenge:** Must adapt from game thinking to real people with emotions, needs, fears.
*   **Growth:** Learn that strategy mastery means nothing without wisdom and compassion.
*   **Current God-Kings:** Takuto (Mynoghra), Aria (Radiant), Jin (Ironclaw), Nox (Void), possibly others.

**10. The Primordial Threat**
*   **Nature:** Entity predating current reality, sealed at world's foundation by united factions.
*   **Weakening:** Centuries of faction warfare, magical drain, and reality erosion degraded seal.
*   **Manifestation:** Begins as reality glitches, corrupted creatures, impossible events. Escalates to full emergence.
*   **Corruption:** Warps units, terrain, even strategy mechanics. Interface glitches. Meta-knowledge fails.
*   **Defeat Requirement:** All major factions must unite, combining ultimate abilities in coordinated assault while god-kings synchronize commands. Impossible without trust and cooperation—exactly what centuries of war destroyed.

**11. Timeline (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Mynoghra refugees scatter without leader, die to exposure and bandits.
*   **Session 2:** Other factions ignore destroyed demon nation, focus on their conflicts.
*   **Session 3:** Sylvan Theocracy eliminates demon remnants as threat.
*   **Session 4:** Faction warfare continues, no one notices seal weakening.
*   **Session 5:** Primordial Abyss begins manifesting, initially ignored as local problem.
*   **Session 6:** Corruption spreads, factions respond individually, all fail.
*   **Session 7:** Reality breaks down, Abyss manifests fully.
*   **Session 8:** World consumed, all factions destroyed. Without Mynoghra's unifying presence (outsider perspective), old enemies never cooperate. Prophecy fulfilled—revival of Mynoghra signaled doom... but only through absence.

This specification creates a world where strategic mastery meets genuine human emotion, where "evil" faction proves morality transcends designation, where former enemies must unite against cosmic threat, and where player's careful nation building creates foundation for world's salvation. Grand strategy becomes personal, and tactical decisions carry emotional weight.
