# Creative Brief: Eternal Nations Reborn

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grand Strategy Fantasy with Personal Stakes

Inspired by strategy games like *Total War*, *Civilization*, *Age of Empires*, grand strategy anime like *Overlord*, *Log Horizon*, nation-building isekai, and epic fantasy like *Lord of the Rings*. This style combines sweeping campaign map aesthetics with intimate character moments, strategic overview with tactical detail.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Strategic Scale**: Show both grand campaign maps and ground-level battles. Zoom from overview to personal.
*   **Nation Growth**: Visual progression from ruins to thriving civilization. Each session shows development.
*   **Tactical Detail**: Combat emphasizes positioning, unit types, terrain—strategic thinking made visual.
*   **Demon Aesthetic**: Mynoghra is "evil" faction but beautiful in dark way—gothic architecture, shadow magic, fearsome but not monstrous.
