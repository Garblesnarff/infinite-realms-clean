- Dystopian ground cities vs free sky settlements

**Colors**:
- **Sky**: Storm gray, lightning blue, cloud white, electricity purple
- **Storm Metal**: Crackling cyan, energized gold
- **Dominion**: Industrial iron, rust red, smoke black
- **Trick Magic**: Electrical discharge (white-blue), thunder (dark purple), wind (translucent silver)

**Key Visuals**: POV mid-air tricks, lightning roads forming beneath wheels, storm-metal bike circuits glowing during tricks, massive floating islands, aerial combat, trick combos with elemental effects

## Audio Design

**Music**:

- **Competitions**: Arena rock, crowd chanting
- **Emotional**: Acoustic guitar with distant thunder
- **Dominion**: Military drums, industrial clanging

## Voice Acting

**Magnus "Thunderhead"**: Gruff older male, carries weight of past, Norwegian/Scandinavian accent
**Zara "Whipcrack"**: Confident young female, competitive trash-talk, American West Coast
**Warlord Ferrum**: Commanding military voice, British, believes he's righteous
**Storm King**: Layered voices, thunder rumble, speaks rarely but powerfully

## Cinematics

**Opening**: Ground-level POV, rider hits ramp, mid-air trick, lightning road spontaneously forms, bike lands on electricity, camera pulls back showing floating islands, title card in lightning

**Circuit Wins**: Winning trick in slow-motion, crowd roaring, storm responding to rider's mastery, trophy presentation, bike glowing with upgraded storm-metal

**Storm King Challenge**: Approaching the Arena (eye of storm), facing the King, trick-for-trick battle, winner becomes King or refuses crown, new balance achieved

## Tone

**Primary**: Adrenaline-fueled aerial freedom
**Secondary**: Mythological weight of power
**Tertiary**: Family of riders against the world

Every session: Pre-comp prep, engine revving countdown, insane tricks, electrical storms responding to skill, post-comp celebration/mourning, fighting for sky-life, deciding who controls the storm.
