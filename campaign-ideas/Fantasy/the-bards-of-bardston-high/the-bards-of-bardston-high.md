### Core Premise
The players are students at Bardston High, a magical academy in a peaceful kingdom. They've joined (or accidentally formed) the school's struggling Light Music Club, which is on the verge of being disbanded due to lack of members and funding. To save their club, they must recruit new members, practice their instruments (magical and mundane), perform at school events, and ultimately wow the crowd at the annual Cultural Festival. Along the way, they'll face the trials of student life: exams, rivalries with other clubs, tea time debates, and the challenges of friendship and self-expression through music.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Formation & First Notes (Sessions 1-4)**
- The players meet, discover the Light Music Club, and decide to save it from disbandment. They must recruit at least one more member, secure a practice room, and learn to play together despite their wildly different personalities and skill levels.

**Act 2: Practice & Performance (Sessions 5-10)**
- The club faces various challenges: preparing for the school's Spring Concert, dealing with equipment malfunctions, navigating inter-club rivalries (especially with the prestigious Orchestra Club), and balancing their club activities with academic responsibilities. They also grow closer as friends, sharing tea, snacks, and heartfelt conversations.

**Act 3: The Cultural Festival (Sessions 11-15)**
- The grand finale approaches. The Light Music Club must prepare their best performance yet for the Cultural Festival, overcome personal doubts and fears, and prove that their club deserves to exist. The campaign culminates in an emotional, triumphant performance that brings the school together and cements their bonds of friendship.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: After School in the Music Room**: Players arrive at school and discover the abandoned Light Music Club room. They meet each other and the desperate club advisor who pleads for help. Their first task: find one more member before the week ends or the club is officially dissolved.
- **Session 2: The Recruitment Drive**: The party creates posters, performs in the courtyard, and tries to convince various NPCs to join. They succeed (barely) and must now figure out what instruments everyone will play.
- **Session 3: Tea Time Tactics**: The club's first official practice session is a disaster. To bond and relax, they institute "tea time" – a sacred tradition of sharing sweets and conversation. During tea time, they learn about each other's backstory and motivations.
- **Session 4: First Performance Jitters**: The club is scheduled to perform at a small school assembly. Chaos ensues during practice, but they manage to pull off a heartfelt (if imperfect) performance that earns them modest applause.
- **Session 5-6: The Midterm Crisis**: Exams approach, and the club must balance studying with practice. Some members struggle academically, leading to tutoring sessions and study groups. Meanwhile, the Orchestra Club mocks their dedication.
- **Session 7: Summer Training Camp**: The club goes on a weekend retreat to a lakeside cabin to practice intensively. Hijinks ensue: ghost stories, midnight raids on the kitchen, swimming competitions, and a breakthrough in their musical chemistry.
- **Session 8: The Equipment Breakdown**: Their instruments and magical amplification crystals malfunction right before an important performance. The party must quest through the city's magical district to find repairs or replacements on a tight budget.
- **Session 9-10: Rivalry and Reconciliation**: Tensions with the Orchestra Club reach a peak when both groups are scheduled to perform at the same event. After a dramatic confrontation, they find mutual respect and even collaborate on a joint piece.
- **Session 11-12: Cultural Festival Preparation**: The big event looms. The club must design costumes, plan their setlist, promote their performance, and manage their nerves. Personal conflicts arise and must be resolved.
- **Session 13-14: Festival Days**: The Cultural Festival arrives with all its chaos – food stalls, games, other performances, and VIP guests. The players experience the festival atmosphere while preparing backstage.
- **Session 15: The Final Performance**: The Light Music Club takes the stage. In a climactic, emotional scene, they perform their signature song. Regardless of how well they roll, their genuine passion and friendship shine through, winning the hearts of the audience and securing the club's future.

### Major NPCs

- **Maestro Cordelia Songweaver**: The aging, dreamy music teacher and club advisor. **Role**: Mentor / Mother Figure. **Personality**: Absent-minded but caring, speaks in musical metaphors, has a mysterious past as a famous bard. **Flaw/Secret**: She was once a member of a legendary adventuring band that disbanded tragically, and she sees the players as a second chance to recapture that magic.
- **Veronica von Crescendo**: President of the Orchestra Club, a talented but arrogant violinist. **Role**: Rival / Future Ally. **Personality**: Perfectionist, competitive, secretly lonely. **Flaw/Secret**: She pushes herself too hard because her noble family expects perfection, and she envies the Light Music Club's genuine camaraderie.
- **Pip the Enthusiast**: A first-year student the party recruits. **Role**: Cheerleader / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Boundlessly enthusiastic, can't play an instrument but brings incredible energy, accidentally causes most of the club's mishaps. **Flaw/Secret**: Terrified of performing in front of crowds but doesn't want to let the team down.
- **Headmaster Aldric Ironquill**: The stern but fair leader of Bardston High. **Role**: Authority Figure. **Personality**: Believes in rules and tradition but respects genuine effort. **Flaw/Secret**: He secretly attends every club performance incognito because he misses his own youth.

### Key Locations

- **The Light Music Club Room**: A cozy, slightly dusty room on the third floor with mismatched furniture, tea-making supplies, a few instruments, and walls covered in posters and memories.
- **The Courtyard Stage**: An outdoor performance space where students gather during lunch and festivals, the site of many impromptu concerts.
- **The Tea Shop "Melodia's"**: A popular student hangout near campus where the club goes for treats, strategizing, and comfort after difficult practices.
- **The Grand Festival Grounds**: The sprawling campus transformed with stalls, decorations, and stages for the annual Cultural Festival.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to prove that their unconventional, heartfelt approach to music and friendship is just as valuable as technical perfection and tradition. It's about finding one's voice, supporting each other through challenges, and creating something beautiful together.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Harmony Points & Tea Time**: The party accumulates "Harmony Points" through successful collaboration, mutual support, and shared experiences (especially during tea time). These points can be spent during performances to grant bonuses to skill checks, reroll failures, or create magical effects through their music. Each session should include at least one "tea time" scene where players roleplay casual conversations, share backstory, and strengthen bonds – this is when Harmony Points are awarded. The DM should encourage creative uses of Harmony Points during performances, such as "inspiring courage in the audience" or "creating illusory effects that enhance the show." This mechanic rewards the social, slice-of-life aspects of the campaign and makes friendship mechanically powerful.
