# Houses Divided
**Tagline:** *Twelve territories. Twelve philosophies. One devastating civil war.*

## Campaign Overview

The world of Domicil was once united under the Council of Twelve Houses, each territory governing a different aspect of life based on astrological house principles. The First House controlled identity and self, the Second wealth and resources, the Third communication and travel, and so on. For centuries, this system maintained balance. But twenty years ago, a dispute over governance philosophy escalated into accusations, then sanctions, then violence.

Now, the Twelve Houses are locked in devastating civil war. Each house believes its domain should be the organizing principle of society. The First House Individualists argue personal freedom above all. The Tenth House Authoritarians demand hierarchical order. The Eleventh House Collectivists push for communal governance. The Fourth House Traditionalists want familial structures to dominate. No compromise seems possible.

The party are House-Walkers - rare individuals born in the liminal spaces between houses, belonging to none and accepted by all (or hunted by all). They can traverse the war-torn borders and access the powers of any house. Their unique position makes them valuable to all sides and trusted by none. They must either broker peace, help one house win, or discover the hidden thirteenth house that predates the twelve - the House of Unity that was deliberately destroyed to create the current divisions.

## Core Themes

- **Political Philosophy:** Different valid approaches to governance
- **Civil War:** Former allies become enemies
- **Specialization vs. Unity:** Expertise vs. cooperation
- **Border Conflicts:** Literal and metaphorical boundaries
- **Lost History:** The forgotten path to unity
