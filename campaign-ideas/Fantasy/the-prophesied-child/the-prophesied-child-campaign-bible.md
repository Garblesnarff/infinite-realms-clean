## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Weave of the Great Spinner
Before the gods, there was only the Great Spinner, a cosmic arachnid of starlight who wove the Tapestry of Existence. Reality is not stone and soil, but threads of potential held in tension. Magic is the act of tugging these threads, and "Darkness" is not a force, but the act of *unravelling* the weave to reveal the Void behind it. Bavmorda does not conquer lands; she is ritually unpicking the knots of history to re-weave the world with herself as the central, suffocating pattern.

### The Timeline of Ten Sorrows
1.  **The Age of Threading:** The Spinner completes the Tapestry; the First Men are sewn into the fabric.
2.  **The Revolt of the Thimbles:** Small folk (Brownies/Dwarves) discover how to hide between the threads, escaping the gods' notice.
3.  **The Bleeding Rain:** *Surreal Event.* For ten years, clouds rained warm, iron-tasting red water. It stained the white stone of Tir Asleen to a permanent rust-gold.
4.  **The Birth of Bavmorda:** Born not of woman, but found in a crater of obsidian glass, clutching a severed spider leg.
5.  **The Silence of the Lutes:** *Surreal Event.* All music ceased to produce sound for a generation. Only the screams of dying beasts carried melody.
6.  **The Unification Wars:** Bavmorda binds the Nockmaar clans using "flesh-stitching" sorcery.
7.  **The Cursing of Tir Asleen:** Bavmorda freezes the Golden City. The inhabitants are not dead, but turned to living marble, their eyes still wet and moving.
8.  **The Day of No Shadows:** *Surreal Event.* The sun halted at noon for 48 hours. Shadows detached from their owners and fled underground to form the "Umbral Court."
9.  **The Transformation of Raziel:** Fin Raziel challenges Bavmorda and is twisted into a possum. The balance of magic tips to decay.
10. **The Starfall Prophecy:** A single thread turns gold in the Tapestry—the birth of Elora Danan.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is between **Narrative Continuity (The Weave)** and **Egoist Solipsism (The Unravelling)**. The Prophesied Child is not just a baby; she is a "Living Knot"—a point in reality that cannot be untied by Bavmorda’s dark magic. If Bavmorda kills her, the Tapestry unravels completely, leaving only Bavmorda floating in the Void.
