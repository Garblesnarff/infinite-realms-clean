---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Prophesied Child
**Campaign Type / Genre:** High Fantasy Quest / Unlikely Hero Journey / Prophecy Fulfillment
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **11–14**
**Tone (keywords):** epic fantasy, unlikely heroes, prophecy, magic vs tyranny, found family, courage over competence, light vs darkness
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party discovers a prophesied infant marked with a special sign—according to legend, this child will bring about the downfall of the evil sorceress-queen Bavmorda who rules with fear and dark magic. Though they're common folk (farmers, innkeepers, small-village heroes) with no grand destiny of their own, they must protect the child and journey across kingdoms to find the good sorceress who can defeat Bavmorda. Along the way they'll gain allies (rogue warriors, fairy folk, transformed animals), face dark magic, and discover that being a hero isn't about destiny—it's about choosing to do what's right.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **David vs Goliath:** The party starts underpowered against a sorceress-queen and her army. Clever tactics matter.
*   **Prophecy Protection:** Keeping the child safe is paramount—failure means world domination by darkness.
*   **Transformation Magic:** Enemies use curses and transformations. The party may be turned into animals or worse.
*   **Growing Power:** The party starts weak but gains allies, magic items, and skills as they journey.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 2 — "The Flight"
*   They must flee with the child. Their village is destroyed or occupied behind them.

### Session 3 — "Madmartigan"

*   The child's innocence reflects the dark magic, destroying Bavmorda in a blaze of light.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Village:** Humble starting point, destroyed or occupied, representing what they're fighting for.
2.  **The Fairy Forest:** Magical woodland ruled by the Fairy Queen, wondrous and dangerous.
3.  **The Cursed Island:** Where Fin Raziel is trapped, cut off from magic sources.
4.  **Tir Asleen:** Grand kingdom frozen in time by Bavmorda's curse, becomes ally when freed.
5.  **Nockmaar Castle:** Dark fortress of obsidian and iron where Bavmorda reigns in terror.

## Central Conflict

Prophecy versus tyranny. Bavmorda represents the fear of losing power—she'll destroy an innocent to maintain her dark rule. The child represents destined hope, but prophecy alone isn't enough. The party, ordinary people, must choose heroism and prove that courage, friendship, and protecting innocence matter more than destiny or power. It's about becoming heroes by choice, not birth.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Child Protection**
*   The child must be kept safe at all times. Losing the child means campaign failure. Creates constant tension.

### 2. **Transformation Curses**
*   Characters may be transformed into animals temporarily. They retain intelligence but lose some abilities.

### 3. **Raziel's Restoration Progress**
*   Track components gathered. Each restoration attempt transforms Raziel into progressively more complex animals (possum → goat → human).

### 4. **Love Potion Chaos**
*   Accidental love potions cause NPCs to become infatuated with party members or each other, creating comedy and complications.

### 5. **The Fairy Pact**
*   Gaining fairy allies requires following fairy logic and customs—complex bargains and strange tasks.

### 6. **Innocence Magic**
*   The child's presence can dispel certain dark magic or reflect evil spells if properly used as a last resort.

### 7. **Army Management**
*   In late campaign, the party commands allied forces in large battles while conducting key missions.
