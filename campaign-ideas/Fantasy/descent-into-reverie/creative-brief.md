# Descent into Reverie - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Inception meets The Matrix meets Eternal Sunshine—each layer has distinct visual identity while maintaining throughline of "something's off."

**Layer Visual Themes:**
- **Layer 1**: Hyperrealistic—too perfect to be real
- **Layers 2-5**: Increasingly surreal—physics bending, impossible geometry
- **Layers 6-10**: Abstract expressionism—concepts made visible
- **Layers 11+**: Pure symbolism—psychology as landscape

**Color Theory by Depth:**
- Shallow layers: Natural but oversaturated
- Mid layers: Shifting, unnatural color combinations
- Deep layers: Colors that shouldn't exist

## Art Direction
- **The Spinning Top Motif**: Each PC has a totem object
- **Folding Cities**: Escher-like architecture
- **Time Visualization**: Clocks running different speeds
- **Layer Transitions**: Reality fragmenting like breaking glass
- **Projections**: Nightmare versions of familiar faces

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Hans Zimmer style—brass stabs, ticking clocks, building tension
**Layer Themes:** Each has musical signature
- Layer 1: Orchestral, traditional
- Layer 5: Electronic meets organic
- Layer 10: Pure synthesizers, barely music
- Layer 15: Sound that feels like thought

**Sound Design:**
- Time dilation: Audio pitch shifts between layers
- Reality glitches: Record scratches, audio loops
- Liminal spaces: Reverb that shouldn't exist
- Projections: Distorted familiar voices

## Voice Direction
**Somnus:** Calm, patient, knows more than reveals—like therapist crossed with oracle
**Ariadne:** Experienced but uncertain, helpful but unreliable
**Projections:** Party members' own voices twisted into accusations
**The Stayers:** Contentment that sounds almost believable

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Kick**: "Waking" only to discover it's another layer
- **Layer Descent**: Falling through reality layers visually distinct
- **The Workshop**: Seeing blueprints of their own dreams
- **Identity Crisis**: PC questioning which version of themselves is real
- **Final Wake**: Ambiguous—is this really base reality?
