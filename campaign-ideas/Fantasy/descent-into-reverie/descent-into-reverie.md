# Descent into Reverie
## "How Deep Can You Dream?"

### Campaign Overview

The party awakens in what they believe is reality, only to discover they're in a dream. They escape to waking... which is another dream layer. They're trapped in nested dreams—each layer deeper than the last, each more convincing, each harder to escape. This is the Descent into Reverie, an Inception-style campaign where distinguishing reality from dream becomes impossible.

The Dream Architect Somnus has imprisoned them in their own subconscious, using nested dream layers as both prison and puzzle. Each level has different rules, different aesthetics, different time flows. The party must descend through layers to find the truth at the bottom, or ascend to escape—if they can determine which direction is real. The deeper they go, the more powerful they become, but the harder it is to remember who they truly are.

This campaign explores themes of perception vs. reality, layered consciousness, time dilation, and the question of whether waking life is just another dream. Players will question everything, doubt all truths, and ultimately must choose which layer feels most real to them.

### Core Themes

- **Reality vs. Illusion**: What makes something "real"?
- **Nested Consciousness**: Dreams within dreams within dreams
- **Time Dilation**: Deeper levels run slower/faster
- **Identity Dissolution**: Forgetting which layer is home
- **Infinite Regression**: The possibility there is no bottom

### Key NPCs

**Somnus the Dream Architect** (Antagonist/Mentor)
An enigmatic figure who built the nested dream structure. Appears differently in each layer—businessman in shallow layers, god in deep layers, abstract concept at extremes. Claims to be teaching the party about consciousness. May be benevolent torturer or malicious teacher. Cannot lie but speaks only in puzzles. Genuinely believes the party needed this experience. May actually be the party's collective unconscious personified.

**Ariadne** (Guide)
A veteran of the layers who has been descending/ascending for years (or subjectively—centuries). Appears as a woman made of thread and light. Knows the shortcuts, the tricks, the reality checks. But has forgotten which layer she originated in. Helps party navigate but her advice sometimes contradicts itself. May be Somnus's creation or a genuine fellow prisoner. Her thread can mark paths between layers.

**The Projections** (Hostile Forces)
Manifestations of the party's subconscious that attack as defense mechanism. Take forms of personal traumas, fears, regrets. Grow stronger in deeper layers. Some represent individual party members' baggage. Others are collective nightmares. Defeating them requires confronting what they represent. They're not evil—they're the mind's immune system attacking foreign consciousness.

**The Architect's Shadow** (Mysterious Presence)
Somnus's rejected self, dwelling in the deepest layer. Wants to warn the party but can only communicate through symbols and cryptic signs. Appears as a silhouette that moves independently of light. Knows the truth about the layers but cannot speak it directly. May be trying to help or may be another test.

**The Stayers** (Tragic NPCs)
Dreamers who chose to remain in particular layers instead of seeking base reality. Each found a layer they preferred over "true" waking. The Businessman who rules Layer 2 as a god. The Lover who stays where their lost partner "lives". The Child who remains in innocent wonder. They offer temptation—why keep seeking reality if a dream fulfills you?

**Fellow Prisoners** (Allies)
Other people trapped in the Descent alongside the party. Each has different theories about escape. Some want to ascend to Layer 0. Others think Layer 20 holds truth. A few believe there is no exit. They can join forces or work against each other. Trust is difficult when everyone's reality is suspect.

**The Dreamer** (Ultimate Mystery)
The being whose dream contains all layers. Might be one of the party. Might be Somnus. Might be everyone. Might be a sleeping god. Finding them could mean escape, destruction, or revelation that there is no single dreamer. The deepest layer might be their subconscious core—or there might be infinite layers with no true dreamer at all.

### Major Locations

**Layer 1: The Mundane** (Apparent Reality)
Looks like normal world—modern city, daily life. Most convincing layer. Subtle wrongness only visible to those looking. The party's "waking" life that might be another dream. Contains their homes, jobs, loved ones (or projections thereof). Escaping from here is hardest psychologically.

**Layer 2-5: The Surreal** (Standard Dreams)
Recognizable but wrong. Buildings too tall, colors too vivid, people acting scripted. Dream logic applies but physics mostly works. Where most dreamers get trapped. Time runs slightly faster than Layer 1. Contains the Dreaming City, the Shifting Mansion, the Impossible Forest.

**Layer 6-10: The Symbolic** (Deep Dreams)
Landscapes made of metaphor. A library where books are memories. An ocean of forgotten things. Mountains of crystallized emotions. Abstract concepts made concrete. Time dilation intensifies. Communication becomes telepathic. Physics is optional.

**Layer 11-15: The Primordial** (Subconscious)
Raw psychology made manifest. The Shadow Self dwelling here. Archetypes walking around. Personal mythology as geography. Time becomes non-linear. Identity starts fragmenting. Only experienced Oneironauts can navigate without dissolving.

**Layer 16+: The Unformed** (Beyond Dreams)
Pre-conscious chaos. Reality hasn't coalesced yet. Everything is potential. The party's powers peak here but their identities are nearly lost. Somnus dwells somewhere in these depths. May be where true escape lies or infinite trap.

**The Liminal Spaces** (Between Layers)
Corridors and thresholds between dream levels. Grey zones where reality hasn't decided which layer to be. Dangerous—easy to get lost. Time doesn't flow. The Projections hunt here. But also where layer manipulation is possible. The Architect's Shadow appears here most often.

**Somnus's Workshop** (Meta Location)
Exists outside the normal layer structure. Where the Architect designs dreams. Contains blueprints of all layers, tools for dream manipulation, and possibly the key to everything. Reaching it requires understanding from multiple layers. May be Layer 0, Layer Infinity, or orthogonal to the numerical structure entirely.

### Unique Mechanics

**Layer Awareness** (Track Current Position)
Players must maintain awareness of which layer they're in:
- Markers, reality checks, personal anchors
- Layer confusion causes disorientation penalties
- Deep layers make tracking harder
- Party can disagree on current layer

**Time Dilation**
Each layer deeper runs at different speed:
- Layer 1: Real time
- Layer 2: 2x faster
- Layer 3: 5x faster
- Layer 5: 20x faster
- Layer 10: 100x faster
Minutes in deep layers = hours in shallow ones. Planning becomes complex. Aging is subjective.

**Reality Checks**
Specific tests to determine if dreaming:
- Personal totems (objects that behave differently in dreams)
- Text reading (changes in dreams)
- Mirror reflections (wrong in dreams)
- Clocks and time (inconsistent in dreams)
- Failed checks don't prove anything—dreams can fake reality checks

**Layer Powers**
Deeper layers grant more control:
- Layer 1: Normal abilities
- Layer 3: Minor reality manipulation
- Layer 5: Physics bending
- Layer 7: Thought manifestation
- Layer 10: God-like powers
Trade-off: Power vs. reality anchor

**Descent/Ascent Mechanics**
Moving between layers:
- Descent: Fall asleep/die in current layer
- Ascent: Wake up/escape from current layer
- Lateral: Rare shortcuts through Liminal Spaces
- Difficulty scales—deep layers harder to leave

**Identity Fragmentation**
Spending too long in deep layers:
- Forgetting original identity
- Adopting dream personas
- Questioning base reality
- Risk of choosing wrong layer to "wake" to
Each layer has a "Home Appeal" score—temptation to stay

**Layer Specific Rules**
Each layer has unique properties:
- Layer 2: Wishes manifest slowly
- Layer 4: You're the hero of a story
- Layer 6: Communication is telepathic
- Layer 8: Time loops are possible
- Layer 12: You can meet past/future selves
Learning rules is survival skill

### Plot Twists

**Twist 1: They Never Fell Asleep**
The party has been in this dream structure since birth. "Layer 1" was always a dream. They're seeking a waking world that might not exist for them.

**Twist 2: One of Them Is Somnus**
The Dream Architect is a future version of a party member who descended so deep they became the structure itself. Confronting them is confronting their own potential future.

**Twist 3: The Layers Are Protective**
They're in comas in base reality due to trauma. The layers are healing simulation keeping them alive until recovery. Waking too soon kills them.

**Twist 4: It's All One Layer**
The "different layers" are the same layer experienced from different psychological states. There are no layers—only perspectives. Somnus is teaching them this.

**Twist 5: Base Reality Is Worse**
Layer 1 is horrible (war, plague, dystopia). The party subconsciously built deeper layers to escape. Somnus is trying to keep them from remembering why they're fleeing.

**Twist 6: Multiple Parties**
Every "NPC" is another player group experiencing the same layers differently. They're all real people in shared dream structure. Helping others helps themselves.

### Victory Conditions

**True Awakening**: Find base reality (Layer 0), wake up completely, escape dream structure
**Chosen Dream**: Pick preferred layer, accept it as reality, stop seeking "true" wake
**Architect Ascension**: Become new Somnus, control layer structure, help future dreamers
**Transcendence**: Realize all layers are real, exist in all simultaneously, become Dreamer

### Defeat Conditions

**Lost in Limbo**: Trapped between layers forever, neither dreaming nor waking
**Deep Dissolution**: Descend too far, identity dissolves into raw subconscious
**False Wake**: Accept wrong layer as reality, live in lie forever
**The Cycle**: Escape to Layer 0 only to discover it's Layer 17, infinite regression confirmed
