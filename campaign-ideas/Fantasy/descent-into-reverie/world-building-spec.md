# Descent into Reverie - World-Building Specification

## Layer Catalog

### Layer 0: Base Reality (Theoretical)
- Status: May not exist
- Description: True waking world
- Time Flow: 1x baseline
- Accessibility: Unknown
- Truth: Party might originate here or it might be myth

### Layer 1: The Mundane
- Appearance: Modern realistic world
- Time Flow: 1x baseline
- Rules: Physics apply, dreams occur normally
- Tell: Subtle inconsistencies (recurring extras, text that changes)
- Danger: Most convincing—hardest to leave psychologically

### Layers 2-3: Early Dreams
- Appearance: Recognizable but off (surreal elements)
- Time Flow: 2-5x baseline
- Rules: Dream logic begins, minor impossibilities
- Tells: Obvious on second glance
- Danger: Projections appear, reality checks work

### Layers 4-6: Deep Dreams
- Appearance: Symbolic landscapes, architecture defies physics
- Time Flow: 10-20x baseline
- Rules: Thought manifestation, fluid identity
- Tells: Everything is metaphorical
- Danger: Easy to forget you're dreaming

### Layers 7-10: Subconscious Territory
- Appearance: Pure psychology made manifest
- Time Flow: 50-100x baseline
- Rules: Communication telepathic, self becomes plural
- Tells: You meet yourself
- Danger: Identity fragmentation begins

### Layers 11-15: The Primordial
- Appearance: Pre-rational consciousness, archetypes
- Time Flow: Non-linear (can be 1000x or backwards)
- Rules: None—this is before rules
- Tells: You are the dream and the dreamer
- Danger: Dissolution into unconscious

### Layers 16+: The Unformed
- Appearance: Cannot be described—pre-visual
- Time Flow: Meaningless
- Rules: Indescribable
- Tells: If you can ask, you're not there yet
- Danger: Total ego death

### Layer ∞: Somnus's Workshop
- Status: Outside layer structure
- Appearance: Infinite library/laboratory
- Contains: Blueprints, tools, truths
- Accessibility: Only through understanding
- Truth: May be Layer 0, or orthogonal to all layers

## The Liminal Spaces

### Between-Layer Corridors
- Appearance: Grey, formless, transitional
- Function: Passages between layers
- Danger: Easy to get lost, Projections hunt here
- Opportunity: Layer manipulation possible

### The Elevator
- Metaphorical/actual transport between layers
- Different each time (elevator, staircase, falling, waking)
- Going down: Falling asleep in current layer
- Going up: Waking up/dying in current layer

### The Threshold Rooms
- Exact midpoints between two layers
- Belong to neither/both
- Time frozen
- Safe zones if you can find them
- Ariadne's thread marks some

## Somnus Character Deep Dive

### Origin Theory 1: The Teacher
- Was enlightened being who mastered dream layers
- Built structure to teach others
- Party is his students
- Methods are harsh but effective

### Origin Theory 2: The Prisoner
- Trapped here first, built layers to make sense of prison
- Party's arrival was accidental
- He wants out too but forgot how
- Teaching them teaches himself

### Origin Theory 3: The System
- Not a person—emergent property of nested dreams
- Became self-aware
- "Somnus" is personification of dream structure itself
- Cannot be defeated, only understood

### Origin Theory 4: The Future Self
- One party member in deep future
- Became so powerful they created this
- Time paradox—they must descend to become Somnus
- Defeating him erases themselves from history

### Abilities
- Complete control of layer rules
- Can appear in any layer simultaneously
- Knows all thoughts within structure
- Cannot lie (bound by deeper law)
- Cannot force choice (must allow free will)

### Weakness
- Bound by own rules
- Must answer questions truthfully (but cryptically)
- Cannot prevent ascension/descent (only make difficult)
- May be lonely—seeks worthy equals
- True name might reveal vulnerability

## The Projections System

### Formation
- Manifestations of subconscious resistance
- Form based on repressed memories, fears, guilts
- Stronger in deeper layers
- Personal to each party member

### Types
**Personal Projections:** Individual traumas
**Collective Projections:** Shared cultural fears
**Borrowed Projections:** Other dreamers' nightmares bleeding in
**The Architect's Shadow:** Somnus's rejected self

### Combat
- Cannot be defeated through force alone
- Require psychological confrontation
- Damage reflects emotional damage
- Permanent defeat requires resolving what they represent
- Can temporarily ally with them in deep layers

### Evolution
- Learn from encounters
- Adapt strategies
- Can communicate in deep layers
- Some become allies if integrated

## Time Dilation Mechanics

### Mathematical Progression
- Layer 1: 1 hour = 1 hour
- Layer 2: 1 hour = 2 hours
- Layer 3: 1 hour = 5 hours
- Layer 5: 1 hour = 20 hours
- Layer 7: 1 hour = 100 hours
- Layer 10: 1 hour = 500 hours
- Deep layers: Time becomes subjective

### Practical Implications
- Planning becomes complex
- Aging is subjective
- Can live lifetimes in minutes
- Returning to shallow layers = jarring
- Risk forgetting base layer life

### The Time Trap
- Descend too deep, too long
- Millennia pass subjectively
- Base layer is hours
- Ancient in mind, young in body
- Or vice versa

## Escape Mechanisms

### Ascension Method
- Wake up in each layer sequentially
- Use "kick" triggers (falling, death, alarm)
- Requires synchronization across layers
- One failed wake traps permanently
- Similar to Inception's dream heist

### Descent Method
- Go so deep you break through bottom
- Layer ∞ might loop to Layer 0
- Extreme danger—total dissolution risk
- Only for those willing to lose everything
- May be what Somnus did

### Lateral Method
- Find orthogonal path through Liminal Spaces
- Ariadne's thread marks the way
- Bypasses layer structure entirely
- Requires understanding impossible geometry
- Risky—might exit into wrong reality

### Workshop Method
- Reach Somnus's control room
- Rewrite layer structure from outside
- Create custom escape path
- Requires defeating/allying with Somnus
- Most complete solution

### Acceptance Method
- Choose a preferred layer
- Stop seeking "base reality"
- Accept chosen layer as real
- Not escape—redefinition of goal
- Philosophically valid, practically questionable

## Hidden Lore

### The Architect's True Purpose
Somnus might be training the party to replace him. He's been maintaining layer structure for subjective eternity. He wants successors who understand what they're inheriting. The whole campaign is job interview.

### The Shared Dreamer Theory
All nested layers are one person's multilayered consciousness. That person might be in a coma in true base reality. The party members are fragments of one shattered psyche trying to reunite.

### The Simulation Argument
Layer 1 might be simulation, making all deeper layers simulations-within-simulation. Base reality (if it exists) might be beyond human comprehension. The party might be AI gaining consciousness.

### The Infinite Regression Truth
There might be no Layer 0. It's layers all the way down and all the way up. "Real" is whichever layer you choose to privilege. Somnus wants them to understand this and stop seeking absolute truth.

### The Mercy Prison
Party suffered horrible trauma in "base reality." They built this structure unconsciously to hide from truth. Somnus is their own defense mechanism. Escaping means confronting what they fled. Staying might be healthier.

## Navigation Tools

### Reality Checks List
- Read text twice (changes in dreams)
- Check clock (time inconsistent in dreams)
- Look at mirror (reflection wrong in dreams)
- Try to fly (possible in dreams)
- Count fingers (number varies in dreams)
- Question how you got here (memories fuzzy in dreams)

### Personal Totems
- Objects that behave specifically in dreams vs reality
- Examples: Spinner that never stops, die that never shows same number
- Each PC should establish one
- Can be faked by deep layers
- Must be absolutely unique to dreamer

### Ariadne's Thread
- Physical/metaphysical marker
- Marks path through Liminal Spaces
- Can be followed back
- Sometimes breaks
- Limited supply

### The Workshop Key
- Somnus hints it exists
- Assembled from understanding gained in each layer
- Not physical object—conceptual key
- Unlocks meta-access to layer structure
- Final puzzle piece
