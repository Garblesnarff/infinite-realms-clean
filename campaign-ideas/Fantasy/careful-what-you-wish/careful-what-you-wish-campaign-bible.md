## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The universe operates on a single, unbreakable principle: The Law of Narrative Conservation. For every action, there is an equal and opposite story. A heroic sacrifice that saves a city (a "good story") might create a "bad story" of a grieving widow who turns to villainy. A true love's kiss might cause a jealous onlooker to become a monster. The cosmos is a zero-sum game of narrative. "Wishes," however, are a loophole. A wish is an attempt to create a "good story" ("I wish I was a king!") without the required narrative sacrifice or effort. The universe, a vast and impersonal bureaucracy, abhors this imbalance. When a wish is granted, the cosmos immediately creates a "Consequence"—a sentient, ironic, and often cruel "bad story" of equal narrative weight to balance the books. The beings who grant wishes—Genies, Fey, Devils—are not servants or tempters; they are cosmic lawyers, agents of the "Court of Consequences," bound by ancient law to process these wishes and then enforce the resulting, often horrific, payment. The campaign begins when a foolish, forgotten king, on the brink of losing his kingdom, finds a lamp and makes the biggest wish in history: "I wish for my kingdom to last forever and for my people to always be happy." The resulting Consequence is so vast and terrible it threatens to unravel the very fabric of narrative itself.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Wish (The Beginning):** The first sentient being looks at the stars and "wishes" it were not alone. In response, the universe creates a "Consequence": a second sentient being, who is its perfect rival and eternal enemy. The Law of Narrative Conservation is born.
2.  **The Age of Balance (Ancient History):** Mortals live in balance with the Law. They do not make wishes, but create their own stories through deeds.
3.  **The First Genie (c. -5,000 years):** A powerful, logical being (a Marid) is bound by the cosmos to become the first "Wish-Granter," a lawyer tasked with formalizing the wish/consequence process. The first "lamps" and "monkey's paws" are created as legal binding contracts.
4.  **The Empire of a Thousand Wishes (c. -3,000 years):** An emperor discovers a trove of wish-granting artifacts and builds a magnificent empire. His wishes are small and selfish. The Consequences are minor but cumulative: his food loses its taste, his artists can only create copies, his people forget how to laugh. The empire collapses into a grey, apathetic ruin.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day of Regret (c. -1,000 years):** A powerful wizard wishes to undo a single, terrible mistake from his past. The universe grants his wish. For 24 hours, every living creature is forced to vividly re-live their greatest regret, over and over. The collective psychic trauma scars the planet.
6.  **The Binding of the Court (c. -800 years):** The Gods, tired of the chaos caused by wishes, create the "Court of Consequences," a demi-plane where the Genies and other wish-granters are bound. They can now only grant wishes made through their specific, legally-binding artifacts.
7.  **The Forgotten King's Wish (c. -50 years):** King Osric of the small, forgotten kingdom of Oakhaven, on the verge of being conquered, finds an ancient lamp and makes his wish: "I wish for Oakhaven to last forever and for my people to always be happy."
8.  **The Consequence's Birth (c. -49 years to present):** The wish is granted. Oakhaven becomes a perfect, timeless, and utterly static utopia where the people are trapped in a single, perfect, happy day, repeating it for eternity. The "Consequence" for this massive, reality-defying wish manifests: The Iron Prince, a being of pure, logical stagnation, who seeks to impose Oakhaven's "perfectly happy" stasis on the entire, chaotic world.
9.  **(Surreal) The Un-Told Story (c. -10 years):** A child is born who has no "story." They have no past, no future, no potential. They are a "narrative vacuum," a blank page. This is a sign that the Law of Narrative Conservation is breaking down under the weight of Osric's wish.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the Laughter Soured (c. -1 week):** For 24 hours, all laughter in the world sounds like weeping. All joy is tinged with a deep, profound sorrow. The Consequence is beginning to "balance the books" on a global scale.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a battle against good intentions. King Osric's wish was not evil; it was born of love for his people. But his desire for a "perfect story" without sacrifice has created a "narrative debt" so large it is causing a universal recession. The Iron Prince is not a villain to be defeated; he is a cosmic accountant, here to collect on that debt. The players must find a way to "pay" it. Can they create a "good story" so powerful, so filled with heroic sacrifice and true, earned happiness, that it can balance the books? Can they find a legal "loophole" in the universe's oldest law? Or will they be forced to destroy Oakhaven's "perfect" happiness to save the rest of the world from its stagnant, smiling damnation?

### The Court of Consequences
**Type:** Cosmic Legal System
**Leader:** The Judge, a being of pure, dispassionate law. Its "Genies" and "Devils" are its lawyers and clerks.

### The Iron Legion
**Type:** Armies of the Great Consequence
**Leader:** The Iron Prince, a being of perfect, logical stasis, the Consequence of King Osric's wish.
**Asset:** An army of "Static Knights," constructs of grey, unfeeling iron who do not feel pain and cannot be reasoned with. Their touch drains emotion and imposes a perfect, terrible stillness.

### The Clause-Finders
**Type:** Metaphysical Lawyers and Philosophers
**Leader:** The Barrister of Loopholes, a man who once successfully argued his way out of a prophecy.

**Rivals:** The Court of Consequences.

### The People of Oakhaven
**Type:** Trapped Utopians
**Leader:** King Osric, who is also trapped in the repeating "perfect day."
**Asset:** Perfect, unassailable happiness. They are immune to fear, sadness, and despair. Their town is a fortress of joy, which is psychically damaging to any creature of negative emotion.
**Rivals:** None. They are perfectly content.

### The Brotherhood of the Earned Smile
**Type:** Stoic Heroes and Ascetics
**Leader:** The Old Man of the Mountain, a hero who achieved his fame through great personal sacrifice.

### The Wish-Brokers
**Type:** Black Market Artifact Dealers
**Leader:** The Collector, a mysterious figure who deals in wish-granting artifacts.

**Rivals:** The Iron Legion (who have no sense of humor).

### The Librarians of Faded Stories
**Type:** Narrative Archaeologists
**Leader:** The Head Librarian, who is slowly fading from existence as the stories she guards lose their power.

**Leader:** A man who wished to be the "greatest lover in the world" and was turned into a talking parrot.

## [TAG: LOCATIONS_MAIN]
### Oakhaven, the Happy Kingdom
A small, beautiful kingdom, trapped in a single, perfect, repeating day.
*   **The Sun-Drenched Square:** The town square, where the people are eternally celebrating a summer festival. **Smell:** Flowers, fresh-baked bread, and a cloying, unnatural sweetness. **Sound:** Constant, happy laughter, the same cheerful song played by the same bard, over and over.
*   **The Palace of the Contented King:** King Osric's castle, where he sits on his throne, a perfect, happy smile on his face. **Smell:** Polished wood, and the absence of dust or decay. **Sound:** The faint, endlessly repeating echo of the King's wish.
*   **The Unchanging Forest:** The forest around Oakhaven. The leaves never fall, the animals are never hungry, and the sun is always shining through the canopy. **Smell:** Green leaves, and the absence of the smell of decay. **Sound:** The cheerful, unceasing song of birds.
*   **The River of a Single Moment:** A river that does not flow. Its surface is a perfect, glassy mirror, reflecting the single, perfect, summer sky. **Smell:** Clean water, with no hint of fish or mud. **Sound:** Perfect, unnatural silence.
*   **The Wall of Thorns:** A wall of beautiful, flowering rose-thorns that surrounds the kingdom. It was not part of the wish, but a manifestation of the world's attempt to "quarantine" this reality-defying anomaly. **Smell:** Roses. **Sound:** The faint, angry buzz of the thorns.

### The Court of Consequences
A demi-plane of pure, dispassionate law, where wishes are processed.
*   **The Great Hall of Contracts:** A massive, sterile hall where Genies and other wish-granters argue their "cases" before the Judge. **Smell:** Old paper, and the cold scent of binding law. **Sound:** The murmur of a thousand lawyers, the boom of the Judge's gavel.
*   **The Vault of Loopholes:** A library containing every wish-contract ever made. The Clause-Finders spend their lives here, searching for a mistake. **Smell:** Dust, and the scent of desperation. **Sound:** The frantic rustle of turning pages.
*   **The Iron Prince's Chambers:** A perfectly grey, perfectly symmetrical, and perfectly empty room where the Iron Prince waits. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** The absence of sound.
*   **The Registry of Regret:** A massive hall where every Consequence is recorded. **Smell:** Ink, and the faint, salty scent of a million tears. **Sound:** The scratching of a million quills, recording a million tragedies.

### The Wasting Wilderness
The parts of the world being "drained" of narrative to pay for Oakhaven's happiness.
*   **The Grey Hills:** Hills where the grass is grey, the trees are grey, and the sky is a uniform, overcast grey. **Smell:** Dust, and apathy. **Sound:** A low, monotonous wind.
*   **The City of Amateurs:** A city where no one is a "master" of their craft. The bread is always slightly burnt, the swords are slightly bent, the songs are slightly out of tune. **Smell:** Mediocrity. **Sound:** A general, low-grade, uninspired hubbub.
*   **The River of Clichés:** A river where everything is a tired metaphor. The water is "like glass," the fish are "like silver," the current is "like the passage of time." **Smell:** The scent of a story you've heard a thousand times before. **Sound:** The faint, boring narration of a nature documentary.

### The Fortress of the Earned Smile
The mountain monastery of the Brotherhood, a place of harsh discipline and true, earned contentment.
*   **The Peak of Sacrifice:** A high, windswept peak where aspirants go to perform a great, selfless act. **Smell:** Cold air, and resolve. **Sound:** The roar of the wind.
*   **The Library of Deeds:** A library containing not books, but the actual, preserved "heroic deeds" of its members. **Smell:** Old leather, and the scent of victory. **Sound:** A respectful, proud silence.
*   **The Arena of Scars:** A training arena where every scar on the walls is from a famous, hard-won battle. **Smell:** Sweat, blood, and honor. **Sound:** The clash of steel, the shouts of warriors.

### The Black Market of Wishes
A chaotic, underground market run by The Collector.
*   **The Shop of Second-Hand Curses:** A shop that sells cursed items at a discount. **Smell:** Irony, and desperation. **Sound:** The haggling of desperate customers.

*   **The Auction of the Monkey's Paw:** A high-stakes auction where the most powerful and dangerous artifacts are sold. **Smell:** Money, and immense, foolish ambition. **Sound:** The fast-talking patter of the auctioneer.

## [TAG: QUEST_MAIN]
1.  **The Laughing Sickness:** The players are in a town where a strange "plague" has struck: no one can laugh. The laughter has been "stolen" to help pay the narrative debt of Oakhaven.
2.  **The Jester's Clue:** The Jester of the Apocalypse, The Punchline, appears and, finding the situation hilarious, gives the players their first clue: "The happiest kingdom is the saddest story."
3.  **The Road to Oakhaven:** The players must find the legendary, lost kingdom of Oakhaven. The journey takes them through the Wasting Wilderness.
4.  **The Perfect Day:** The players arrive in Oakhaven and are horrified to discover its true nature: a beautiful, happy, eternal prison.
5.  **The Glitch in the System:** The players discover the Mayor's "glitched" whisper for help and realize the people of Oakhaven are not truly happy.
6.  **The First Consequence:** The Iron Prince and his Static Knights arrive, drawn by the players' "chaotic" presence. They try to "pacify" a nearby village, imposing their perfect stasis.
7.  **A Visit from the Lawyer:** Jubal, the Genie, appears before the players, legally bound to inform them that they are now "accessories to a narrative crime" and are accumulating "debt." He gives them a cryptic clue about the "fine print" of the wish.
8.  **The Brotherhood's Offer:** The Brotherhood of the Earned Smile contacts the players, offering to help them "earn" a story powerful enough to balance the books.
9.  **The Clause-Finder's Case:** The Clause-Finders offer a different solution: find a legal loophole in the Court of Consequences.
10. **The Great Deed:** The players, siding with the Brotherhood, must perform a great, heroic deed (e.g., slaying a dragon, saving a city from a flood). The deed is successful, but only pays off a tiny fraction of the debt.
11. **The Cosmic Courtroom:** The players, siding with the Clause-Finders, must travel to the Court of Consequences and argue their case before The Judge. They fail, but discover a key piece of legal precedent.

13. **The Sadness of a Perfect Man:** The players break the curse on Osric, who is flooded with 50 years of repressed grief and horror. His immense, genuine sorrow is a "narrative event" of immense power.
14. **The Accountant's Rage:** The Iron Prince, seeing his "perfectly balanced" equation being ruined by this new, powerful emotion, loses his composure and attacks.
15. **The Final Argument:** The players must defeat the Iron Prince, not with swords, but with a "story"—by reminding him of the value of sadness, grief, and imperfection.
16. **The Loophole:** The players use the knowledge they have gained to find the ultimate loophole: a wish cannot be undone, but it can be *re-worded*.
17. **Be Careful What You Wish For:** The players confront Jubal, the Genie, and use their "one wish" (as legal representatives of King Osric) to re-word the original wish: "I wish for my people to have the *chance* to be happy, forever." The Consequence is balanced, Oakhaven is freed, and the Iron Prince becomes a being of pure, logical potential, free to find his own purpose.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Lamp of the First Genie
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** The original wish-granting artifact, a simple, clay oil lamp. It contains Jubal, the first and most powerful of the Genies.
**Mechanics:** The lamp can grant three, reality-altering wishes. However, it is a "perfect contract." The Consequence for each wish is equal, opposite, and perfectly, poetically, ironically just. The lamp can only be used once per person, ever. It is the most powerful and most dangerous object in the universe.

### 2. The Scales of Narrative Justice
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A beautiful, ornate set of scales, held by a small, clockwork statue of a blindfolded goddess.
**Mechanics:** When a "story" (a quest, a heroic deed, a wish) is completed, the user can place an object representing that story on one of the scales. The scales will then show the "narrative weight" of that story. The user can then place another object on the other scale to see what would be required to "balance" it. It is a tool for understanding and paying off narrative debt.

### 3. The Quill of the Cosmic Bailiff
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Quill)
**Description:** A quill made from a single, grey feather. It writes in a neat, implacable, and utterly final script.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this quill to write a single, binding, magical contract. Any party who signs the contract is magically bound to uphold their end of the bargain, on pain of being "erased" from existence by the Court of Consequences. The quill can also be used to "serve a summons" on any being, forcing them to appear for a negotiation.

### 4. The Un-Wishing Coin
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A simple, copper coin that seems to absorb the light around it. One side shows a smiling face, the other a weeping one.
**Mechanics:** The user can flip this coin once, and only once. If it lands on the smiling face, they can "un-wish" one wish that has been made by someone else. This does not erase the wish, but it erases the *Consequence*, leaving the "good story" unbalanced and creating a massive narrative debt that the user must then pay. If it lands on the weeping face, it erases the *wish*, but leaves the *Consequence* in existence, a tragedy with no cause.

### 5. The Final Draft
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Book)
**Description:** A large, leather-bound book that is completely blank. It was created by the Sage of the Empty Lot.
**Mechanics:** The user can use this book to "write" a new story into existence. This requires an immense act of will and sacrifice (e.g., giving up all of one's memories, or a piece of one's soul). If the user is successful, they can write a single, new "Law of Narrative," creating a new kind of story or a new way to balance the books. For example, they could write "The Law of Forgiveness," allowing a "bad story" to be balanced by a "story of true repentance." It is a tool for re-writing reality itself.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Half-Eaten Wish:** A cookie in the shape of a star, with one bite taken out of it. It can grant a single, very minor, and slightly disappointing wish.
2.  **The Lawyer's Quill:** A quill that, when you write with it, automatically adds several pages of incomprehensible legal jargon to your document.
3.  **A Bottled Argument:** A bottle containing the swirling, angry-colored energies of a marital dispute. If opened, everyone in the room falls into a petty argument.
4.  **The Iron Prince's Smile:** A small, iron mask that is a perfect replica of the Iron Prince's face. Wearing it makes you feel calm, content, and utterly devoid of ambition.
5.  **A "Get Out of a Minor Social Obligation Free" Card:** A card that will allow you to get out of one awkward dinner party or boring wedding.
6.  **The Monkey's Other Paw:** A second, mummified monkey's paw. It doesn't grant wishes, but it can give a surprisingly firm "thumbs up."
7.  **A Single, Perfect, Happy Memory from Oakhaven:** A small, glowing orb. If you crush it, you experience a single, perfect, happy moment. You then feel a profound sense of loss.
8.  **The Regretful Parrot's Cracker:** A single, perfect, and delicious cracker.
9.  **A Blank Check:** A check, drawn on the "Bank of the Cosmos." You can write it for any amount of "happiness." The Consequence is, of course, an equal amount of "sadness."
10. **The Jester's Slapstick:** A rubber chicken that, when used as a weapon, makes a loud "slap" sound and deals 1 point of psychic damage (from embarrassment).
11. **A "Cautionary Tale" in a Bottle:** A tiny ship in a bottle, depicting a scene from a famous, cautionary tale.
12. **The Loophole:** A small, twisted piece of metal that looks like it was tied in a knot. It does nothing, but the Clause-Finders will pay a fortune for it.
13. **A Single, Un-Wished Wish:** A dandelion seed head. All the seeds are still attached. It is pregnant with possibility.
14. **The Bureaucrat's Inkwell:** An inkwell that is full of grey, uninspired ink.
15. **A "Good-Enough" Trophy:** A small, tin trophy with a plaque that reads "You Tried."
16. **The Story of a Boring Man:** A short, incredibly boring, and poorly-written biography of a man whose life was completely without incident. It is a powerful weapon against beings of narrative.
17. **A Single, Ironic Cheer:** A small, brass bell that, when rung, produces the sound of a single person clapping, slowly and sarcastically.
18. **The Consequence of a Wish for a Better Pen:** A pen that is beautiful, writes perfectly, but all the words you write with it are lies.
19. **A Faded Photograph of a Happy Couple:** You don't know who they are, but you get the sense that their story did not end well.
20. **A Receipt from the Court of Consequences:** A long, itemized receipt for a single, minor wish. The "legal fees" and "narrative taxes" are astronomical.

## [TAG: ENEMY_STATBLOCK]
### 1. Static Knight
(CR 4). Construct. HP 70, AC 18.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Aura of Stasis:** The area within 20 feet of the knight is difficult terrain as the very air resists movement and change.
*   **Action: Pacifying Touch:** Melee attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage and must make a CHA save or be overcome with apathy, unable to take any actions on its next turn.

### 2. A "Consequence"
(CR 6). Aberration. HP 95, AC 15.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Ironic Defense:** The Consequence is immune to the damage type most associated with the wish that created it. (e.g., the Consequence of a wish for "love" would be immune to psychic damage).
*   **Action: Poetic Justice:** The Consequence makes an attack that is an ironic reflection of the original wish. A wish for "riches" might result in an attack that turns the target's gear to lead.

### 3. A "Loophole"
(CR 5). Aberration. HP 70, AC 16.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Intangible Logic:** The Loophole can move through solid objects as long as it can argue that the object is "conceptually" not there.
*   **Action: Twist the Words:** The Loophole targets a creature under the effect of a spell. It can "re-interpret" the spell's wording, changing its target or effect in a minor, but significant, way.

### 4. A "Happy" Citizen of Oakhaven
(CR 1). Humanoid. HP 30, AC 10.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Aura of Blissful Ignorance:** The citizen is immune to being charmed or frightened. Any creature attacking the citizen must make a WIS save or be unable to attack, unwilling to harm someone so perfectly happy.
*   **Action: Cheerful Greeting:** The citizen gives a friendly wave. The target must make a WIS save or be charmed for 1 minute.

### 5. A "Heroic Deed" (Sentient Story)
(CR 8). Celestial. HP 120, AC 17.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Narrative Armor:** The Deed is resistant to damage from any creature whose "story" is less significant than its own (DM's discretion).
*   **Action: Self-Sacrifice:** The Deed sacrifices a portion of its own essence. An ally is healed to full hit points, but the Deed takes an equal amount of damage.

### 6. A "Bad Joke" (Sentient Story)
(CR 3). Fey. HP 50, AC 14.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Groan-Inducing Aura:** Any creature starting its turn within 20 feet of the Joke must make a WIS save or use its action to groan and roll its eyes.
*   **Action: The Punchline:** The Joke tells its punchline. All creatures who hear it must make a WIS save or take 3d6 psychic damage and fall prone from laughter.

### 7. A "Legal Precedent"
(CR 7). Construct. HP 100, AC 18.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Binding Authority:** The Precedent cannot be moved against its will. All creatures within 30 feet are considered to be under the effect of a *Zone of Truth* spell.
*   **Action: Objection!:** The Precedent uses its reaction to "object" to a spell being cast. The caster must make a spellcasting check against the Precedent's save DC or the spell fails.

### 8. A "Blank Page"
(CR 6). Ooze. HP 90, AC 8.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Narrative Vacuum:** The Blank Page is immune to all spells that have a "story" or "narrative" component.
*   **Action: Erase:** The Blank Page touches a creature. The target must make a CHA save or have one of their defining character traits (e.g., "brave," "loyal," "greedy") temporarily erased for 1 hour.

### 9. A "Cautionary Tale"
(CR 5). Undead. HP 80, AC 15.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: I Told You So:** If a creature fails a saving throw within 30 feet of the Tale, it takes an extra 1d8 psychic damage.
*   **Action: A Terrible Example:** The Tale shows a creature a vision of a terrible fate. The target must make a WIS save or become frightened for 1 minute.

### 10. The Cosmic Accountant
(CR 9). Inevitable. HP 140, AC 19.
**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: The Books Must Balance:** At the start of its turn, the Accountant chooses the creature with the highest current HP and the creature with the lowest current HP. It transfers 2d10 hit points from the highest to the lowest.
*   **Action: Audit:** The Accountant targets a creature. The target must make an INT save. On a failure, the Accountant discovers a "discrepancy" in their life-story, and the target takes 5d10 force damage as reality "corrects" the error.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Weight
Every action, every story, every wish has a "Narrative Weight." A small, selfish wish has a small weight. A heroic, world-saving deed has a massive weight.
*   **Balancing the Books:** The universe must always be in balance. A "good story" must be balanced by a "bad story" of equal weight. A wish creates a "good story" out of nothing, creating a "narrative debt." This debt *must* be paid, usually by the universe creating a "Consequence" (a bad story) of equal weight.
*   **Narrative Debt:** The players can track the "Narrative Debt" of Osric's wish. It is a massive number. They can "pay it down" by completing quests that are "good stories" (heroic deeds, selfless acts). They can also make it worse by making their own wishes.
*   **Ironic Twists:** The nature of a Consequence is always an ironic reflection of the wish. A wish for eternal life might result in being turned into a timeless, un-moving statue. A wish for riches might result in being given the Midas touch.

### Subsystems: The Wish-Board and The Court of Public Opinion
*   **The Wish-Board:** The DM should have a "board" of all the wishes and consequences currently active in the world. The players might find a "monkey's paw" and make a wish. The DM then writes down the wish and the resulting, ironic Consequence. This Consequence now becomes a new plot hook or recurring problem in the world.
*   **The Court of Public Opinion:** The players' actions are part of a story. The more people who know and tell that story, the more "Narrative Weight" it has. The players can gain "Notoriety" by performing public deeds, telling their own stories in taverns, or getting the bards to sing songs about them. A heroic deed that no one knows about has very little weight. A minor deed that becomes a world-famous legend has immense weight.
