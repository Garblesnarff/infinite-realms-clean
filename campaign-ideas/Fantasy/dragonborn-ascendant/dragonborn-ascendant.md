## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-35 sessions)

An epic journey from prisoner to legendary dragon slayer and savior of the world.

*   **Act I — The Dragon Crisis & The Voice (Sessions 1-12):** The party escapes execution when a dragon attacks, learning they are Dragonborn when they absorb a dragon's soul. They travel to High Hrothgar, a monastery atop the Throat of the World, to learn the Way of the Voice from the Greybeards. They master Thu'um shouts—reality-bending words of power—and hunt dragons plaguing Skyrim's holds. They learn Alduin has returned and is resurrecting ancient dragons. Meanwhile, the Civil War between Imperials and Stormcloaks demands they choose a side.
*   **Act II — The Blades & Elder Knowledge (Sessions 13-24):** They join the Blades, an ancient order of dragon-slayers, and hunt Alduin's lieutenants. To learn how to defeat Alduin permanently, they must find an Elder Scroll—artifacts that record past and future. This quest takes them through Dwemer ruins, vampire-infested caves, and arcane college politics. They learn Alduin was banished to the future (now) by ancient heroes using a special Shout. They must learn this Shout by witnessing the past through the Elder Scroll. The Civil War intensifies—whichever side they support gains ground.
*   **Act III — Sovngarde & The World-Eater (Sessions 25-35):** With the Dragonrend Shout learned, they can finally challenge Alduin. They pursue him to the Throat of the World for an epic battle, but he flees to Sovngarde—the Nordic afterlife. To follow, they must capture a dragon and force it to fly them to the portal. In Sovngarde, they ally with ancient heroes and face Alduin in his own realm. After his defeat, they return as legends. The Civil War reaches its climax—they can help end it peacefully or see it through to bloody conclusion. Epilogue shows a Skyrim forever changed by their choices.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of destiny versus free will, the burden of heroic prophecy, cultural identity and autonomy, and redemption. It asks: Can you forge your own path while fulfilling prophecy? Is cultural independence worth civil war? Can ancient evils (or beings) be redeemed? The central conflict pits the party's role as prophesied hero against their desire to make their own choices, while Skyrim tears itself apart.
