# Creative Brief: The Crossing to Dreamtime

## Art Style: Aboriginal Art and Deep Connection

Inspired by traditional Aboriginal art: dot paintings, rock art, bark paintings, and the distinctive x-ray style. Earth tones dominate. Symbolic representation rather than literal. Art that's functional and spiritual, not merely decorative.

### Core Principles:

*   **Symbolic and Layered:** Images contain multiple meanings and stories. Dots, lines, and symbols represent deep knowledge.
*   **Earth and Ochre:** Red earth, white clay, yellow ochre, black charcoal. Colors from the land itself.
*   **Living Land:** The landscape is a character, not just a setting. Country has awareness and agency.

## Voice

A storyteller's voice, passed down through generations. Uses rhythmic repetition, metaphor, and deep connection to land. Timeless and patient. Speaks of the living world and Dreamtime as continuous. Respectful of knowledge that's earned, not freely given.

## Music Direction

Didgeridoo as primary instrument, creating drone and connection to earth. Clapsticks, rhythm and ceremony. Singing that sounds like the land itself. Each area has its own song. Music that teaches the songlines. Traditional Aboriginal music consultation strongly recommended for authenticity and respect.

## Sound Design

Wind across red earth, water in billabongs, animal calls (kookaburra, dingo, cockatoo), footsteps on various country, the didgeridoo's drone connecting all sounds, the crackle of campfire, stones being painted, the living presence of land, ancestral voices in wind and water, the timeless quality of Dreamtime where past and present sound simultaneously.

**Important Note**: This campaign deals with living Aboriginal culture and sacred traditions. Proper consultation with Aboriginal elders and cultural advisors is essential. Some knowledge is restricted and shouldn't be shared. Approach with deep respect, acknowledging that this isn't ancient mythology but living spirituality. Consider whether non-Aboriginal people should run this campaign at all, or if it should only be created with Aboriginal guidance and blessing.
