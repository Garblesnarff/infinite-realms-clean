# Creative Brief: Slimes and Sanctuary

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Wholesome Fantasy with Found Family Warmth

Inspired by wholesome isekai like *By the Grace of the Gods*, *I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years*, slice-of-life fantasy like *Restaurant to Another World*, and heartwarming anime like *Somali and the Forest Spirit*. This style combines soft pastoral fantasy with genuine emotion, cute creature designs with real stakes, and the visual language of building home and family.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Soft and Welcoming**: Environments feel safe and nurturing. Even challenges are framed with hope.
*   **Expressive Creatures**: "Worthless" monsters are adorable and full of personality. Slimes have character through shape and movement.
*   **Found Family Warmth**: Visual emphasis on togetherness, caring moments, and building community.
*   **Beauty in the Overlooked**: Highlight the charm of things society ignores—wildflowers in ruins, sunset over simple camps, joy in small moments.
