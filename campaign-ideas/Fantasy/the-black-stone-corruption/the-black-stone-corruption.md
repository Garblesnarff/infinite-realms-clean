The land of Serendia is rich with mysterious Black Stones—crystalline fragments that enhance weapons and armor beyond natural limits, but corrupt those who use them. The players are adventurers seeking to build trade empires by controlling worker nodes, towns, and resources while fighting rivals for territorial supremacy. But as they grow more powerful through Black Stone enhancement, dark rifts begin opening—leaking monsters and madness from another dimension. They must balance ambition with the creeping corruption that threatens to transform them into the very monsters they fight.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 13+ sessions)

A tale of economic empire-building corrupted by dark power.

*   **Act I — The Worker's Empire (Sessions 1–5):** The party arrives in Serendia and begins building their economic base. They establish worker networks, control trade nodes, and fight bandits and rival guilds. They discover Black Stones enhance their gear dramatically but whisper strange compulsions. Guild wars over node control begin.
*   **Act II — The Dark Rifts (Sessions 6–10):** As the party's power grows, dark rifts begin opening near areas with heavy Black Stone concentration. Monsters pour through, and the party discovers the stones are fragments of a sealed god. Using them weakens the seal. They must balance continued enhancement against growing corruption and rift frequency.
*   **Act III — The Black God (Sessions 11–13+):** The party must choose: continue using Black Stones and risk breaking the seal entirely, purge their corruption and fight the rifts with reduced power, or attempt to control the Black God's emergence for their own benefit. Their choice determines Serendia's fate.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Black Stone Enhancement System**
*   Equipment can be enhanced using Black Stones, adding +1 to +20 to weapons/armor.
*   Each enhancement attempt requires Black Stones and has failure chance (50% base).
*   Failure can degrade equipment or destroy it entirely.
*   High enhancement grants massive power but accumulates Corruption Points.

### 2. **Corruption Points**
*   Using Black Stones, closing rifts, or certain actions grant Corruption.
*   At certain thresholds (25, 50, 75, 100), players gain:
    *   **Benefits:** Bonus abilities, enhanced stats, dark powers.
    *   **Costs:** Disturbing dreams, compulsions, physical changes, rift attraction.
*   At 100 Corruption, must make daily Wisdom saves or permanently transform into a monster NPC.

### 3. **Worker Empire System**
*   Players hire workers (NPCs) to gather resources from controlled nodes.
*   Workers have stamina that depletes, requiring lodging and food.
*   Resources gathered are used for crafting, trading, or guild projects.
*   Nodes can be contested—PvP combat determines ownership during scheduled "node wars."

### 4. **Guild Wars and Territory**
*   Guilds can declare war for control of specific territory.
*   Victory grants tax income from that territory's economic activity.
*   Losing means giving up control and potentially disbanding workers.
*   Wars are scheduled events with teams fighting for objectives.

### 5. **Dark Rift Events**
*   Random encounters where rifts spawn based on party's total Corruption.
*   Higher Corruption = more frequent and dangerous rifts.
*   Rifts spawn boss monsters that drop valuable loot but increase local Corruption.
*   Closing rifts grants rewards but also Corruption—vicious cycle.

### 6. **Life Skills Economy**
*   Players can invest in life skills: trading, processing, cooking, alchemy, training horses.
*   These create passive income and rare resources.
*   Some recipes can temporarily reduce Corruption or enhance without Black Stones.
*   Creates non-combat progression paths.
