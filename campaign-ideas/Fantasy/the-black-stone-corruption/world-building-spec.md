**The Black Stone Corruption**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Players build trade empires by controlling worker nodes and resources in Serendia, using Black Stones to enhance gear. But the stones are fragments of a sealed god, and using them causes dark rifts and corruption that threaten to transform users into monsters.

    *   Detail previous corruption incidents and those who transformed into monsters.

        *   **Assets:** Anti-corruption magic, rift-sealing techniques, moral authority.
