# Clockwork Elemental - World-Building Specification

## Historical Context

**Era of Avatar Aang (Previous Generation)**: Hundred Year War ended. Fire Nation defeated. Four nations beginning recovery. Aang united world through Avatar role.

**Industrial Revolution Begins**: Fire Nation technology spreads. Steam power, metalworking, airships developed. Non-benders find ways to compete.

**Republic City Founded**: Aang and Zuko create cosmopolitan city where all nations mix. Idealistic experiment in multiculturalism.

**Current Era**: Aang dead 15-20 years. Korra young/missing/captured (DM choice). Industrial age accelerating. Traditional ways threatened.

## Four Nations Status

**Water Tribes**: Northern (traditional, patriarchal) vs. Southern (progressive, industrial). Healing arts preserved. Some embrace modernity, others resist.

**Earth Kingdom**: Fractured after queen's death. City-states competing. Ba Sing Se traditionalist. Zaofu progressive. Power vacuum invites strongmen like Kuvira.

**Fire Nation**: Post-war redemption arc. Technology leaders. Guilt over past drives some reform, others nationalism. Lightning benders power industrial revolution.

**Air Nomads**: Nearly extinct. Tenzin rebuilding. New airbenders appearing threatens cultural purity vs. survival joy. Most spiritual, least industrial.

## Bending Mechanics Detailed

**Waterbending**:
- Liquid manipulation, ice creation, steam control
- Healing (restorative chi flow)
- Bloodbending (full moon only, extremely forbidden)
- Plant bending (swamp tribe specialty)

**Earthbending**:
- Stone, metal, sand, lava variants
- Seismic sense (Toph's invention—see through earth)
- Metalbending (industrial revolution key—police, construction)
- Lavabending (rare genetic ability)

**Firebending**:
- Flame projection, lightning, combustion
- Lightning generation (power plants)
- Lightning redirection (defensive technique)
- Blue fire (hotter, more skilled)

**Airbending**:
- Flight, levitation, air projection
- Spiritual projection (master technique)
- Suffocation (forbidden, effective)
- Sound amplification

**Non-Bending Techniques**:
- Chi-blocking (Ty Lee's invention—martial art disabling bending)
- Technology (mecha-suits, electricity without lightning)
- Strategy and leadership
- Bloodline and resources

## Republic City Detailed

**Districts**:
- **Downtown**: Art Deco skyscrapers, City Hall, police HQ
- **Dragon Flats**: Poor district, Equalist recruiting ground
- **Industrial**: Factories, smog, worker housing
- **Harmony**: Cultural mixing, markets
- **Air Temple Island**: Tenzin's home, traditional enclave

**Government**: Council representing each nation. Corruption and favoritism issues. Bender majority creates bias.

**Pro-Bending**: Major sport. 3v3 teams (water-earth-fire). Arena battles. Gambling and organized crime involvement.

**Police**: Metalbender corps (Lin Beifong). Cable systems, metal armor. Controversial—only benders allowed creates resentment.

**Technology**: Radio, automobiles (Satomobiles), electricity, telephone, airships. Rapidly industrializing.

## Equalist Movement

**Ideology**: Benders oppress non-benders through genetic privilege. Solution: remove bending or suppress benders. Equality through eliminating difference.

**Legitimate Grievances**:
- Bender-only police force
- Bending gangs (Triple Threats, etc.)
- Job discrimination (many roles prefer benders)
- Political underrepresentation

**Methods**: Chi-blocking, mecha-suits, propaganda, terrorism. "By any means necessary."

**Leadership**: Amon (masked, charismatic, bloodbender secretly). Hiroshi Sato (funding). Cell structure.

**Problem**: Solution is oppression mirroring what they fight. Removing bending violates bodily autonomy. Become what they hate.

## Spirit World Mechanics

**Nature**: Parallel dimension. Beings of pure concept/emotion live there. Physics optional. Time fluid.

**Access**: Spirit portals (North/South poles, Republic City). Deep meditation. Near-death experiences.

**Inhabitants**:
- **Raava**: Spirit of light/order
- **Vaatu**: Spirit of dark/chaos
- **Wan Shi Tong**: Knowledge spirit
- **Koh**: Face-stealing entity
- **Hei Bai**: Forest spirit
- **Countless others**: Every concept has spirit

**Balance**: Material and spirit worlds need separation with connection points. Too much mixing = chaos. Too little = stagnation.

**Industrial Damage**: Pollution, deforestation, mining damage spirits. They become dark/aggressive. Attacking human world.

## Technology vs. Spirituality

**Technology Benefits**:
- Equalizes bender/non-bender gap
- Improves life quality (medicine, transport)
- Economic growth
- Non-benders gain agency

**Technology Costs**:
- Environmental damage
- Spirit world corruption
- Cultural erosion
- Weapons escalation

**Spirituality Benefits**:
- Connection to something greater
- Environmental harmony
- Traditional wisdom
- Bending as art/culture

**Spirituality Costs**:
- Can justify hierarchy
- Resists necessary change
- Excludes non-benders
- Static culture

**Campaign Goal**: Find balance, not supremacy.

## Mecha Development

**Equalist Mechs**: Platinum (non-bendable), electrified fists, cable launchers, chi-blocking. Man-sized. Mass-produced.

**Metal Clan Mechs**: Construction tools, precision work, artistic. Bendable metal for piloting integration.

**Military Mechs**: Earth Empire mass production. Armed with net launchers, dart guns. Platoon support.

**The Colossus**: Kaiju-sized (100+ feet). Platinum shell. Spirit vine laser arm. Kuvira's superweapon. City-destroyer.

## Spirit Vines

**Nature**: Plants growing from spirit portals. Extremely high energy when processed.

**Uses**:
- Power source (replaces coal)
- Weapons (energy blasts)
- Medicine (controversial)
- Portal stability (or destabilization)

**Problem**: They're alive. Semi-sentient. Harvesting them is essentially slavery/murder of spiritual beings.

**Varrick's Industry**: Doesn't care about ethics. Sees profit. Funny but harmful character.

## Harmonic Convergence

**Event**: Planetary alignment amplifying spiritual energy. Occurs every 10,000 years.

**Effects**:
- Spirit portals open
- Bending amplified
- New airbenders appear randomly
- Reality barriers thin
- Raava/Vaatu influence strongest

**Campaign Use**: Ultimate crisis/opportunity point. Villains try to weaponize. Party must manage.

## Sub-Factions

**Red Lotus**: Anarchist group wanting to eliminate all nations and let chaos reign. See Avatar as oppression symbol.

**White Lotus**: Originally secret society preserving knowledge. Now Avatar's bodyguards. Conservative.

**Triple Threat Triad**: Bending gang. Shows bender criminality justifying Equalist fears.

**Metal Clan**: Beifong family. Progressive but exclusive. Good intentions, problematic execution.

## Key Technologies

**Satomobiles**: Electric cars (Hiroshi Sato's company). Mass production beginning.

**Radios**: Communication revolution. Propaganda tool. Amon uses broadcasts.

**Airships**: Fire Nation development spreading. Military and civilian.

**Platinum Refining**: Non-bendable metal crucial for anti-bender tech.

**Spirit Vine Engines**: Controversial power source. High output, ethical questions.

**Mecha-Suits**: Various sizes from man-portable to Colossus.

## Cultural Tensions

**Tradition vs. Progress**: Air Nomads vs. industrialists.

**Bender Supremacy vs. Equality**: Genetic privilege vs. earned capability.

**Nation vs. Republic**: Traditional nations vs. cosmopolitan mixing.

**Spirituality vs. Science**: Faith vs. empiricism.

**Individual vs. Collective**: Personal freedom vs. social good.

## Campaign Paths

**Pro-Technology**: Help industry, regulate ethically, achieve equality through invention.

**Pro-Tradition**: Resist modernization, protect spirits, maintain bending culture.

**Revolutionary**: Overthrow existing systems (Equalist or otherwise), radical change.

**Balanced Approach**: Navigate between extremes, find harmonious third way.

## Endings Expanded

**Harmonious Future**: Technology regulated. Spirits protected. Bender/non-bender equality. Republic City thrives as model.

**Equalist Victory**: Bending suppressed/removed. Technology supreme. Spirit world sealed. Efficient but soulless.

**Traditionalist Restoration**: Industry dismantled. Four nations separate again. Spirits safe. Progress halted.

**Spirit Integration**: Material and spirit worlds merge. New reality with different rules. Uncertain but transformative.

**Authoritarian Order**: Kuvira or similar wins. Mech-enforced peace. Stability through tyranny.

**Apocalyptic Failure**: Uncontrolled harmonic convergence. Reality shattered. Campaign total loss.
