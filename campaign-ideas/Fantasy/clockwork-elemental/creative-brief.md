# Clockwork Elemental - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Legend of Korra's Art Deco meets Avatar's Asian aesthetics. 1920s industrialization mixed with martial arts fluidity. Bending as dance-like combat. Technology as geometric precision. Spirit world as watercolor dreamscape.

## Color Palettes
**Republic City**: Jazz Age Gold (#FFD700), Industrial Grey (#696969), Neon Blue (#00BFFF), Art Deco Teal (#008080)
**Elemental**: Water Blue (#1E90FF), Earth Green (#228B22), Fire Red (#FF4500), Air Orange (#FFA500)

## Music
Jazz and swing for Republic City. Traditional Asian instruments (erhu, guzheng) for spirit sequences. Industrial percussion for mecha combat. Fusion representing cultural mixing. Character themes match bending element.

## Voice Direction
**Amon**: Calm revolutionary rhetoric. Never yells. More frightening in whispers.
**Kuvira**: Military precision. Believes she's hero. Authoritarian but not cackling villain.
**Varrick**: Manic entrepreneur. Think Elon Musk meets snake oil salesman.
**Tenzin**: J.K. Simmons' patient wisdom hiding frustration with modernity.

## Cinematic Moments
- Bending combat choreography (martial arts as magic)
- First mecha-suit reveal (technology matching bending)
- Spirit world entry (reality melting into art)
- Amon removing bending (horror of power loss)
- Colossus laser firing (kaiju destruction)
- Harmonic convergence (mass airbender awakening)
- Final choice moment (which future to choose)

## Player Experience
Bending as martial arts-powered magic. Technology as equalizer. Moral complexity—both sides have points. Spirit world wonder. Urban adventure meets mystical quest.
