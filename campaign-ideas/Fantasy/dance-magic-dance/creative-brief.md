## Art Style: 1980s Fantasy Practical Effects meets Surrealist Art

Theatrical fantasy combining Jim Henson puppetry aesthetics with M.C. Escher geometry and David Bowie glam rock. Everything has a handmade, practical feel—visible texture, exaggerated features, whimsical yet slightly uncanny. The surreal is grounded in tangible physicality.

### Core Principles:
*   **Practical Magic:** Fantasy feels touchable—puppets, sets, costumes rather than ethereal CGI
*   **Surreal Logic:** Escher-inspired impossible geometry and dream-like transitions
*   **Theatrical Glamour:** Everything is a performance, especially Jareth

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** The labyrinth uses earthy stone grays, mossy greens, dusty browns. The Bog is murky greens and browns. The Goblin City uses warm torchlight ambers and reds. Jareth's domain features stark contrasts—white marble, black voids, crystal ball clarity. The masked ball is all silver, gold, and midnight blue glamour. His costume is tight pants, flowing capes, and glitter.

**Character Design:** Jareth is glam rock royalty—wild blonde hair, dramatic makeup, theatrical costumes. Goblins are ugly-cute puppets with exaggerated features. Hoggle is grumpy dwarf with warts and bristles. Sir Didymus is a fox-terrier in knight's armor. Ludo is massive, shaggy, with gentle eyes. Everything feels handcrafted.

**Environments:** Stone labyrinth walls covered in texture and moss. The Escher castle has stairs everywhere—up, down, sideways, impossible angles. The masked ball is baroque grandeur. The Goblin City is chaotic medieval fantasy. Everything has depth and tactile quality.

**Composition:** Use impossible perspectives for the castle—Escher's "Relativity" brought to life. Frame Jareth dramatically with low angles emphasizing his power and theatricality. Use Dutch angles for surreal moments. Wide shots emphasize the labyrinth's scale and the party's smallness within it.

## Voice

Theatrical, knowing narrator with whimsical British flair. Like someone recounting a dream that was both magical and meaningful—playful during absurdist moments, sincere during emotional beats. Quick-witted and fond of wordplay. The emotion balances wonder with the ache of growing up. Role: A storyteller who understands that fairy tales teach real lessons through fantastic metaphors.

## Music Style

1980s fantasy synth-rock in the style of David Bowie and Trevor Jones. Jareth's themes use synthesizers, dramatic vocals, and theatrical rock—"Magic Dance" energy for goblin chaos, haunting ballads for temptation. The labyrinth itself has mysterious, wandering melodies using woodwinds and strings. The masked ball is classical-rock fusion—waltz time with electric undertones. Sir Didymus has heroic brass despite his size. Overall tone is whimsical adventure with emotional depth and rock opera theatricality.
