## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Puzzle-Focused:** Combat is secondary to riddles, logic puzzles, and creative problem-solving.
*   **Time Pressure:** The thirteen-hour countdown creates urgency without being overwhelming.
*   **Perception Challenges:** Nothing is as it seems—doors that aren't doors, helpful creatures that mislead.
*   **Temptation Tests:** Jareth offers escapes and dreams to make the party give up.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A single-act race-against-time structure through increasingly surreal challenges.

*   **Act I — The Outer Labyrinth (Sessions 1–3):** The party enters the labyrinth and encounters its basic tricks—walls that move, creatures that lie, and the realization that "solving" the maze requires accepting its absurd logic.
*   **Act II — The Inner Trials (Sessions 4–6):** They face greater challenges: the Bog of Eternal Stench, the Goblin City, Jareth's direct temptations, and surreal dreamscapes testing their resolve.
*   **Act III — The Castle (Sessions 7–8):** The final confrontation with Jareth in his Escher-inspired castle, where they must speak the words that break his power: "You have no power over me."

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 1 — "The Thirteen Hours"
*   A loved one (child sibling, innocent companion) is stolen by goblins after a careless wish.
*   Jareth the Goblin King appears, charismatic and cruel, offering a challenge: solve his labyrinth in thirteen hours.
*   **Escalation:** Time begins. The labyrinth's entrance reveals a vast maze with no clear path.

### Session 2 — "The Walls Have Ears"
*   The party meets Hoggle, a grumpy dwarf who claims to be their friend but serves Jareth.
*   They encounter the labyrinth's first rules: things that look like walls aren't, doors lead nowhere, asking the right questions matters.
*   **Escalation:** A riddling door guarded by two guardians—one lies, one tells truth.

### Session 3 — "The Helping Hands"
*   The party falls into a pit of helping hands—thousands of hands forming walls, offering aid, but leading where they're not wanted.
*   They meet strange creatures: door-knockers, wise worms, false alarms.
*   **Escalation:** Time is running out faster than expected. Jareth appears to mock their progress.

### Session 4 — "The Bog of Eternal Stench"
*   They must cross the bog—anyone who touches it stinks forever. Sir Didymus, a brave fox-knight, guards the bridge.
*   Goblin encounters become more theatrical and dangerous.
*   **Escalation:** Hoggle betrays them under Jareth's orders, giving them a poisoned peach.

### Session 5 — "The Dream"
*   Someone eats the peach and falls into a surreal dream—a masked ball where Jareth offers escape, glamour, and the chance to forget responsibilities.
*   Others must break them free from the fantasy.
*   **Escalation:** Reality and illusion blur. They're running out of time.

### Session 6 — "The Goblin City"
*   They reach the goblin city—chaotic, nonsensical, filled with goblins and contradictions.
*   They must navigate this urban maze while goblins cause havoc.
*   **Escalation:** The castle looms ahead. Jareth makes his final offer: give up and stay comfortable, or risk everything.

### Session 7 — "The Escher Stairways"
*   They enter Jareth's castle—an impossible space of stairs going every direction, gravity optional.
*   Jareth manipulates time and space, separating the party, creating obstacles.
*   **Escalation:** They must reach the throne room where the stolen one is being transformed.

### Session 8 — "You Have No Power Over Me"
*   Final confrontation with Jareth. He offers everything—dreams, power, love, escape from responsibility.
*   The party must realize the labyrinth was about their own growth and self-belief.
*   Speaking the words "You have no power over me" breaks Jareth's hold.
*   **Escalation:** Everything collapses. They return home with the rescued one and new wisdom.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Labyrinth Entrance:** Vast maze walls stretching forever, seemingly no paths forward.
2.  **The Pit of Hands:** Vertical shaft where hands form walls offering contradictory help.
3.  **The Bog of Eternal Stench:** Swampland with permanent odor curse, guarded by Sir Didymus.

## Central Conflict

Growing up versus staying in fantasy. Jareth represents the temptation to avoid responsibility, stay in comfortable dreams, and let others make choices. The labyrinth itself is a test of maturity—can the party accept reality's difficulties while maintaining wonder? Can they claim their own power instead of letting others (Jareth) control them? The stolen one symbolizes innocence that must be protected without losing it to cynicism or fantasy.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Thirteen Hour Clock**
*   Track time rigorously. Certain actions burn time. Delays have consequences. Creates real urgency.

### 2. **Nothing Is As It Seems**
*   Perception checks regularly reveal hidden doors, false walls, and truths behind illusions.

### 3. **Riddle Challenges**
*   Key obstacles require solving riddles or logic puzzles rather than combat.

### 4. **Jareth's Temptations**
*   Periodically, Jareth offers shortcuts, easy solutions, or dreams. Accepting has consequences.

### 5. **The Power of Words**
*   Certain phrases have magical weight. The final victory requires speaking specific words of self-empowerment.

### 6. **Gravity Optional**
*   In the castle, physical laws don't apply normally. Movement becomes puzzle-solving.

### 7. **Companion Bonds**
*   Befriending creatures (Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ludo) provides unique abilities for overcoming obstacles.
