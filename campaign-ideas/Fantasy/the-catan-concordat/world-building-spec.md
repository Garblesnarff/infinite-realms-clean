# World-Building Specification: The Catan Concordat

## Faction Details

### The Brick Industrialists
Control hills. Believe material power is supreme. Build fastest but deplete resources recklessly. Pragmatic and ruthless. Value settlements over sustainability.

### The Lumber Environmentalists
Control forests. Believe in sustainable growth. Restrict lumber production to maintain balance. Patient but can be fanatical about preservation.

### The Wool Communes
Control pastures. Believe in sharing and trading. Most willing to negotiate. See commerce as the path to peace. Vulnerable to exploitation by less honest traders.

### The Grain Oligarchy
Control fields. Believe controlling food means controlling civilization. Hoard grain to create artificial scarcity, driving up trade value. Machiavellian pragmatists.

### The Ore Militarists
Control mountains. Believe military might (Largest Army) is the path to security and victory. Aggressive expansionists. Value cities over settlements (cities need ore).

### The Robber's Cult
Worship chaos and disruption. Believe the Robber represents necessary entropy preventing stagnation. Actively invite the Robber to their hexes to disrupt competitors.

### The Port Cartels
Control trading posts. Don't produce resources but control exchange rates. Economic power through facilitating others' trades. Neutral but profit-driven.

### The Development Guild
Focus on Progress Cards rather than settlements. Believe in cultural/technological advancement over territorial expansion. Knights, Monopoly, and VP cards as power source.

### The Victory Rejectionists
Led by the Victory Prophet. Believe achieving 10 VP triggers meaningless reset. Work to prevent anyone from "winning" to avoid the eternal cycle.

## The Five Resources as Philosophy

**Brick (Memory/Foundation)**: The past, what has been built, material history. Brick represents permanence and legacy.

**Lumber (Growth/Potential)**: The future, what can be grown, organic development. Lumber represents life and expansion.

**Wool (Comfort/Community)**: The present, warmth and security, social bonds. Wool represents care and connection.

**Grain (Sustenance/Necessity)**: The body, basic needs, survival. Grain represents the physical requirements of existence.

**Ore (Transformation/Power)**: The will, change and transcendence, alchemical force. Ore represents the ability to remake reality.

## The Revelation

The five resources are not just materials—they're the five components of consciousness itself. Memory (brick), growth (lumber), comfort (wool), sustenance (grain), and transformation (ore). Trading resources is trading parts of your mind/soul.

The Robber represents necessary chaos—without disruption, the system achieves static "perfection" where no one can improve (dystopian utopia). The Robber forces adaptation and change.

Victory Points are a trap. Achieving 10 VP doesn't win—it resets Catan to starting conditions, erasing all progress. The game is designed to be eternal. Those who discover this truth must choose:

1. Accept the eternal game (play forever, never achieving final victory)
2. Destroy the Victory system (end the competitive game, create cooperation)
3. Find the sixth resource (transcend Catan's five-resource limitation)
4. Step off the board (leave Catan entirely, enter the infinite ocean)

The true ending involves understanding that the journey (building, trading, cooperating) matters more than the destination (10 VP). Victory is playing the game well, not finishing it.
