# Creative Brief: The Catan Concordat

## Art Style
Pastoral fantasy meets resource management. Each hex is a distinct biome: rocky hills with quarries, lush forests, green pastures with sheep, golden wheat fields, snowy mountains with mines, barren desert. Settlements are wooden villages, cities are stone fortresses. Roads are actual pathways connecting locations. Board-game aesthetic with tangible pieces. Dice are large cosmic objects rolling across sky.

## Color Palette
- **Brick**: Terra cotta #E2725B, rusty orange
- **Lumber**: Forest green #228B22, wood brown #8B4513
- **Wool**: Cloud white #F8F8FF, sheep gray #D3D3D3
- **Grain**: Golden #FFD700, wheat yellow #F0E68C
- **Ore**: Slate gray #708090, metallic silver #C0C0C0
- **Desert**: Sandy tan #D2B48C, barren brown
- **Ocean**: Deep blue #4682B4, surrounding waters
- **Robber**: Shadow black #2F4F4F with sinister red #8B0000

## Music
Pastoral folk music—acoustic guitar, flute, hand drums. Each resource has musical motif (Brick: industrial percussion, Lumber: woodwinds, Wool: gentle strings, Grain: harvest dance, Ore: anvil strikes). Trading scenes have marketplace atmosphere. Dice rolling is rhythmic percussion determining fate. Robber has ominous theme—discordant strings and dark brass.

## Voice Direction

**Brick Baron**: Gruff industrialist, speaks in construction metaphors, harsh and uncompromising

**Lumber Magnate**: Soft-spoken environmentalist, slow deliberate speech, protective of resources

**Wool Shepherd**: Gentle pastoral wisdom, speaks in trading parables, peaceful negotiator

**Grain Overseer**: Calculating agricultural mind, discusses supply and demand, opportunistic

**Ore Warlord**: Military commander, values strength, speaks of armies and fortifications

**Robber**: Raspy chaos voice, laughs at others' misfortune, speaks in riddles about disruption

**Victory Prophet**: Weary and hollow, speaks of the meaninglessness of achieving 10 points, trying to warn others

## Cinematic Moments

**Resource Harvest**: Dawn breaks. Two massive cosmic dice roll across sky. They land showing 6 and 2 (total: 8). All hexes with "8" tokens glow. Resources materialize at settlements—bricks, lumber, wool bales, grain sacks, ore chunks appearing from nothing.

**The Robber Moves**: Dice show 7. Dark clouds gather. The Robber (shadow entity) rises from current hex and swoops to a new hex. That hex goes dark—no more production. A settlement owner's resources vanish (stolen).

**Strategic Trade**: "I'll give you two Grain for one Ore." Handshake. Physical resources exchanged. Both parties gain what they need. Civilization advances through cooperation.

**Victory and Reset**: Character builds final city, reaching 10 Victory Points. Reality freezes. Then begins to fade. All settlements, cities, roads dissolve into light. Board resets to starting positions. The "winner" screams as their achievements vanish.

**Discovering the Sixth Resource**: Party finds a glowing hex that shouldn't exist. It produces ethereal purple energy (the sixth resource). Harvesting it breaks Catan's rules—reality glitches, new possibilities open.
