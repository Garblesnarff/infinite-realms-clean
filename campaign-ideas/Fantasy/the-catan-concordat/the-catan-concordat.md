# The Catan Concordat
*"Five resources build civilization. Two dice determine harvest. One robber can destroy everything you've worked for."*

## Campaign Overview

The Catan Archipelago consists of 19 hexagonal islands arranged in a larger hex pattern, floating in infinite ocean. Each hex produces one of five resources: Brick (from hills), Lumber (from forests), Wool (from pastures), Grain (from fields), or Ore (from mountains). There's also a central Desert hex that produces nothing but harbors the Robber—a bandit entity that blocks production and steals resources.

Society is built on Settlements (villages worth 1 Victory Point) and Cities (upgraded settlements worth 2 Victory Points). Roads connect them across hex edges. Every dawn, two dice are rolled—the total determines which hexes produce resources this day. A roll of 7 means the Robber awakens and moves. Resource scarcity drives the core mechanic: trading. "I'll give you two Grain for one Ore" is not just commerce but survival. Ports on coastal edges allow favorable trades with the cosmic Bank (4:1 normally, 3:1 at generic ports, 2:1 at specialized ports).

The campaign begins when impossible occurs: a Settlement is built without the required resources (normally costs 1 Brick, 1 Lumber, 1 Wool, 1 Grain). Then dice start rolling impossible numbers (below 2 or above 12). Resource hexes change type spontaneously. Someone is manipulating the fundamental mechanics. The party must master resource trading, build settlements and cities, develop civilization through Progress Cards, command the Longest Road and Largest Army, and discover who is corrupting Catan's resource-based reality. The truth will require understanding that the five resources represent more than materials—they're the building blocks of consciousness itself.

## Core Themes

- **Resource Scarcity and Abundance**: Managing limited materials
- **Trading and Negotiation**: "What are you willing to trade for what I have?"
- **Settlement and Expansion**: Building civilization from nothing
- **Luck and Probability**: Dice rolls determine harvest
- **The Robber as Chaos**: Random disruption and theft
- **Development vs. Expansion**: Build tall (cities) or wide (settlements)?

## Campaign Sessions (32 Sessions)

### Arc 1: First Settlements (Sessions 1-8)
Party establishes initial settlements and roads. Learn resource production, dice mechanics, and trading. Introduction to the five factions (one per resource type). Discovery of the first impossible Settlement. Investigation begins.

### Arc 2: The Trading Wars (Sessions 9-18)
Resource trading becomes cutthroat. Monopoly cards (claim all of one resource type), Year of Plenty (free resources), and Road Building (rapid expansion) introduce Progress Cards. The party must negotiate trades with suspicious faction leaders while expanding territory. Discovery that resources have consciousness.

### Arc 3: The Robber Awakens (Sessions 19-26)
The Robber becomes hyperactive, moving even when not rolled. Resource theft epidemic. The party must either appease the Robber, control it, or eliminate it. Discovery that the Robber represents chaos necessary for balance—without it, Catan stagnates into static utopia (which is its own dystopia).

### Arc 4: Victory Points (Sessions 27-32)
Race to 10 Victory Points: Settlements (+1), Cities (+2), Longest Road (+2), Largest Army (+2), Progress Cards (+1). Multiple factions approaching victory simultaneously. The party discovers "winning" doesn't end the game—it resets Catan, erasing all achievements. True ending requires either preventing all victories (eternal game) or transcending Victory Points entirely.

## Key NPCs

### The Brick Baron (Hill Tyrant)
Controls all hill hexes producing Brick. Monopolizes early settlement building since settlements require Brick. Brutal industrialist. Believes in material power.

### The Lumber Magnate (Forest Keeper)
Controls forest hexes producing Lumber. Essential for roads and settlements. Environmentalist who restricts lumber production to maintain sustainability. At odds with expansionists.

### The Wool Shepherd (Pastoral Leader)
Controls pasture hexes producing Wool. Needed for settlements and Progress Cards. Philosophical and peaceful. Teaches that trading is more important than hoarding.

### The Grain Overseer (Agricultural Dominator)
Controls field hexes producing Grain. Essential for cities and Progress Cards. Wants to control food supply to control civilization. Willing to cause famines for leverage.

### The Ore Warlord (Mountain King)
Controls mountain hexes producing Ore. Necessary for cities and Progress Cards. Militaristic, wants to build Largest Army to dominate through knight cards (soldiers).

### The Robber (Chaos Bandit)
Mysterious entity that occupies one hex at a time, blocking production and stealing resources. Revealed to be a necessary force preventing any single faction from total dominance. Chaotic neutral cosmic principle.

### The Port Masters (Harbor Guilds)
Control the coastal trading posts offering favorable exchange rates. Can make or break economies by granting or denying port access. Trade cartels with immense soft power.

### The Bank (Cosmic Reserve)
Infinite resource repository that enables trades. Appears neutral but may have hidden agenda. What does the Bank receive in exchange for its services?

### The Dice Twins (Fate Pair)
Two cosmic entities whose daily dance determines resource production. They represent probability itself. Someone has been drugging them, making them roll impossible numbers.

### The Victory Prophet (Ten Pointer)
A being who achieved 10 Victory Points and "won" Catan... only to discover victory resets everything. Now trapped in knowledge that achieving the goal is meaningless. Trying to prevent others from "winning" to spare them the revelation.

## Major Locations

### The 19 Hexes
Arranged in hexagon pattern. Each hex has a number token (2-12, skipping 7) determining when it produces. More probable numbers (6, 8) are more valuable. Desert has no number and never produces.

### Hills (Brick Production)
Rocky terrain with quarries. Three hex tiles. Produce Brick on their number roll. Industrial, polluted, dominated by the Brick Baron.

### Forests (Lumber Production)
Wooded areas. Four hex tiles. Produce Lumber. Ancient trees, druidic circles, protected by the Lumber Magnate.

### Pastures (Wool Production)
Grassy meadows with sheep. Four hex tiles. Produce Wool. Peaceful, pastoral, meditative zones ruled by the Wool Shepherd.

### Fields (Grain Production)
Agricultural farmland. Four hex tiles. Produce Grain. Organized rows of crops, granaries, controlled by the Grain Overseer.

### Mountains (Ore Production)
Rocky peaks with mines. Three hex tiles. Produce Ore. Militaristic forges and armories, commanded by the Ore Warlord.

### Desert (The Robber's Home)
One hex producing nothing. The Robber starts here. Barren wasteland representing scarcity and entropy. Some believe it's the most important hex because it teaches value through absence.

### The Ports (Trading Posts)
Nine coastal edges offering trading advantages: 3:1 generic ports (4 locations), 2:1 specialized ports (5 locations, one per resource). Control of ports is strategic power.

### The Longest Road
The network of roads forming the longest continuous path. Controlling it grants +2 Victory Points. Roads are not just infrastructure but power projection.

### The Knight Encampments
Where knight cards (soldiers) are deployed. Building the Largest Army (3+ knights) grants +2 Victory Points. Military power as civic achievement.

### The Development Forum
Where Progress Cards are purchased (Ore + Grain + Wool). Cards include Victory Point cards (hidden until revealed), Progress cards (Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly), and special powers.

### The Settlement Sites
Intersection points between three hexes where settlements are built. Only one settlement per intersection (blocking mechanic). Strategic positioning determines resource access.

### The Ocean Beyond
Infinite water surrounding the 19 hexes. Some theorize unexplored hexes exist in the ocean—lost resources or entirely new resource types.

## Unique Mechanics

### Resource Production
Roll 2d6 each turn. Hexes with that number produce resources. Settlements on those hexes' intersections gain 1 resource, cities gain 2 resources.

### Building Costs
- Road: 1 Brick + 1 Lumber
- Settlement: 1 Brick + 1 Lumber + 1 Wool + 1 Grain
- City: 3 Ore + 2 Grain (upgrade from Settlement)
- Progress Card: 1 Ore + 1 Wool + 1 Grain

### Trading
Players can trade resources with each other (free negotiation) or with the Bank (4:1 ratio, better at ports). Trading is essential—no player can win with only their own production.

### The Robber Mechanic
When 7 is rolled, the Robber moves to a new hex (chosen by whoever rolled). That hex produces nothing until Robber leaves. Robber roller also steals one random resource from player with settlement/city on robbed hex.

### Victory Points
Race to 10 VP. Sources: Settlement (+1), City (+2), Longest Road (+2 for longest continuous road), Largest Army (+2 for most knight cards), VP Progress Cards (+1 each, kept hidden).

### Progress Cards
Development cards granting special abilities: Knights (move Robber), Road Building (place 2 free roads), Year of Plenty (take 2 free resources), Monopoly (claim all of one resource type from other players), Victory Points (instant +1 VP).

### Port Trading
Generic ports allow 3:1 trades. Specialized ports allow 2:1 trades for specific resources. Controlling ports grants economic advantage.

### Dice Probability
2 and 12: 1/36 chance (rarest)
3 and 11: 2/36 chance
4 and 10: 3/36 chance
5 and 9: 4/36 chance
6 and 8: 5/36 chance (most common except 7)
7: 6/36 chance (most common, triggers Robber)

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: Resources Are Alive
The five resources are conscious entities. Brick is memory, Lumber is growth, Wool is comfort, Grain is sustenance, Ore is transformation. Trading them is trading aspects of consciousness.

### Twist 2: The Bank Is A Parasite
The infinite Bank sustains itself by extracting a small piece of soul with each trade. The 4:1 ratio isn't economic—it's metaphysical tax.

### Twist 3: Victory Points Are A Trap
Reaching 10 VP doesn't win—it triggers reset, erasing all progress. The game is designed to never end. The Victory Prophet discovered this and is trying to save others.

### Twist 4: The Sixth Resource
A hidden sixth resource exists beyond the five (perhaps "Essence" or "Faith"). Discovering it breaks Catan's rules but opens new possibilities.

### Twist 5: You Are The Robber
The party is revealed to be the Robber—agents of chaos disrupting static systems. Their presence is necessary for balance but makes them enemies of order.

## Victory Conditions

### Achieve 10 Victory Points
Traditional victory—build enough settlements, cities, roads, and armies to reach 10 VP. But this may trigger reset rather than true ending.

### Resource Harmony
Balance all five resources perfectly across all players. Create sustainable equilibrium where everyone has enough but no one has excess. Utopian ending.

### Destroy the Victory System
Reject Victory Points as measurement of worth. End the competitive game, create cooperative Catan where building is shared achievement.

### Discover the Sixth Resource
Find the hidden resource beyond the traditional five. This transcends Catan's rules, creating new possibilities beyond current system.

### Befriend the Robber
Rather than fighting chaos, embrace it. Work with the Robber to maintain dynamic balance through controlled disruption.

## Defeat Conditions

### Resource Starvation
Unable to acquire any resources for extended period. Settlements wither, cities collapse, civilization dies.

### Eternal Robber
The Robber occupies all hexes simultaneously, blocking all production. Total economic collapse.

### Trading Isolation
All other factions refuse to trade with party. In trading-based economy, isolation is death.

### Monopoly Domination
One faction achieves total monopoly on one resource, charging impossible prices. Economic tyranny prevents progress.

### False Victory
Party achieves 10 VP and "wins," only to have reality reset. All progress erased, forced to start over in eternal cycle.
