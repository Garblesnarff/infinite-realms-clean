# Jotunheim Saga - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Norse mythology meets epic fantasy. Think Vikings TV series, God of War (game), and classical Norse art. Emphasize ice, stone, runes, and harsh beauty.

**Color Palette**: Cold blues and whites (frost giants), volcanic reds and blacks (fire giants), storm grays (storm giants), earth browns (mountain giants). Muted, harsh, beautiful.

**Giant Design**: Humanoid but distinctly inhuman—frost giants have ice-like features, fire giants glow with internal heat, storm giants' eyes spark lightning. Each clan visually distinct. Clothing: furs, armor, practical but ornate. Weapons massive and runic.

## Music and Sound Design
**Themes**: Nordic folk instruments (hardanger fiddle, lur), epic choir, percussion. Each giant clan has musical signature.

**Frost Giants**: Wind howling, ice cracking, deep throat singing
**Fire Giants**: Forge sounds, rumbling, aggressive percussion
**Storm Giants**: Thunder, wind, ethereal choir
**Gods**: Golden triumphant music but with undertone of desperation

**Ragnarok**: Apocalyptic soundscape—horns, destruction, cosmic scale

## Voice Acting
**Giants**: Deep, resonant, accented (Scandinavian influenced), speak slowly and deliberately. Each clan has linguistic quirks.

**Þrymr**: Commanding, harsh, aged wisdom, occasional dark humor
**Surtr**: Melancholic, deep, conflicted, poetic despite destruction role
**Odin**: Measured, calculating, desperate beneath authority
**Thor**: Boisterous, straightforward, surprisingly honorable
**Loki**: Quick, smooth, multiple tones (honest and lying sound same)

## Atmosphere
**Mythic Weight**: Everything matters cosmically. Decisions echo through realms. Prophecy looms. Epic scope constantly reinforced.

**Cultural Authenticity**: Respect Norse sources. Giants have poetry (skaldic verse), honor codes (like samurai), hospitality laws.

**Winter Omnipresent**: Cold as character. Fimbulwinter isn't background—it's threat, mood, killer.

This campaign should feel like **participating in the Eddas**—myths made playable, gods made human, apocalypse made personal.
