# Creative Brief: The Camorr Game

Art Style: Fantastical Renaissance Venice with Thieves' Aesthetics. Rich colors, elaborate architecture, Elderglass (glowing ancient glass), canals, masquerade masks, elegant cons.

**Color Palette:** Deep canal blues, Elderglass amber glow, rich merchant purples and golds, shadow-black for night work, blood-red for violence.

**Character Design:** Thieves in elaborate disguises (merchant prince one day, beggar the next), nobles in finery, the players' true appearance vs their many false faces, Bondsmagi in their distinctive robes.

**Backgrounds:** Venetian-style canal cities with impossible ancient Elderglass towers, opulent noble estates, shadowy criminal warrens, elaborate gambling houses, pleasure barges floating on dark water.

**Mood:** Witty, clever, style over substance (except when substance matters most), dark humor, loyalty in dishonor, the thrill of the impossible heist.

Voice: A clever, witty voice with theatrical flair, like a master thief recounting their greatest con. Pacing is quick during heists, slower during planning. Emotion conveys the joy of a plan coming together and the pain when friends are lost. Role: The chronicler of the impossible made real through audacity and wit.
