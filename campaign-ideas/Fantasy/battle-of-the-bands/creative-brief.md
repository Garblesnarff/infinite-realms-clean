# Creative Brief: Battle of the Bands

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Comic Book Video Game Hybrid (Scott Pilgrim-inspired)

Inspired by *Scott Pilgrim vs The World*—blending comic book aesthetics with video game UI elements, Toronto indie culture, and over-the-top action sequences. Reality operates on video game logic with visible HUD elements, combo counters, and boss health bars.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Video Game HUD:** Health bars, combo counters, EXP numbers, achievement pop-ups
*   **Comic Book Style:** Bold lines, halftone effects, action words (POW, SLASH), speed lines
*   **Toronto Indie:** Casual fashion, music venues, coffee shops, winter aesthetic
*   **Explosive Combat:** Enemies explode into coins, power-ups appear, over-the-top special moves

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Video game logic, indie rock, comic book action, power of love, Toronto winter, level-up romance
*   **Feeling:** The excitement of a beat-em-up game mixed with romantic comedy. Mundane indie life exploding into impossible action.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Bright Primaries:** Bold reds, blues, yellows like classic video games
*   **Toronto Winter:** Gray skies, white snow, earth-tone buildings
*   **Neon Accents:** Electric pink, bright green, cyan for video game elements
*   **Coin Gold:** Shiny metallic gold for defeated enemy drops
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant color palette with bold primary colors. Toronto street in winter with gray sky and snow. Characters in bright clothing—red jacket, blue jeans. A defeated enemy explodes into golden coins with cartoon explosion effect. Neon pink health bar floating above character's head. Comic book halftone texture on shadows."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Indie Aesthetic:** Hoodies, band t-shirts, winter coats, scarves, casual sneakers
*   **Ramona:** Changes hair color constantly, delivery bag, rollerblade shoes, goggle headband
*   **Video Game Elements:** Health bars hover above heads, level numbers visible, status effect icons
*   **Evil Exes:** Each themed—rockstar, action hero, vegan psychic, ninja, robot twins, mogul
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young person in winter indie fashion: red hoodie, jeans, casual sneakers, messy hair. Above their head floats a green health bar showing HP: 250/300. A glowing 'LVL 4' badge hovers near their shoulder. They're in an action pose mid-punch. Comic book speed lines behind the fist. Their expression is determined but slightly confused about the absurdity."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Toronto Locations:** Bloor Street, Casa Loma, generic coffee shops, indie venues
*   **Boss Arenas:** Themed stages for each fight—concert hall, movie set, recording studio
*   **Subspace:** Surreal geometric corridors with impossible angles and dream logic
*   **UI Overlays:** Location names appear in corner, minimap when relevant
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a Toronto indie music venue called 'The Rockit'. Small stage with band equipment, crowd of hipsters watching. Exposed brick walls with concert posters. Christmas lights strung overhead. In the foreground, a boss battle begins—health bars appear above both fighters. The crowd forms a circle. Video game UI elements: 'ROUND 1' in bold letters, 'FIGHT!' appearing center screen."

**5. Combat & Action:**
*   **Comic Book Violence:** Exaggerated impacts, action words, speed lines, multiple-image motion blur
*   **Combo System:** Hit counters appear ('x7 HIT COMBO!'), bonus multipliers flash
*   **Special Moves:** Announced in text boxes, dramatic charging effects, screen shake
*   **Enemy Defeat:** Explosion into coins with satisfying pop, EXP numbers float up
*   **Prompt Example:** "Dynamic action shot of a punch landing. The word 'SLASH!' in bold yellow comic text. The attacker mid-movement with multiple-image blur showing motion. The enemy recoils with impact lines radiating from hit point. Above, a combo counter reads '15 HIT COMBO!' in neon text. Coins starting to burst from the defeated enemy. Speed lines fill the background. Camera angle is dramatic low angle."

**6. Video Game UI Elements:**
*   **Health Bars:** Green bars with HP numbers above characters
*   **Lives Counter:** '1-UP' icons in corner of vision
*   **Coin Counter:** Running total of collected coins
*   **Achievement Unlocks:** Pop-up notifications ('Achievement Unlocked: Defeated Evil Ex!')
*   **Boss Intro:** Name cards for boss fights with dramatic pose
*   **Prompt Example:** "A boss introduction screen. The character 'MATTHEW PATEL' in large text at top. Below, his title: 'MYSTICAL HIPSTER'. The boss stands in dramatic silhouette against red background. His stats appear: LVL 9, HP: 800. At bottom: 'PRESS START TO CONTINUE'. Video game interface elements frame the screen. Pixel-art hearts and stars decorate the borders."

**7. Musical Elements:**
*   **Band Performance:** Instruments with action lines, musical notes visible in air
*   **Sound Effect Visualization:** Amp feedback creates actual shockwaves
*   **Battle of Bands:** Musical duel shown as literal combat
*   **Instruments as Weapons:** Bass guitars smash through reality
*   **Prompt Example:** "A musician playing bass guitar on stage. Musical notes and sound waves visible emanating from the instrument as glowing energy. The bass player mid-movement, strings literally vibrating so hard they create visual distortion. Amp behind them has glowing green power indicators. The music is visualized as wave forms in the air creating actual force. Comic book style with bold outlines."

**8. Subspace & Dream Sequences:**
*   **Geometric Corridors:** Impossible angles, Escher-like architecture
*   **Dream Logic:** Locations merge, scale is wrong, surreal elements
*   **Delivery Routes:** Pathways through emotional landscapes
*   **Portal Doors:** Obvious video game transition portals
*   **Prompt Example:** "A surreal subspace highway corridor. Geometric gray walls at impossible angles forming an infinite hallway. Doors of various colors line the walls leading to different locations. Ramona rollerblade-dashing through on subspace skates. The perspective is distorted and dream-like. Floating delivery packages with '?' boxes drift past. Video game portal effects shimmer around doors."

**9. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Comic Book Cel-Shading:** Flat colors with bold outlines, minimal gradients
*   **Dramatic Shadows:** Strong black shadows for impact
*   **Neon Glow:** Video game elements emit light
*   **Halftone Dots:** Used for texture and depth instead of traditional shading
*   **Prompt Example:** "...cel-shaded comic book style with bold black outlines. Flat colors with minimal gradients. Shadows are solid black or halftone dot patterns. Neon UI elements (health bars, combo counters) emit actual glow affecting nearby surfaces. Dramatic overhead lighting creates strong shadows. The overall effect is graphic and punchy like a moving comic panel."

## Voice

An energetic, self-aware narration style like someone who knows they're in a video game story. The pacing is rapid-fire with pop culture references and indie music mentions. The tone shifts between earnest romantic feelings and ironic commentary on the absurdity. There's constant awareness of video game tropes ("This is the boss," "Achievement unlocked," "Level up!"). Delivery is enthusiastic but occasionally deadpan about impossible events. Role: The voice of a slacker hero who's both confused and excited to be in an adventure.
