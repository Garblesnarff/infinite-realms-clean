# Creative Brief: The Eternal Relay

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Fluid Aquatic Beauty with Emotional Depth (Free!-inspired)

Inspired by the gorgeous swimming aesthetics of *Free!* with emphasis on water dynamics, athletic male forms, emotional bonds, and the freedom of swimming. This style captures underwater perspectives, relay teamwork, competitive intensity, and the beauty of movement through water.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Water Dynamics:** Flowing water, splashes, underwater perspectives, surface tension, bubbles
*   **Athletic Forms:** Swimmer physiques, muscle definition during strokes, streamlined positions
*   **Emotional Bonds:** Friendship, rivalry, team unity, personal growth through competition
*   **Technical Swimming:** Proper stroke form, relay exchanges, racing starts, turns

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Free, flowing, friendship, rivalry, relay bonds, water freedom, competitive drive
*   **Feeling:** The liberation of moving through water mixed with the intensity of competition. Childhood bonds tested by rivalry. The unity of four becoming one in the relay.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Water:** Deep blues underwater, turquoise at surface, white foam and splashes, reflective shimmer
*   **Team Colors:** Iwatobi's blue and white, Samezuka's red and black, varying team uniforms
*   **Lighting:** Bright sunlight through water, pool lighting creating caustics, sunset training scenes
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an Olympic-size swimming pool with crystal clear turquoise water. Four swimmers in blue and white Iwatobi swim team jammers prepare for relay. Sunlight streams through skylights creating dancing caustics on the pool floor. The starting blocks are labeled with lane numbers. Water surface ripples catch the light. The atmosphere is both serene and charged with competitive energy."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Athletic Swimmers:** Lean, muscular builds, broad shoulders, defined abs and backs
*   **Swim Gear:** Racing jammers in team colors, swim caps, goggles, streamlined design
*   **Underwater vs Surface:** Hair flowing underwater vs slicked back above surface
*   **Prompt Example:** "A freestyle swimmer mid-stroke underwater. Their athletic form is streamlined, one arm extended forward, the other pulling back. Bubbles trail from their movement. Blue swim jammer and goggles. Hair floating in the water. Muscles defined from the effort. Expression focused and determined. The pool lane lines visible below. Sunlight filtering from above creates rays through the water."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Pool Facilities:** Indoor and outdoor pools, starting blocks, lane lines, spectator stands
*   **Underwater Perspective:** Looking up at surface, lane markers, pool floor patterns
*   **Training Locations:** Beach for conditioning, outdoor pools for practice, modern aquatic centers
*   **Prompt Example:** "The National Aquatics Center championship pool from underwater perspective. The surface above shows distorted crowds in the stands. Eight lanes stretch into the distance marked by floating lane lines. The pool floor has regulation depth markers. Sunlight creates shimmering patterns. Starting blocks visible in the distance. The perspective conveys the vast competitive arena."

**5. Swimming Action:**
*   **Relay Exchanges:** One swimmer touching wall as next dives over, split-second timing
*   **Stroke Techniques:** Freestyle arms rotating, butterfly's dolphin kick, backstroke rotation, breaststroke pull
*   **Starts and Turns:** Explosive diving starts, flip turns creating vortexes, underwater streamline glides
*   **Prompt Example:** "A relay exchange at the pool wall. The first swimmer's hand touches the wall, water exploding around their impact. Simultaneously, the second swimmer is mid-dive, body arched perfectly over them. Bubbles and splash fill the frame. Both swimmers' expressions show intense focus. The exchange is perfectly timed. Pool lane markers frame the action. The moment frozen shows relay teamwork at its peak."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Underwater Lighting:** Caustic light patterns, rays from surface, depth gradients
*   **Pool Reflections:** Water surface reflecting lights, creating shimmering effects
*   **Dramatic Moments:** Backlit starts, sunset practices, championship spotlighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit from above as sunlight penetrates the clear pool water. The swimmer is streamlined underwater after a turn, sunlight creating god-rays around them. Bubbles trail from their nose and movement. The caustic patterns dance across their body and the pool floor below. Deep blue water gradients from light to shadow. Their determined expression is visible through the goggles and water."

## Voice

A voice that starts quiet and introspective but builds to passionate declaration. The pacing flows like swimming strokes—rhythmic, building momentum, then explosive at turns. The tone shifts between peaceful reflection on water's freedom, competitive fire during races, and emotional declarations of friendship. There's an underlying theme of water as liberation and the relay as eternal bond. Includes phrases about swimming free and swimming together. Role: The voice of finding freedom through connection and competition.
