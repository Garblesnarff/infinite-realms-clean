The party joins an epic pilgrimage led by a scholarly monk traveling west to retrieve sacred scriptures that will enlighten the realm. Their most powerful companion is Sun Wukong, the legendary Monkey King—an immortal trickster of unmatched power who has been forced by the gods to serve as bodyguard as penance for his past rebellion against heaven itself. Along the journey, they face demons, spirits, celestial bureaucrats, and moral challenges while the Monkey King's impulsive nature both saves and endangers them at every turn.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Episodic Challenges:** Each session features a different supernatural obstacle—demons, magical transformations, celestial tests, moral dilemmas.
*   **Social Combat:** Many conflicts are resolved through cleverness, wordplay, and negotiation rather than pure violence.
*   **The Monkey King's Power:** Sun Wukong is essentially unkillable and can defeat most foes—but he's bound by magical restraints and his own character flaws.
*   **Transformation Magic:** Enemies and allies constantly shapeshift, creating mysteries about true identities and intentions.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 2 — "The Mountain Prison"

*   They free him. He is chaotic, powerful, disrespectful—and their most valuable ally.

### Session 3 — "The Dragon Horse"
*   They need transportation. A dragon prince, transformed into a horse as punishment, becomes their mount.

## Central Conflict

Redemption versus rebellion. Sun Wukong once rebelled against heaven's order and was punished. The pilgrimage is his chance at redemption, but his nature rebels against authority. The party must help him (and themselves) learn that true freedom comes from self-mastery, not just power. Meanwhile, they face a conspiracy to maintain separation between heaven, earth, and enlightenment.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Tightening Circlet**
*   When Sun Wukong disobeys or abandons the group, Tripitaka can chant a sutra causing the magical circlet to tighten, inflicting pain. This creates party tension.

### 2. **Transformation Magic**
*   Sun Wukong and enemies can shapeshift. Social encounters involve detecting true forms through investigation and insight.

### 3. **The 72 Transformations**
*   Sun Wukong can transform into 72 different forms—animals, objects, other people. Players can suggest creative uses.

### 4. **Demon King Challenges**
*   Each demon king has a unique gimmick requiring creative problem-solving beyond combat.

### 5. **Enlightenment Points**
*   Track the party's spiritual growth. High enlightenment unlocks better endings and celestial boons.

### 6. **Epic Power Scaling**
*   Characters gain mythic abilities mid-campaign, making them legendary heroes capable of supernatural feats.
