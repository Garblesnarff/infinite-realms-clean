# World-Building Specification: Kingdoms of the Droplet

## Pond Water Ecosystem Biology

### Scale and Environment
- **Party size:** 10-20 micrometers (size of large bacteria/small protozoans)
- **Droplet volume:** ~0.05 mL (massive at micro scale)
- **Temperature:** Ambient pond temperature affects organism metabolism
- **Light:** Decreases with depth; crucial for photosynthesis
- **Oxygen:** Produced by algae, consumed by heterotrophs
- **pH:** Affects organism survival and chemistry

### Major Organism Groups

**Paramecia (Ciliated Protozoans)**
- Size: 50-300 micrometers (giants to party)
- Covered in cilia for movement
- Feed on bacteria and smaller organisms
- Complex behavior patterns
- Form basis for democratic federation

**Amoebas**
- Size: 500-1000 micrometers (massive)
- Shapeshifting pseudopods
- Engulf prey through phagocytosis
- Adaptable and aggressive
- Empire builders

**Rotifers**
- Size: 100-500 micrometers
- Corona (wheel organ) creates currents
- Complex anatomy including brain
- Filter feeders
- Scholarly culture

**Tardigrades (Water Bears)**
- Size: 50-1200 micrometers
- Eight legs with claws
- Cryptobiosis (dormancy) for survival
- Extremely durable
- Perfect mercenaries

**Algae**
- Various types: Chlorella, Spirogyra, desmids
- Photosynthetic
- Produce oxygen and organic matter
- Base of food chain
- Collective consciousness

**Bacteria**
- Smallest (1-10 micrometers)
- Decomposers and primary producers
- Can exchange genes
- Foundation of ecosystem

**Predators**
- Hydra: Multi-tentacled hunters
- Dragonfly larvae: If campaign expands
- Other macro-predators

### Food Web as Politics
- Algae produce energy (producers)
- Bacteria decompose and recycle
- Protozoa graze on bacteria (primary consumers)
- Larger protozoans eat smaller ones (secondary consumers)
- Hydra and large predators (apex predators)
- Competition and cooperation based on trophic position

## Environmental Physics

### Surface Tension
- Water's surface acts as elastic membrane
- Can support some organisms
- Breaking through dangerous (exposure to air)
- Creates unique habitat at interface

### Brownian Motion
- Random molecular collisions visible at this scale
- Constant environmental "tremors"
- Affects precision and aim
- Can be helpful or problematic

### Water Currents
- Convection from temperature
- Movement from larger organisms
- Chemical gradients
- Used for transportation

### Osmotic Pressure
- Water balance crucial
- Contractile vacuoles pump out excess water
- Saltwater vs. freshwater differences
- Affects organism survival

## The Pollution Crisis

### Chemical Threats
- Heavy metals (mercury, lead)
- Organic solvents
- Alchemical waste products
- Acid or base contamination

### Effects on Organisms
- Cellular damage and death
- Mutation in bacteria
- Food chain bioaccumulation
- Ecosystem collapse

### Resistance Mechanisms
- Extremophile bacteria adaptations
- Detoxification enzymes
- Protective membranes
- Genetic modification through horizontal transfer

## The Elemental Connection

### Creation Process
- Micro-kingdoms attempted mass magical working
- Combined consciousness to create macro-scale entity
- Inexpert casting led to confusion
- Elemental drawn to water, causing flooding

### Communication
- Initially: Chaotic, aggressive behavior
- Party's intervention: Establishing coherent link
- Final state: Clear spokesman for micro-civilizations
- Bridge between scales

### Rights and Recognition
- Is collective micro-consciousness creating macro-entity valid "person"?
- Legal precedent for microscopic sentience
- Environmental implications

## Campaign Implications

### Environmental Themes
- Pollution affects unseen victims
- Microscopic life supports macro-scale existence
- Responsibility for ecosystems
- Interconnected nature of life

### Political Allegory
- Different governance systems (democracy, empire, collective)
- Resource scarcity driving conflict
- Need for cooperation against existential threats
- Small voices seeking representation in larger world

### Scientific Accuracy
- Based on real pond microorganisms
- Ecological relationships authentic
- Physics of micro-scale accurate
- Adds educational value to fantasy

## DM Customization

### Difficulty Adjustments
- Number and severity of pollution events
- Complexity of micro-kingdom politics
- Strength of macro-world opponents
- Time pressure before ecosystem collapse

### Expansion Options
- Other water sources (ocean droplet, rain, etc.)
- Different microorganism kingdoms
- Larger predators (fish scale if party grows)
- Multiple polluted sites needing help
- Permanent micro-scale adventures

### Integration
- Environmental campaign arc
- Introduces biomancy and microscopic magic
- Creates ongoing micro-civilization allies
- Establishes party as environmental champions
