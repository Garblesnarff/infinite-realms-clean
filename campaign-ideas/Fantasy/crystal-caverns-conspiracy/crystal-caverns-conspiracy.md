---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Crystal Caverns Conspiracy
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Economic Intrigue / Heist / Crystal Magic / Mining Conflict
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 18–30 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **12–13**
**Tone (keywords):** glittering, greedy, dangerous, exploitative, magical, labor-conflict, crystalline
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Prismatic Depths are the world's richest source of magic-infused crystals, controlled by three mining cartels locked in escalating conflict. When miners begin disappearing and strange crystal formations start growing through solid rock at impossible speeds, the party is hired to investigate. They uncover a conspiracy reaching from the deepest mines to the highest merchant houses: someone is awakening the Crystal Wyrm, an ancient entity slumbering in the living crystal veins. As labor revolts, corporate espionage, and magical catastrophe converge, the party must navigate greed, exploitation, and the question of whether wealth is worth the cost to those who dig it from the dark.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

* **Encounters:** Mix of combat, infiltration, and social challenges. Crystal elementals, rival miners, corrupted guards, and crystal-infected creatures.
* **Economic Complexity:** Understanding trade routes, gem values, labor economics, and market manipulation is crucial.
* **Moral Ambiguity:** All factions have legitimate grievances and terrible methods. There are no clear heroes or villains.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 18–30 sessions)

A four-act arc moving from investigation to revolution.

* **Act I — The Missing Miners (Sessions 1–7):** The party investigates disappearances in the mines, discovering evidence of both cartel cover-ups and something unnatural in the crystal veins.
* **Act II — The Three Cartels (Sessions 8–14):** Deep dive into corporate espionage, labor revolts, and the political landscape. The party chooses allies or plays all sides.
* **Act III — The Living Crystal (Sessions 15–21):** The truth emerges—the Crystal Wyrm is awakening, feeding on miners and magical energy. The cartels knew and kept mining anyway.
* **Act IV — The Shattering (Sessions 22–30):** Full-scale labor revolution, cartel warfare, and the Crystal Wyrm's emergence. The party must choose between economic collapse, mass casualties, or finding a third option.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict operates on multiple levels:
* **Economic:** Cartels prioritizing profit over safety and lives
* **Labor:** Workers fighting for basic rights and dignity
* **Existential:** The Crystal Wyrm offering transcendence versus maintaining individual identity
* **Moral:** Whether economic collapse and job loss justify continued exploitation

The party must balance these competing interests or find a revolutionary third option.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Crystal Resonance**

* Different crystals have different magical properties and resonate with specific spells or emotions.
* Characters can attune to crystals for temporary power boosts.
* Over-attuning leads to crystal corruption (similar to transformation in other campaigns).

### 2. **Economic Warfare**

* Track market prices of crystals, cartel influence, and economic stability.
* Party actions affect prices, trade routes, and faction wealth.
* Economic collapse has real consequences for NPCs and regions.

### 3. **Labor Relations**

* Party's reputation with miners versus cartels affects available resources and allies.
* Can organize strikes, break strikes, or mediate conflicts.
* Labor actions can shut down mining operations, affecting the economy.

### 4. **Crystal Corruption**

* Exposure to living crystal gradually transforms characters.
* Grants powers but slowly merges consciousness with the Wyrm.
* Must balance using crystal magic with maintaining individuality.

### 5. **Mine Navigation**

* Complex three-dimensional maze of shafts, levels, and caverns.
* Cave-ins, flooding, crystal growth, and rival factions all pose navigation challenges.
* Maps are valuable commodities, often outdated or deliberately false.

### 6. **Heist Mechanics**

* Multiple infiltration missions into cartel headquarters.
* Stealing information, sabotaging operations, or rescuing prisoners.
* Consequences for getting caught include bounties, assassination attempts, and faction hostility.
