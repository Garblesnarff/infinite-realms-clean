# Creative Brief: Echoes of Lavos

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Pixel Art Epic (Chrono Trigger-inspired)

Inspired by the distinctive 16-bit JRPG aesthetic of *Chrono Trigger*, with colorful pixel art, dramatic lighting, and a blend of fantasy and science fiction elements. This style aims to capture the epic, desperate, hopeful, and bittersweet tone of "Echoes of Lavos," where heroes travel through time to prevent an apocalypse that has already happened.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Era Diversity:** Each time period should have a distinct visual identity - primitive ice age, crystalline magical kingdom, medieval fantasy, modern festival, apocalyptic future.
*   **Dramatic Scale Contrasts:** Shift between intimate character moments and massive cosmic battles, from small village scenes to the emergence of Lavos.
*   **Temporal Aesthetics:** Use visual cues like time distortions, portal effects, and anachronistic elements to emphasize the time travel theme.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, desperate, hopeful, bittersweet, timeless, heroic, apocalyptic, magical, technological, prehistoric, futuristic.
*   **Feeling:** A grand adventure across the ages with high stakes and emotional depth. The atmosphere balances wonder and discovery with the weight of preventing an apocalypse. Moments of beauty and friendship contrast with devastating loss and cosmic horror.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, defined pixel art with strong silhouettes and clear character designs. Forms are stylized but readable, with attention to iconic shapes and recognizable features.
*   **Textures:** Pixel textures suggest materials without excessive detail - stone, metal, crystal, organic matter, energy - appropriate to each era.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in 16-bit JRPG pixel art style. The focus is on a time portal, with defined pixel edges creating concentric circles of blue and purple energy."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and varied across eras. Ice Age uses whites, grays, and earth tones. Age of Magic features brilliant blues, purples, and crystalline whites. Medieval era has rich greens and castle stone grays. Present era shows festival colors and everyday life. Future is dominated by rust reds, dark grays, and toxic greens.
*   **Temporal Elements:** Time portals and temporal effects use distinctive blue-purple gradients. Lavos's influence manifests as red-orange energy with dark, organic undertones.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...the floating Kingdom of Zeal rendered in pixel art, using a palette of deep blues, brilliant whites, and purple crystal accents against a sky gradient."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Distinctive character silhouettes with iconic elements - Frog's amphibian form and knight's cape, Robo's mechanical body, Ayla's primitive garb, Magus's dark flowing cloak with pointed collar.
*   **Expression:** Despite pixel limitations, characters convey strong emotions through pose, animation suggestions, and distinctive features.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior princess in pixel art style, with flowing red hair, blue dress with white accents, and a determined pose holding a crossbow. Her design is iconic and instantly recognizable."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Each era has a unique environmental signature. Ice age: snow, caves, primitive villages, dinosaurs. Age of Magic: floating islands, crystalline architecture, magical machinery. Medieval: castles, forests, villages. Present: festival grounds, modern architecture. Future: ruins, dead forests, broken machines.
*   **Atmosphere:** Can shift from beautiful and wondrous (Kingdom of Zeal at its height) to bleak and horrifying (the ruined future). Environmental storytelling is crucial.
*   **Details:** Small pixel details suggest life and history - a flickering campfire, a crystal pulsing with energy, a rusted robot hand reaching from rubble, festival banners waving.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pixel art landscape of a post-apocalyptic city in 2300 AD. Rusted domes, broken highways, skeletal buildings, and a toxic green sky. Small details show survival - a faint light in one building, a makeshift path through rubble."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Uses limited pixel art shading with 3-4 tones per color to create depth. Lighting is dramatic and mood-setting - the golden light of the Millennial Fair, the ethereal glow of Zeal's magic, the harsh shadows of the ruined future.
*   **Energy Effects:** Special attention to magical and technological effects - time portals swirl with animated pixels, Lavos's energy crackles and pulses, spells create distinct visual patterns.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the emotional tone of each scene and guides the eye to important elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the ominous red glow of Lavos emerging from the earth, casting long shadows across the landscape. Energy crackles upward in pixel art style, with graduated shading suggesting immense power."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** JRPG-inspired compositions - wide establishing shots of eras, character-focused dialogue scenes, dramatic battle compositions with the party facing massive foes. Uses the rule of thirds and strong focal points.
*   **Techniques:** Employ parallax-style layering (foreground, midground, background). Frame important moments like cutscenes. Use height differences to show power dynamics (players small before Lavos).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide pixel art composition showing the party of six heroes standing on a cliff overlooking the Black Omen, a massive black pyramid suspended in a temporal vortex. The fortress dominates the upper third, the heroes small but determined in the lower third."

## Voice

A warm, timeless voice that sounds simultaneously ancient and youthful, like someone who has witnessed all of history unfold. The pacing is measured and thoughtful, occasionally building to passionate intensity during moments of crisis or triumph. The emotion carries the weight of bittersweet victory - hope tempered by sacrifice, joy tinged with inevitable loss. Audio quality is clear with a subtle harmonic resonance, as if the voice echoes slightly across time itself. Role: The voice of Gaspar, Guru of Time, or a narrator who has witnessed all possible timelines.
