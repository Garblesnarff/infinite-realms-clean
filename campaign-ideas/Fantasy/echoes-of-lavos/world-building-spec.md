### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Echoes of Lavos**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players discover they can travel through time using ancient portals linked to Lavos - a parasitic world-devourer buried deep beneath the earth. Across multiple eras spanning from 65,000,000 BC to 2300 AF, they must prevent the apocalypse that destroys civilization in 1999. Each era has its own crisis linked to Lavos's influence throughout history. The campaign culminates in a desperate assault on Lavos across multiple timelines, with player choices determining which of several endings comes to pass.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the cosmic origin of Lavos. Where did it come from, what is its lifecycle, and how many worlds has it consumed?
    *   Write the history of the Kingdom of Zeal at its height, before Queen Zeal's corruption by Lavos. What were the Gurus, what was the Mammon Machine?
    *   Describe the Day of Lavos as it occurred in the original timeline - 1999 AF. What happened hour by hour?
    *   Explain the extinction event of 65,000,000 BC and how Lavos's arrival affected the evolution of humans versus reptilians.
    *   Detail the fall of the Kingdom of Zeal and the Ocean Palace disaster. What became of Schala?
    *   Write the legend of the hero Cyrus and his battle with Magus, and how Glenn was cursed.
    *   Describe the Frozen Flame, a fragment of Lavos with reality-warping properties found throughout history.
    *   Explain the nature of time gates and the End of Time - who created this nexus and why?

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players save a forest in 600 AF from being destroyed.
    *   **THEN:** In 1000 AF, that forest thrives and contains rare herbs and magical creatures. Villagers speak of it as an ancient guardian wood.
    *   **IF:** The players retrieve the Masamune sword and help Frog confront Magus.
    *   **THEN:** Frog can either kill Magus in revenge or spare him. If spared, Magus joins the party to fight Lavos. If killed, Frog becomes more confident but Magus's knowledge is lost.
    *   **IF:** The players help Robo repair the forest using his robot companions in 600 AF, leaving them to work for 400 years.
    *   **THEN:** In 1000 AF, they find a thriving forest shrine with powerful items left by Robo's robots, and a monument to their fallen mechanical friends.
    *   **IF:** The players complete side quests for each companion (saving Lucca's mother from the accident, helping Frog reclaim his honor, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** Each completion unlocks a better ending variation and that companion's ultimate weapon/ability.
    *   **IF:** The players defeat the Black Omen before facing Lavos in 1999.
    *   **THEN:** Queen Zeal's temporal fortress vanishes from all time periods, and allies from multiple eras can join the final battle against Lavos.
    *   **IF:** The players confront Lavos without changing enough of history.
    *   **THEN:** They achieve only the "basic" ending - Lavos is defeated but the world remains damaged, many allies are lost, and the future remains bleak.
    *   **IF:** The players save Schala from the Ocean Palace disaster.
    *   **THEN:** This is nearly impossible, but if achieved, unlocks the "perfect" ending where Schala survives, Magus is redeemed, and a golden age begins.
    *   **IF:** The players visit 2300 AF after making significant changes to history.
    *   **THEN:** The ruined future shows signs of recovery - more survivors, better conditions, messages of hope - confirming their actions are working.
    *   **IF:** The players abuse time travel for personal gain or cause reckless paradoxes.
    *   **THEN:** Introduce temporal anomalies - hostile time-displaced monsters, unpredictable gate behavior, or a mysterious force trying to correct the timeline.
