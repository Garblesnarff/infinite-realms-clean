**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dystopian Future / Time Travel / Resistance / Dark Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **12** → Finish **18**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the year 2095, the world is a wasteland ruled by the Sentinels—adaptive construct soldiers created to hunt and eliminate all magic-users. What began as a defense program became a purge that killed millions and enslaved the rest. The players are survivors in a concentration camp, living in a future where heroes lost. When a dying archmage unlocks a ritual to send one person's consciousness back in time, the party must choose who will go, and that hero must prevent the single assassination that triggered the Sentinel program—without erasing themselves from existence.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A desperate fight to change a dark future before it begins.

*   **Act I — The Dark Future (Sessions 1–5):** The campaign opens in 2095, in the ruins of what was once a great magical city. The players are survivors in Camp Omega, a concentration camp where magic-users are imprisoned and worked to death. They witness daily atrocities, plan escapes, and try to keep hope alive. When the resistance's leader, the ancient wizard Shadowcat, reveals she has found a way to send someone's mind back in time to 2025, the party must escape the camp to reach her hidden sanctum and perform the ritual.
*   **Act II — The Time Jump (Sessions 6–11):** One player's consciousness is sent back 70 years into their younger body (or the body of their ancestor). They retain their memories and some powers, but they must convince their past allies that they're telling the truth about the dark future. The party (now including "past" versions of themselves or ancestors) must identify the key moment: the assassination of Ambassador Mystral, which triggered anti-magic sentiment and led to the Sentinel program. They have weeks to stop it while hunted by early-model Sentinels and those who want the dark future to occur.
*   **Act III — The Butterfly Effect (Sessions 12–15+):** As the party works to prevent the assassination, they discover a conspiracy: a time-traveling agent from the dark future, sent by the Sentinel AI itself, is ensuring the timeline remains intact. The party must confront this agent, prevent the assassination, and deal with the consequences—their actions create ripples that may alter their present in unexpected ways. The time-traveler returns to find a changed future, but is it better—or just different?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of fate versus free will, the cost of changing history, and hope in the face of inevitable doom. The central conflict is against time itself, and the question of whether the future can truly be changed—and at what cost. Can the players prevent the dark future without creating something worse? And what happens to those who remember the timeline that never was?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Time Paradox Strain**
*   The time-traveler accumulates Paradox Strain whenever they reveal future knowledge or significantly alter events.
*   High Strain causes painful visions of the dark future, disadvantage on checks, and risks "fading" from existence if it reaches maximum.
*   Strain can be reduced by allowing certain "minor" events to occur as they originally did, creating moral dilemmas.

### 2. **Butterfly Effect Table**
*   Each major change the players make to the timeline triggers a roll on the Butterfly Effect table.
*   Results range from beneficial (a hero who died now lives) to catastrophic (a new threat emerges) to bittersweet (peace is achieved but magic fades from the world).
*   The DM tracks these changes secretly, revealing them when the time-traveler returns to the future.

### 3. **Dual-Timeline Play**
*   After the time jump, the campaign occasionally cuts back to the dark future where the "future versions" of characters still fight to survive.
*   Changes in the past gradually affect the future—Sentinels become weaker, camps have fewer guards, hope spreads.
*   If the past-party succeeds, the final session shows them both in the changed future, witnessing what their sacrifice created.
