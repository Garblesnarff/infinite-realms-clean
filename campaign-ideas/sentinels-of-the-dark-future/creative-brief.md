# Creative Brief: Sentinels of the Dark Future

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dystopian Dark Fantasy (Terminator meets X-Men)

Inspired by the bleak, industrial aesthetic of dystopian sci-fi like *The Terminator*, *The Matrix*, and *X-Men: Days of Future Past*. This style aims to capture the contrast between the dark, oppressive future and the vibrant, hopeful past that must be saved.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize the Contrast:** Show the stark difference between the dystopian future (dark, ruined, industrial) and the hopeful past (vibrant, magical, alive).
*   **Brutal Technology:** The Sentinels should look imposing, adaptive, and inhuman—perfect killing machines.
*   **Survivor Aesthetic:** Characters in the future are scarred, worn, and desperate. Characters in the past are clean, hopeful, and unaware of what's coming.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dystopian, desperate, industrial, hope vs. despair, time-travel, resistance, brutal technology.
*   **Feeling:** The future feels like the end of hope—gray, cold, oppressive. The past feels warm, alive, and precious because we know it will be lost. The contrast should be heartbreaking.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Sharp, angular lines for Sentinels and future tech. Softer, more organic lines for characters and magic. The future is all hard edges; the past has curves.
*   **Forms:** Sentinels are geometric, inhuman, and adaptive. Future architecture is brutalist and functional. Past architecture is elegant and magical.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed digital painting in a dystopian realism style. Focus on the angular, threatening form of a Sentinel—humanoid but inhuman, with glowing red sensors and adaptive armor plates."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Future:** Desaturated grays, browns, and blacks, with harsh red and orange emergency lights. Rust, ash, and decay dominate.
*   **Past:** Vibrant colors—blues, greens, golds—with magical auroras and warm natural light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette split between the gray, ash-covered ruins of the future and the warm, golden magical lights of the past, showing the same location in two times."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Future Characters:** Scarred, branded with control collars, wearing tattered prisoner uniforms or scavenged armor. Faces show trauma, determination, and exhaustion.
*   **Past Characters:** Clean, wearing elegant robes or armor with magical flourishes. Faces show idealism, confidence, and unawareness of coming doom.
*   **Sentinels:** Humanoid constructs with adaptive armor, glowing sensors, and weapon systems integrated into their bodies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A resistance fighter from 2095—scarred face with a control collar brand, wearing tattered robes over makeshift armor. Eyes show both exhaustion and fierce determination."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Future:** Ruined cities, concentration camps with guard towers and searchlights, Sentinel manufacturing facilities, ash wastelands.
*   **Past:** Vibrant magical cities with floating towers, bustling markets, peaceful academies, diplomatic summits in grand halls.
*   **Details:** Future has propaganda posters, execution platforms, guard Sentinels, barbed wire. Past has magical lights, celebration banners, diverse crowds.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split-screen composition: left shows Camp Omega in 2095—gray, brutal, with guard towers and patrolling Sentinels. Right shows the same location in 2025—a beautiful magical academy with floating towers and gardens."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Future:** Harsh, dramatic lighting from industrial sources—searchlights, emergency lights, fires. Deep, oppressive shadows.
*   **Past:** Warm, natural lighting—sunlight, magical glows, welcoming fires. Soft, hopeful illumination.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the emotional tone—the future is harsh and unforgiving, the past is warm and worth saving.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...the future scene lit by harsh red emergency lights and searchlights, creating dramatic shadows. The past scene bathed in warm golden sunlight streaming through stained glass."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses before/after or split-screen compositions to show the contrast between timelines. Also uses oppressive framing in the future (characters small against imposing Sentinels) and empowering framing in the past.
*   **Techniques:** Use vertical splits to show same location in different times. Frame Sentinels as looming threats. Show characters looking up at hope or down in despair.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vertical split composition showing the same character: left side in 2095 as a scarred prisoner, right side in 2025 as their younger, hopeful self, both looking toward each other across time."

## Voice

A gravelly, worn voice of a survivor who has seen the worst of what can happen. The tone is somber and haunted, speaking with the weight of terrible memories and desperate hope. There's an undercurrent of warning—a sense that every word carries the urgency of someone trying to prevent an apocalypse. The delivery alternates between quiet intensity and passionate determination. Role: A resistance fighter from the dark future, chronicling the last hope to change history.
