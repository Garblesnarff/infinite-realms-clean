### **World-Building Specification Brief: Dance Magic Dance**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party must navigate an impossible, ever-changing labyrinth in thirteen hours to rescue a stolen innocent from the Goblin King, solving riddles, resisting temptations, and discovering that claiming personal power through self-belief is the only way to break Jareth's control.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the nature of the labyrinth—is it a physical place, a dream, or a test created by wishes?
    *   Explain Jareth's origins and his relationship to wishes, childhood, and growing up
    *   Describe the goblin hierarchy and culture—chaotic, theatrical, ruled by Jareth's whims
    *   Write about the castle's impossible geometry and what it represents
    *   Detail the rules of the thirteen-hour challenge and whether anyone has succeeded before
    *   Explain what happens to those who fail—goblin transformation and what it means

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **Jareth's Court** (Major) - Goblin King and his goblin subjects, goal: keep the stolen one, test challengers
    *   **The Seekers** (Major) - The party rescuing the stolen innocent, goal: navigate labyrinth and win
    *   **Reluctant Allies** (Minor) - Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ludo—creatures helping despite fear or duty
    *   **The Labyrinth Itself** (Major) - Living environment that tests and teaches, ambiguous allegiance
    *   **The Goblins** (Minor) - Chaotic subjects serving Jareth, more nuisance than threat

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Jareth, Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ludo, The Stolen One
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "The Worm," "The Helping Hands," "Door Guard Riddlers," "Goblin Soldier," "The Junk Lady," "Masked Ball Attendant," "The Wise Man with Bird Hat," "Firey (detachable head creature)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Labyrinth Entrance** - Vast stone walls, no obvious path forward, requires accepting false perceptions
*   **The Oubliette** - Underground forgotten place where helping hands lead
*   **The Bog of Eternal Stench** - Swamp with permanent odor curse, bridge guarded by Sir Didymus
*   **The Goblin City** - Urban chaos filled with goblins, contradictory architecture, approaching the castle
*   **The Escher Castle** - Impossible stairways going all directions, gravity optional, throne room at center
*   Each location challenges perception, logic, and self-belief rather than combat prowess

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF time runs out THEN the stolen one transforms permanently into a goblin
*   IF the party accepts Jareth's temptations THEN they gain shortcuts but lose time or companions
*   IF they befriend Hoggle despite his betrayal THEN he helps in the final confrontation
*   IF they solve riddles and puzzles creatively THEN they progress faster
*   IF they eat the poisoned peach THEN they enter the dream realm and must be rescued
*   IF they speak the words "You have no power over me" THEN Jareth's illusions shatter
*   IF they try to fight Jareth directly THEN they fail—he's not defeated through violence
*   IF they claim their own power THEN the labyrinth releases them and the stolen one
