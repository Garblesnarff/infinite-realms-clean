# Creative Brief: Defender of the Holy City

## Art Style: Epic Medieval with Middle Eastern Influences

Inspired by *Kingdom of Heaven* and historical Crusades. Captures the golden architecture of Jerusalem, the brutal reality of siege warfare, the cultural blend of East and West, and the moral ambiguity of religious conflict.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Sacred Beauty:** Jerusalem's golden stone, religious architecture, sacred sites
*   **Cultural Blend:** Crusader and Muslim aesthetics mixing, both beautiful and martial
*   **Siege Scale:** Massive walls, armies, engines of war, human cost
*   **Moral Complexity:** No clear villains in main conflict, sympathetic characters on both sides

### Color Palette:

*   **Jerusalem:** Golden-white stone, blue sky, green gardens within walls
*   **Crusaders:** Steel armor, white surcoats with red crosses, practical earth tones
*   **Muslims:** Curved scimitars, flowing robes, greens and golds, ornate decoration
*   **Siege:** Fire and smoke, blood on stone, dust clouds, sunset oranges

## Voice

A contemplative voice grappling with moral complexity—not declaring right and wrong but exploring questions. Speaks with the gravity of someone who's seen holy war's human cost. Pacing is measured, thoughtful, allowing weight of decisions to land. Tone shifts between inspirational speeches about higher ideals, pragmatic military commands, and philosophical questions about faith and humanity. Accent suggests education and nobility, period-appropriate formality. Role: The voice of conscience in impossible situations.
