The party arrives in Crusader Jerusalem as knights, artisans, or pilgrims, finding a tenuous peace maintained by the leper King Baldwin IV and his wise marshal Balian. When Baldwin dies and zealots seize power, they provoke Saladin's Muslim armies into siege of the Holy City. The party must defend Jerusalem against overwhelming odds, navigate Christian-Muslim politics, and decide what the city truly represents—a symbol of faith worth dying for, or people worth saving regardless of religion. Through siege combat, political intrigue, and moral choices about mercy vs victory, they'll discover that some enemies are more honorable than allies.

## Story Arc (Medium-Long Campaign — 18-22 sessions)

A four-act progression from peace to war to moral reckoning.

*   **Act I — The Fragile Peace (Sessions 1-5):** The party arrives in Jerusalem during King Baldwin's enlightened rule. They witness cooperation between Christians, Muslims, and Jews. They meet Balian, Tiberias, and Sybilla—leaders trying to maintain peace. Baldwin's leprosy worsens. Zealot crusaders like Reynald de Chatillon commit atrocities. Party realizes peace depends on fragile political balance.

*   **Act II — The Road to War (Sessions 6-11):** Baldwin dies, his sister's husband Guy becomes king. Guy and the Templars provoke Saladin by attacking caravans. The party witnesses the disaster at Hattin where the Crusader army is destroyed. They retreat to Jerusalem as Saladin's massive army approaches. Must prepare defenses with limited resources and fractured command. Question: Fight for fanatics or for innocents?

*   **Act III — The Siege (Sessions 12-18):** Saladin surrounds Jerusalem with forces far outnumbering defenders. Daily battles on walls, siege engines, mining operations, starvation. The party must manage resources, morale, and internal politics. Muslim and Christian moderates seek negotiated peace vs zealots demanding fight to death. Balian leads defense while trying to negotiate. Moral complexity: enemy commander Saladin more honorable than supposed allies.

*   **Act IV — Terms of Peace (Sessions 19-22):** Walls breached, city nearly falls. Final choice: suicide defense causing massacre, or negotiate surrender saving lives but losing control of holy sites. Party's actions throughout campaign determine what terms Saladin offers. Resolution explores whether they defended faith or humanity, and if there's difference. Epilogue shows consequences of their moral choices.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores moral complexity in religious war, honorable enemies vs dishonorable allies, and whether faith justifies violence. It asks: What makes a place holy—stone or people? Can enemies share respect? Is saving lives worth losing symbols? Is it better to die pure or live compromised? The central conflict isn't good vs evil but competing goods—faith vs mercy, symbols vs lives, victory vs peace.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Moral Complexity Tracking**
*   Actions rated not good/evil but faith/mercy, victory/peace, allies/enemies
*   No clear right answers, consequences for all choices
*   Saladin respects honorable opponents, massacres atrocity-committers
*   Final terms of surrender based on moral track record

### 2. **Siege Management**
*   Defend walls with limited defenders against superior numbers
*   Manage food, water, morale, civilian population
*   Repair damage vs prepare counterattacks vs rest troops
*   Resource scarcity creates impossible choices

### 3. **Three Faiths**
*   Jerusalem contains Christians, Muslims, Jews
*   Party can find allies or enemies in each
*   Religious tolerance affects NPC reactions
*   Some quests available only if respectful to all faiths

### 4. **Knight's Code**
*   Chivalric ideal vs brutal reality
*   Following code earns respect even from enemies
*   Balian exemplifies highest ideals
*   Guy/Reynald show how faith can excuse atrocities

### 5. **Siege Warfare**
*   Wall defense mechanics: boiling oil, arrows, stones
*   Siege engines: trebuchets, towers, rams, mining
*   Daily battles wear down both sides
*   Civilians caught in middle create moral dilemmas

### 6. **Negotiation with Enemy**
*   Can parley with Saladin's forces
*   Muslim commanders honor truces if party does
*   Information can be exchanged, wounded traded
*   Ultimate goal may be negotiated peace vs military victory

### 7. **Historical Divergence**
*   Campaign can follow history (negotiated surrender) or diverge
*   Party's choices determine if Jerusalem falls, terms of peace, massacres
*   Better choices save more lives but may compromise faith
*   Worse choices cause bloodbath but "defend faith"

### 8. **"What is Jerusalem Worth?"**
*   Recurring question throughout campaign
*   Saladin asks Balian: "What is Jerusalem worth?"
*   Answer: "Nothing... Everything" (nothing as stone, everything as symbol)
*   Party must answer for themselves through actions
