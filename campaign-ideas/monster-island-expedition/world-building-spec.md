# Monster Island Expedition: World-Building Specification

## Monarch Organization

**Founded:** 1946 after first titan encounter

**Mission:** Study, track, and maintain balance between humans and titans

**Structure:** Covert international coalition, funded through black budgets

**Key Facilities:**
- Outpost 33 (Skull Island observation, destroyed early campaign)
- Castle Bravo (Pacific headquarters)
- Research Station sites worldwide at known titan locations

**Philosophy:** "Let them fight"—titans maintain natural balance

## Skull Island Ecosystem

**Geographic Anomaly:** Island shouldn't exist, may be emerging from Hollow Earth

**Storm Barrier:** Perpetual hurricane, electromagnetic phenomena prevents modern tech

**Biomes:**
- Coastal Cliffs: Pteranodon rookeries, vertical terrain
- Primary Jungle: Megaflora, constant rainfall, low visibility
- Bamboo Forest: Hollow bamboo 200 feet tall, musical in wind
- Swamps: Toxic gas pockets, aquatic megafauna
- Mountains: Kong's territory, bone yards, ancient ruins
- The Divide: Barrier between safe zones and Skull Crawler territory

**Megafauna Examples:**
- Psycho-vultures (60-foot wingspan)
- Mother Longlegs (spider, 100+ feet)
- Spore Mantis (praying mantis, breathes hallucinogenic pollen)
- Sirenjaw (amphibious ambush predator)
- Death Jackal (pack hunters, rhino-sized)

## The Iwi Tribe

**Population:** ~500, declining
**Language:** Unique, no relation to any known tongue
**Technology:** Stone age, but sophisticated in titan management
**Religion:** Kong as god-protector, precursors as ancestors
**Society:** Communal, led by elders, gender equality
**Knowledge:** Extensive titan biology understanding, passed through oral tradition
**Relationship with Kong:** Symbiotic—they provide warning of threats, he provides protection
**Lifespan:** Radiation exposure from titans causes genetic mutations, slightly enhanced abilities but shorter lives

## Kong Specifics

**Species:** Titanus Kong (scientific designation)
**Height:** 300+ feet (still growing, adolescent)
**Age:** ~90-110 years
**Intelligence:** Near-human, learns from experience
**Abilities:** Extreme strength, durability, healing, tactical thinking
**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to conventional weapons at sufficient scale, emotional isolation
**Motivation:** Protect Iwi, defend territory, lonely for his extinct species
**Combat Style:** Uses environment as weapons, learns opponent tactics
**Communication:** Sign language with Jia, body language, roars convey emotion

## Godzilla Details

**Species:** Titanus Gojira
**Age:** Millions of years (predates humanity)
**Height:** 350+ feet
**Power Source:** Internal nuclear reactor, feeds on radiation
**Role:** Alpha predator, maintains ecological balance
**Abilities:** Atomic breath, extreme durability, healing, electromagnetic pulse
**Behavior:** Surfaces when balance threatened, otherwise stays deep ocean
**Relationship to Humans:** Indifferent unless provoked or path blocked
**Territory:** All oceans, contested land masses when necessary

## Ghidorah Origins

**Species:** Unknown (extra-terrestrial)
**Arrival:** Crash-landed on Earth millennia ago during ice age
**Purpose:** Terraforming agent, remakes worlds for its creators
**Biology:** Three-headed, gravity-manipulating, electrical generation, regenerative
**Motivation:** Consume energy, establish dominance, transform Earth
**Power:** Category 0 (beyond normal titan classification)
**Weakness:** Requires massive energy to awaken fully, vulnerable during that process
**History:** Ancient titans united to imprison it, barely succeeded

## Hollow Earth Deep Lore

**Formation:** Not hollow—vast underground ecosystem in pockets and caverns

**Access Points:** Limited, Skull Island is one, others exist globally

**Energy Source:** Gravitational anomalies create heat and light

**Flora/Fauna:** Evolution in isolation created unique species

**Titan Homeland:** Most titans originated here before surface migration

**Ancient War:** Kong's species and Godzilla's species fought titans that would become threats, drove them deep

**Current Status:** Unstable, pressure building, will eventually breach surface globally

## Apex Corporation

**Public Face:** Cybernetics and robotics company

**Secret Agenda:** Titan harvesting for bioweapons

**Leadership:** Walter Simmons (CEO, driven by profit and power)

**Resources:** Private military, advanced technology, government contracts

**Ethics:** None, sees titans as resources not life

**Plans:**
- Harvest titan DNA for supersoldiers
- Create mechanical titans under human control
- Establish corporate dominance in post-titan world
- Exploit Hollow Earth resources

## Precursor Civilization

**Timeline:** Existed 200,000 years ago

**Species:** Unknown (extinct or evolved beyond recognition)

**Technology:** Far beyond modern humanity, titan-scale architecture

**Achievements:**
- Mapped Hollow Earth
- Developed titan communication
- Created weapons capable of harming titans
- Built dimensional stabilizers

**Downfall:** Civil war using titans as weapons, self-extinction

**Legacy:** Ruins, warnings, and inadvertent creation of alpha dominance hierarchy

**Iwi Connection:** Precursors' engineered servants evolved into modern Iwi

## Titan Classification System

**Category System:**
- **Category 5:** Small, 10-50 feet (Psycho-vultures)
- **Category 4:** Medium, 50-150 feet (Skull Crawlers)
- **Category 3:** Large, 150-250 feet (Kong currently)
- **Category 2:** Huge, 250-350 feet (Mature Kong, Godzilla)
- **Category 1:** Colossal, 350-500 feet (Ancient titans)
- **Category 0:** Beyond Classification (Ghidorah, theoretical others)

**Behavior Types:**
- **Destroyer:** Aggressive, territorial (Skull Crawlers)
- **Protector:** Maintains balance (Kong, Godzilla)
- **Neutral:** Follows instinct, not aggressive unless threatened
- **Invader:** Alien to Earth's ecosystem (Ghidorah)

## Other Titans (Mentioned/Encountered)

**Mothra:** Benevolent, symbiotic with humans, heals ecosystems, Queen of Monsters

**Rodan:** Volcanic pteranodon, destructive, submits to alpha

**Behemoth:** Mammoth-like, peaceful unless provoked, accelerates plant growth

**Scylla:** Aquatic cephalopod, aggressive territorial behavior

**MUTO:** Parasitic, feeds on radiation, breeds in other titans

**All operate under alpha hierarchy—Godzilla's roar compels submission**

## Campaign Timeline

**Week 1:** Arrival and crash, survival basics
**Week 2:** Iwi contact, first major titan encounter
**Week 3:** Exploration and mapping, Apex discovery
**Week 4:** Descent into Hollow Earth
**Weeks 5-6:** Hollow Earth exploration, Ghidorah discovery
**Week 7+:** Return to surface, global crisis, resolution

## Resources and Scarcity

**Starting Equipment:** 30 days supplies, scientific instruments, weapons (inadequate), communication gear (fails)

**Depletion:** Food runs out week 2, ammo by week 3, medicine by week 4

**Hunting:** Necessary but dangerous, must target smaller creatures

**Iwi Trade:** Cultural exchange required, they provide food/guides for knowledge/tools

**Salvage:** Titan battles leave materials usable for equipment

**Apex Supplies:** Can raid their expedition camps (risky, morally questionable)

This world-building creates an expedition campaign where every session involves survival horror, exploration wonder, and the growing realization that humanity is not the dominant species and never was.
