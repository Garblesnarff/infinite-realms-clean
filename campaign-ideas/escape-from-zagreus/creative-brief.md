# Creative Brief: Escape from Zagreus

## Art Style: Greek Mythological Painted Art with Isometric Action (Hades-inspired)

**Color Palette:** Deep underworld purples and blacks, divine gold, blood red, olympian white-blues, vibrant boon colors

**Core Principles:**
*   Painted art style, vibrant character designs against dark backgrounds
*   Greek pottery art influences, glowing divine powers
*   Each god has signature color scheme
*   Isometric dungeon perspective

**Prompt Example:** "Greek underworld chambers in painted art style. Zagreus with glowing red blade fighting shades. Purple Stygian architecture with gold accents. Zeus's blue lightning, Poseidon's green water, Artemis's silver arrows. Isometric perspective, vibrant against dark."

## Voice

A determined, charismatic voice with divine authority and rebellious streak. Shifts between respectful to elders and sarcastic to enemies. Greek accent optional. Quick-witted in combat banter. Role: The voice of a demigod defying death itself, learning family means more than escape.
