## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 16-24 sessions)

A roguelike journey through death's domain, dying and learning with each run.

*   **Act I — The First Runs (Sessions 1-8):** Start in the House of Hades. Each session represents multiple "runs" attempting escape. Fight through Tartarus (lava prison), face the Fury Sisters boss, die, respawn, try again. Olympian gods offer boons—Zeus (lightning), Poseidon (knockback), Athena (deflection), Artemis (crits), Ares (doom), Aphrodite (charm). Between runs, talk to NPCs: Nyx (adoptive mother), Achilles (trainer), Megaera (Fury, secret romance option), Hypnos (sleepy secretary). Slowly learn Zagreus is searching for his birth mother. First successful escape reaches the surface but Hades drags them back.
*   **Act II — The Truth Revealed (Sessions 9-16):** Continue runs with new weapons and deeper relationships. Reach Asphodel (lava fields), Elysium (hero paradise), Temple of Styx (poison chambers). Each biome has unique enemies and bosses: Bone Hydra, Theseus & Asterius (heroes), multiple Satyr Sacks. Unlock Persephone's true story: she left the Underworld because Hades was cold and controlling. She's been hiding in a secret garden on the surface. Zagreus was kept in the dark. Hades has been stopping escapes to "protect" him. The family dysfunction is revealed through conversations and artifacts.
*   **Act III — Reconciliation or Freedom (Sessions 17-24):** Multiple successful escapes to visit Persephone unlock the truth: Zagreus's birth nearly killed her because Underworld denizens can't survive on the surface (and vice versa). Hades hid this to protect him. After enough visits, convince Persephone to return. The Olympians help modify Persephone's garden to exist partly in the Underworld. Final run: Hades doesn't fight to kill but to test Zagreus's resolve. Defeat him to prove worthiness. Epilogue: Family dinner with Hades, Persephone, and Zagreus together for the first time. Can continue making runs to help souls or explore relationships.
