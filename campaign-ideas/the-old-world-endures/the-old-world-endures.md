The Old World teeters on the brink of destruction as multiple factions wage war for dominance: the Empire of man, Dwarfen holds, Elvish kingdoms, Greenskin hordes, Vampire Counts, and more. The party leads one faction as a Legendary Lord, conquering settlements, managing provinces, and fielding armies in massive battles. But when the forces of Chaos invade from the northern Wastes—daemons, corrupted warriors, and reality-warping sorcery—ancient enemies must choose between eternal rivalry or united survival against the End Times.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-40 sessions)

A three-act arc of faction wars, escalating threats, and chaos invasion.

*   **Act I — Wars of the Old World (Sessions 1-15):** The party chooses their faction and legendary lord. They expand their empire through diplomacy and conquest, managing settlements and building armies. Faction-specific quests drive the narrative: Empire unites provinces, Dwarfs reclaim Karaks, Greenskins seek WAAAGH!, Vampire Counts raise dead legions. Regional conflicts dominate—no faction trusts another. Chaos is merely a distant rumor in the far north.
*   **Act II — The Northern Threat (Sessions 16-25):** Chaos corruption spreads south like a plague. Chaos warrior armies, daemon manifestations, and corrupted settlements appear. The party must fight a two-front war: rivals to the south and Chaos to the north. Some factions fall to corruption or are destroyed. A cataclysmic event (capital city besieged by daemons) forces acknowledgment of the true threat. Legendary lord confrontations become personal grudge matches.
*   **Act III — The End Times (Sessions 26-40):** Chaos Everchosen—the ultimate champion of dark gods—leads an apocalyptic invasion. Reality tears apart. The party must forge alliances with former enemies through summit or conquest. United armies march north to the Chaos Wastes for final confrontation. Major characters die holding the line. The climax involves defeating the Everchosen and sealing the Chaos rift, but victory is pyrrhic—the Old World is forever changed.
