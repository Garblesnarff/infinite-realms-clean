### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Professional, intense, tragic, methodical, inevitable, urban, disciplined.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of controlled tension and masterful expertise balanced against human vulnerability. The atmosphere should evoke both the cool precision of professionals and the warm pull of personal connections that threaten to destroy everything. The world feels modern, harsh, and ultimately unforgiving.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, precise lines for professional planning and execution; softer, more emotional lines for personal moments.
*   **Forms:** Urban architecture, tactical equipment handled with expertise, treasury security systems, vehicles prepared for precision driving.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed illustration in the style of Heat, showing a crew of professional criminals in a safehouse, gathered around a blueprint of the treasury with tactical precision, each figure showing disciplined focus."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Urban blues and grays for professional scenes, warmer amber tones for personal moments, cold steel for law enforcement presence.
*   **Luminosity:** City lights, neon reflections, harsh fluorescent planning rooms, the warm glow of coffee shops where enemies meet.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an urban color palette of deep blues and grays for nighttime city scenes, with warm amber lighting for intimate moments and the cold blue-white of law enforcement searchlights."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Professional criminals in functional clothing: dark suits, tactical gear worn with expertise, the understated style of those who avoid attention.
*   **Professional Elements:** Characters show their expertise through body language—confident, controlled, economical movement. Details like expensive watches, quality weapons, professional tools.
*   **Expression:** Faces show controlled intensity, the weight of experience, brief moments of human vulnerability breaking through professional masks.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A professional criminal in a tailored dark suit, their expression showing controlled intensity and tactical awareness, holding blueprints with expert precision while a subtle photograph of a loved one creates visual tension."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Urban landscapes dominated by modern architecture, city streets at night, professional safehouses that are austere and functional, coffee shops as neutral ground, the treasury as an imposing target.
*   **Atmosphere:** The city feels alive but dangerous—constantly watched, full of variables, both opportunity and threat.
*   **Details:** Professional world-building: surveillance cameras, escape routes, timing devices, law enforcement presence, the contrast between criminal and civilian spaces.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A nighttime city street during the treasury transport heist, with tactical positioning visible, law enforcement closing in, civilians as variables, professional criminals executing with precision amid urban chaos."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Urban lighting—streetlights, neon signs, searchlights, the stark lighting of professional planning sessions contrasted with softer lighting for human moments.
*   **Shadows:** Used to show professional concealment, create dramatic tension during confrontations, and symbolize the dark side of the criminal life.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting distinguishes professional scenes (cool, controlled) from personal scenes (warm, vulnerable), with pursuit scenes using harsh, chaotic lighting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by urban streetlights and police searchlights creating stark contrasts, with neon reflections on wet pavement and the harsh white of police spotlights hunting through shadows."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide urban vistas for pursuit scenes, tight tactical framing for planning sessions, intimate close-ups for personal moments, parallel compositions showing crew and law enforcement preparing simultaneously.
*   **Techniques:** Split-screen showing cat-and-mouse parallel action, overhead shots of tactical planning, dynamic angles for pursuit and action, static symmetrical framing for the famous coffee shop meeting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A parallel split composition showing the criminal crew planning the heist on one side and Detective Branwell coordinating the pursuit on the other, both with the same professional intensity and tactical precision."

## Voice

A voice that reflects professional intensity mixed with tragic awareness. The narrator speaks with controlled precision during heist sequences, using technical language and tactical detail. During personal moments, the voice softens, showing the humanity beneath the professional exterior. The pacing is methodical and measured, building tension through careful detail rather than rushed delivery. The emotion is restrained but deeply felt—the voice of someone who understands both the allure and the cost of professional excellence. Audio quality features urban ambience—city traffic, police radios, the mechanical precision of preparing equipment, the quiet of a coffee shop conversation between enemies. Role: The voice of a professional who knows this life ends only one way but pursues excellence anyway.
