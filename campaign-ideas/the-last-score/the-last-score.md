## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the tension between professional excellence and human weakness, between the discipline required for criminal success and the personal connections that make life meaningful. The central conflict is the cat-and-mouse game between professional criminals and an equally professional detective, complicated by personal relationships that threaten operational security. The crew must balance their desire to retire with the reality that one more job is never simple, and that choosing love or family over professional protocol can be fatal. The campaign asks: Can you be truly professional and truly human? What happens when your greatest strength—discipline—becomes incompatible with what makes life worth living? And what is the price of being the best at something that will eventually destroy you?

*   Players must choose between professional effectiveness and personal fulfillment.

### 2. **The Heat Tracker**
*   Represents law enforcement pressure on the crew, increasing with each job and mistake.
*   High heat restricts movement, increases danger, and forces difficult choices about continuing operations.

### 3. **The Thirty-Second Rule**
*   During heists, the crew has emergency escape protocols that trigger automatically.
*   Players must decide whether to follow protocol (escape safely) or break discipline (save allies, retrieve targets, help civilians).
*   Creates tragic dilemmas where professionalism conflicts with loyalty and compassion.

### 4. **Mutual Respect Mechanics**
*   The crew and Detective Branwell can have civil, even respectful interactions despite being enemies.
*   These interactions provide opportunities for deals, intelligence, and understanding—but also psychological warfare.
*   The game tracks respect levels that influence the final confrontation's tone and outcome.
