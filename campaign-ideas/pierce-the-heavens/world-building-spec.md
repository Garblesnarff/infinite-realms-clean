### **World-Building Specification Brief: Pierce the Heavens**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   The party escapes underground prisons using mecha powered by spiral energy (willpower). They fight Beastmen tyrants, reach the surface, lead a revolution against the Spiral King, then discover he was protecting humanity from the Anti-Spirals—cosmic entities suppressing evolution. The war escalates to galactic scale as the party evolves from rebels to gods, facing the ultimate question: is unlimited growth worth universal entropy?

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail the Spiral Nemesis—if spiral beings evolve infinitely, their energy accelerates universal heat death.
*   Explain the Anti-Spiral War (ancient): Lord Genome fought and lost, then suppressed humanity to save them.
*   Describe Beastmen (humanoid animals created by Genome to police humanity without spiral power).
*   Chart spiral evolution stages: Human → Gunmen pilot → Multi-Galactic being → Universal consciousness.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Team Dai-Gurren** (Major - Player Faction): Ragtag rebels evolving into cosmic warriors.
*   **Beastmen Empire** (Major - Early Antagonist): Lord Genome's enforcers, animal-human hybrids piloting Gunmen.
*   **The Anti-Spirals** (Major - Ultimate Antagonist): Collective consciousness that chose stagnation over evolution, suppresses all spiral races.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Kamina** (mentor who dies heroically), **Yoko** (sniper and survivor), **Lord Genome** (tyrant-protector), **Nia** (princess turned enemy herald), **The Anti-Spiral** (cosmic opponent), **Viral** (honor-bound Beastman rival).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Giha Village** (underground starting point), **Surface World** (vast and bright), **Teppelin** (mobile spiral fortress), **Space Battleship Dai-Gurren**, **Anti-Spiral Dimension** (abstract realm where willpower = physics).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** Kamina dies **THEN** party inherits his will, gains massive Spiral Power boost, must learn to lead.
*   **IF** Anti-Spiral defeated **THEN** universe safe but party must choose: keep evolving or voluntarily limit spiral power.
*   **IF** Nia saved **THEN** proves love transcends cosmic programming, weakens Anti-Spiral's logic.

**7. Spiral Power Mechanics:**
*   Stat that increases through inspiration, hot-blooded speeches, refusing to give up.
*   Add to any roll if you make a dramatic declaration first.
*   No cap—endgame bonuses reach +20 or higher.
*   **Drawback:** Overconfidence can backfire. Infinite power risks universal heat death.

**8. Gunmen Evolution:**
*   **Tier 1:** Lagann (one-pilot, drill-headed).
*   **Tier 2:** Gurren Lagann (combined form, humanoid).
*   **Tier 3:** Arc-Gurren Lagann (fortress-sized).
*   **Tier 4:** Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann (galaxy-sized, throws galaxies as weapons).
*   **Tier 5:** Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (universe-sized, drills through probability itself).
