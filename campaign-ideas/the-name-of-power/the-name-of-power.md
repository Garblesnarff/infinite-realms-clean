*A Dark Fairy Tale / True Name Horror campaign — Medium Campaign (12–16 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Name of Power
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Fairy Tale / True Name Horror / Deal with Devil
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** true names, spinning straw to gold, firstborn bargain, name guessing game, fey contracts, identity power, desperate deals, transformation magic
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Rumpelstiltskin isn't a singular creature but a title passed through name-binding—when someone learns the current holder's true name, they either break the contract or become the next Rumpelstiltskin, inheriting the power to spin straw into gold and the compulsion to make terrible bargains. The party, hired to help a queen whose firstborn child is claimed by mysterious contract, discovers a centuries-old chain of desperate people forced to continue the cycle, each collecting children as payment because the true name magic demands it. They must trace the history of Rumpelstiltskins back to the original bargain, navigate the terrifying power of knowing someone's true name, and decide whether to break the curse (freeing current victim but losing gold-spinning magic) or perpetuate it by claiming the name for themselves.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **True Name Power:** Knowing someone's name gives absolute control over them.
*   **Inherited Curse:** Breaking contract might transfer curse to party member.
*   **Moral Complexity:** Current Rumpelstiltskin is victim forced to victimize others.
*   **Name Magic:** Speaking true names has immediate binding effects requiring caution.
*   **Child Stakes:** The bargain involves taking firstborn children with all ethical weight.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act mystery about names, power, and the chains of exploitation.

*   **Act I — The Queen's Bargain (Sessions 1–4):** The party is hired by a queen (formerly a miller's daughter) who's about to lose her firstborn to a mysterious creature who helped her spin straw into gold years ago. She never learned its name and now desperately seeks to break the contract. They investigate the original deal and discover multiple women throughout the kingdom with similar stories—all made desperate bargains, all gave up firstborn children, all to creatures they couldn't name. The pattern suggests this has been happening for centuries. Early encounters with "Rumpelstiltskin" reveal a tormented creature compelled to make these bargains.

*   **Act II — The Chain of Names (Sessions 5–8):** They discover the horrifying truth—there have been dozens of Rumpelstiltskins throughout history. Each person who learned the previous one's name had choice: break the contract (good) or speak the name to bind it and become the new Rumpelstiltskin (gaining gold-spinning power but cursed to collect children). Some broke free, most didn't. The collected children aren't eaten but raised in hidden realm, trained to eventually take over the role. The current Rumpelstiltskin is revealed as previous victim's child, continuing cycle not from malice but magical compulsion.

*   **Act III — The Name Game (Sessions 9–12):** They learn the only way to break the curse is to learn Rumpelstiltskin's true name without using it for binding. Speaking the name gives power over the named—but that power is the curse itself. Previous attempted rescues failed because would-be heroes claimed the name to gain gold-spinning ability and became new Rumpelstiltskins. The children raised in the hidden realm are being prepared as insurance—if current Rumpelstiltskin is freed or killed, one child automatically inherits. The party must find the original bargain-maker who started the chain and discover if true name magic can be broken at the source.

*   **Act IV — Breaking the Name (Sessions 13–16):** Final confrontation reveals the original Rumpelstiltskin made a deal with a demon of avarice—spinning worthless straw into gold at cost of spreading that same greed through generations. Each Rumpelstiltskin must collect children to feed the demon, each child raised becomes potential next victim. The party must choose: kill current Rumpelstiltskin (passing curse to next in line), learn the true name and resist using it (risking temptation), break the original demonic contract (potentially releasing something worse), or find the demon and renegotiate. The queen's firstborn hangs in balance, the collected children need saving, and speaking the name—any name—wrong could bind the speaker to centuries of curse.

## Central Conflict

Power versus freedom and the curse of knowledge. True names grant absolute power over the named, making them ultimate tool and ultimate weapon. The Rumpelstiltskin curse exploits this—offering miraculous gold-spinning power at cost of becoming enslaved to avarice demon. Each person who learns the name faces temptation to use it, to gain the power, to become the next link in chain. The collected children represent how exploitation creates more exploiters. The party must navigate whether some knowledge is too dangerous to possess, if breaking curses justifies risking becoming cursed, and whether the system creating desperate millers' daughters is the real villain.
