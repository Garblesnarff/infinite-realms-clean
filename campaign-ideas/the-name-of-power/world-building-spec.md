### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Name of Power**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When a queen's firstborn is claimed by mysterious contract, the party—hired to break the bargain—discovers Rumpelstiltskin is not singular creature but a title passed through name-binding where learning the true name either frees the current victim or transfers the curse to the speaker, creating centuries-old chain of desperate people forced to spin straw into gold and collect children to feed a demon of avarice.

    *   Write about the three-day name-guessing game and its magical enforcement

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the true name is spoken to break curse THEN speaker risks becoming next Rumpelstiltskin
*   IF current Rumpelstiltskin is killed THEN curse automatically transfers to Eldest Child
*   IF name-guessing game is won THEN contract breaks but temptation to use name remains
*   IF queen's firstborn is claimed THEN demon of avarice is fed and grows stronger
*   IF gold-spinning continues THEN more desperate bargains are enabled by wealth
*   IF Hidden Realm is discovered THEN collected children must be saved or freed
*   IF true name is learned but not spoken THEN curse might break cleanly
*   IF original demonic contract is found THEN renegotiation or breaking becomes possible
*   IF previous victims are consulted THEN warnings about temptation are given
*   IF the miller's boasts are exposed THEN systematic problem of creating desperation is revealed
*   IF Name Library is accessed THEN all true names become dangerous knowledge
*   IF demon of avarice is confronted THEN ultimate source of curse can be addressed
*   IF party member speaks name for power THEN they become new Rumpelstiltskin
*   IF collected children are returned THEN families reunite but indoctrination damage remains
*   IF the compulsion dance is witnessed THEN Rumpelstiltskin sings name revealing it
