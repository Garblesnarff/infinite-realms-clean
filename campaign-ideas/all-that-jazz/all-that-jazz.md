---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** All That Jazz
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Jazz Age Crime / Fame and Murder / Dark Satire
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **9–11**
**Tone (keywords):** jazz age decadence, murder as celebrity, media manipulation, corrupt justice, vaudeville satire, fame over morality, razzle dazzle
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In 1920s Chicago during Prohibition, the party becomes entangled with Murderess Row—the women's cellblock where killers become celebrities and murders become headline entertainment. When party member(s) are framed for murder (or actually commit one), they must navigate the corrupt justice system where a slick lawyer can get anyone acquitted if they're famous enough. It's all about the show, the press, and making murder into vaudeville—because when you're good to Mama, Mama's good to you.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Social Manipulation:** Managing public opinion, press relations, and courtroom performance matter more than combat.
*   **Investigation and Framing:** Finding evidence, manufacturing alibis, discrediting witnesses.
*   **Jazz Age Politics:** Bribes, speakeasies, corrupt cops, mob connections—everything negotiable.
*   **Performance as Power:** Musical numbers and showmanship provide mechanical benefits.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Murder (Sessions 1–3):** Party in jazz age Chicago—speakeasies, clubs, crime. Someone is murdered and party member is accused (framed or guilty). Arrested and taken to Cook County Jail.
*   **Act II — Murderess Row (Sessions 4–7):** In jail, meet the celebrity killers. Matron Mama Morton runs the place through bribes. Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer, can get anyone off for $5000. Must become famous enough to win public sympathy.
*   **Act III — The Media Circus (Sessions 8–11):** Competing with Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly for headlines. Stage performances, manipulate press, manufacture stories. Billy Flynn orchestrates the trial as theater.
*   **Act IV — The Trial (Sessions 12–15):** Courtroom as vaudeville show. Billy Flynn's razzle dazzle. Witnesses manufactured and discredited. Will the party get acquitted through fame and spectacle, or will justice actually happen?

## Central Conflict

Justice versus spectacle, truth versus entertainment, guilt versus celebrity. In jazz age Chicago, murder is showbiz and the press loves a beautiful killer more than truth. The party must decide whether to play the game—manufacture fame, lie expertly, win through razzle dazzle—or pursue actual justice and likely hang. The question: when murder is entertainment and fame excuses everything, what does justice even mean?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Fame Points**
*   Track public attention. High fame means sympathetic juries, better treatment, Billy Flynn's full attention. Fame decays without fresh headlines.

### 2. **Razzle Dazzle**
*   Performance checks can replace investigation or persuasion. If you dazzle them enough, facts don't matter.

### 3. **Mama's Favors**
*   Bribe system—pay Mama Morton for privileges, connections, planted evidence. Everything has a price.

### 4. **Press Management**
*   Regular opportunities to shape your story. Mary Sunshine's articles affect public opinion and trial outcomes.

### 5. **The Merry Murderesses**
*   Other inmates provide assistance if you're the headliner. Lose fame, lose their support.

### 6. **Cell Block Tango**
*   Each major NPC murderess has her story—often sympathetic despite the killing. Understanding their motivations provides insights and alliances.
