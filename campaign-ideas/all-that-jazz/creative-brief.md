# Creative Brief: All That Jazz

## Art Style: Jazz Age Noir Vaudeville

Inspired by Chicago's sleek Bob Fosse aesthetic—art deco elegance, jazz age decadence, vaudeville theatricality, shadows and spotlights, crime as performance art.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Sultry and theatrical—black fishnets and lingerie, blood red curtains and lipstick, gold art deco trim, harsh spotlight white against deep shadows, champagne gold, cigarette smoke gray. Everything is high contrast—light and shadow, glamour and crime.

**Character Design:** 1920s flapper style—Roxie and Velma in iconic black lingerie and fishnet for performances, period dresses and cloche hats for daily wear, Mama Morton in matron uniform and pearls, Billy Flynn in sharp three-piece suits and fedora, Amos in simple working-class clothes ignored by everyone. All designs emphasize showmanship and style—everyone is performing.

**Environments:** Art deco jazz clubs with illegal booze and brass bands, Cook County Jail's women's cellblock (surprisingly nice for celebrities), the courtroom as theater with press gallery as audience, vaudeville stages with spotlight and curtains, press rooms with typewriters and telephone. Everything has theatrical staging—spotlights pick out characters, shadows hide crimes.

**Action:** Dance numbers with Fosse choreography—sharp angles, hat tricks, chair work. The murder as stylized movement. Courtroom performances with Billy Flynn conducting like a maestro. Press photographers' flashbulbs. Vaudeville acts between story beats. Everything is performance.

## Voice

A voice of cynical showbiz savvy—breathy jazz singer mixed with wise-cracking criminal, able to sell any story with enough pizzazz. Chicago accent, period slang, vaudeville patter. Can be Roxie's desperate ambition, Velma's bitter rivalry, Billy Flynn's smooth manipulation, Mama's transactional warmth. The voice of someone who knows it's all bullshit but plays the game beautifully anyway. Sardonic, theatrical, darkly comic.

## Music Style

Jazz and vaudeville with Fosse's signature sound—think Chicago's iconic Kander and Ebb score. "All That Jazz" as sultry opening number with brass and sass. "Cell Block Tango" as sharp rhythmic storytelling—"He had it coming!" "Razzle Dazzle" as Billy Flynn's showman philosophy—brass fanfare and tap dancing. "Mr. Cellophane" as heartbreaking invisibility. Mix of sultry jazz, vaudeville theater, and satirical edge. Music that's entertaining as hell while commenting on corruption. Make it snappy, make it sexy, make it cynical.
