### **World-Building Specification Brief: All That Jazz**

**1. Core Concept:**
In 1920s Chicago, the party becomes entangled with Murderess Row where killers are celebrities, hiring a slick lawyer to turn their murder trial into vaudeville spectacle and win acquittal through fame rather than innocence.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail 1920s Chicago—Prohibition, speakeasies, jazz age, organized crime
*   Explain Murderess Row phenomenon—women killers as celebrities, public fascination
*   Describe the corrupt justice system—everything for sale, trials as entertainment
*   Write about vaudeville culture—showbiz as ultimate value, fame as redemption
*   Detail the press machine—tabloids that make and break celebrities
*   Explain Billy Flynn's methods—razzle dazzle, manufactured witnesses, courtroom theater
*   Describe class dynamics—working class criminals versus wealthy socialites

**3. Factions:**
*   **Murderess Row** (Major) - Celebrity female killers competing for headlines
*   **The Press** (Major) - Journalists manufacturing narratives for sales
*   **Billy Flynn's Circus** (Major) - Defense attorney and his theatrical approach
*   **The Corrupt System** (Major) - Police, judges, jailers all on the take
*   **The Mob** (Minor) - Organized crime running speakeasies and protection
*   **The Public** (Minor) - Fickle audience that loves a beautiful killer

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Roxie Hart, Velma Kelly, Billy Flynn, Mama Morton, Amos Hart, Mary Sunshine
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Cell Block Murderess," "Corrupt Cop," "Press Photographer," "Jury Member," "Nightclub Owner," "Mob Enforcer," "Witness for Hire," "Vaudeville Manager"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Jazz Clubs** - Speakeasies where crime and celebration mix freely
*   **Cook County Jail** - Murderess Row where killers live as celebrities
*   **The Courtroom** - Theater stage where Billy Flynn performs trials
*   **The Press Room** - Where public narratives are manufactured
*   **The Vaudeville Theater** - Where acquitted killers attempt comeback shows

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party gains fame THEN better treatment, sympathetic jury, Billy Flynn's attention
*   IF party loses headlines to rival murderess THEN support and resources vanish
*   IF Billy Flynn works his magic THEN facts become irrelevant to trial outcome
*   IF party bribes Mama Morton THEN access to privileges and favorable "accidents"
*   IF press turns against party THEN conviction becomes likely regardless of evidence
*   IF party actually pursues justice over spectacle THEN faces harsh consequences—truth doesn't sell papers
