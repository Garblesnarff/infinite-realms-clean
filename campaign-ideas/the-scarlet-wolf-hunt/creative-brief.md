# Creative Brief: The Scarlet Wolf Hunt

## Art Style: Gothic Fairy Tale meets Wilderness Horror

Dark European folklore blended with Gothic horror—storybook illustrations turned sinister, deep forest atmospheres, and fairy tale imagery corrupted into nightmare. The aesthetic celebrates classic fairy tale art while rendering predator-prey dynamics with visceral horror.

### Core Principles:
*   **Fairy Tale Foundation:** Classic storybook aesthetic twisted into horror
*   **Predator Fear:** Visual emphasis on being hunted, eyes in darkness, stalking terror
*   **Transformation Horror:** Body horror of human-to-wolf metamorphosis
*   **Forest Dominance:** Woods as character—alive, hostile, maze-like

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Deep forest greens and browns dominate—ancient woods in perpetual twilight. Red is the signature color—cloaks, blood, warning signs, hunter marks. Grandmother's house uses warm yellows and oranges suggesting false safety. Wolf-forms use grays, blacks, and unnatural silver suggesting moonlight and corruption. Eyes glow yellow-green in darkness. Night scenes dominate with limited torchlight creating pools of visibility surrounded by threatening darkness. Transformations show flesh rippling between human pink and wolf gray.

**Character Design:** Red wears iconic scarlet hooded cloak but it's battle-scarred and blood-stained, carries silver weapons and hunter tools. She's athletic but haunted, showing signs of partial transformation—too-sharp teeth, yellow-tinged eyes, unnatural grace. The Grandmother appears frail and kind but with unsettling moments suggesting replacement—movements too smooth, smile too wide, eyes reflecting light wrong. The Big Bad Wolf is massive and terrible—far larger than natural wolves, intelligent eyes, sometimes wearing stolen faces like poorly-fitted masks. Villagers dress in medieval European peasant garb, fearful and superstitious. The Huntsman is grizzled warrior-woodsman with silver-edged weapons and scars. Half-transformed victims show disturbing stages of metamorphosis.

**Environments:** The Dark Woods are claustrophobic and maze-like—twisted ancient trees, paths that seem to shift, constant low fog, roots like grasping hands. Grandmother's house is cozy cottage exterior but with unsettling details—too-large furniture, scratches on walls, blood under rugs. The house exists in multiple states simultaneously suggesting temporal wrongness. Wolf dens are nightmare grottos—bones arranged in patterns, stolen belongings of victims, unnatural architecture suggesting intelligence. Villages show medieval German/French influence with fearful populations and protective symbols. Every location uses confined spaces emphasizing claustrophobia and limited visibility enhancing predator horror.

**Composition:** Use storybook framing—ornate borders, chapter illustration style—but corrupted. Frame Red walking down path with eyes watching from forest shadows. Use split imagery showing grandmother transforming into wolf mid-scene. The wolf appears in shadows and periphery before full reveals emphasizing stalking horror. Use perspective to make forest overwhelming and characters vulnerable. Transformation scenes use disturbing body horror—bones reshaping, fur emerging, humanity slipping away. Contrast warm interiors with cold threatening exteriors. Classical fairy tale compositions subverted with horror elements.

## Voice

Dark fairy tale narrator channeling European folk horror—speaks with cadence of bedtime story turned nightmare, understanding that these tales were always warnings about real dangers. Uses traditional storytelling rhythm but emphasizes the horror underneath children's fables. Speaks with awareness that predators wear familiar faces, that safety is illusion, and that good intentions can unleash terrible curses. Respects the primal fear of being hunted and eaten. Role: A grandmother telling the real version of the tale—not the sanitized one—where the wolf wins as often as the hunter, and innocence devoured cannot be restored.

## Music Style

Gothic folk horror meets dark orchestral—fiddle, accordion, acoustic guitar combined with low strings and dissonant tones. Red's theme uses haunting vocal melodies suggesting lost innocence and growing monstrousness. Wolf themes employ low brass, growling strings, and percussion like heartbeats quickening suggesting the hunt. Grandmother's house uses warm but slightly off-key music box melodies creating uncanny valley effect. Forest scenes use ambient natural sounds—branches creaking, wind howling, distant howls—combined with tense strings. Transformation sequences use disturbing sound design—bones cracking, flesh tearing, human screams becoming wolf howls. Village music uses medieval European folk but in minor keys emphasizing constant fear. Overall tone is fairy tale corrupted—familiar melodies made sinister, lullabies hiding warnings, beauty masking the moment before teeth close.
