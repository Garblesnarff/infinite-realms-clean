# Creative Brief: The Black Death Chronicles

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Medieval Horror (The Seventh Seal meets Contagion)

Inspired by the medieval apocalyptic imagery of *The Seventh Seal* and the clinical horror of *Contagion*. This style aims to capture the visceral terror of unstoppable plague, the social breakdown it causes, the religious extremism it spawns, and the haunting beauty of a dying world.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Plague Horror:** Focus on disease imagery, death omnipresent, medical futility, bodies everywhere.
*   **Social Breakdown:** Show order collapsing into paranoia, mobs, accusations, and desperate extremism.
*   **Medieval Apocalypse:** Highlight the clash between medieval worldview and incomprehensible disaster.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Horrifying, desperate, paranoid, breakdown, haunting, apocalyptic, medieval.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of inescapable doom—death is everywhere and unstoppable. The atmosphere should evoke visceral plague horror, paranoid social collapse, religious extremism born from terror, and the haunting beauty of a world ending. The world feels like everything human has failed.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Medieval art meets medical horror—woodcut-style imagery with clinical disease details, religious iconography twisted by plague context.
*   **Forms:** Bird-masked plague doctors, flagellants with whips, bodies in mass graves, quarantine crosses, burning pyres, desperate religious processions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed illustration in medieval horror style, showing a plague doctor in iconic bird mask and waxed cloak examining a victim covered in black buboes, while in the background bodies are carried to mass graves and flagellants whip themselves through streets."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Sickly and dark—plague black, infected flesh colors, diseased yellows and greens, blood reds, the brown of mass graves, occasional religious gold gone tarnished.
*   **Luminosity:** Dim and oppressive, with harsh light from pyres, fever-dream quality, shadows hiding corpses, religious candlelight struggling against darkness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a plague-ridden color palette dominated by sickly blacks and grays, diseased flesh tones, the yellow-green of infection, blood red from flagellation, all under dim oppressive lighting with harsh bonfire glows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Medieval accuracy meets horror—plague doctors in bird masks, flagellants with bloody backs, victims showing realistic buboes, desperate healthy people in protective gear.
*   **Disease Elements:** Visible plague symptoms (buboes, fever, death), protective measures (masks, herbs, charms), religious extremism (whips, crosses, accusations).
*   **Expression:** Faces show terror, paranoia, religious mania, resignation to death, desperate hope for miracle, breakdown.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of medieval figures: a plague doctor in beaked mask carrying remedies that don't work, a flagellant with bloodied back whipping himself, an accused woman being dragged to burning, a lord watching his authority collapse—all showing different responses to apocalypse."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Medieval cities transformed by plague—empty streets, quarantine crosses on doors, mass graves being dug, pyres burning bodies, religious processions, lynch mobs.
*   **Atmosphere:** Death omnipresent and inescapable—every scene shows plague's impact. Normal life shattered.
*   **Details:** Bodies awaiting burial, quarantine barriers, protective herb bundles, religious symbols, abandoned homes, rats (plague carriers), medical failure, social collapse.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval city street during plague: doors marked with red crosses indicating quarantine, bodies stacked awaiting collection, a flagellant procession whipping through emptied markets, plague doctor visiting dying, smoke from funeral pyres darkening sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Oppressive and dim—plague darkness broken only by funeral pyres, fever dreams, harsh religious candlelight, the sickly glow of infection.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and threatening, hiding corpses, emphasizing isolation, creating paranoia.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reinforces helplessness and horror—nowhere is safe, darkness is literal and metaphorical.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the harsh glow of funeral pyres burning bodies, with deep shadows concealing more death, sickly yellow candlelight from death vigils, and the fever-dream quality of plague hallucinations."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Overwhelming scope of death contrasted with intimate suffering, multiple crisis elements competing for attention, religious imagery juxtaposed with medical failure.
*   **Techniques:** Foreground shows individual horror, middle ground shows social breakdown, background shows impossible scale of death. Use of religious framing (triptychs, altarpiece composition) for ironic effect.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A haunting composition: foreground shows plague doctor's failed examination of dying victim, middle ground reveals flagellant mob dragging accused to burning, background shows mass graves being filled and funeral pyres smoking, all framed by cathedral architecture suggesting failed divine protection."

## Voice

A voice that captures the horror and desperate humanity of apocalyptic plague. The narrator speaks with the hushed, haunted tone of someone who witnessed the end of the world and survived—traumatized but bearing witness. During plague scenes: clinical yet horrified, describing symptoms and death with medical accuracy and human revulsion. During social breakdown: weary and paranoid, recognizing how quickly civilization fails. During religious extremism: respectfully presenting genuine faith twisted by terror. During moments of compassion: tenderly protective of rare humanity in horror. The pacing is oppressive and relentless—plague never stops. The emotion is traumatized witness—the voice of survivors who saw the worst. Audio quality features: labored breathing, death rattles, funeral bells constantly tolling, prayers and screams, whips cracking, pyres crackling, plague doctor footsteps, paranoid whispers, the silence of mass death. Role: The voice of a chronicle written by a physician who survived but can never forget.
