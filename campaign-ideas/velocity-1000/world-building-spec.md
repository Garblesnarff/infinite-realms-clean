### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Velocity 1000**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the 26th century, F-Zero Grand Prix is the galaxy's deadliest sport—anti-gravity racing at 1000+ km/h on tracks designed to kill. The party pilots experimental racers, competing for the championship while uncovering a conspiracy involving legendary racer deaths. They must navigate corporate sabotage, bounty hunter rivals, and Captain Falcon's vigilante justice system while pushing their bodies and machines to absolute limits.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the invention of anti-gravity technology and how it revolutionized transportation and created F-Zero racing.
    *   Write the history of the first F-Zero Grand Prix and why it became the galaxy's premier sporting event.
    *   Describe Captain Falcon's legendary championship runs and mysterious identity.
    *   Explain Black Shadow's rise from crime lord to dominant racer and his immortal nature.
    *   Detail the Galactic Federation's complex relationship with F-Zero—it's deadly but also too popular to ban.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Racing Commission** (Major): Official body governing F-Zero, struggles to balance safety with spectacle.
    *   **Galactic Federation** (Major): Government body that funds some racers as agents, uses races for political leverage.
    *   **Black Shadow Syndicate** (Major): Crime empire using F-Zero as cover for smuggling and assassination.
    *   **Independent Racers** (Minor): Freelance pilots racing for glory or survival, diverse motivations and ethics.
    *   **Corporate Sponsors** (Minor): Companies that fund racers for advertising, engage in espionage and sabotage.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Captain Falcon (legendary racer), Black Shadow (crime lord), Jody Summer (Federation agent), Samurai Goroh (bounty hunter), Dr. Stewart (doctor-racer).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Professional Racer" (various specialties), "Corporate Agent" (sponsor representatives), "Bounty Hunter" (pursuing targets), "Track Official" (race management), "Syndicate Assassin" (Black Shadow's agents).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Mute City:** Central hub metropolis with standard racing circuit, city is built around racing culture with massive screens broadcasting races.
*   **Big Blue:** Ocean planet with endless water highways, circuit runs at sea level over alien ocean, pit zones on floating platforms.
*   **Fire Field:** Active volcanic planet, track weaves through lava flows and geysers, extreme heat damages shields over time.
*   **Port Town:** Orbital space station, cylindrical track wrapping around exterior, sections pass through station interior.
*   **Death Wind:** Hurricane planet with extreme weather, wind tunnels affect machine control unpredictably.
*   **Black Shadow's Asteroid Track:** Illegal circuit through asteroid field with mines, no safety measures, designed for death racing.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A racer dies under suspicious circumstances → **THEN:** Investigation begins, other racers become paranoid, security increases.
*   **IF:** Party gains high reputation → **THEN:** Better sponsors interested, also becomes target for rivals and assassins.
*   **IF:** Energy runs critically low during race → **THEN:** Shields fail, must pit or risk death, lose positions but survive.
*   **IF:** Black Shadow's conspiracy exposed → **THEN:** Federation cracks down on racing corruption, but pushes conflict underground.
*   **IF:** Captain Falcon's identity revealed → **THEN:** Changes dynamics of all racer relationships and Federation involvement.

**7. Technology System & Power Dynamics**
*   **Anti-Gravity Generators:** Core tech enabling hovering flight, different models trade speed for stability.
*   **Energy Shield Systems:** Unified pool powers both shields and boost, management is key to survival.
*   **Boost Thrusters:** Afterburner systems provide extreme acceleration at cost of energy and control.
*   **G-Force Dampening:** Implants or cockpit systems reduce physical strain at extreme speeds, expensive upgrades.
*   **Combat Modifications:** Illegal weapons for death races—energy disruptors, mines, ramming reinforcements.

**8. Economy & Resources**
*   **Prize Money:** Massive payouts for top finishers, primary motivation for many racers.
*   **Sponsor Contracts:** Provide machines and maintenance in exchange for advertising and performance.
*   **Black Market Tech:** Illegal modifications offering advantages but risking disqualification or worse.
*   **Medical Expenses:** Healing G-force damage and injuries from crashes costs significant money.
*   **Betting Rings:** Massive gambling economy around races, manipulation attempts common.

**9. Conflict Escalation Framework**
*   **Early Game:** Learn to survive racing at extreme speeds, minor corporate sabotage, suspicious deaths investigated.
*   **Mid Game:** Corporate conspiracy deepens, Black Shadow's involvement revealed, party becomes targets, must ally with other racers.
*   **Late Game:** Illegal death race announced, Federation president's life at stake, racing and combat merge, reality-warping final confrontation.

**10. Cultural Details & Flavor**
*   **Racer Honor Code:** Despite deadly competition, racers have unspoken rules about respecting skill and mourning the dead.
*   **Speed Addiction:** Many racers become psychologically dependent on extreme velocity, struggle with "normal" life.
*   **Machine Naming:** Each racer's machine has a name reflecting personality or aspiration (Blue Falcon, Black Bull, Fire Stingray).
*   **Death Commemorations:** Fallen racers honored with memorial laps, their machines retired to hall of legends.
*   **Cybernetic Enhancement Culture:** Many racers have neural implants for faster reactions, creates class divide between enhanced and natural racers.
