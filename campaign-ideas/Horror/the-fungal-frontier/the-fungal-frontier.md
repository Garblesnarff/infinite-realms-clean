## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Fungal Frontier
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Exploration / Ecological Horror / Frontier Settlement / Myconid Society
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 18–24 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **11–12**
**Tone (keywords):** bioluminescent, alien, symbiotic, eerie, beautiful, spore-filled, frontier, ecological
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Luminous Depths are a vast underground ecosystem of bio-luminescent fungal forests, where myconid circles have achieved an advanced peaceful civilization. When a surface kingdom establishes a frontier colony to harvest valuable "glow-fungus" for medicine and profit, the delicate underground ecosystem begins to destabilize. The party, hired as frontier scouts, discovers the colony's harvesting is disrupting ancient myconid thought-networks and awakening something ancient—the Spore Sovereign, a fungal super-colony that views all non-fungal life as potential substrate. They must choose between protecting the profitable colony, preserving the alien myconid civilization, or finding a way for three kingdoms (surface, myconid, and fungal) to coexist before the entire region becomes a fungal wasteland.

## Key Locations

## Unique Mechanics

* **Spore Infection**: Track exposure to aggressive spores; transformation is slow but offers powers.
* **Telepathic Networks**: Myconid communication requires adjustment; can share thoughts but alien perspective.
* **Ecosystem Degradation**: Harvesting affects fungal forest stability; map changes as areas die or regrow aggressively.
* **Three-Way Politics**: Balancing colonial economics, myconid survival, and Spore Sovereign's expansion.
* **Bioluminescent Navigation**: Light is precious and complicated—some fungi provide light, others attack light sources.

## Central Conflict

Can three forms of civilization (human industrial, myconid peaceful-telepathic, and fungal super-colonial) coexist, or must one dominate? Is the Spore Sovereign awakening humanity's fault or natural evolution? At what point does economic interest justify ecological destruction?

## Campaign Themes

* **Colonialism and Exploitation**: Taking resources from inhabited land for profit.
* **Alien Consciousness**: Understanding truly foreign intelligence and communication.
* **Ecological Balance**: Actions have environmental consequences.
* **Transformation vs. Preservation**: Is becoming part of the ecosystem evolution or extinction?
* **Three Ways Forward**: War, coexistence, or exodus—no perfect solution.
