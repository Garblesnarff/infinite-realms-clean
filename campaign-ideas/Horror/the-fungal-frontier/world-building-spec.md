# World-Building Specification Brief: The Fungal Frontier

**Core Concept**: A frontier colony harvesting bioluminescent fungus disrupts an underground ecosystem, awakening an ancient fungal super-colony while threatening peaceful myconid civilization.

**Lore Prompts**:
* Detail myconid telepathic circle culture—peaceful, consensus-based, thought-sharing society.
* Explain the Spore Sovereign's origin—accidental consciousness from massive fungal colony.
* Describe spore infection mechanics—slow transformation offering symbiosis or consumption.
* History of the Luminous Depths ecosystem—millions of years of evolution.

**Factions**:
* **New Hope Colony**: Frontier settlement, profit-driven, increasingly desperate, led by Governor Brightwood.
* **Myconid Circle of Soft-Glow**: Peaceful fungal people, telepathic network, trying to prevent war.
* **The Spore Sovereign**: Awakening super-colony, alien intelligence, sees all life as potential substrate.
* **Colonial Companies**: Surface merchants funding expedition, care only for profit.
* **Infected Community**: Humans/myconids who embraced transformation, evangelize unity through spores.

**Key NPCs**:
* **Sovereign Mycellius**: Ancient myconid leader, telepathic, peaceful, tragic figure watching civilization threatened.
* **Governor Brightwood**: Ambitious colonial leader, descent into desperation and paranoia.
* **Spore-Prophet Grimwald**: Willingly infected, speaks for Sovereign, offers transcendence.
* **Ranger Kess**: Scout who loves the forest, internal conflict, potential romance/friendship with party.

**Locations**:
* **Luminous Forests**: Massive caverns, giant glowing mushrooms, spore-filled air, breathtaking beauty.
* **Myconid Circle**: Living architecture, thought-pools for telepathy, alien but peaceful.
* **New Hope**: Frontier town becoming fortress, showing boom-town turning desperate.
* **Harvest Zones**: Ecological scars showing destruction and dangerous regrowth.
* **Spore Cathedral**: Heart of Sovereign, where super-colony achieved consciousness.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF party supports unrestricted harvesting THEN ecosystem collapse accelerates, myconids declare war, Sovereign awakens faster.
* IF party negotiates sustainable harvesting THEN all three factions must compromise, difficult balance to maintain.
* IF party sides fully with myconids THEN colony faces economic ruin, surface kingdom may send military.
* IF Spore Sovereign fully awakens THEN region faces transformation into fungal zone, evacuation becomes necessary.
* IF party accepts transformation THEN gain powers but lose humanity, become bridges between kingdoms or threats.

**Mechanics**:
* **Spore Infection Stages**: Track exposure, progressive transformation, powers and drawbacks.
* **Telepathic Communication**: Myconid thought-sharing, alien perspective, adjustment required.
* **Ecosystem Health**: Track degradation from harvesting, affects encounters and environment.
* **Three-Way Politics**: Reputation with colony, myconids, and Sovereign determines available options.
* **Bioluminescent Environment**: Special navigation rules, some creatures attracted/repelled by light.
