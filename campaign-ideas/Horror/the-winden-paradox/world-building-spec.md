# World-Building Specification Brief: The Winden Paradox

**Core Concept:** Players investigate disappearances in Winden, discovering time travel caves creating 33-year loops (1986-2019-2053). Families are interconnected through bootstrap paradoxes. They're trying to prevent an apocalypse but may be causing it. The campaign explores determinism—whether free will exists if the future is fixed.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Winden nuclear plant accident in 1986 and its connection to time travel.
*   Sic Mundus secret society manipulating time across centuries.
*   The God Particle—unstable energy allowing time travel but requiring massive power.
*   Bootstrap paradoxes where people are their own ancestors and events cause themselves.

**Factions:**
*   **Sic Mundus Creatus Est:** Secret society believing the apocalypse must happen, led by Adam.
*   **The Travelers:** Individuals using time travel to prevent apocalypse, led by Claudia.
*   **The Plant Workers:** Nuclear plant employees covering up disasters.

**Locations:**
*   **The Cave System:** Network with time door, 33-year jumps.
*   **Nuclear Plant:** Source of apocalypse, God Particle chamber.
*   **The Bunker:** Experimental site, where children were tested.
*   **2053 Ruins:** Post-apocalyptic wasteland, survivors in ruins.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF players prevent a death in 1986, THEN their own parents never meet, erasing them from existence.
*   IF players destroy the time machine early, THEN they're trapped in wrong timeline, unable to return.
*   IF players learn too many paradoxes, THEN sanity fractures, unable to distinguish present from other times.
