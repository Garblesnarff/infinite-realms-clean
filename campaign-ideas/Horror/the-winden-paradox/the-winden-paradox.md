# The Winden Paradox

*A Time Loop / Mystery campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Winden Paradox
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Travel Mystery / Psychological Horror / Family Drama
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** determinism vs free will, bootstrap paradoxes, family connections across time, nuclear horror, "the beginning is the end"
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party lives in Winden, a small town built around a nuclear power plant, where children have been disappearing for decades. They discover a cave system that creates stable time loops—allowing travel to 1986 and 2053. As they investigate, they realize their families are interconnected across three time periods through predestination paradoxes, and they themselves may be causing the very tragedies they're trying to prevent. The apocalypse is coming, and it might be unavoidable.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is rare. The real threats are temporal paradoxes, moral choices, and unraveling sanity.
*   **Investigation:** Extremely complex. Players must track family trees across three time periods, recognize younger/older versions of NPCs, and piece together bootstrap paradoxes.
*   **Consequences:** Actions in one time period have permanent effects on others. Preventing tragedies might cause worse outcomes. Determinism may be inescapable.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc exploring determinism and time loops.

*   **Act I — The Missing Children (Sessions 1–5):** Children disappear in Winden. The party investigates, discovers the cave system creates 33-year time loops (1986, 2019, 2053). They travel to 1986, meeting younger versions of their parents and uncovering the nuclear plant's secrets.
*   **Act II — The Knot (Sessions 6–10):** The party realizes families are connected through bootstrap paradoxes—people are their own ancestors, events cause themselves. They travel to 2053, discovering an apocalypse occurred in 2020. They're trying to prevent it but may be causing it.
*   **Act III — The Origin (Sessions 11–15):** The party discovers a second time travel device, the Origin—which exists outside the loops. They must choose: accept determinism and let the apocalypse happen, or attempt to destroy the Origin and erase themselves from existence to prevent all suffering.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Sessions 1–5: The Missing Children
*   Children disappear from Winden. Investigation reveals the nuclear plant and a cave system with a door labeled "Sic Mundus Creatus Est" (Thus the world was created).
*   The party discovers time travel passages—33-year intervals. They travel to 1986, meeting their parents as teenagers.
*   They learn about a secret society (Sic Mundus) manipulating time to prevent/cause an apocalypse.

### Sessions 6–10: The Knot
*   The party realizes their families are impossibly intertwined—characters are their own ancestors, creating bootstrap paradoxes.
*   They travel to 2053, seeing Winden destroyed by nuclear fire. Survivors live in ruins.
*   Every attempt to change events seems to ensure they happen. Determinism feels inescapable.

### Sessions 11–15: The Origin
*   They discover Adam—the leader of Sic Mundus, who claims the apocalypse must happen to maintain existence itself.
*   The party finds the Origin—a device that can destroy the time loop and prevent everything, but it will erase everyone in the loop from existence.
*   Final choice: Let the apocalypse happen (preserving themselves but dooming the world), or destroy the Origin (saving the world but ceasing to exist).

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **determinism versus free will**. Can the party break the cycle, or are they doomed to repeat it? Every action to prevent tragedy seems to cause it. The campaign explores whether choice matters if the future is fixed, and whether existence is worth the suffering it causes.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Time Period Tracking**
*   Actions in 1986, 2019, and 2053 affect each other. DM tracks consequences across timelines.

### 2. **Family Tree Paradoxes**
*   NPCs are younger/older versions of each other. Players must recognize them despite age changes.

### 3. **Bootstrap Objects**
*   Some items exist in causal loops—no clear origin. Finding and using them correctly is key.

### 4. **The Apocalypse Clock**
*   Countdown to June 27, 2020. Player actions advance or delay it, but may not prevent it.

### 5. **Sanity Checks**
*   Understanding paradoxes and time loops strains the mind. High insight comes with madness risks.
