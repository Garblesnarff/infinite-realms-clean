---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Seven Days Remain
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Cursed Artifact / Investigation / Vengeful Spirit / Time Limit Horror
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **8**
**Tone (keywords):** cursed media, spreading curse, ticking clock, investigative, vengeful spirit, dread
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party discovers a cursed magical scroll that shows those who read it a vision of their own death—in exactly seven days. The curse is a manifestation of a murdered girl's rage, seeking revenge against those who wronged her. Now the party has one week to uncover her story, find her remains, put her spirit to rest, and break the curse—while also dealing with the moral dilemma that "curing" themselves may require passing the curse to someone else. The clock is ticking, and each sunset brings them closer to the terrifying vision coming true.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Time Pressure:** The seven-day deadline is absolute. Each session represents approximately one day. Poor time management means death.
*   **Investigation Focus:** Combat is rare. Success requires research, interviewing witnesses, and following clues.
*   **Moral Dilemma:** The easiest way to survive is passing the curse to someone else—but is that acceptable?
*   **The Spirit:** Sadako (the vengeful spirit) can only be defeated by resolving her grudge, not through violence.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A race against time across three acts, each representing roughly two days.

*   **Act I — The Curse (Sessions 1–2, Days 1–2):** The party reads the cursed scroll, experiences the vision, and has seven days to live. They research the curse and learn it's a spreading vengeance from a murdered girl named Sadako. They must find her story.
*   **Act II — The Investigation (Sessions 3–5, Days 3–5):** The party follows clues to Sadako's origin: a psychic who was murdered 30 years ago and thrown into a well. They uncover a conspiracy of those who killed her. But time is running out, and the temptation to just pass the curse to someone else grows.
*   **Act III — The Reckoning (Sessions 6–8, Days 6–7):** The party must find Sadako's well, retrieve her remains, and put her to rest before the seventh day ends. Or they must face the terrible choice of passing the curse to innocents. The final session takes place over the 24 hours of day seven, with Sadako manifesting to claim her victims.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Scroll" (Day 1)
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Curse Triggered
*   **Key Events:** The party finds an ancient scroll in a library/dungeon. Reading it shows each character a vision of their death in seven days—each death involves a ghostly girl with long black hair crawling toward them. They have seven days.
*   **Escalation:** Research reveals this is a spreading curse. Those who've read it have all died exactly seven days later. The only survivors are those who copied and showed it to someone else.

### Session 2 — "The Investigation Begins" (Day 2)
*   **Focus:** Research / First Clues
*   **Key Events:** The party investigates previous victims. They find a pattern: all victims had a connection to a psychic girl named Sadako who disappeared 30 years ago. They find her surviving mother.
*   **Escalation:** Sadako's mother reveals she was murdered, but claims not to know where the body is. She's lying. Also, the first character starts experiencing the curse's effects: visions, nightmares.

### Session 3 — "Secrets and Lies" (Day 3)
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Witnesses
*   **Key Events:** The party tracks down people who knew Sadako. They discover she had powerful psychic abilities that frightened people. A group of locals conspired to kill her to "protect" the town.
*   **Escalation:** One of the murderers is still alive. They can reveal the location of the well where Sadako was thrown, but they're terrified of retribution.

### Session 4 — "The Well" (Day 4)
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Horror
*   **Key Events:** The party finds the sealed well. Opening it releases a wave of psychic trauma. Inside are Sadako's remains and evidence of her horrible death—thrown in alive and left to die.
*   **Escalation:** Retrieving the remains doesn't break the curse immediately. They must also appease her spirit. Also, the fourth day means they're past the halfway point. Desperation sets in.

### Session 5 — "The Temptation" (Day 5)
*   **Focus:** Moral Dilemma / Social
*   **Key Events:** The party learns the "easy" solution: show the cursed scroll to someone else. That person becomes cursed instead, creating a chain. Some cursed individuals they meet have done this, passing their doom to innocents.
*   **Escalation:** The party must decide: pass the curse or find a true solution. Time is running short. Arguments erupt.

### Session 6 — "The Ritual" (Day 6)
*   **Focus:** Preparation / Lore
*   **Key Events:** Through research and questioning spirits, the party learns how to appease Sadako: her story must be told publicly, those responsible must be brought to justice (or confess), and she must be given a proper burial.
*   **Escalation:** Some steps require time the party doesn't have. They must choose which steps they can accomplish in the remaining time.

### Session 7 — "The Seventh Day" (Day 7 - First Half)
*   **Focus:** Execution / Time Pressure
*   **Key Events:** The final day. The party races to complete the ritual: burying Sadako's remains in hallowed ground, forcing or convincing the murderer to confess, and telling her story to break the cycle.
*   **Escalation:** Sadako begins manifesting even before the deadline. Ghostly omens intensify. Party members see her in reflections, hear her in wells.

### Session 8 — "The Moment of Truth" (Day 7 - Final Hours)
*   **Focus:** Climax / Moral Resolution
*   **Multiple Endings:**
    *   **Appeasement:** The party successfully completes the ritual. Sadako's spirit is laid to rest. The curse breaks. They survive.
    *   **Passing It On:** The party shows the scroll to others, saving themselves but dooming innocents. They live with guilt.
    *   **Failure:** The seventh day ends. Sadako manifests and kills those who failed to appease her or pass the curse. Deaths match the visions.
    *   **Sacrifice:** One party member willingly accepts the curse for all others, then attempts to break it alone through heroic action or self-sacrifice.

2.  **Shizuko Yamamura** — *Sadako's Mother*

    *   **Personality:** Grief-stricken, protecting her daughter's secret, guilt-ridden.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between survival and morality. The curse offers an easy out: pass it to someone else. But doing so makes you complicit in murder. The party must choose whether to take the hard road—uncovering the truth, appeasing a justifiably angry spirit—or the easy road of condemning others to save themselves. It's a race against time where the clock represents not just death but the erosion of ethics under pressure.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Seven-Day Countdown**
*   Each session represents roughly one in-game day (some sessions may cover more).
*   The DM tracks the countdown openly. Sunset each day should be dramatic.
*   At certain milestones (Day 4, Day 6, Day 7 Morning), the curse intensifies with visions and manifestations.

### 2. **The Vision**
*   Each cursed character has seen exactly how they'll die: Sadako crawling toward them. The details are specific and terrifying.
*   As the deadline approaches, they experience previews: seeing her in mirrors, hearing her approach, feeling water when there is none.

### 3. **Curse Spread Mechanics**
*   Characters can create a copy of the scroll and show it to someone else, passing the curse.
*   This saves the character but curses the new victim. The DM should make the moral weight clear.

### 4. **Investigation Clues**
*   Success requires following a chain of clues: records, witnesses, locations.
*   Poor investigation means missing critical information and failing to break the curse.

### 5. **Sadako's Manifestation**
*   Sadako cannot be fought traditionally. She's a spirit of pure vengeance.
*   She manifests more strongly as the deadline approaches and can be warded temporarily but not defeated through violence.
*   Only appeasing her through justice and proper burial can stop her.
