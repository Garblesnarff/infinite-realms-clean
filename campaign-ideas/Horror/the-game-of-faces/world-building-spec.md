# The Game of Faces - World-Building Specification

## The Organization

**Global Network:** Death games operate in multiple planes/continents. Funded by ultra-wealthy elite across kingdoms. Protected by political connections and extreme secrecy. Centuries old, evolved from gladiatorial entertainment.

**Hierarchy:**
- The Board: Shadowy investors (retired monarchs, merchant princes, crime lords)
- VIPs: Ultra-wealthy participants (annual membership millions)
- Front Man: Facility operator (previous winner recruited/coerced)
- Guards: Recruited from desperate poor (hierarchy: shapes determine rank)
- Players: Debt-ridden desperate people, invited by recruiters

**Facility Details:**
- Isolated island prison complex repurposed
- Self-sufficient (power, food, crematorium)
- Advanced surveillance technology
- Medical facility (for guards, not players)
- Secret organ harvesting operation
- Hidden escape routes and tunnels
- VIP accommodation wing (luxury contrast)

## VIP Culture

**Annual Event:** Death games are prestigious invitation-only event. VIPs wear animal masks (maintain mystery). Each VIP has betting account (millions wagered). Can request "special events" for extra fee.

**Activities:**
- Watch games from luxury boxes
- Bet on outcomes, specific deaths, alliances
- Hunt players in special midnight events
- Purchase survivors as servants
- Network with other wealthy elite
- Decadent parties during player suffering

**Protection:** Political connections shield from consequences. Evidence destroyed systematically. Witnesses eliminated. Previous winners either recruited or silenced.

## Guard System

**Recruitment:** Desperate people offered guard positions. Better than being a player (safety, payment). Strict hierarchy enforced brutally. Speaking or showing face: instant death.

**Roles:**
- Workers (circles): Prepare meals, clean, body disposal
- Soldiers (triangles): Armed enforcement, executions
- Managers (squares): Supervise, report to Front Man

**Corruption:** Secret organ harvesting ring among some guards. Selling player organs on black market. Front Man unaware (mostly). Leverage opportunity for players.

## Previous Games History

**Decades of Operation:** Games running for 30+ years in this facility. Hundreds of previous games globally. Only one winner per game typically. Winners either: recruited as staff, paid off and monitored, or eliminated if they investigate.

**Notable Previous Games:**
- Year of Rebellion (players nearly overthrew facility)
- Year of Mercy (final two refused to fight, both executed)
- Year of Massacre (lone player killed 80+ others in riots)
- Year of Exposure (journalist infiltrated, killed before publishing)

## The Prize Money Mechanics

**Accumulation:** 100,000 gold per dead player. Starts at 45.6 million (456 players). Displayed in giant suspended piggy bank (visible to players). Psychological manipulation: watching it grow.

**The Truth:** Money is real, can be claimed. But winners are monitored forever. Organization can reclaim money if winner problematic. Some winners "robbed" soon after. Others "suicided" mysteriously. True freedom never granted.

## Post-Game Consequences

**Winner's Curse:** Survivor's guilt cripples most winners. Many commit suicide within year. Some become alcoholics/addicts. Few investigate organization (usually eliminated). Some recruited as VIPs or guards.

**Cover Story:** Players officially missing, never found. Families receive no closure. Bodies cremated, scattered at sea. Perfect crime, repeated hundreds of times.

**The Cycle:** New games every year. Recruitment ongoing. Waiting list of desperate people. Organization grows wealthier. No external pressure to stop.

This world provides both the visceral horror of deadly games and the systemic critique of wealth inequality, creating a campaign that's both action-packed and thematically rich.
