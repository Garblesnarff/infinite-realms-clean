### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Spiral of Uzumaki**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The coastal town of Kurozu-cho is cursed by an obsession with spirals—a cosmic pattern asserting itself through reality. The party investigates strange transformations and discovers the town is built on a massive geological spiral formation that acts as an antenna for this fundamental pattern of existence. As the curse intensifies, people transform into spiral shapes, architecture warps, and physics breaks down. The party must resist growing obsession while seeking escape, knowing the spiral is patient, inevitable, and transforming them slowly into living art.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the geological spiral beneath Kurozu-cho: an impossibly perfect natural formation that shouldn't exist, predating humanity.
    *   Chronicle past manifestations: the curse appears cyclically over centuries, each time consuming the town before fading, then returning.
    *   Explain the nature of the spiral as a cosmic pattern: it's not conscious or malevolent, but a fundamental structure of reality asserting itself.
    *   Describe the stages of spiral obsession: fascination, collection, creation, transformation, transcendence.
    *   Detail various transformations: snail-people (slow, harmless), twisted ones (aggressive, weaponized bodies), fully consumed (living spiral patterns, beyond human).
    *   Explain why some resist longer than others: strong will, lack of pattern recognition, or simple luck.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Investigators (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Understand the curse, escape the town, resist transformation.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None. United by circumstance.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Solve the mystery, help townspeople.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each character may be hiding their growing obsession from others.
        *   **Assets:** Outside perspective, resistance to obsession (initially), determination.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with resistant townspeople; opposed by the spiral (impersonally); increasingly alienated from each other as obsessions grow.
    *   **The Spiral** (Major - Cosmic Force)
        *   **Goals:** None. It simply manifests. It is pattern becoming real.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Not applicable. It's a force, not an organization.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The spiral doesn't scheme. It transforms. It is inevitable.
        *   **Assets:** Reality manipulation within the town, inevitability, patient manifestation, psychological appeal.
        *   **Relationships:** Affects all life and matter in the town; indifferent to resistance; eternal.
    *   **The Obsessed** (Minor - Fluid)
        *   **Goals:** Embrace the spiral, create spiral art, undergo transformation, achieve "perfection."
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure. Those further transformed gain influence through others' fascination.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Share the beauty of the spiral.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None. They're beyond secrets, having embraced the pattern completely.
        *   **Assets:** Fearlessness, transformed bodies with unusual abilities, disturbing persuasiveness.
        *   **Relationships:** They welcome others into transformation; hostile to those who resist aggressively; protective of spiral formations.
    *   **The Resistant** (Minor - Declining)
        *   **Goals:** Escape, survive, maintain sanity and human form.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Informal leadership by the most determined.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Warn newcomers, seek escape routes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some are already showing early obsession and hiding it. Some plan to sacrifice others to buy time.
        *   **Assets:** Human intelligence, desperation, local knowledge.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with the party initially; fracturing under pressure; losing members to transformation daily.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Kirie Goshima:** Townswoman documenting the curse, increasingly desperate, slowly developing obsession.
    *   **Shuichi Saito:** Paranoid young man who recognized the curse early, trying desperately to flee but unable to leave.
    *   **Mr. Goshima:** Kirie's father, a potter who was the first to fully embrace the spiral, now completely transformed.
    *   **The Lighthouse Keeper:** Elderly guardian of an old lighthouse, has resisted for decades through isolation, knows the town's history.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Early Obsessed" (collecting snails, drawing spirals, spinning)
    *   "Snail Person" (slow, docile, transformed into human-snail hybrid)
    *   "Twisted One" (aggressive, body weaponized through spiral transformation)
    *   "Fully Consumed" (living spiral pattern, beautiful and terrible, beyond communication)
    *   "Resistant Fighter" (still human, desperate, willing to do anything to escape)
    *   "Spiral Evangelist" (partially transformed, tries to convince others to embrace the pattern)

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Kurozu-cho (General Town):** Coastal Japanese town being consumed.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Main street (spiraling), beach (spiral wave patterns), school, hospital, pottery district.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Mix of obsessed, transformed, and resistant people.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Decreasing as vendors transform. Spiral art everywhere (dangerous to examine).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Witnessing transformation, spiral patterns appearing spontaneously, being offered spiral gifts, meeting transformed people, reality warping near heavy spiral concentrations.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The lighthouse keeper knows the history." "People who try to leave end up walking in circles back to town." "The spiral formation goes deeper than anyone's measured."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Spiral patterns everywhere, transformed people, architecture twisting), Sound (Ocean waves in spiral rhythms, spinning, bone grinding), Smell (Salt air, pottery clay, slime trails).
    *   **The Lighthouse:** Old stone structure with infamous spiral staircase.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The spiral staircase, observation deck, keeper's quarters, journal collection.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The elderly keeper, possibly some taking refuge.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Historical information, temporary safety, view of the town's spiral layout.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Obsession triggered by staircase, finding historical records, lighthouse keeper's warnings, transformed person trying to climb, staircase warping reality.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The staircase has driven people mad before." "The keeper has resisted by avoiding all spirals." "From the top, you can see the town is arranged in a spiral."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Stone spiral stairs, ocean view, dust), Sound (Wind, waves, creaking stairs), Smell (Salt, stone, age).
    *   **The Spiral House:** A building transforming into non-Euclidean space.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Entrance (normal), interior (impossible spiral geometry), center (compression point).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Fully transformed individuals at the center, trapped victims in corridors.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is a death trap. But also contains evidence.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Corridors that loop, gravity based on spiral patterns, encountering compressed corpses, rooms larger inside than outside, time dilation.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The center compresses all matter into spirals." "Someone who entered found a way to the underground formation." "The house is alive and hungry."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Spiraling walls, impossible angles, compressed bodies), Sound (House breathing, distant screams, silence), Smell (Dust, something organic, ozone).
    *   **The Geological Spiral (Underground):** Massive natural formation beneath the town.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Entrance tunnel, spiraling descent, chambers filled with spiral crystals, the perfect center.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Fully transformed beings, living spiral patterns, the most concentrated manifestation.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** The truth, potential disruption point, transformation (for those who embrace it).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Instant transformation upon seeing the center, physics breaking down, living spiral entities, echoes of past victims, choice between resistance and acceptance.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The center is perfect and terrible." "Disrupting it could destroy the town." "Some who reach it achieve transcendence."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Perfect spirals in rock, impossible geometry, light bending), Sound (Reality humming, silence that presses), Smell (Stone, age, something beyond description).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A character reaches 5+ Obsession points.
    *   **THEN:** Generate their first visible transformation: spiral pattern on skin, enhanced flexibility, spiral pupils. They experience this as oddly pleasant.
    *   **IF:** A character examines spiral patterns closely or creates spiral art.
    *   **THEN:** Wisdom save. Failure grants Obsession but also grants temporary insight or calm. Success resists but the patterns become more appealing.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to leave town.
    *   **THEN:** Roads curve back to town, paths loop, compass spins. Generate frustrating encounters where they think they're leaving but end up at town center.
    *   **IF:** A character reaches 10+ Obsession.
    *   **THEN:** Full transformation begins. Generate a scene where they must choose: resist (painful, requires help) or embrace (blissful, lose character control).
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to disrupt the geological spiral.
    *   **THEN:** Catastrophic consequences. Earthquakes, reality tears, mass transformations. The spiral fights back through physics itself.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully escapes before 10 Obsession.
    *   **THEN:** They escape but carry residual obsession. Generate lingering effects: seeing spirals in patterns, occasional compulsions, dreams of the spiral.
    *   **IF:** A character fully embraces transformation voluntarily.
    *   **THEN:** They transform completely, losing player control but achieving a form of transcendence. Generate a final scene from their perspective: becoming one with the eternal pattern, beautiful and terrible.
