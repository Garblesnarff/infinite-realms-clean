The players are members of a minor noble house thrust into the deadly game of thrones, where they must forge alliances, betray enemies, and navigate court politics while an ancient evil awakens beyond the frozen northern wall. Dragons, thought extinct for centuries, have returned. Meanwhile, in the frozen wastes, the White Walkers march south with an army of the dead.

## Story Arc (Very Long Campaign — 30–40 sessions)

A multi-generational epic of politics, war, and the return of ancient magic.

*   **Act I — The Death of Kings (Sessions 1–8):** The old king dies under suspicious circumstances, and his Hand is murdered. The players' house is drawn into the conflict as various claimants emerge. They must choose sides, navigate court intrigue, and survive assassination attempts while learning the rules of the game.
*   **Act II — The War of Five Kings (Sessions 9–18):** Open warfare erupts as multiple factions claim the throne. The players must lead troops, forge alliances through marriage and treaty, and deal with betrayals. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, a exiled princess hatches three dragon eggs, and beyond the Wall, dark omens multiply.
*   **Act III — Dragons and Debts (Sessions 19–26):** The war has bled the kingdoms dry. New powers emerge—a religious fanatic movement, the return of dragons, and reports of the dead walking. The players must consolidate power while preparing for threats they barely understand. Winter begins to fall in earnest.
*   **Act IV — The Long Night (Sessions 27–35):** The White Walkers breach the Wall with an army of undead. Former enemies must unite or perish. The players lead the defense of the living, wielding ancient weapons and dragon fire against an unstoppable force.
*   **Act V — A Dream of Spring (Sessions 36–40):** With the White Walkers defeated (or the living destroyed), the survivors must rebuild. The Iron Throne is contested one final time. The players determine the future of the realm—will they bring peace, become tyrants, or watch as it all burns?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the cost of power and the question: "What is worth fighting for when everything you love is threatened?" It is a story about the futility of political games in the face of existential threats, and the tragedy that humans will fight each other even as the world ends. The central tension is between multiple conflicts: the game of thrones (who rules), the war for survival (against the White Walkers), and the return of magic (dragons and ancient powers). Players must navigate all three or perish.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Game of Thrones** (Intrigue System)
*   Characters accumulate Influence with different factions (The Crown, The North, The Faith, etc.).
*   Decisions made in court require Intrigue checks (Persuasion, Deception, Insight) with consequences for failure.
*   Players can sponsor rumors, arrange marriages, take hostages, and execute plots between sessions.
*   Betrayals are mechanically encouraged—players can gain advantage by breaking oaths, but NPCs remember.

### 2. **Winter is Coming** (Seasonal Doom Clock)
*   A countdown represents winter's approach and the White Walkers' southern march.
*   Every few sessions, winter advances—resources become scarce, travel becomes difficult, undead sightings increase.
*   If players don't prepare for winter while fighting political wars, thousands die from starvation and cold before the undead even arrive.

### 3. **Dragon Rider Bonding**
*   If players gain access to dragons (through Daenerys's alliance or finding eggs), they can bond with them through a dangerous ritual.
*   Dragon riders gain immense power but must make Wisdom saves to avoid megalomania.
*   Dragons are intelligent and temperamental—they are not mounts but partners who may refuse commands.

### 4. **Mass Combat: Armies and Sieges**
*   Warfare uses streamlined mass combat where players command units, make strategic choices, and fight champions.
*   Resources (gold, troops, supplies) must be managed between battles.
*   Victories and defeats have permanent consequences—lost troops don't respawn, and burned castles stay burned.

### 5. **Permadeath and Legacy**
*   Character death is a real possibility, especially from political betrayals or war.
*   Players can create backup characters from their house—siblings, cousins, or newly recruited allies.
*   Dead characters leave legacies (good or bad) that affect their successors' relationships and opportunities.
