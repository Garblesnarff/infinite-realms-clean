# The Tall Man's Proxy: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: Found Footage Horror**
The campaign embodies the visual language of amateur documentaries, corrupted security footage, and liminal forest photography. Everything feels like it was captured on camera—slightly too real, uncomfortably ordinary until it's not.

**Color Palette:**
- **Forest Green** (#2C5F2D): Dense woods, oppressive nature
- **Corrupted Black** (#0A0A0A): The Tall Man, static, void
- **Static Gray** (#808080): Video artifacts, distortion
- **Blood Red** (#8B0000): Nosebleeds, danger markers
- **Pale White** (#FFFFFF): Tall Man's blank face, Proxy masks
- **Security Camera Blue** (#1E3A5F): Night vision, footage aesthetic

**Lighting:** Naturalistic but wrong—daylight in forests feels too dim, flashlights create harsh contrast, security cameras show too much shadow

## Music and Sound Design

**Musical Themes:**
- **Main Theme**: Distorted static building into dissonant strings
- **Proxy Theme**: Industrial percussion, footsteps, breathing
- **Forest Theme**: Natural ambience corrupted by electronic interference
- **Tall Man Theme**: Absence of music, replaced by pure static

**Sound Design:**
- Constant low-level static hum when Tall Man is near
- VHS tracking sounds, corrupted audio
- Forest ambience: Too quiet, occasional unnatural sounds
- Proxy sounds: Mechanical twitching, labored breathing, whispered Operator symbols

**Voice Direction:**
- **Sheriff Torres**: Exhausted authority, Midwestern accent
- **Dr. Kast**: Manic energy, German accent, rapid speech
- **Overseer**: Digitally distorted, paranoid edge
- **Proxies**: Monotone, glitching, repetitive
- **The Tall Man**: White noise, static, no voice (communicates through compulsion)

## Cinematic Moments

**The First Sighting**: Tall figure visible only when camera pans, gone when looked at directly
**Memory Gap**: Scene repeats with contradictions, party realizes hours missing
**Proxification**: First-person view of party member's conversion, losing control
**Static Storm**: Reality glitches violently, Tall Man walking through walls
**The Forest Calls**: Trees moving to block escape, paths rearranging
**Final Confrontation**: Depending on ending, Tall Man fully manifests or dissipates

**Marketing Tagline**: "He watches from the trees. He calls through the static. Soon, you will serve."
