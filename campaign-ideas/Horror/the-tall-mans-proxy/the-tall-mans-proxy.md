# The Tall Man's Proxy
**"He watches from the trees. He calls through the static. Soon, you will serve."**

## Campaign Overview

The party arrives in the small town of Ashgrove Crossing to investigate a series of disturbing disappearances. Children's drawings in the local school show a tall, faceless figure in the forest. Security cameras capture impossible static patterns. Witnesses report memory loss and nosebleeds. The town is in the grip of something ancient and hungry—the Slender Man, an entity that exists in the peripheral vision and incomplete memories of humanity.

As the investigation deepens, the party discovers a conspiracy of Proxies—normal people driven mad and enslaved by the Tall Man's influence. These Proxies hunt and mark new victims, preparing them for the Tall Man's collection. The party must navigate a web of paranoia, information warfare, and psychological horror while fighting their own increasing exposure to the Tall Man's memetic presence. Every piece of evidence they gather makes them more visible to him. Every video they watch brings them closer to becoming Proxies themselves.

The campaign escalates from investigation to survival to resistance. The party learns of The Collective—an underground network fighting the Tall Man—and must decide whether to flee, fight, or succumb. The Tall Man doesn't kill quickly. He corrupts slowly, stealing memories, identity, and will until nothing remains but perfect obedience. In the end, the party must confront the impossible question: how do you kill something that exists in the act of observing it?

## Core Themes

- **Observation as Danger**: The more you learn, the more you're at risk
- **Paranoia and Trust**: Anyone could be a Proxy
- **Memory and Identity**: Losing yourself to compulsion
- **Information Warfare**: Knowledge is both weapon and curse
- **Childhood Innocence Corrupted**: The Operator symbol, child victims

## Unique Mechanics

**Slender Sickness Progression**
- **Exposure Points**: Gained by seeing Tall Man, watching recordings, entering marked areas
- **Stage 1 (1-10 points)**: Minor symptoms—headaches, paranoia, deja vu
- **Stage 2 (11-25 points)**: Moderate symptoms—nosebleeds, memory gaps, nightmares
- **Stage 3 (26-40 points)**: Severe symptoms—compulsions, hallucinations, behavioral changes
- **Stage 4 (41+ points)**: Proxification—player loses character control, becomes NPC Proxy

**Operator Symbol Protection**
- Drawing/carving symbols provides temporary immunity
- Must be precise: Wrong symbols attract Tall Man
- Degradation: Symbols lose power over time, must be refreshed
- Side effect: Using symbols increases long-term exposure
- Double-edged sword: Protection now, vulnerability later

**Memory Mechanics**
- Party members may lose memories of encounters
- DM controls what they forget (notes passed secretly)
- Contradictory memories create paranoia
- Can be restored through recordings or hypnosis
- Permanent memory loss at high exposure

**Peripheral Vision System**
- Tall Man can only be seen in peripheral vision
- Looking directly causes him to vanish
- Mechanical advantage: Partial vision grants preparation but stress
- Looking through cameras/recordings allows safe observation
- But watching recordings increases exposure

**Proxy Identification**
- Behavioral tells: Twitching, repetitive phrases, memory issues, nosebleeds
- Social deduction challenges to identify hidden Proxies
- Proxies may not know they're Proxies (sleeper agents)
- Insight checks vs. Deception to identify
- False positives possible: Paranoia can lead to friendly fire

**Static World**
- When Tall Man is near, reality glitches
- Audio distortion, visual artifacts, time skips
- Mechanical effect: Random environmental changes, disorientation
- Can be detected: White noise generators alert to presence
- Used strategically: Party can induce static to track him

**Information Hazard**
- Every clue discovered increases exposure
- Creating paradox: Must learn to fight but learning makes you vulnerable
- Choice: Research and risk Proxification or remain ignorant and helpless
- Certain knowledge is "memetic hazard" requiring saving throw to process

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Town Knows**
- Ashgrove has been dealing with Tall Man for generations
- Founded as containment zone, population are knowing wardens
- Missing children are sacrifices to keep Tall Man localized
- Party's investigation threatens balance

**Twist 2: You've Been Proxied**
- Reveal that party member has been Proxy since session 1
- All "investigation" has been feeding info to Tall Man
- Player was unaware (sleeper programming)
- Can fight programming or embrace it

**Twist 3: The Collective Made Him Worse**
- Original Tall Man was minor tulpa
- Collective's resistance spread awareness, making him stronger
- Fighting him feeds him; ignorance would starve him
- Heroes are actually villains

**Twist 4: The Children Aren't Victims**
- Missing children are in Operator's Forest, safe and happy
- They chose to go; Tall Man offers escape from abuse/trauma
- Proxies are protecting children from "rescue"
- Moral grayness: Who are the real monsters?

**Twist 5: The Tall Man Is Multiple Entities**
- Different cultures have different Tall Men
- They're competing for territory/victims
- Party has been playing them against each other unknowingly
- Final battle: Make them destroy each other

**Twist 6: He's Already Won**
- Everyone in campaign is already Proxied
- Entire investigation is shared hallucination
- Party must achieve enlightenment to realize and break free
- Ultimate cosmic horror: No objective reality
