## Causality Chains

**100,000 Years Ago**: Tidal Sovereign tried to drown world, was imprisoned in Leviathan Throne

**50 Years Ago**: Earthquake damages prison slightly, unnoticed

**10 Years Ago**: Dr. Deepwater's deep ocean research accidentally weakens prison further

**1 Year Ago**: Cult discovers prison, intentionally damages it more

**6 Months Ago**: Sea level rise begins, initially small

**3 Months Ago**: Rising accelerates, coastal flooding

**Campaign Start**: Major cities drowning, 200 feet rise

**Month 1-2**: Continued rise, mass evacuations, cult emerges

**Month 3-4**: Mountains becoming islands, prison investigation

**Month 5-6**: Final peaks flooding, Sovereign nearly free, apocalypse or salvation

## Additional Lore

### The Tidal Sovereign
- **Nature**: Primordial water elemental, embodiment of ocean
- **Motivation**: Believes world should be water, land is aberration
- **Morality**: Not evil, just alien perspective
- **Power**: Controls all water, can raise sea levels at will
- **Intelligence**: Sentient, can communicate, doesn't understand land life
- **History**: Imprisoned for attempting previous flood

### The Previous Floods
This has happened before. Sunken kingdoms found underwater were victims of earlier flood cycles. Each time Sovereign escapes partially, floods world, is re-imprisoned. Cycle repeats every 100,000 years. This time is worst yet.

### Merfolk Politics
Ocean natives are divided. Some see surface dwellers as invaders who pollute ocean, deserve drowning. Others are sympathetic, remember when their ancestors were surface dwellers who adapted. King Pelagius torn between factions.

### Alternative Solutions
1. **Repair Prison**: Requires ritual, sacrifices, powerful magic, Sovereign stays imprisoned
2. **Negotiation**: Convince Sovereign to lower waters in exchange for ocean sanctuaries
3. **Adaptation**: Accept oceanic world, build floating cities, underwater habitats, new civilization
4. **Destruction**: Kill Sovereign (nearly impossible, removes water from world—desert apocalypse)
5. **Merger**: Party member becomes living seal, controls Sovereign through willpower
6. **Relocation**: Open portal, send Sovereign to elemental plane of water

### Endings
- **Waters Recede**: Prison repaired, Sovereign contained, slow return to normal
- **New Balance**: Negotiated settlement, permanent partial flood, mixed land/water world
- **Oceanic World**: Total failure, scattered survivors on floating cities
- **The Guardian**: Hero becomes eternal warden, merges with prison
- **Desert World**: Sovereign killed, all water gone, opposite apocalypse
