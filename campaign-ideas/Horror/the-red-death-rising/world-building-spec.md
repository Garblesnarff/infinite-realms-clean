# The Red Death Rising - World-Building Specification

## Factions

**The Healers' Conclave**: Medical professionals led by Dr. Vita Healer, researching cure, treating infected, heroes working to exhaustion and death

**The Military Quarantine**: General Quarantine's forces, enforce lockdowns, burn infected zones, authoritarian "necessary evil"

**The Death Cult**: Worshippers of Blood Titan, believe plague is divine, intentionally spread it, led by Death Prophet (undead cleric immune to disease)

**Safe Zone Councils**: Paranoid uninfected communities, refuse entry to anyone, violent enforcement, survival at any cost

**The Infected**: Millions suffering, dying, desperate, some mad from Titan's whispers, some heroes helping others

**Immune Survivors**: Those naturally resistant (rare), valuable for cure research, hunted by desperate infected

## NPCs

Dr. Vita Healer (lead researcher, secretly infected), General Quarantine (ruthless commander), Death Prophet (cult leader, undead), Sister Mercy (dying healer, inspiration), Artificer Remedy (protective gear inventor), Patient Zero's Family (grieving, guilty), The Blood Titan (disease entity, ancient hunger)

## Locations

**Port Meridian**: Origin city, mass grave, quarantined wasteland, ghostly

**The Lazaret**: Massive quarantine hospital, overcrowded, understaffed, tragic

**Dr. Healer's Lab**: Fortified research facility, only hope

**Safe Zones**: Gated communities, paranoid, armed guards, turn away infected

**Blood Titan's Prison**: Underground tumor-cavern, diseased architecture, body horror environment

## Disease Mechanics

**The Red Death Symptoms**:
- Stage 1 (0-24 hrs): Fever, headache, asymptomatic carrier
- Stage 2 (24-48 hrs): Red lesions, internal bleeding, highly contagious
- Stage 3 (48-72 hrs): Organ failure, hemorrhaging, 95% fatal
- Stage 4 (rare): Titan possession, madness, plague spreader

**Transmission**: Airborne, contact, bodily fluids, magical aura from infected

**Protection**: Masks, gloves, distance, magical wards, immunity ritual (dark cost)

## The Blood Titan

Ancient disease incarnate, imprisoned 10,000 years ago. Feeds on suffering, death, decay. Semi-sentient collective consciousness of all plague throughout history. Prison damaged, seeping into world through weak points. Each infected strengthens it. Goal: Consume all life, transform world into diseased realm. Can be negotiated with but alien morality.

## Cure Components

1. Blood of immune individual
2. Essence from Titan's prison
3. Rare alchemical compounds (mandrake, unicorn horn, etc.)
4. Divine magic (blessing from plague god's opposite)
5. Sacrifice (someone must carry plague's burden)
