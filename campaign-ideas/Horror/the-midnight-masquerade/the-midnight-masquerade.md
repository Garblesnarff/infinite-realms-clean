## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Midnight Masquerade
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Fairy Tale / Temporal Heist / Social Horror
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** time limit horror, transformation magic, servitude and freedom, false identity, midnight deadline, glass prison, fairy godmother's price, masquerade deception
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Fairy Godmother's magic isn't kindness but a predatory contract—she transforms the desperate into perfect servants who infiltrate noble houses during enchanted balls that exist outside time, then extracts payment at midnight by claiming their transformed selves permanently. The party, investigating nobles who vanish at exactly midnight during masquerade balls, discovers "Cinderella" is the name of the Godmother's most successful infiltrator who's been running the scheme for decades, and that the glass slippers are tracking devices binding victims to the temporal loop. They must navigate balls where time doesn't flow normally, servants are transformed prisoners, and midnight means becoming the Godmother's property forever unless they can break a contract written in wishes and desperation.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act heist thriller wrapped in fairy tale horror of contracts and transformation.

*   **Act I — The Vanishing Nobles (Sessions 1–4):** High society is terrified—nobles attending masquerade balls vanish at midnight, last seen dancing perfectly with mysterious partners. The party investigates the pattern and encounters "Ella," a charming servant who seems too refined for her station. They attend their first enchanted ball where time flows strangely and servants are eerily perfect. They discover glass slippers left behind at midnight crime scenes and learn about the Fairy Godmother's "benevolent" reputation.

*   **Act II — The Godmother's Gift (Sessions 5–8):** They meet the Fairy Godmother who seems genuinely helpful, offering to solve problems through magic transformation. Investigation reveals she's been "helping" desperate people for centuries—transforming ash-covered servants into nobles for one night. But victims sign contracts in desperation, and the fine print claims their transformed selves as payment at midnight. Cinderella is revealed as the Godmother's agent who identifies perfect targets and recruits new victims. The balls exist in temporal bubbles—what seems like hours are minutes, or vice versa.

*   **Act III — The Glass Prison (Sessions 9–12):** They discover the glass slippers are prison-anchors—at midnight, victims transform back but their beautiful selves are extracted and imprisoned in glass. The Godmother uses these captured identities as servants in her timeless realm, running future infiltrations. Previous "Cinderellas" exist trapped in glass slippers throughout noble houses, aware but unable to communicate. The stepmother and stepsisters were actually previous victims who tried to resist and became cautionary tales. The current Cinderella wants freedom but is too deep in contract debt to escape.

*   **Act IV — Breaking the Clock (Sessions 13–16):** The party must infiltrate the Godmother's Midnight Ballroom—the nexus where all temporal balls connect—and break the master contract. They navigate competing objectives: save current victims (who might not want to lose their beautiful transformations), free imprisoned identities (destroying the glass might kill them), stop the Godmother (who claims she genuinely helps the desperate), or find Cinderella's redemption (she's both victim and perpetrator). The midnight deadline approaches for a grand ball where the Godmother plans mass harvesting. Success requires playing by fairy contract rules while finding loopholes—and deciding if freedom without beauty is worth the price.

## Central Conflict

Freedom versus beauty and the price of transformation. The Fairy Godmother genuinely provides what people request—one night of beauty and belonging—but exploits desperation by making the cost their transformed identity forever. Victims must choose between remaining ash-covered servants with agency or becoming beautiful prisoners without freedom. Cinderella represents how victims can become perpetrators to survive exploitation. The party must decide whether eliminating the Godmother's "help" is worth condemning the desperate to lives without hope, if transformation is worth identity loss, and whether contract law can be ethical when one party is desperate.
