### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Midnight Masquerade**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When nobles vanish at exactly midnight during masquerade balls, the party—investigating the temporal crimes—discovers the Fairy Godmother's "benevolent" transformations are predatory contracts that extract victims' beautiful identities at midnight and imprison them in glass slippers, with "Cinderella" as her chief recruiter running infiltration schemes for decades through enchanted balls existing outside normal time.

*   **The Ash House** - Servant quarters showing poverty that makes transformation appealing
*   **The Midnight Ballroom** - Godmother's realm where all balls connect across time
*   **The Glass Gallery** - Storage of slipper-prisons containing hundreds of trapped identities
*   **Prince's Palace** - Noble court unknowingly hosting enchanted infiltrations
*   **The Pumpkin Patch** - Gateway to Godmother's realm, strongest transformation magic
*   **The Clock Tower** - Manifestation of midnight showing all timelines simultaneously
*   **The Contract Chamber** - Where desperate people sign binding fairy law agreements
*   Each location represents different stages of transformation, exploitation, and temporal manipulation

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF midnight strikes while transformed THEN beautiful identity is extracted and imprisoned
*   IF glass slippers are broken carelessly THEN trapped identities may die
*   IF transformation is refused THEN victims remain in poverty and servitude
*   IF contract loopholes are found THEN escape is possible but Godmother adapts terms
*   IF Fairy Godmother is killed THEN all transformations reverse simultaneously (chaotic)
*   IF temporal bubbles collapse THEN time debt must be paid causing rapid aging
*   IF victims become addicted to beauty THEN they'll sign worse contracts for more
*   IF Cinderella is freed from debt THEN recruitment network collapses
*   IF Prince Charming learns the truth THEN court politics shift dramatically
*   IF stepfamily's curse is broken THEN powerful allies are gained
*   IF all imprisoned identities are freed THEN Godmother's power weakens significantly
*   IF transformation magic is exposed publicly THEN desperate people might still choose it
*   IF midnight deadline is defeated THEN fundamental contract terms are challenged
*   IF new Godmother arises THEN cycle continues under different management
*   IF party accepts transformation THEN they risk becoming new Cinderellas
