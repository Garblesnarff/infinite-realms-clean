*   **Moral Ambiguity:** V's methods are extreme. Players must grapple with whether ends justify means.
*   **Investigation:** Uncovering the regime's secrets and V's past drives the narrative.
*   **Asymmetric Warfare:** The party fights a much more powerful enemy through guerrilla tactics.

## Central Conflict

Freedom versus security, violence versus peace, individual versus society. The campaign asks: How far is too far in fighting oppression? Can violence create freedom? What replaces tyranny—democracy or chaos? Are ideas truly bulletproof?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Public Opinion**
*   Track the populace's support for resistance versus regime. Propaganda and actions shift this.

### 2. **The Symbol**
*   V's mask becomes a symbol. As more wear it, the movement grows but also becomes less controlled.

### 3. **Surveillance State**
*   Regime's monitoring means players must avoid detection, use codes, maintain covers.

### 4. **Asymmetric Combat**
*   Direct confrontation with regime forces is suicide. Players must use guerrilla tactics, sabotage, information warfare.

### 5. **Moral Choices**
*   Regular decisions about violence, collateral damage, and whether methods justify ends. These affect the ending available.
