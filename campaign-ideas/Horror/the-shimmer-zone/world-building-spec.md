# World-Building Specification Brief: The Shimmer Zone

**Core Concept:** A reality-warping alien entity called the Shimmer has appeared, mutating everything inside. Party must reach the epicenter to understand and stop it while resisting transformation.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Shimmer: appeared 6 months ago, expanding 1 mile per month.
*   The Source: an alien entity from beyond reality, crashed/arrived here, unintentionally rewriting reality.
*   Previous expeditions: 12 sent, none returned. Military has quarantined the area.
*   Mutation process: cellular-level rewriting, creates hybrids and duplicates.
*   The Lighthouse: crystalline structure at epicenter, housing the Source.

**Factions:**
*   **The Expedition** (Major): Party and Dr. Ven, seeking answers.
*   **The Military** (Minor): Quarantine enforcers, considering drastic measures (bombing the zone).
*   **The Shimmer/Source** (Major "Antagonist"): Not hostile, just incomprehensible and transformative.

**NPCs (Tier 1):**
*   The Source: Alien entity, geometry and light, incomprehensible.
*   Dr. Cassia Ven: Expedition leader, actually a Shimmer duplicate.
*   Kane: Previous expedition leader, merged with forest.
*   The Party's Duplicates: Near-identical copies with altered minds.

**Locations:**
*   **The Border:** Prismatic wall, military checkpoint.
*   **Changed Forest:** Mutated but navigable.
*   **Research Outpost Gamma:** Abandoned, full of journals.
*   **Deep Zone:** Time unstable, reality fractured.
*   **The Lighthouse:** Crystalline spire, the Source within.

**Causality Chains:**
*   IF party destroys Source: Shimmer collapses, but massive energy release may kill them or cause wider damage.
*   IF party communicates with Source: Can negotiate its departure, but must accept transformation (Mutation 7+).
*   IF party flees: Mission failed, Shimmer continues expanding, party forever mutated.
*   IF Mutation reaches 10: PC transcends humanity, becomes NPC with alien perspective.
*   IF party kills duplicates: Existential crisis—were we the originals?
*   IF party fully explores: Discovers Source is lonely, trying to understand reality through refraction.
