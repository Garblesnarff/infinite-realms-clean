# The Shattered Sky
*Reality tears. Planes collide. The multiverse bleeds through.*

## Campaign Overview

The sky cracked open above the capital city of Spirereach two months ago. A massive rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire appeared, raining flame and summoning fire elementals. Before mages could seal it, three more rifts opened across the continent—to the Abyss, the Feywild, and the Far Realm. Now rifts are opening daily: Portals to other planes, dimensions, realities. The Material Plane's boundaries are failing.

The cause: The Planar Keystone, an ancient artifact maintaining the separation between planes, has been shattered. Its pieces scattered across multiple dimensions. Without it, planes are bleeding together. Fire elementals walk streets, demons invade farms, fey steal children, aberrations corrupt minds. Geography makes no sense—cities exist in multiple realities simultaneously. Time flows differently in different areas. Gravity reverses. Reality itself is coming apart.

The party must navigate an increasingly surreal world, seal rifts where possible, journey through multiple planes to gather Keystone fragments, and reassemble it before planes merge completely into chaotic omniverse where nothing can survive.

## Core Themes

- **Reality Breakdown**: Physics stops making sense, impossible things happen
- **Planar Invasion**: Creatures from other dimensions flooding in
- **Multidimensional Chaos**: Same location exists in multiple realities
- **Cosmic Horror**: Things beyond understanding entering world
- **Planar Travel**: Journey through wildly different dimensions
- **Existential Threat**: Not just death but erasure from reality

## Session Breakdown (26-34 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The First Tears (Sessions 1-6)
**Sessions 1-2**: Campaign opens as rift opens above city. Fire rains down, elementals emerge. Evacuate civilians, fight invaders. Rift sealed by powerful mages—exhausting. Then another opens. And another. Introduction to planar rifts, environmental hazards from mixed realities.

**Sessions 3-4**: Investigation reveals pattern: Rifts opening faster, lasting longer, growing larger. Archmage Council explains: Planar Keystone is shattered, barriers failing. Must find fragments. First fragment detected nearby—in pocket dimension overlapping city. Journey through warped reality to retrieve it.

**Sessions 5-6**: Retrieve first fragment. Learn each fragment exists in different plane. Must journey to: Elemental Planes, Feywild, Shadowfell, Abyss, Far Realm, etc. Meanwhile, rifts multiply. Demons invade countryside. Reality stable areas shrinking.

### Arc 2: Between Worlds (Sessions 7-16)
**Sessions 7-10**: Journey to Elemental Plane of Air for second fragment. Navigate impossible storms, floating islands, sentient winds. Air elementals hostile—blame Material Plane for invasions. Must convince or fight. Retrieve fragment from ancient elemental vault.

**Sessions 11-13**: Return to find Feywild bleeding into Material Plane. Forests become enchanted overnight, time flows wrong, fey courts appear. Party must enter Feywild for third fragment. Navigate fey politics, trickery, time distortion. Days pass as minutes, minutes as years.

**Sessions 14-16**: Reality zones forming: Areas where Material Plane overlaps with others. The Burning Quarter (overlap with fire plane), The Shadow District (Shadowfell), The Dream Streets (Far Realm). Society adapting to new normal, governments struggling, cults worshipping invasions.

### Arc 3: The Planar War (Sessions 17-26)
**Sessions 17-20**: Military mobilizes against planar invaders. Demons, devils, elementals, aberrations, all entering through rifts. Party must help war effort while seeking fragments. Journey to Abyss for fragment—most dangerous yet. Navigate demonic layers, avoid corruption, deal with demon lords.

**Sessions 21-23**: Discover shocking truth: Keystone was shattered intentionally. Reality Cult believes planes should merge, creating "higher existence." They're actively preventing reconstruction, hunting fragments, trying to destroy them. Led by Void Prophet who has Far Realm insight.

**Sessions 24-26**: Race against cult to final fragments. Journey to Far Realm—sanity-blasting nightmare dimension. Lovecraftian horror, reality doesn't work, madness everywhere. Retrieve fragment but party member might be corrupted. Meanwhile, planes nearly merged—reality breaking down everywhere.

### Arc 4: The Omniversal Convergence (Sessions 27-34)
**Sessions 27-29**: Reality critical mass. Multiple planes occupying same space. You can step from Material to Feywild to Shadowfell in single street. Time meaningless. Physics suggestions. Population going mad. Cult attempting to destroy remaining fragments.

**Sessions 30-32**: Gather all fragments, prepare reconstruction ritual. Requires planetary-scale magic, sacrifices, and perfect timing. Cult launches assault, demons want chaos to continue, elementals divided. Multi-faction battle across collapsing realities.

**Sessions 33-34**: Activate reconstruction ritual while defending it. Reality warps around ritual site. Boss fight against Void Prophet and Far Realm entity he's channeling. Multiple endings: Success—Keystone reforms, planes separate, reality heals. Partial—Some planes permanently merged but stable. Failure—Omniversal chaos, reality soup.

## Key NPCs

**Archmage Prismara** (Elf Planar Expert) - Knows Keystone lore, guides party
**General Bulwark** (Dwarf Commander) - Leads defense against invasions
**Void Prophet** (Human Warlock) - Cult leader, wants plane merger, insane wisdom
**Elementari** (Elemental Noble) - Represents elemental courts, complex ally
**Feyqueen Twilight** (Archfey) - Feywild ruler, trickster, has fragment
**Lord Abyssal** (Demon Lord) - Controls fragment in Abyss, powerful enemy
**Reality Refugee** (Planar Native) - Creatures displaced, seeking help

## Major Locations

**Spirereach** (Capital City) - First rift site, becoming multi-planar nightmare city
**Reality Zones** - Areas where planes overlap permanently, surreal environments
**The Burning Quarter** - Overlap with Fire Plane, always burning
**Shadow District** - Shadowfell overlap, eternal twilight, undead
**Dream Streets** - Far Realm overlap, sanity-blasting, impossible geometry
**Elemental Planes** - Classic elemental environments, fragment locations
**The Feywild** - Enchanted forest, fey courts, time distortion
**The Abyss** - Demonic chaos, infinite layers, horror
**The Far Realm** - Lovecraftian dimension, madness incarnate

## Unique Mechanics

**Planar Bleeding**: Reality unstable, random planar effects
**Rift Events**: Portals open randomly, invasion encounters
**Sanity System**: Far Realm exposure causes madness
**Time Distortion**: Different flow in different areas
**Physics Anomalies**: Gravity, matter, energy behave strangely
**Multidimensional Navigation**: Same place, multiple realities
**Fragment Resonance**: Gathering fragments makes rifts worse initially
**Reality Anchors**: Safe zones maintaining stability

## Plot Twists

- **Keystone Shattered Intentionally** by Reality Cult
- **Some Invasions Are Refugees** fleeing worse threats
- **Void Prophet Partially Right** about cosmic evolution
- **Reassembling Keystone** might trap displaced beings cruelly
- **Party Member Corrupted** by Far Realm exposure
- **Original Keystone Creators** were tyrants forcing separation

## Victory Conditions

**Optimal Victory**: Keystone repaired, planes separate cleanly, displaced beings sent home safely
**Heroic Victory**: Planes separated but scars remain, permanent reality zones
**Compromise Victory**: Some planes merge into stable mixed reality
**Sacrifice Victory**: Party member becomes living Keystone, eternal duty

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: Complete planar convergence, reality soup, nothing makes sense
**Partial Defeat**: Material Plane destroyed but other planes survive
**Cult Victory**: Void Prophet creates "higher reality" (madness for all)
**Fragmentation**: Planes splinter infinitely, multiverse shattered beyond repair
