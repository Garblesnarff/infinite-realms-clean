## The Void Prophet's Philosophy

He's not entirely wrong—Keystone was created by ancient tyrants who forced planar separation for power. Natural state might be more fluid. But complete merger creates chaos nothing survives. His Far Realm corruption makes him unable to see middle ground.

## Endings

**Separated**: Planes cleanly divided, Keystone whole, displaced beings returned
**Mixed**: Some reality zones permanent, new multicultural civilization
**Chaos**: Total merger, reality meaningless, survival impossible
**New Keystone**: Reformed with better design, allows controlled interaction
**Living Keystone**: Hero becomes eternal maintainer of barriers
