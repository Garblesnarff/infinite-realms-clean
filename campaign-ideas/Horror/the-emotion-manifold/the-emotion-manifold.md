# The Emotion Manifold

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Abstract Expressionist Fantasy / Psychological Horror / Pure Feeling
- **Estimated Length**: 8-12 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 7-14
- **Tone**: Intense, Raw, Overwhelming, Cathartic, Terrifying

### Core Premise
The Emotion Manifold is a dimension where emotions exist as pure form and color divorced from thought or narrative. There are no objects, creatures, or landscapes - only fields of color representing feeling, shapes that embody psychological states, and gestures frozen in painted motion. The party doesn't arrive physically but psychically - their consciousness pulled into this abstract realm during a magical trauma. To escape, they must traverse their own emotional landscape made literal, confront repressed feelings manifested as color fields and violent brushstrokes, and reach the Center of Catharsis where pure expression can shatter the prison. Each PC experiences a different manifold based on their psyche.

### Core Themes
- **Emotion as Pure Form**: Feelings exist without narrative, color without objects
- **Psychological Confrontation**: Face repressed emotions made physically real
- **Gestural Violence**: Action painting as combat, expression as weapon
- **Color Field Navigation**: Navigate purely by emotional tone, not geography
- **The Impossibility of Communication**: Each PC in their own emotional reality

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Shattering (Sessions 1-3)**
A psychic catastrophe pulls party consciousness into the Manifold. Each PC finds themselves alone in abstract space corresponding to their dominant emotion. Must learn to navigate color fields (red anger zones burn, blue melancholy zones slow, yellow anxiety zones fracture perception). Discover they can communicate through Gestural Expression - painting/sculpting emotional messages into the void. Realize they must reach the Center of Catharsis together despite being in separate emotional realities.

**Act 2: The Emotional Journey (Sessions 4-9)**
Each PC must traverse their personal manifold, confronting emotional memories manifested as abstract forms: a purple field of shame from childhood, black drips of despair from loss, wild red slashes of suppressed anger. Other PCs can see these as abstract paintings but must interpret and help. Collaborative emotional therapy through Abstract Expressionism. Each PC has a core psychological trauma to confront.

**Act 3: The Center of Catharsis (Sessions 10-11)**
All emotional paths converge. The Center is white space - absence of emotion, potential for all expression. Here they confront the Blank Canvas, an entity of pure unexpressed feeling that absorbed them. Boss fight is collaborative emotional expression - party must paint their feelings together in synchronized gestural combat, creating unified artwork that shatters the Canvas and frees them.

**Act 4: The Return (Session 12)**
Escaping back to physical reality, but changed. Each PC has confronted deep psychological truth. Bonus: can now manifest small emotional effects (anger as red light, sadness as blue aura, etc.). Stronger for having faced abstract selves.

### Major NPCs
- **The Blank Canvas**: Absorbing entity, unexpressed trauma given form
- **Color Field Entities**: Pure emotions as zones (The Red Rage, The Blue Sorrow, The Yellow Fear)
- **Gestural Echoes**: Past actions frozen as brushstrokes, replaying emotional moments
- **The White Silence**: Absence of feeling, peace or death depending on perspective
- **Fragment Selves**: Parts of PCs' psyches split into abstract forms

### Key Locations

- **White Catharsis Center**: Blank space of potential expression

### Unique Mechanics
- **Emotional Navigation**: Move through color fields representing feelings, not physical space

- **Psychological Damage**: HP represents emotional integrity, not physical health
- **Cathartic Combat**: Attacks are expressive gestures - angry slashes, sad washes, fearful splatters

### Victory/Defeat Conditions
Victory: Unite in synchronized emotional expression to shatter Blank Canvas. Defeat: Lose emotional integrity, absorbed into Canvas as unexpressed feeling forever.
