# World-Building Specification Brief: Releasing Control Art

**Core Concept:** Players work for Hellsing Organization—Britain's vampire hunting agency wielding Alucard, Dracula himself, as weapon. When Nazi group Millennium invades with vampire army, apocalyptic war erupts. Alucard releases restriction levels, becoming eldritch horror. Vatican fanatics join. The campaign is gothic ultraviolence—monsters fighting monsters while humanity barely survives collateral damage.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Hellsing family history—how they defeated and enslaved Dracula using Van Helsing's methods.
*   Control Art Restriction System—seals limiting Alucard's power, released by Integra's command.
*   Millennium's creation—Nazi vampire experiments during WW2, the Major's war philosophy.
*   Vatican Section XIII Iscariot—Catholic assassins using holy magic and regeneration science.

**Factions:**
*   **Hellsing Organization:** British vampire hunters, control Alucard, serve Crown, pragmatic and ruthless.
*   **Millennium:** Nazi vampire army, worship war as art, led by the Major, desire apocalypse.
*   **Vatican Iscariot:** Catholic fanatic assassins, view vampires as abominations, Anderson leads.
*   **The Round Table:** British elite secretly funding Hellsing, political maneuvering.

**Locations:**
*   **Hellsing Manor:** Victorian mansion, Alucard's basement prison, frequently besieged.
*   **London:** Becomes apocalyptic battlefield during Millennium invasion.
*   **Vatican City:** Catholic military headquarters, houses Iscariot operations.
*   **Millennium Zeppelins:** Floating Nazi fortress carrying vampire army.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF Alucard releases all restrictions, THEN he becomes Dracula again—nearly unstoppable eldritch entity.
*   IF Anderson uses Nail of Helena, THEN he transforms into monster himself, losing humanity.
*   IF Millennium isn't stopped, THEN London falls and war spreads globally.
*   IF Integra dies, THEN Alucard's control breaks and he becomes true threat.
