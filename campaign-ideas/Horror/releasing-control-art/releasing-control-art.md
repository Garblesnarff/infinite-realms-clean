**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party works for the Hellsing Organization—Britain's secret vampire hunting agency led by the iron-willed Integra Hellsing. Their ultimate weapon is Alucard, a vampire so powerful he's bored by combat and craves a worthy opponent. When a Nazi organization called Millennium returns with an army of artificial vampires, the party must help defend Britain while Alucard gradually releases his Control Art Restriction System, unleashing his true monstrous power. It's a story about monsters fighting monsters, and whether humanity can survive being saved by one.

*   **Investigation:** Tracking ancient vampire cults, Nazi conspiracy networks, and supernatural threats.
*   **Consequences:** Civilian casualties are massive. The party witnesses apocalyptic violence they can barely survive.
