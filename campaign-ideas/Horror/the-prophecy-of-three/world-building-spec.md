### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Prophecy of Three**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The galaxy is torn by war between three factions: Terran Dominion (human military expansionists), Swarm Collective (ravenous biomass hivemind), and Protectorate (ancient psionic warriors). An ancient prophecy speaks of three champions who must unite to stop Dark Archons—extradimensional beings returning to unmake reality. The party serves one faction initially but discovers they are the prophesied heroes, forcing them to forge impossible alliances between eternal enemies to prevent galactic extinction.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Xel'Naga—ancient precursor race that created Terrans, Swarm, and Protectorate as experiments.
    *   Write the history of the Eternal Conflict between the three races spanning centuries.
    *   Describe the first Dark Archon War when Xel'Naga fell to corruption and nearly destroyed reality.
    *   Explain how the Prophecy of Three was encoded in ancient temples by the last uncorrupted Xel'Naga.
    *   Detail each faction's discovery of space travel and expansion across the galaxy.
