---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Redline Grand Prix
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Insane Racing / Space Opera / No-Rules Competition
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **6** → Finish **14**
**Tone (keywords):** no rules, deadliest race, exploding planets, bioweapons, pure insanity, style over substance, magnificent bastards
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
REDLINE is the universe's most dangerous and illegal racing event—held once every five years on a planet that's guaranteed to be destroyed by the end. The party are wildcard racers who qualified through the preliminary "Yellowline" race using absurdly customized vehicles that barely qualify as legal anywhere. Now they must race against cyborg champions, military bioweapons, mafia-backed killers, and reality-warping technology across a hostile alien world where the local government is literally trying to blow up the track with orbital weapons while the race is happening. There are no rules. Only one guarantee: this will be absolutely insane.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions)

A three-act arc of increasingly impossible racing and spectacular chaos.

*   **Act I — Yellowline Qualifiers (Sessions 1-6):** The party enters Yellowline—the preliminary race to qualify for REDLINE. They build ridiculous racing machines, compete against skilled lunatics, and survive multiple attempts at cheating, sabotage, and murder. They barely qualify through a combination of skill, luck, and sheer audacity. They're introduced to REDLINE's legendary racers and learn the host planet this year is Roboworld—whose totalitarian government has banned the race and will try to kill all participants.
*   **Act II — Roboworld Preparation (Sessions 7-12):** The party arrives on Roboworld where the hostile government deploys military forces to prevent the race. They must upgrade vehicles, sabotage rivals, avoid assassination attempts, and navigate the planet's criminal underground. They discover Roboworld's government has a secret bioweapon program and plans to destroy the entire race with orbital strikes. Rival racers become reluctant allies when survival is at stake.
*   **Act III — REDLINE Race (Sessions 13-18):** The actual REDLINE race is three laps of absolute chaos across Roboworld while the government tries to kill everyone. The track includes: active war zones, biological weapon release zones, collapsing megastructures, and orbital bombardment. The party must race at impossible speeds while the planet literally explodes around them, making split-second alliances with rivals, and ultimately confronting the truth: REDLINE's organizers knew about the weapons and chose this planet anyway for the spectacle.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of freedom vs. control, spectacle vs. safety, pure passion, and whether some thrills are worth dying for. It asks: What would you risk for glory? Is freedom worth chaos? Can you maintain integrity in a no-rules environment? The central conflict pits the racers' passion for speed against literally everything trying to kill them.
