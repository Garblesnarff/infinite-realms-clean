# Creative Brief: The Wendigo Hunger

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Arctic Horror Realism

Inspired by the brutal beauty and terror of the frozen wilderness, blending stark winter landscapes with body horror and spiritual corruption. This style captures the isolation of endless winter, the desperation of starvation, and the monstrous transformation of the Wendigo curse.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Cold and Isolation:** Describe endless snow, ice, and the oppressive emptiness of winter wilderness.
*   **Contrast Beauty and Horror:** The pristine white snow hides blood, bones, and corruption. Beautiful winter scenes with horrific elements.
*   **Focus on Transformation:** Show the gradual corruption from human to monster—gaunt frames, ice-covered skin, inhuman hunger.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Hunger, isolation, winter, possession, cannibalism, corruption, primal, frozen, desperate, transforming.
*   **Feeling:** Constant cold that seeps into bones. The atmosphere should be beautiful yet hostile, with an underlying current of starvation and desperation. Civilization is a fragile shell against overwhelming nature and inner darkness.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic with sharp, angular forms for ice and harsh winter elements. Human forms become increasingly skeletal and distorted as Wendigo corruption progresses.
*   **Forms:** Snow drifts, frozen trees, log fortifications, emaciated human figures, and the Wendigo itself—an impossibly tall, skeletal creature covered in ice and frost.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic digital painting of a remote wooden fort surrounded by endless snow. The buildings are half-buried in drifts, and icicles hang from every surface. The scene is beautiful but utterly isolated and hostile."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by whites, pale blues, and grays. Occasional pops of color from firelight (warm orange), blood (stark red against white), and the sickly blue-green of Wendigo corruption.
*   **Atmosphere:** Cold, sharp, and unforgiving. Even firelight seems weak against the overwhelming whiteness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a stark color palette of whites and pale blues, with the warm glow of firelight from windows providing small islands of color. A trail of dark red blood stands out against pristine snow, leading into the dark forest."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are bundled in winter gear (furs, heavy coats, scarves) that makes them look bulky and anonymous. As starvation sets in, they become visibly thinner.
*   **Wendigo Transformation Stages:**
    *   Early: Gaunt face, hollow eyes, skin taking on a bluish tint
    *   Middle: Skeletal frame visible, fingernails becoming claw-like, frost forming on skin and breath
    *   Late: Elongated limbs, exposed ribs, ice crystals growing from flesh, glowing pale eyes, monstrous hunger visible in expression
    *   Full Wendigo: 12-15 feet tall, skeletal frame covered in ice and frozen flesh, impossibly long limbs, antler-like growths from skull, heart visible as a glowing frozen mass in chest cavity
*   **Prompt Example:** "A person in the middle stages of Wendigo corruption. They wear tattered furs and their face is gaunt and skeletal. Their skin has a bluish tint with frost forming at the edges. Their eyes are wide with hunger and beginning to glow faintly. Their hands have elongated into claw-like appendages."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Endless winter wilderness: snow-covered forests of bare trees, frozen lakes, blizzard conditions reducing visibility, and the small human structures trying to hold against the cold.
*   **Atmosphere:** Vast, empty, and merciless. The wilderness dwarfs human presence.
*   **Details:** Snow drifts hiding dangers, frozen corpses partially visible, tracks in snow (both human and inhuman), northern lights in the night sky, frost patterns on windows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A scene of the frozen northern wilderness. Bare, skeletal trees are covered in snow and ice. The ground is an unbroken expanse of white. In the distance, barely visible through falling snow, is a massive, impossibly tall figure with elongated limbs moving between the trees. The scene is both beautiful and terrifying."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh lighting from snow reflection during day creates high contrast. Nighttime scenes use moonlight reflecting off snow, firelight from the fort, and the eerie glow of Wendigo eyes.
*   **Shadows:** Sharp and dark, especially from figures against snow. The Wendigo casts impossibly long shadows.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the harsh environment and creates dramatic reveals of horror elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by pale moonlight reflecting off the snow, creating an almost daylight brightness but with deep shadows. The scene is illuminated in silvery blue tones. Two glowing pale eyes peer from the darkness of the forest, casting no light but visible nonetheless."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses vast, empty spaces to emphasize isolation. Characters are small against huge landscapes. The Wendigo is framed to emphasize its unnatural height and skeletal proportions.
*   **Techniques:** Use the emptiness of snow fields to create negative space. Frame the fort as a small point of light in vast darkness. Show the Wendigo from low angles to emphasize its towering presence.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of a lone figure trudging through deep snow, dwarfed by the endless white landscape and dark forest. In the far background, barely visible, a towering skeletal silhouette stands among the trees, watching. The composition emphasizes the figure's vulnerability and isolation."

## Voice

A raspy, hollow male voice with a northern/Canadian regional accent, speaking in labored breaths as if weakened by cold and hunger. The pacing is slow and halting, with long pauses as if conserving energy. The emotion is one of deep exhaustion mixed with growing dread and a barely-controlled hunger. Audio quality has a slight echo and the sound of wind, as if recorded in a cold, empty space. Role: A survivor on the edge of starvation, fighting the growing temptation of the Wendigo's corruption.
