## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A survival horror descent into desperation, cannibalism, and spiritual possession.

*   **Act I — Snowbound (Sessions 1–4):** The players arrive at Fort Winterhold just as a catastrophic blizzard cuts the settlement off from the outside world. Food stores are mysteriously destroyed, hunting parties disappear, and the first signs of the Wendigo appear—mutilated corpses and inhuman tracks in the snow.
*   **Act II — The Spreading Hunger (Sessions 5–9):** As starvation sets in, the Wendigo's influence grows. The players must hunt for food, ration supplies, and identify who among the survivors is possessed. Trust breaks down as paranoia spreads and some survivors resort to cannibalism—which only strengthens the Wendigo's power.
*   **Act III — The Frozen Heart (Sessions 10–15):** The players discover the Wendigo's origin: a cursed shaman who consumed his own tribe centuries ago. To destroy it, they must venture into the heart of the frozen wilderness to the site of the original sin and perform a purification ritual—all while resisting the corruption within themselves.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Wendigo** — *The Eternal Hunger*
    *   **Role:** An ancient evil spirit that possesses those who commit cannibalism or are driven to extreme starvation.
    *   **Personality:** Not a single entity but a force of corruption. When it manifests physically, it's a towering, skeletal figure with ice-covered bones, elongated limbs, and a frozen heart. It speaks through its victims.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Wendigo is the cursed remnant of a shaman who consumed his entire tribe. It cannot be killed permanently while its frozen heart remains intact in the ancient burial site.

2.  **Elder Miksa** — *The Keeper of Stories*
    *   **Role:** The fort's oldest resident, a keeper of indigenous lore and traditions.
    *   **Personality:** Wise, cautious, and deeply afraid. She knows the old stories about the Wendigo and the taboo against cannibalism.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her grandfather was one of the last people to face a Wendigo outbreak. She possesses a ritual to fight it but requires the players' help and a terrible sacrifice.

3.  **Bjorn Ironhand** — *The Commander*
    *   **Role:** The fort's military commander, responsible for keeping order and ensuring survival.
    *   **Personality:** Practical, stern, and increasingly ruthless as the situation deteriorates. He will make hard choices to ensure the majority survives.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is one of the first to be possessed but hides it well, using his authority to isolate victims and feed the growing hunger.

4.  **Sasha Brightclaw** — *The Hunter*
    *   **Role:** The fort's best tracker and survivalist, desperately trying to find food for the community.
    *   **Personality:** Brave, resourceful, and fiercely independent. She refuses to give up hope.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is carrying a dark secret—during a past winter, she survived by eating her dead companions. The Wendigo's presence is awakening those memories.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival, corruption, and the thin line between civilization and savagery. The central conflict is both external (surviving the winter and the Wendigo) and internal (resisting the corruption of desperation and hunger). The players must make impossible choices: do they maintain their humanity and risk starvation, or do they cross moral lines to survive?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Hunger and Starvation**
*   The DM tracks **Hunger Levels** for each character on a scale of 0-10.
*   Every day without adequate food, Hunger increases by 1 (more if engaging in strenuous activity).
*   At Hunger 5+, characters suffer disadvantage on physical checks. At Hunger 8+, they gain a level of exhaustion.
*   At Hunger 10, a character must make a **Wisdom saving throw** or be tempted to commit cannibalism. Failing this save and consuming human flesh attracts the Wendigo's possession.

### 2. **Wendigo Corruption**
*   Characters who commit cannibalism or witness it without intervening accumulate **Corruption Points**.
*   Corruption is tracked secretly by the DM. At certain thresholds, the character begins to transform:
    *   **3 Points:** Strange hungers, nightmares, hearing whispers in the wind.
    *   **5 Points:** Physical changes—gaunt appearance, cold skin, unusual strength.
    *   **7 Points:** Partial possession—the player must make saves to resist the Wendigo's control during stressful moments.
    *   **10 Points:** Full transformation into a Wendigo thrall—the character becomes an NPC under the DM's control.

### 3. **Winter Survival**
*   The harsh environment is as much an enemy as the Wendigo. Players must manage:
    *   **Food supplies** (rationing, hunting, foraging in deadly conditions)
    *   **Warmth** (maintaining fires, avoiding frostbite and hypothermia)
    *   **Shelter** (protecting the fort from the elements and infiltrators)
*   Failed survival checks can lead to exhaustion, injury, or worse.

### 4. **The Purification Ritual**
*   To destroy the Wendigo permanently, the players must perform a ritual at the Ancient Burial Mound that requires:
    *   Destroying the Wendigo's frozen heart
    *   A willing sacrifice (someone with Corruption Points who chooses redemption)
    *   Maintaining the ritual against waves of Wendigo thralls and the manifestation of the spirit itself
