## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-18 sessions)

A revenge arc where methods determine the world's fate.

*   **Act I — Fall and Marking (Sessions 1-4):** The Empress is murdered; the party is framed. They escape Coldridge Prison with help from loyalists. The Outsider appears in dreams, offering his Mark—supernatural abilities powered by the Void. They establish a base in the Hound Pits Pub with other loyalists. Their mission: eliminate the conspirators, rescue Emily (the young heir), and restore the throne. Early assassinations teach the Chaos system—killing raises Chaos, leading to more plague rats, weepers (plague zombies), and a darker world.
*   **Act II — Hunting the Conspiracy (Sessions 5-12):** They systematically eliminate targets: the High Overseer spreading propaganda, the Pendleton brothers exploiting the city, Lady Boyle financing the coup, the Royal Spymaster controlling information, and the Royal Physician experimenting on plague victims. Each mission offers choices: lethal or non-lethal, seen or unseen, collateral damage or surgical precision. The Chaos level fluctuates based on their methods, visibly affecting the city.
*   **Act III — The Lord Regent and Aftermath (Sessions 13-18):** They storm Dunwall Tower to face the Lord Regent who orchestrated everything. The confrontation and Emily's fate depend on Chaos levels. Low Chaos: redemption, Emily becomes a wise ruler, plague recedes. High Chaos: the city burns, Emily becomes tyrannical, plague consumes everything. Medium Chaos: bittersweet—order restored but scars remain. The Outsider judges their choices, revealing he was testing if they'd succumb to power's corruption.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of power corrupting, revenge versus mercy, consequences of violence, surveillance state, and whether the ends justify the means. It asks: Does killing the corrupt make you corrupted? Will Emily learn from your mercy or your violence? Can you resist the ease of supernatural murder? The central conflict pits the party's desire for justice against the temptation of brutal revenge and the world-altering consequences of their methods.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Chaos System (Core Mechanic)**
*   Every kill raises Chaos slightly
*   High body counts, civilian deaths raise it significantly
*   Chaos affects the world: more rats, weepers, plague, darker endings
*   Low Chaos: Emily becomes wise, plague recedes, golden age
*   High Chaos: Emily becomes tyrant, plague consumes isles
*   Visible consequences throughout—not just at ending

### 2. **The Outsider's Mark**
*   Grants supernatural powers fueled by mana
*   **Blink:** Short-range teleport, core mobility
*   **Dark Vision:** See enemies through walls, patrol routes
*   **Possession:** Control animals and people briefly
*   **Bend Time:** Slow or stop time for repositioning
*   **Windblast:** Knock enemies away, non-lethal
*   Powers enable both stealth and chaos

### 3. **Lethal vs Non-Lethal**
*   Every target has non-lethal elimination option
*   Non-lethal is often harder but lowers Chaos
*   Examples: branding, exile, delivering to fates worse than death
*   The "merciful" options aren't always moral—some are cruel
*   Player must weigh convenience versus consequence

### 4. **Stealth and Detection**
*   Guards have vision cones, patrol routes, alert states
*   Sound matters—running is louder than walking
*   Height advantage—ledges and rooftops are safer
*   Can ghost entire missions (no detections, no kills)
*   Rewarded for creative stealth approaches

### 5. **Runes and Bone Charms**
*   Runes upgrade powers or unlock new ones
*   Bone Charms provide passive bonuses (faster movement, cheaper powers, etc.)
*   Hidden throughout levels, encourage exploration
*   The Heart artifact reveals their locations and speaks secrets

### 6. **The Heart**
*   Mysterious artifact that beats when aimed at targets
*   Reveals dark secrets about anyone
*   Shows locations of runes and charms
*   Makes targets human—harder to kill after hearing their stories
*   High Insight into the world's corruption

### 7. **Multiple Approaches**
*   Every mission has multiple paths: rooftops, sewers, main gates
*   Can complete missions without entering main areas
*   Environmental storytelling through notes, conversations
*   Rewarded for finding alternative solutions
*   No "correct" way—only consequences

### 8. **Dynamic World State**
*   Chaos affects every level's future state
*   High Chaos: more guards, weepers, rats, darker atmosphere
*   Low Chaos: fewer enemies, NPCs hopeful, brighter colors
*   Samuel's dialogue reflects moral judgment
*   Emily's drawings show what she's learned from you
