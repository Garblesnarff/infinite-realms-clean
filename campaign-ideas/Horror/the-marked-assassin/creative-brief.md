# Creative Brief: The Marked Assassin

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Industrial Whaling-Punk with Oil Painting Aesthetic (Dishonored-inspired)

Inspired by the unique art direction of *Dishonored*. This style captures Victorian-era whaling industrialization, steampunk-ish technology powered by whale oil, plague-ridden streets, and a painterly quality where everything looks like concept art. Thearchitecture is angular, imposing, and beautiful in its decay.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Painterly Quality:** Visible brush strokes, oil painting texture, concept art feel
*   **Whaling Industry:** Whale processing, oil tanks, industrial coastal city
*   **Angular Architecture:** Sharp lines, towering buildings, oppressive verticality
*   **Plague Aesthetic:** Rats everywhere, weepers (plague zombies), quarantine zones

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Supernatural stealth, revenge, plague city, whale oil industry, consequences, mark of the Outsider, chaos
*   **Feeling:** Moving through shadows with godlike powers. The weight of each kill. A city drowning in plague and corruption.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Dunwall:** Industrial grays, rust browns, whale oil amber-gold, fog whites
*   **Plague Districts:** Sickly greens, dried blood, shadow blacks
*   **High Chaos:** Darker tones, more red and black, oppressive
*   **Low Chaos:** Brighter, more blues and golds, hopeful
*   **The Void:** Black and white only, stark contrast, otherworldly
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of industrial Victorian. Gray stone buildings with angular architecture, rust-colored metal whale oil pipes. Amber-golden light from whale oil lamps. Fog rolling through streets. Muted tones overall—browns, grays, dull golds. Plague rats scattered. Painterly oil painting texture."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Marked:** Dark coat, mask covering lower face, supernatural tattoo (the Mark) on hand
*   **City Watch:** Angular armor, masks, intimidating silhouettes
*   **Nobles:** Elaborate Victorian dress, masks for masquerades
*   **Weepers:** Plague victims, blind, vomiting, reaching out desperately
*   **The Outsider:** Young man in dark clothes, black eyes, otherworldly presence
*   **Prompt Example:** "A masked assassin in a dark coat, black mask covering lower face. Left hand shows glowing supernatural tattoo—the Outsider's Mark. Holding a collapsible blade. Crouched on rooftop. Behind them, angular Gothic architecture and whale oil tanks. Painterly style with visible brush strokes."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Dunwall:** Coastal industrial city, whale slaughterhouses, towering chimneys
*   **Architecture:** Angular, oppressive, towering—makes people feel small
*   **Plague Zones:** Bodies in piles, rats everywhere, buildings boarded up
*   **Upper Class:** Lavish estates contrasting with slums below
*   **Prompt Example:** "An industrial Victorian city: angular buildings with sharp lines towering overhead. Whale oil refineries with massive tanks and pipes. Cobblestone streets with fog. In the distance, whale carcasses being processed. The ocean visible with ships. Oppressive vertical architecture. Oil painting style, muted colors—grays, browns, amber lighting from lamps."

**5. Supernatural Elements:**
*   **The Mark:** Glowing tattoo on hand, geometric patterns
*   **Blink:** Blue-white trail when teleporting short distances
*   **The Void:** Black and white otherworld, floating platforms, the Outsider watching
*   **Possession:** Green smoky tendrils when controlling creatures
*   **Prompt Example:** "A figure mid-Blink: dissolving into blue-white particles, leaving a trail as they teleport across a gap between buildings. The supernatural tattoo on their hand glows bright blue. Motion blur emphasizing the speed. Industrial Victorian rooftops. Painterly effect."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Painterly Strokes:** Not photorealistic, visible brush work
*   **Whale Oil Lighting:** Warm amber-gold artificial light
*   **Fog and Atmosphere:** Heavy atmospheric perspective, mist everywhere
*   **Prompt Example:** "...oil painting lighting style. Warm amber light from whale oil lamps creating pools of illumination. Deep shadows between lights. Heavy fog creating atmospheric depth. Visible brush strokes in the rendering. High contrast between light and shadow."

## Voice

A voice carrying both determination and doubt, like someone granted power but questioning its use. The pacing is measured, stealthy, with bursts of action. The tone shifts between vengeful anger, moral contemplation, and supernatural wonder. There's an underlying theme of whether you become the monster to fight monsters. Role: The voice of marked vengeance.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** String-heavy orchestral with industrial sounds. Daniel Licht-style atmospheric, melancholic, building tension. Each location has unique instrumentation.
*   **Dunwall Streets:** Ambient—distant foghorns, whale processing sounds, rat squeaks, guard conversations.
*   **Stealth:** Minimal music, heartbeat when detected, tension strings.
*   **Detection:** Sharp stings, aggressive percussion when spotted.
*   **Combat:** Frantic strings, industrial percussion, chaotic when fighting.
*   **The Outsider:** Ethereal, otherworldly sounds, whispers, void ambience.
*   **High Chaos:** Music is darker, more dissonant, unsettling.
*   **Low Chaos:** Music has hopeful undertones, lighter instrumentation.
*   **Dunwall Tower:** Grand orchestral, representing power and corruption.
*   **The Void:** Minimal, echoing, sound design more than music—incomprehensible whispers.
