# Creative Brief: The Nine Courts of Diyu

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Chinese Underworld Horror

Inspired by traditional Chinese hell scrolls, Buddhist and Taoist depictions of Diyu, and Chinese horror aesthetics. The style combines ornate imperial Chinese architecture with grotesque torture imagery, bureaucratic order with nightmarish chaos. Colors include imperial red and gold for authority, dark greens and blacks for the underworld, sickly yellows for supernatural elements, and the red of blood and fire for punishment chambers.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Ornate Horror:** Beautiful Chinese palatial architecture housing horrific torture devices. The contrast between elegant design and brutal purpose.
*   **Bureaucratic Precision:** Even in hell, everything is organized, documented, and administered. Horror within orderly systems.
*   **Karmic Visualization:** Punishments visually reflect sins. The visual language makes moral cause-and-effect tangible.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Horrific, bureaucratic, karmic, ornate, oppressive, dark, judicious, systematic, grotesque, redemptive.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of karma, inescapable judgment, horror made orderly, suffering with purpose, beauty corrupted by function, the mundane evil of bureaucracy, hope for redemption beneath despair.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed traditional Chinese illustration style mixed with horror elements. Clean architecture but grotesque figures and torture implements.
*   **Textures:** Polished dark wood, red lacquer, jade and bronze, blood and flesh, paper documents, stone torture implements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Traditional Chinese underworld illustration with ornate architectural details and horrific torture imagery. Clean lines for palatial structures, grotesque detail for punishments, bureaucratic precision in composition..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Imperial red and gold for authority, deep blacks and dark greens for the underworld, sickly yellow-green for supernatural, blood red for torture, cold blues for ice hells.
*   **Accent Colors:** The flickering light of punishment fires, the pale glow of spirit lanterns, the darkness between.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark color palette dominated by imperial reds, deep blacks, and sickly yellows. Gold accents for authority, blood red for torture chambers, cold blues for ice punishment. Oppressive atmosphere lit by fires and spirit lanterns."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Judges in elaborate official robes, demon guards with animal features (ox heads, horse faces), suffering souls in tattered clothing, Judge Cui in bureaucrat attire hiding demonic nature.
*   **Clothing:** Traditional Chinese official robes for judges, armor for guards, simple clothes for souls (increasingly tattered as they progress through courts).
*   **Expression:** Judges are stern and impassive, demons are brutal but professional, souls show suffering and desperation, the hidden demon shows careful control masking hunger.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Yanluo Wang, the supreme judge of Chinese hell, seated on an ornate throne wearing elaborate official robes in imperial red and gold. His expression is stern and impassive, holding a brush for recording judgments. Behind him, scrolls listing sins. Ox-Head and Horse-Face demon guards stand at attention. Traditional Chinese art style with horror undertones."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Ornate Chinese palatial architecture for judgment halls, grotesque torture chambers with systematic layout, bureaucratic offices filled with documents, bridges over blood rivers, mountains of knives.
*   **Atmosphere:** Dark, oppressive, lit by fires and lanterns, smoke and mist obscuring distances, the sense of endless corridors and infinite suffering.
*   **Details:** Chinese architectural elements - upturned roofs, red pillars, lattice work, but everything serves horror. Documents everywhere. Torture implements as architecture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The First Court of Diyu - a massive Chinese palatial hall with red pillars and ornate ceiling. Yanluo Wang's throne at the far end. Endless lines of souls waiting judgment. Demon clerks at desks checking scrolls. The Mirror of Retribution shows souls' sins. Lit by braziers and spirit lanterns. Oppressive, bureaucratic grandeur housing horror."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dark, oppressive lighting from fires, torture implements glowing red-hot, spirit lanterns casting pale light, deep shadows hiding horrors.
*   **Light Sources:** Punishment fires, burning coals, spirit lanterns, the glow of supernatural elements, occasional harsh spotlights for judgment moments.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and threatening, hiding partially visible horrors, creating oppressive atmosphere.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatic lighting from punishment fires and spirit lanterns creating deep shadows. Glowing red from torture implements, pale sickly light from supernatural sources. Oppressive darkness with strategic harsh lighting for judgment scenes."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Hierarchical - judges above, souls below. Symmetrical for authority, asymmetrical for chaos. Show both the orderly bureaucracy and the horrific result.
*   **Techniques:** Use vertical space to show hierarchy. Frame torture scenes with beautiful architecture. Documents and bureaucracy as recurring visual elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hierarchical composition showing a Court of Diyu. The judge elevated on a platform, stern and official, surrounded by scrolls and demon clerks. Below, souls being led to torture chambers visible through doorways. Beautiful red and gold architecture frames scenes of horror. The bureaucratic precision makes the horror worse."

## Voice

A measured, official voice like a stern Chinese magistrate reading legal judgments. The narrator speaks with authority and without emotion, describing horrors matter-of-factly as administrative necessities. Pronunciation includes authentic Chinese terms and deity names. The tone is bureaucratic horror - making torture sound like routine paperwork. Emotional range includes stern judgment, cold efficiency, occasional hints of suppressed compassion, and the horror of systematic cruelty presented as justice. The voice carries the weight of cosmic law and infinite patience. Role: The underworld's official chronicler, documenting karma's consequences with bureaucratic precision.

## Music Direction

Traditional Chinese instruments (erhu, guzheng, pipa, dizi) combined with dark ambient and horror elements. Heavy use of low strings for oppressive atmosphere. Court scenes have ceremonial music with authority. Torture chambers have dissonant strings and percussion. Investigation scenes have tense, creeping music. The main theme should convey both the grandeur of cosmic justice and the horror of its implementation. Use Chinese opera vocal techniques for dramatic moments. Gongs and drums for judgment pronouncements. The music should feel ancient, authoritative, and increasingly disturbing. Reference: Chinese opera, traditional Buddhist funeral music, horror game soundtracks with Asian influence, "Kung Fu Panda" villain themes.

## Sound Design

Traditional Chinese hell scroll atmosphere brought to audio: the scratch of brushes on paper, the rustle of silk robes, footsteps on wooden floors. Torture sounds are horrific but presented matter-of-factly - screams become background noise in this bureaucracy. The clack of abacus beads calculating karma. The echo of gongs announcing judgments. Demon guards' animal sounds - ox snorts, horse whinnies mixed with speech. The crackle of torture fires, the grind of mills, the splash of blood pools. Spirit lanterns emit ethereal hums. The environment should sound organized and systematic despite the horror - hell as efficient bureaucracy. Distant suffering becomes ambient sound. The corruption manifests as wrong sounds - documents fluttering when they shouldn't, whispers in empty halls, the subtle wrongness of altered reality.
