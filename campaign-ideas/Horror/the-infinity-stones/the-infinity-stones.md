Thaldros the Eternal, a mad titan from the outer void, has acquired all six Infinity Stones—gems of primal reality that control Space, Time, Mind, Soul, Reality, and Power. With a mere thought, he erases half of all life in the universe, believing this "mercy" will restore balance and prevent resource depletion. The players are among the survivors, and they must unite the shattered remnants of heroes, villains, gods, and cosmic entities in a desperate gambit to undo the Snap and stop Thaldros before he completes his twisted vision of paradise. But defeating a god with the power of creation itself may require the ultimate sacrifice.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 20+ sessions)

The universe's last hope against a mad god with omnipotent power.

*   **Act I — The Snap (Sessions 1–6):** The campaign opens with the players on a mission when reality shudders. Half of all living beings—friends, family, allies, strangers—simply dissolve into ash. The players witness heroes and villains alike vanish. They learn the truth: Thaldros has acquired all six Infinity Stones and used them to "balance" the universe. The survivors must deal with trauma, loss, and the collapse of civilization as half the population disappears. The party must find other survivors and discover if there's any way to undo what was done.
*   **Act II — The Desperate Alliance (Sessions 7–14):** The players discover that the Stones' power leaves an echo that can be traced. They must assemble an alliance of cosmic entities, divine beings, surviving heroes, and even reformed villains to mount an assault on Thaldros's sanctuary world. They travel to the far reaches of reality—the realm of Death, the forge of the dwarven artificers, the home of the cosmic abstracts—gathering knowledge, power, and allies. They learn that the Stones can only be used against their wielder if someone is willing to sacrifice everything.
*   **Act III — The Final Gambit (Sessions 15–20+):** The united forces assault Thaldros's sanctuary in a desperate battle. While armies clash, the players must find a way to separate Thaldros from the Gauntlet long enough to seize the Stones. In the climactic moment, one hero must use the Stones to reverse the Snap—but the Stones' power will kill any mortal who wields them all. The players must decide who makes the ultimate sacrifice, or if they can find another way to save everyone without losing one of their own.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Thaldros the Eternal** — *The Mad Titan*
    *   **Role:** The primary antagonist, a cosmic being who believes killing half of all life is merciful salvation.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, convinced of his righteousness, and terrifyingly powerful. He sees himself as the universe's savior.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is in love with Death itself (personified entity) and believes the Snap will impress her. She is disgusted by him.

2.  **The Oracle of Eternity** — *Keeper of Cosmic Knowledge*

    *   **Personality:** Wise, mournful, and burdened by knowing all possible futures.

3.  **Death Herself** — *The Cosmic Abstract*
    *   **Role:** The personification of death, whom Thaldros seeks to impress with his Snap.
    *   **Personality:** Elegant, sardonic, and fundamentally amoral. She is intrigued by the players' defiance.

    *   **Role:** NPCs and potentially PCs who dissolved in the Snap, existing in a liminal space between life and death.
    *   **Personality:** Varied—desperate to return, at peace, or serving as spiritual guides.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of sacrifice, the value of life, utilitarianism versus individual worth, and the cost of victory. The central conflict is against overwhelming, godlike power—but also against despair. Can mortal heroes defeat a being with omnipotent abilities? What is worth sacrificing to save the universe? And who has the right to decide who lives or dies?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Fallen Roster**
*   At the start, each player rolls. On a 1-10, their character is Snapped (temporarily).
*   Snapped players take control of surviving NPCs for Act I, or play their characters as ghosts who can communicate with the Oracle.
*   In Act III, when the Snap is reversed, these characters return.

### 2. **Infinity Stone Powers**
*   If players temporarily acquire individual Stones during the campaign, they gain immense power but suffer drawbacks:
    *   **Space:** Teleportation at will, but risks phasing out of reality.
    *   **Time:** Time manipulation, but risks creating paradoxes.
    *   **Mind:** Mental domination, but risks losing their own identity.
    *   **Soul:** Understanding all life, but risks being consumed by others' suffering.
    *   **Reality:** Alter reality itself, but risks making changes permanent and uncontrollable.
    *   **Power:** Infinite energy, but risks destroying their body.

### 3. **The Ultimate Sacrifice**
*   In the final encounter, using all six Stones simultaneously to reverse the Snap requires a DC 30 Constitution save.
*   Failure means instant death, but the Snap is reversed.
*   Creative solutions might allow distributing the burden or finding alternatives, but these require exceptional planning and execution.
