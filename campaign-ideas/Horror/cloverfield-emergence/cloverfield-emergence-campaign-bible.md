# Cloverfield-Emergence: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The Earth is a living organism, a colossal, dormant being whose consciousness operates on a geological timescale. Humanity is not its child; it is a parasitic infection. Our cities are tumors of concrete and steel, our pollution is a fever in its oceans, and our endless noise is a migraine in its psychic mind. For millennia, the planet has "slept," its immune system ignoring the minor irritation. But the infection has become too severe. The "Cloverfield" creature, nicknamed "Clover" by the media, is not an alien or a monster from another dimension. It is a "T-cell," a planetary antibody, awakened from a billion-year slumber in the deepest ocean trenches. It is a biological failsafe, a confused and terrified agent of a planetary immune response, tasked with cleansing a "tumor" (New York City) that it cannot comprehend. It is not evil; it is a white blood cell, and we are the virus. The smaller, spider-like creatures that fall from its body are not its children, but its own parasites, shed in its panic and distress as it is attacked by the "infection's" own defense mechanisms (the military).

### Timeline
1.  **The Great Slumber (Billions of years ago):** The Earth-organism, having seeded itself with basic life, enters a long period of dormancy to allow its complex systems to mature.
2.  **The Infection (c. 200,000 years ago):** The "humanity" parasite appears and begins to spread slowly across the planet's surface.
3.  **The First Fever (c. 1850 CE):** The Industrial Revolution causes a spike in planetary temperature and pollution. The Earth's immune system takes notice for the first time, but the threat is not yet deemed critical.
4.  **The Tagruato Anomaly (c. 2005 CE):** The Japanese deep-sea drilling company, Tagruato, accidentally drills into a "lymph node" of the planet near a dormant T-cell, agitating it with sonar pulses and chemical leaks.
5.  **(Surreal) The Sea-Sickness (c. 2007 CE):** For one week, all the oceans of the world become carbonated. The water fizzes, and sailors report the sea itself seems to be "nauseous." This is the planet's first, major, physical reaction to the irritation.
6.  **The Emergence (The Present Day):** The agitated T-cell, "Clover," finally awakens fully and follows the path of greatest irritation—a Tagruato subsidiary's pipeline—directly to its source: New York City. The "attack" begins.
7.  **The Parasites of the Parasite (The First Hours):** As Clover is attacked by the military, its own, smaller parasites, agitated and terrified, detach from its body and spill into the city.
8.  **(Surreal) The Concrete Weeps (Day 2):** The buildings in the financial district begin to "weep" a thick, black, oily substance. The city itself, the heart of the "tumor," is having a sympathetic, psychosomatic reaction to the planet's distress.
9.  **The Hammer-Down Protocol (Day 3):** The U.S. military, unable to harm the creature, authorizes the "Hammer-Down" protocol, a tactical nuclear strike intended to "incinerate and cauterize" the target, regardless of collateral damage.
10. **(Surreal) The Silent Scream (During Hammer-Down):** As the bomb detonates, there is no sound. Instead, every living thing within 500 miles experiences a single, silent, psychic scream of immense, unimaginable pain—the planet itself reacting to the "chemotherapy." The campaign begins in the moments just after this scream.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a horrifying inversion of the classic monster story. It is a tale of cosmic body-horror, where humanity is the disease. The horror comes not from the monster's malice, but from its utter lack of it. It is simply a biological process, and the players are on the wrong side of it. The goal is not victory, which is impossible, but survival. Can the players escape a city that is being systematically cleansed by a force of nature? Can they find a way to communicate with a being whose thoughts are the size of continents? Or can they, perhaps, find a way to prove that humanity is not a parasite, but a symbiont, by finding a way to "heal" the irritation that summoned the creature in the first place?

**Rivals:** The Cloverfield Creature.

### The Gea-Mancers
**Type:** Eco-Terrorist Death Cult
**Leader:** The "Voice of the Mother," a charismatic and insane environmentalist.

### Tagruato Corporation
**Type:** Amoral Corporate Entity
**Leader:** The CEO, a man in a bunker in Tokyo, communicating via satellite phone.

**Type:** Desperate Big-Game Hunters
**Leader:** "Croc," a former big-game hunter who sees the Clover-parasites as the ultimate trophy.

### The CDC "Cleaners"
**Type:** Hazmat-Suited Scientists
**Leader:** Dr. Aris Thorne, a cold, pragmatic CDC official.

**Type:** Conspiracy Theorist Hackers
**Leader:** "Ozymandias," a hacker who communicates from a hidden location.

**Type:** Psychic Trauma Victims
**Leader:** None. They are a collective of people who were psychically "shattered" by the creature's silent scream.

### Ground Zero (Midtown Manhattan)

*   **The Empty City:** The streets within the zone are eerily empty, save for the dead and the monsters. **Smell:** Dust, and death. **Sound:** An unnatural silence, broken by the roar of the creature.
*   **Ground Zero:** The intended target of the Hammer-Down strike, Times Square. **Smell:** The scent of a million forgotten lives. **Sound:** The wind.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Hammer-Down Briefcase
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A black, military briefcase, chained to the wrist of a high-ranking officer. It contains the launch codes for the Hammer-Down nuclear strike.
**Mechanics:** The briefcase is a plot device. It cannot be opened by any means. Its presence signifies the "ticking clock" of the campaign. If the players can somehow get it away from the military, they can delay the strike, but not prevent it.

### 2. Clover's Tooth
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A single, house-sized tooth, broken off from the main creature during a military strike. It hums with a strange, biological energy.
**Mechanics:** The tooth is not a weapon, but a "key." It resonates with the creature's biology. A character holding a piece of it can get a vague, psychic sense of the main creature's emotional state (pain, confusion, fear). It is also the only thing that can open a "path" to the planet's own consciousness, if brought to a place of great natural power.

### 3. The Parasite's Heart
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** The glowing, pulsating heart of one of the spider-like parasites. It continues to beat long after the creature is dead.
**Mechanics:** The heart is a biological battery. It can be used to power any electronic device for 24 hours. **Curse:** The heart also acts as a beacon, attracting other parasites to its location.

### 4. The Silent Scream (In a Bottle)
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A strange, swirling, grey mist in a bottle, captured by a Glitch-Hunter during the Hammer-Down event.
**Mechanics:** The bottle can be opened once. When opened, it does not release a sound, but a 300-foot-radius "scream" of pure, psychic pain. All creatures in the area (including the user) must make a high DC Wisdom save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and take 10d10 psychic damage. It is a weapon of last resort.

### 5. The Tagruato Hard-Drive
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A heavily-encrypted hard-drive containing all of Tagruato's research on the creature, and their culpability in waking it.
**Mechanics:** This is a pure plot device. If the players can decrypt it (a massive undertaking), they will have the "truth" of the entire incident. They can use this to expose Tagruato, or to bargain with the military, or to try and understand the creature.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Perspective
This is a world of found-footage horror. The perspective of the "camera" is a mechanical element.
*   **Found Footage:** The entire campaign should be run as if viewed through a single camera. The "Cameraman" is a key NPC, but the players' actions determine where the camera points. If the camera is dropped, or the view is obscured, the DM's description should reflect that.
*   **The Unseen Horror:** The main creature, Clover, is almost never seen in its entirety. It is too large, too obscured by dust and buildings. The horror comes from glimpses: a foot the size of a bus, an eye that peers over a skyscraper, a tail that demolishes a bridge. The DM should focus on the scale and the incomprehensibility of the creature.
*   **The Human Element:** The true horror is not the monster, but the human reaction to it. The campaign should focus on the small, personal stories of the survivors. The monster is the backdrop, the catalyst for the human drama.

### Subsystems: Panic and The Countdown
*   **Panic:** Every player has a "Panic" score, from 0 to 10. This score increases when they witness terrifying events, are injured, or are separated from the group. High Panic can induce penalties, from disadvantage on rolls to temporary madness (under the DM's control). The only way to lower Panic is to find a moment of safety and human connection.
*   **The Countdown:** From the moment the players learn of the Hammer-Down protocol, a real-world timer should be started. The players have a limited amount of real time (e.g., 4 hours) to complete their final objectives and escape the city. This creates a real, palpable sense of urgency and tension.
