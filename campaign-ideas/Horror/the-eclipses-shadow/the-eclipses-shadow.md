The party are members of the Band of the Falcon, an elite mercenary company led by the charismatic Griffith. At the height of their success, Griffith activates a cursed artifact—the Crimson Behelit—during a solar eclipse, sacrificing the entire band to demon lords called the God Hand in exchange for demonic ascension. The party survives the Eclipse bearing cursed Brands that mark them for eternal demon hunting, and must struggle to survive in a world where they are hunted every night by inhuman monsters. Their quest becomes one of vengeance against their former leader, now a demon lord, while questioning whether fate can be defied or if they are merely actors in a cosmic play written by malevolent gods.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **The Brand of Sacrifice:** Survivors bear a cursed brand that attracts demons every night. Rest is dangerous; darkness brings horrors.
*   **Overwhelming Odds:** Demons are vastly more powerful than normal enemies. Survival often means fleeing, not fighting.
*   **Psychological Trauma:** The betrayal by a trusted leader and witnessing comrades die creates lasting mental scars. Characters struggle with PTSD, rage, and despair.
*   **Fate vs Free Will:** Prophecy suggests all is predetermined. Characters must resist the temptation to surrender to destiny.
*   **Body Horror & Dark Themes:** Graphic violence, demonic possession, assault implications (handled with player consent), and relentless darkness.
*   **Permanent Consequences:** Death is possible and meaningful. NPCs die permanently. The world does not pull punches.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–18 sessions)

A progression from camaraderie through betrayal to vengeance across four acts.

*   **Act I — The Golden Age (Sessions 1–4):** The party joins the Band of the Falcon, fights alongside legendary warriors, forms bonds, and achieves glory. Griffith leads them to victory after victory. The band feels invincible. Undercurrents of Griffith's ambition and the mysterious Behelit are introduced.
*   **Act II — The Eclipse (Sessions 5–7):** After Griffith's fall from grace and torture, he activates the Behelit during a solar eclipse. The entire Band is transported to a nightmare dimension where the God Hand appears. Griffith sacrifices the Band to become the demon lord Femto. The party witnesses friends being devoured by demons and barely escapes, now bearing the Brand of Sacrifice.
*   **Act III — Survival & Vengeance (Sessions 8–14):** Branded and hunted, the party must survive demon attacks nightly while seeking weapons and allies capable of harming Apostles (demons in human form). They hunt demons, uncover the God Hand's plans, and search for Griffith—now building a demon army. They gain legendary weapons, meet other Branded survivors, and learn about the Berserker Armor and other cursed tools.
*   **Act IV — The Confrontation (Sessions 15–18):** The party assaults Griffith's growing empire, faces Apostles and the God Hand's machinations, and must decide: pursue vengeance to the end (likely dying but defying fate), find a way to break the cycle (the idealistic but nearly impossible path), or succumb to darkness themselves (becoming monsters to fight monsters).

4.  **Apostle Territories:** Regions ruled by demons disguised as nobles or warlords.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **vengeance versus futility**. The party seeks revenge against Griffith and the God Hand for the Eclipse's betrayal, but faces the philosophical question: if fate is predetermined (as the God Hand claims), can revenge even matter? Every step forward reveals how outmatched they are—demons are vastly more powerful, the Brand ensures they're hunted eternally, and the God Hand manipulates causality itself. The party must struggle against overwhelming darkness, both external (demons) and internal (trauma, rage, despair). The campaign asks: is defiance meaningful even if doomed to fail? Can free will exist in a universe of predetermined causality? And how much of yourself can you sacrifice—humanity, sanity, morality—in pursuit of justice?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Brand of Sacrifice**
*   All party members bear the Brand—a cursed mark that attracts demons.
*   Every night, demons spawn nearby. Long rests require sanctified areas, protective wards, or constant vigilance.
*   The Brand bleeds and burns when demons are near (warning system).
*   Can never be fully removed without breaking the God Hand's power.

### 2. **Causality & Fate**
*   Prophecies and visions show potential futures. The God Hand claims all is predetermined.
*   Mechanically: certain events are "fated" unless players actively resist with difficult choices and sacrifices.
*   Defying fate grants inspiration/bonuses but comes at narrative cost.

### 3. **Berserker Armor**
*   Legendary cursed armor that removes pain limiters and fear.
*   Grants immense combat bonuses but the wearer enters berserk state: attacks friend and foe alike, ignores injuries (can fight with broken bones or mortal wounds), and suffers massive exhaustion/injury when removed.
*   Overuse causes permanent physical and mental damage.

### 4. **Demon-Slaying Weapons**
*   Normal weapons barely harm Apostles. Special weapons (Dragonslayer, enchanted blades) required.
*   Crafting requires rare materials (Apostle bones, blessed silver, etc.).

### 5. **Trauma & Madness**
*   Characters track psychological trauma from Eclipse and ongoing horrors.
*   High trauma causes penalties, flashbacks, or breakdowns.
*   Can be managed through bonds with allies, therapy, or giving in to rage (which helps short-term but damages long-term).

### 6. **Apostle Transformations**
*   The temptation exists: activate a Behelit, sacrifice someone precious, become an Apostle—gain demon power but lose humanity.
*   NPCs may offer Behelits or try to tempt the party.
*   A player choosing this becomes immensely powerful but transitions to NPC status (now a monster).

### 7. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Revenge:** Kill Griffith at cost of party's lives—defying fate with final act.
*   **Survival:** Wound demons, disrupt plans, continue fighting—pyrrhic victory.
*   **Liberation:** Find mythical way to remove Brand/defeat God Hand—idealistic, near-impossible.
*   **Damnation:** Become Apostles to gain power—victory through corruption.
