# The Viral Curse: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone
**Aesthetic: Digital Horror + Found Footage**
Combines corrupted digital media aesthetic with Ring-style curse horror.

**Color Palette:**
- **Screen Glow Blue** (#0080FF): Phone/monitor light, cold and clinical
- **Corruption Purple** (#800080): Glitched video, digital artifacts
- **Warning Red** (#FF0000): Notification badges, danger signals
- **Static Gray** (#C0C0C0): Corrupted frames, The Figure
- **Void Black** (#000000): The Watcher's presence, empty screens
- **Flash White** (#FFFFFF): Jump scares, subliminal frames

**Lighting:** Phone screen glow in darkness, flickering monitors, ring light horror, shadow figures in backlight

## Music and Sound Design
**Themes:**
- **Main Theme**: Distorted notification sounds building into drone
- **The Figure Theme**: White noise breathing, footsteps on wrong surface
- **Cult Theme**: Reversed chanting, digital corruption sounds
- **Watcher Theme**: Sound of millions watching simultaneously

**Sound Design:** Notification pings, VHS tracking, dial-up modem, screaming compressed to JPEG artifact sounds, "video buffering" loops

**Voice Direction:**
- **Prophet_Zero**: Smooth influencer voice, charismatic but hollow
- **Maria Santos**: Desperate researcher, voice degrades in later recordings
- **Detective Cross**: Gruff, exhausted, trying to sound professional
- **The Hollow**: Speak in overlapping YouTube comments and video titles
- **The Watcher**: No voice—communicates through visual patterns

## Cinematic Moments
**First Viewing**: Normal video slowly corrupts, subliminal frame of The Figure
**Day 7 Transformation**: POV of Hollowing, fading to static
**Mass Hollowing Event**: Thousands watching screens simultaneously, eyes glazing
**Entering Viewer Space**: Reality pixelates, world becomes low-res media
**Counter-Ritual**: Screens everywhere showing clean video, curse reversing
**Final Confrontation**: Facing The Watcher in infinite screening room

**Marketing Tagline**: "Seven days. Share it or join us."
