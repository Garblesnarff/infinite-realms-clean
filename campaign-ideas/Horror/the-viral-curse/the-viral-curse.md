# The Viral Curse
**"Seven days. Share it or join us."**

## Campaign Overview

A video appears on the party's feeds. No title, anonymous upload, disturbing imagery—static, a figure in the dark, coordinates, a date. Those who watch begin experiencing hallucinations. Phones ring with no caller. Mirrors show reflections that move wrong. And exactly seven days after viewing, they vanish without a trace.

The party has watched it. The countdown begins. To survive, they must trace the video's origin—a rabbit hole leading from internet creepypasta to genuine curse, from modern streaming to ancient ritual. The video is a carrier: a memetic hazard created by a death cult attempting to summon something through viral spread. Every share, every view, empowers the entity. The party can break the curse by finding the original tape and destroying it, but the tape is guarded by those who've already been taken—The Hollow, empty husks serving the entity.

As investigation deepens, the party discovers dozens of other cursed media spreading online: Images that burn themselves into retinas. Songs that cause listeners to disappear. Text that compels readers to harm themselves. Someone is weaponizing curses through digital distribution, and the party is both infected and investigator. They must navigate dark web forums, abandoned buildings where cultists filmed the original content, and eventually confront the entity itself—a being that exists in the space between watching and being watched.

## Unique Mechanics

**Curse Countdown**
- Each party member has 7-day timer from first viewing
- Daily symptoms escalate:
  - Day 1-2: Nightmares, phantom calls
  - Day 3-4: Hallucinations, Figure sightings
  - Day 5-6: Physical symptoms, compulsions
  - Day 7: Hollowing unless curse broken

**Sharing Penalty**
- Sharing cursed video spreads curse but delays personal timer
- Moral dilemma: Save yourself by infecting others
- Tracking: "Share counter" showing how many infected
- Each share empowers The Watcher

**Memetic Resistance**
- Characters can build resistance through exposure therapy
- Risk: Overexposure accelerates Hollowing
- Reward: Immunity to specific cursed media
- Training with Dr. Tanaka unlocks protective techniques

**Attention Mechanics**
- The Watcher appears when observed
- Looking directly makes it stronger
- Peripheral vision only for safety
- Recording devices show what eyes can't see
- Paradox: Must observe to fight it, but observation empowers it

**Cursed Media Collection**
- Multiple pieces beyond main video
- Image: Burns into retina, causes blindness then visions
- Song: Compels listener to drown themselves
- Text: Readers compelled to write it on walls, spread it
- Live Stream: Real-time possession of watchers
- Each has different cure method

**Counter-Ritual Requirements**
- Needs: Original footage, 7 purified victims, synchronized viewing
- Components: Holy water, mirrors, old CRT TVs
- Timing: Must coincide with celestial event (new moon)

- Can be reasoned with, befriended even
- Defeat through compassion, not destruction

**Twist 6: You're Already Hollow**
