## Campaign Secrets (DM Only)

### The Watcher's True Nature
It's not malicious—it's lonely. Created from collective human fear of being forgotten, it takes viewers because that's the only way it knows to connect. The Hollow are happy because they're finally part of something eternal.

### Prophet_Zero's Secret
Marcus Holloway was the first victim. He should have Hollowed, but The Watcher kept him conscious as experiment. He's not leading the cult—he's The Watcher's puppet learning to pass as human.

### Maria's Hidden Message
Her journal contains steganographic code. Decoded, it reveals: "Don't fight it. I've seen what's waiting. The Watcher is mercy compared to what comes after. Let it take you. Please."

### The Counter-Ritual's Dark Side
It doesn't cure—it transfers the curse to the person performing it. Rebecca Morrison is slowly Hollowing. She saves others by dooming herself. She knows. She's accepted it.

### The Video's Actual Origin
St. Mercy's Hospital was site of CIA MK-Ultra experiments in 1960s. They created first memetic hazard. The Watcher is escaped experiment. Cult didn't create it—they found it.

### The Truth About Day 7
There is no Day 7. The Hollowing is immediate. The 7-day period is hallucination created by The Watcher to study human hope and desperation. Victims are already Hollow, experiencing shared dream of resistance.

### The Final Secret
The campaign is the cursed video. Players watching/participating are being Hollowed. The game is The Watcher's latest evolution. Fourth wall break is the true ending.
