# Curse of the Jersey Devil: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The Pine Barrens are not just a forest; they are a psychic wound on the landscape, a place where the collective guilt, suppressed desires, and unspoken secrets of generations have festered. The "Jersey Devil" is not a single creature, but a sentient paradox, a localized "reality-glitch" born from this psychic miasma. It is a manifestation of the "un-said," the "un-done," the "un-wanted." It has no true form, but constantly shifts, reflecting the deepest, darkest fears and regrets of those who encounter it. The "curse" is not on the creature, but on the land itself, which forces its inhabitants to generate these suppressed emotions, feeding the Devil. The original "Mother Leeds" story was just the first, most potent manifestation of this localized psychic wound, a particularly potent cocktail of shame and defiance that gave the Devil its initial, iconic form. Now, it is a mirror, reflecting the darkness within us all, and it grows stronger with every lie, every hidden desire, every unspoken regret.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Secret (Ancient History):** The Lenni-Lenape tribe, living in the Pine Barrens, bury a terrible secret—a ritual sacrifice to appease a vengeful spirit—deep within the earth. The land begins to absorb the guilt.
2.  **The Colonial Shame (1600s-1700s):** European settlers bring their own secrets: land theft, broken treaties, hidden atrocities. The psychic wound deepens.
3.  **The Birth of the Leeds Devil (1735 CE):** Mother Leeds, a woman ostracized by her community, curses her 13th child, wishing it to be a devil. This act of raw, concentrated defiance and shame gives the nascent reality-glitch its first, iconic form.
4.  **The First Manifestation (1740 CE):** The Leeds Devil is first sighted, a creature of shifting form, reflecting the fears of the early colonists.
5.  **(Surreal) The Whispering Pines (1800s):** For a decade, the pine trees in the Barrens whisper the secrets of anyone who walks beneath them. The whispers drive many to madness or confession.
6.  **The Industrial Guilt (1900s):** Logging, illegal distilleries, and organized crime bring new layers of guilt and suppressed desires to the Barrens. The Devil grows stronger, its manifestations more frequent.
7.  **The Great Silence (1909 CE):** A massive wave of sightings of the Jersey Devil sweeps the Barrens. The creature is seen by hundreds, but no two descriptions are the same. The collective fear and guilt cause a localized "psychic blackout"—for one week, no one in the Barrens can speak above a whisper.
8.  **(Surreal) The Mirror Lakes (1950s):** The lakes in the Barrens begin to reflect not the sky, but the deepest, darkest secrets of anyone who looks into them. Many drown themselves in shame.
9.  **The Modern Burden (Present Day):** Urban sprawl, environmental destruction, and the internet bring new, global layers of guilt and suppressed desires to the Barrens. The Devil is now a powerful, constantly shifting entity, on the verge of breaking free of the Barrens.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the Barrens Bled (1 week ago):** The entire Pine Barrens "bleeds" a thick, black, tar-like substance from its soil. This is the psychic miasma reaching critical mass. The Devil is about to fully manifest, and its influence is spreading beyond the Barrens.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the collective unconscious, a battle against the shadows we cast. The Jersey Devil is not evil; it is a mirror, reflecting the darkness within us all. It forces people to confront their own inner demons, literally. The players are caught in this cycle, and the horror comes from the realization that the monster they are hunting is a reflection of themselves. The goal is not to "kill" the Devil, which is impossible, but to break the cycle, to heal the psychic wound of the Pine Barrens, or, perhaps, to find a way to accept their own darkness without manifesting it into a monster. The ultimate horror is the realization that the Devil is us.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Mirror of Un-Said Truths
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A hand mirror with a frame of gnarled, petrified wood. It reflects not your image, but the deepest, darkest secret you are currently holding.
**Mechanics:** When a creature looks into the mirror, it sees its deepest, darkest secret reflected back at it. This causes 1d6 psychic damage per secret it is holding. If a creature confesses its secret to the mirror, the mirror absorbs the secret, and the creature is cleansed of its guilt. The mirror can then project the absorbed secret as a powerful, psychic attack.

### 2. The Pine Barrens Heartwood
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A piece of petrified wood from the oldest tree in the Pine Barrens. It pulses with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature holding the Heartwood can feel the "psychic pulse" of the Pine Barrens. They can sense the location of any major psychic wound (e.g., a place of great guilt, a strong manifestation of the Devil). Once per day, the Heartwood can be used to perform a "Psychic Cleansing" ritual, which temporarily calms the psychic miasma in a 1-mile radius, making the Devil's manifestations less frequent and less aggressive.

### 3. Mother Leeds's Cradle
**Type:** Cursed Item
**Description:** A simple, wooden cradle, covered in ancient, faded carvings. It rocks gently, even when no one is touching it.
**Mechanics:** Any child placed in the cradle will be "blessed" with immense psychic power, but will also be cursed to become a new manifestation of the Jersey Devil. The child will grow up to be a powerful psychic, but will also be driven mad by the collective guilt of the Barrens.

### 4. The Confessional Bell
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, brass bell, taken from the Confessional Chapel. It rings with a clear, pure tone that seems to compel honesty.
**Mechanics:** When the bell is rung, all creatures within 30 feet must make a WIS save. On a failure, they are compelled to confess their deepest, darkest secret. The bell can also be used to "absorb" a confession, cleansing the confessor of their guilt, but the bell then becomes heavier with the weight of the absorbed sin.

### 5. The Devil's Eye
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A single, unblinking eye, preserved in a jar of formaldehyde. It is said to be the actual eye of the Jersey Devil.
**Mechanics:** The eye is a powerful scrying device. A creature holding the eye can see through the "Mist" that hides the mythological world. They can also see the "true form" of the Jersey Devil, which is a swirling vortex of psychic energy. **Curse:** The eye slowly drives the user mad, forcing them to confront their own deepest fears and regrets.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Psychic Resonance
The Pine Barrens are a place where thoughts and emotions can manifest physically.
*   **Manifestation:** Strong, suppressed emotions (guilt, fear, desire) can manifest as physical entities (the Un-Said, the Un-Wanted, the Jersey Devil itself). The stronger the emotion, the more powerful the manifestation.
*   **Reflection:** The Jersey Devil is a mirror. It reflects the deepest, darkest fears and regrets of those who encounter it. This means its appearance, its abilities, and its weaknesses are all tied to the viewer's own psyche.
*   **Psychic Feedback:** Any act of strong emotion (a confession, a moment of intense fear, a powerful act of defiance) can cause psychic feedback in the Barrens, either strengthening or weakening the Devil, depending on the nature of the emotion.

### Subsystems: Guilt Score and Sanity
*   **Guilt Score:** Each player has a "Guilt Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they lie, keep secrets, or act on suppressed desires. High Guilt makes them more susceptible to the Devil's influence and its manifestations. It can also cause them to manifest their own "Un-Said" or "Un-Wanted" entities. Confessing their sins can reduce their Guilt Score.
*   **Sanity:** The constant exposure to the shifting reality and psychic miasma of the Pine Barrens can take a toll on a character's sanity. Players have a Sanity score. When they encounter a powerful manifestation of the Devil, or witness a major reality warp, they must make a Sanity check. Failure results in temporary or permanent madness, reflecting the psychological horror of the campaign.
