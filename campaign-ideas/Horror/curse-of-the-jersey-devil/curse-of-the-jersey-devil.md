In the desolate Pine Barrens, locals whisper of the Leeds Devil—a winged demon born from a curse nearly 300 years ago. When Mother Leeds gave birth to her cursed thirteenth child, it transformed into a monster that has haunted the region ever since. The players are drawn into the mystery when a series of brutal attacks begins, and they discover that the Leeds family curse is spreading—any descendant of the family who bears a thirteenth child risks birthing a new devil. The players must uncover the origin of the curse, find the surviving Leeds descendants before it's too late, and confront the original Jersey Devil in its lair deep within the haunted pines.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A gothic investigation into curses, hereditary evil, and the sins of the past.

*   **Act I — The Devil's Return (Sessions 1–4):** The players arrive in the Pine Barrens to investigate livestock killings and strange sightings. They encounter the Jersey Devil firsthand and learn of the Leeds family curse. A pregnant Leeds descendant is in danger—her child will be the thirteenth born in her generation.
*   **Act II — Sins of the Family (Sessions 5–9):** The party investigates the Leeds family history, tracing the curse back to its origin: a pact with a dark entity made by the family patriarch in the colonial era. They must find other Leeds descendants to warn them and gather pieces of a ritual that could potentially break the curse.
*   **Act III — Into the Pines (Sessions 10–15):** The party ventures deep into the Pine Barrens to the devil's lair—the ruins of the original Leeds homestead. They must perform a dangerous ritual to either break the curse permanently or bind the Jersey Devil, all while protecting the latest cursed child from being claimed by its monstrous heritage.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Jersey Devil (Original)** — *The Firstborn Curse*
    *   **Role:** The first thirteenth child, transformed nearly 300 years ago. Now a monstrous entity haunting the Pine Barrens.
    *   **Personality:** Bestial and cunning, driven by rage and hunger. However, it retains fragments of human intelligence and is deeply lonely, seeking others like itself.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The original devil doesn't want to be a monster. Part of it seeks death and release from the curse, but the devil essence won't allow it to die.

3.  **Silas Mortimer** — *The Cult Leader*
    *   **Role:** Leader of the Devil Worshippers, a secret society that venerates the Jersey Devil as a dark god of the wilderness.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic and fanatical. He believes the devils are a higher form of existence and seeks to transform himself through the curse.

4.  **Reverend Josiah Crane** — *The Historian*
    *   **Role:** An elderly minister and historian who has studied the Leeds curse for decades.
    *   **Personality:** Knowledgeable, cautious, and haunted by his research. He has seen what the curse does to people.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of hereditary sin, the price of ambition, and the struggle between fate and free will. The central conflict is whether the curse can be broken or if the Leeds family is doomed to produce monsters for eternity. The players must decide whether to save Emma's child, mercy-kill it before it transforms, or find a way to end the curse once and for all—knowing that doing so may require terrible sacrifices.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Curse Manifestation**
*   As Emma's pregnancy progresses, her unborn child begins manifesting devil traits (visible through magic or medical examination).
*   The DM tracks **Curse Progression** on a 10-point scale. Every failure to protect Emma, every delay, and certain plot events increase the progression.
*   At 10 points, the child will be born fully transformed into a devil. The players must act before this happens.

### 2. **Barrens Navigation**
*   The Pine Barrens are disorienting and dangerous. The DM can call for **Survival checks** to navigate.
*   Failing a check doesn't just mean getting lost—it might mean stumbling into the devil's territory, encountering the cult, or discovering something horrific.
*   Locals can serve as guides, but not all of them can be trusted.

### 3. **Ritual Components**
*   To break the curse, the players must gather three components:
    *   **The Original Pact:** A document signed in blood, hidden in colonial archives.
    *   **Blood of the Firstborn Devil:** A sample from the original Jersey Devil (requiring a dangerous hunt).
    *   **A Saint's Relic:** A blessed artifact held by Reverend Crane, who must be convinced to part with it.
*   Each component requires a mini-quest and difficult moral choices.
