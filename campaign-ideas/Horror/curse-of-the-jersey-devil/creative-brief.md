# Creative Brief: Curse of the Jersey Devil

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Colonial Gothic Wilderness

Inspired by American colonial gothic horror and the oppressive atmosphere of dense wilderness, blending historical authenticity with supernatural dread. This style captures the isolation of the Pine Barrens, the weight of colonial-era sins, and the monstrous nature of the Jersey Devil.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Wild Isolation:** Describe dense, tangled forests, twisted pines, and the claustrophobic feeling of being surrounded by nature.
*   **Blend Colonial and Monstrous:** Highlight the contrast between colonial-era architecture and the savage, demonic presence of the devil.
*   **Focus on Hereditary Horror:** Show visual connections between past and present—family resemblances, inherited traits, the weight of bloodlines.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Cursed, colonial, gothic, monstrous, hereditary, wild, isolated, demonic, ancestral sin.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of being trapped by history and bloodlines. The atmosphere should be oppressive and claustrophobic, with the woods themselves feeling hostile. The past is never truly dead.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic with an emphasis on gnarled, organic forms for the forest and sharp, angular forms for the devil. Colonial architecture should feel weathered and authentic.
*   **Forms:** Twisted pine trees, colonial homes in various states of decay, the Jersey Devil as a hybrid monstrosity (horse head, bat wings, hooved legs, forked tail).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed digital painting in a realistic gothic style. The focus is on a weathered colonial-era homestead surrounded by twisted pine trees. The wood is dark and aged, and the windows are boarded. The style emphasizes the weight of history and decay."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dark, earthy tones dominated by browns, dark greens, and grays. Occasional warm oranges and reds for firelight and blood. The devil itself has a sickly greenish-brown hide.
*   **Atmosphere:** Cold and unwelcoming, with a perpetually overcast or twilight feeling.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, earthy color palette of browns, deep greens, and gray skies. The scene is punctuated by the warm glow of lantern light from windows and the sickly green-brown of the creature's hide in the shadows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are working-class colonial-era or modern rural Americans, dressed practically (work clothes, bonnets, flannel, jeans).
*   **The Jersey Devil:** A horrific chimera approximately 8-10 feet long. It has the muscular body of a large goat or horse, bat-like wings spanning 12-15 feet, a long neck ending in a horse-like head with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth, clawed forearms, hooved hind legs, and a long, whip-like forked tail. Its hide is dark greenish-brown and leathery.
*   **Leeds Family:** Show subtle family resemblances across generations. Some may have inherited minor devil traits (unusual eyes, sharp teeth) that hint at the curse.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Jersey Devil perched on a broken tree branch. It has a muscular, quadrupedal body like a large goat, massive bat wings folded against its sides, a long serpentine neck, and a horse-like head with glowing red eyes and bared fangs. Its hide is dark and leathery with a greenish-brown tone. The creature radiates menace and unnatural presence."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The Pine Barrens in all its oppressive glory: dense forests of stunted pines, dark bogs filled with stagnant water, abandoned colonial structures, fog-shrouded paths.
*   **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic and maze-like. The forest feels endless and hostile.
*   **Details:** Moss-covered stones, gnarled roots creating obstacles, broken fences, colonial graveyards, and the occasional glimpse of red eyes in the darkness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A scene deep in the Pine Barrens. Twisted pine trees create a dense canopy that blocks most sunlight. The ground is covered in fallen needles and twisted roots. A narrow, overgrown path winds through the forest. Fog creeps along the ground, and the atmosphere is oppressive and unwelcoming."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dappled forest light during the day, with deep shadows beneath the canopy. Nighttime scenes use moonlight and artificial light sources (lanterns, torches) to create pools of light in overwhelming darkness.
*   **Shadows:** Long and distorted, suggesting hidden threats. The devil is often partially hidden in shadow.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates a sense of the wilderness being barely held at bay by civilization's light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the pale moonlight filtering through the pine canopy, creating dappled shadows on the forest floor. A lantern held by a character creates a small pool of warm light, but the surrounding darkness feels oppressive and alive."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often frames characters as small figures in vast, hostile wilderness. Uses vertical compositions to emphasize the height of trees and the devil's wingspan.
*   **Techniques:** Use the forest to create natural frames and tunnels that focus attention. Show the devil from below to emphasize its size and the threat it poses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot of the Jersey Devil standing on a hill against a stormy sky. Its wings are spread wide, silhouetted against dark clouds. The composition emphasizes its monstrous size and otherworldly presence."

## Voice

A weathered, female voice with a slight Southern/Mid-Atlantic regional accent, speaking in a tone of warning and sorrow. The pacing is measured and careful, as if sharing dangerous knowledge. The emotion is one of deep sadness mixed with fear—someone who has lost family to the curse and knows its terrible power. Audio quality is warm but slightly hollow, as if recorded in a wooden room. Role: A Leeds family descendant who escaped the curse but lost everything to it, now warning others.
