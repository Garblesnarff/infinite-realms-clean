# The Extinction Protocol
**Tagline:** *Welcome to work. Your shift starts now. Only one employee leaves alive.*

## Campaign Overview

Seventy-five employees of Concordia Solutions arrive for another normal day at their sealed corporate tower. Then the building locks down, all communications are severed, and a voice over the intercom announces the Extinction Protocol: kill thirty people in two hours, or explosives in your heads will detonate. Welcome to the most horrifying team-building exercise imaginable.

This campaign is claustrophobic corporate horror. Players are ordinary office workers—accountants, IT staff, secretaries, janitors—thrust into survival mode. There are no weapons training, no combat expertise, just desperate people with improvised weapons in a familiar environment turned deadly. Moral lines blur as coworkers become threats, survival instincts override humanity, and the social contract of civilization collapses in minutes.

Between killing phases, players discover their company has been experimenting with extreme social psychology, military applications, and human behavior under stress. The Protocol was always planned. Some employees are plants. Nothing was ever normal.

## Core Themes
- **Civilized Veneer:** How thin society's rules really are
- **Workplace as Prison:** Familiar space turned hostile
- **Moral Degradation:** From coworker to killer
- **Class Warfare:** Management vs. workers, even here
- **Obedience to Authority:** Voice commands mass murder
- **Found Family Betrayal:** Killing people you know

## Key NPCs

**Office Workers/Players:**
- Barry (Middle management, first to crack)
- Maria (Secretary, resourceful survivor)
- Tech Jim (IT, finds hacking solutions)
- Dex (Janitor, knows building secrets)
- Amanda (New hire, maintains humanity longest)
- The Accountant (Psychopath, thrives)

**The Voice:** Intercom announcer, calm and clinical, impossible to locate, gives updates on death counts and time remaining.

**CEO Marcus Voss:** In penthouse, watching. Orchestrated everything. Military contract justification. Sociopath.

**Security Chief:** Armed, enforces protocol. Might be reasoned with. Or not.

**Plants:** Some employees secretly hired for this. Trained fighters disguised as workers. Revealed gradually.

## Major Locations

**The Corporate Tower (30 floors):**
- Lobby (sealed, electric barriers)
- Office floors (cubicles, conference rooms, supplies)
- IT department (computer access)
- Maintenance (tools, weapons)
- Cafeteria (food, kitchen knives)
- Security office (monitors, weapons)
- Roof (locked, helicopter there)
- Basement (power, secrets)
- Penthouse (CEO command center)
- Bathrooms (hiding spots, ambush points)
- Stairwells (choke points)
- Elevators (death traps)

## Unique Mechanics

**Explosives in Heads:** Surgically implanted (in "employee health screening"). Tamper-proof, detonate on protocol violation. Remote detonation capability. Constant threat.

**Kill Quotas:** Must be met or mass execution. Creates moral forcing function. Encourages betrayal. Time limits increase pressure.

**Office Weapons:** No guns initially. Improvised weapons (staplers, scissors, cables, fire extinguishers, letter openers, keyboard, monitor, chair, toxic cleaning chemicals). Creative kills.

**Sanity and Moral Decay:** Track psychological state. First kill hardest. Gets easier (horrifyingly). Some break, some thrive. Trauma accumulates.

**Faction Dynamics:** Groups form based on floors/departments. Management vs. workers tension. Some try to maintain humanity, others embrace violence. Betrayal inevitable.

**Hidden Information:** Building has secrets. Company documents reveal truth. Security feeds show everything. Knowledge is power and curse.

**The Watchers:** Employees being monitored for military contract. Behavior data being collected. Expendable test subjects.

## Plot Twists
- One player character was plant all along
- CEO is military contractor testing for urban warfare
- This isn't first Protocol (other buildings)
- Survivors will be silenced or recruited
- Government knows and approved
- Some employees volunteered for money
- Building can't actually be escaped (or can it?)
- Everything filmed for analysis
- One employee is CEO's daughter in disguise
- Final survivor offered job running next Protocol

## Victory Conditions
- **Sole Survivor:** Outlive everyone, "win" the game
- **Rebellion:** Kill CEO and guards, expose conspiracy
- **Escape:** Find impossible exit route
- **Sacrifice:** Die saving others, moral victory

## Defeat Conditions
- **Killed by Coworker:** Murdered in office
- **Head Explosion:** Protocol violation
- **Execution:** Non-compliance with quota
- **Suicide:** Can't handle guilt/horror
- **Survivor's Hell:** Live but destroy
