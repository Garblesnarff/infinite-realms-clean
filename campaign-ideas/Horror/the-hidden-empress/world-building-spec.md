### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Hidden Empress**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Someone reincarnated into a fantasy RPG world as the villainess character—destined for terrible bad ends in every story route. Terrified of triggering these endings, they secretly grinded to Level 99 before the story began. Now absurdly overpowered, they must navigate the academy storyline while hiding their overwhelming strength, avoiding bad end triggers, and dealing with the comedy that arises when someone god-tier tries to appear average. The campaign is power fantasy comedy about being too powerful and trying desperately to hide it.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Kingdom of Astraea—standard fantasy realm where the RPG "Swords & Sorcery Academy" is set.
    *   Explain the Royal Academy's history and role as training ground for heroes and nobles.
    *   Chronicle the original RPG's storyline—protagonist arrives, befriends allies, defeats villainess, saves kingdom from demon threat.
    *   Describe the villainess's bad ends in original game: exile ending, execution ending, monster transformation ending, sealed ending.
    *   Write how someone from Earth reincarnated as Elara Valorian with full memory of the game.
    *   Detail Elara's paranoid grinding phase—age 10-15, secretly clearing dungeons meant for high-level parties.
    *   Explain the Level System and how it normally works vs. how Elara broke it through obsessive grinding.
    *   Chronicle the appearance of The System—mysterious RPG interface that appeared to Elara and enabled her power.
    *   Describe how most people reach Level 5-10 in lifetime, elite adventurers hit Level 15-20, and Level 99 is theoretical maximum.
    *   Detail the demon lord threat that wasn't in original game—new content appearing in real world.

**7. RPG Mechanics System**
*   **Philosophy:** This world operates on RPG logic made literal. Levels, stats, and game mechanics are real and visible to some.

*   **The Level System:**
    *   Levels 1-5: Common people, basic competence.
    *   Levels 6-10: Skilled professionals, veteran soldiers.
    *   Levels 11-15: Elite adventurers, exceptional talents.
    *   Levels 16-20: Legendary heroes, ancient wizards, demon lords.
    *   Levels 21-99: Theoretical maximum, considered impossible to reach.
    *   Elara: Level 99, broke system through obsessive grinding.

*   **The System Interface:**
    *   Visible to Elara and Caelus (reincarnated).
    *   Shows stats, levels, skills, quests, inventory.
    *   Provides meta-information about story events and bad end flags.
    *   Occasionally offers guidance through mysterious messages.
    *   Questions: Who created it? Why does it exist? What's its goal?

*   **Bad End Mechanics:**
    *   Specific triggers based on original RPG routes.
    *   Accumulating flags leads to bad ending unless prevented.
    *   Kindness, humility, and genuine friendship prevent flags.
    *   Power itself isn't bad end trigger—misuse of power is.

**8. Elara's Grinding History**
*   **Age 10:** Reincarnates with memories, realizes she's the villainess, panics about bad ends.
*   **Age 10-11:** Secretly begins training, discovers The System, learns she can level.
*   **Age 12-13:** Solo-clears dungeons meant for parties, rapidly levels, becomes addicted to safety through power.
*   **Age 14:** Reaches Level 50, surpasses legendary heroes, continues grinding out of paranoia.
*   **Age 15:** Hits Level 99, maximum stats, has cleared every dungeon in kingdom solo.
*   **Age 16:** Academy begins, must hide years of obsessive power-gathering.
*   **Campaign Start:** Age 17, desperate to maintain Level 3 cover story despite being maximum level.

**9. The Bad Endings (Original Game)**
*   **Exile Ending:** Villainess bullies protagonist, loses in confrontation, exiled from kingdom.
*   **Execution Ending:** Villainess plots against royalty, discovered, publicly executed.
*   **Monster Transformation:** Villainess uses forbidden magic, transforms into monster, slain by heroes.
*   **Sealed Ending:** Villainess becomes too powerful, sealed away for eternity.
*   **Elara's Goal:** Avoid all these by being genuinely kind while hiding overwhelming power.

**10. Malachar's Arrival**
*   **Why He Appears:** Not part of original game—this world is more than just the RPG.
*   **His Goal:** Seeks worthy opponents, bored with weak resistance.
*   **Level:** 20, genuinely powerful, first time Elara faces peer-level threat.
*   **Recognition:** Senses Elara's true power, becomes interested in her specifically.
*   **Philosophical:** Respects strength, doesn't understand why she hides it.
*   **Resolution:** Can be defeated, redeemed, or become recurring rival depending on Elara's approach.

**11. Timeline (If Elara Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Elara hides in academy, avoids everyone, never forms party. Isolated and paranoid.
*   **Session 2:** Fails to help protagonist, he struggles against threats meant to be easy.
*   **Session 3:** Distances self from story events, bad ends not triggered but no growth.
*   **Session 4:** Rival nobles escalate without intervention, create hostile environment.
*   **Session 5:** Festival occurs without Elara's participation, misses friendship opportunities.
*   **Session 6:** Malachar arrives, Elara refuses to fight publicly.
*   **Session 7:** Kingdom falls because strongest defender stayed hidden.
*   **Session 8:** Elara survives but lives in ruins, alone. Avoided bad ends but created worse outcome—loneliness and failure to help. Power without purpose is hollow.

This specification creates a world where RPG mechanics are literal, meta-knowledge creates comedy and opportunity, and the greatest challenge isn't combat but social navigation. The campaign explores what happens when someone min-maxes for safety but learns that genuine connection and kindness matter more than power levels.
