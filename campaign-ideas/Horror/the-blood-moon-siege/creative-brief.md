# Creative Brief: The Blood Moon Siege

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Zombie Apocalypse (7 Days to Die-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty, voxel-based aesthetic of *7 Days to Die*, blending realistic zombie horror with crafted fortifications and post-apocalyptic decay. This style emphasizes the tension between fortified safety and the overwhelming, relentless undead hordes.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Post-Apocalyptic Decay:** Everything is weathered, broken, and repurposed. Buildings are crumbling, fortifications are makeshift.
*   **Zombie Grotesque:** Zombies are horrific—rotting flesh, exposed bones, unnatural movements.
*   **Blood Moon Horror:** The Blood Moon creates an eerie, ominous atmosphere—red skies, shadows, and the sense of impending doom.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tense, escalating dread, strategic, horde defense, apocalyptic, cyclical terror, undead.
*   **Feeling:** Constant preparation for the next siege, mixed with dread as the Blood Moon approaches. Moments of calm shattered by overwhelming violence.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic with slight stylization. Rough, weathered textures for environments. Grotesque, decaying forms for zombies.
*   **Forms:** Buildings are broken and fortified with crude barriers. Zombies shamble unnaturally, with twisted limbs and decaying flesh.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gritty, realistic digital painting of a post-apocalyptic town. Buildings are crumbling, with makeshift wooden barriers and barbed wire. Grotesque zombies shamble through the streets."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated, muted colors for normal days. Eerie red dominates during Blood Moons.
*   **Normal Colors:** Grays, browns, dusty greens, faded blues.
*   **Blood Moon Colors:** Deep reds, ominous blacks, sickly greens (zombie decay), harsh shadows.
*   **Accent Colors:** The orange glow of fires, the metallic glint of fortifications, the red of blood.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette dominated by deep, ominous reds and blacks for the Blood Moon sky. The landscape below is cast in shadow, with the sickly green glow of zombie eyes punctuating the darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers in practical, scavenged post-apocalyptic gear (torn clothing, makeshift armor, improvised weapons).
*   **Zombies:** Horrifically detailed—rotting flesh, exposed bones, missing limbs, glowing eyes. Various types (basic, feral, demolisher) are visually distinct.
*   **Expression:** Adventurers show exhaustion, determination, and fear. Zombies are mindless, horrifying, and relentless.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer in scavenged tactical gear, holding a makeshift spiked club and a shotgun. Their face is dirty and exhausted. Behind them, a grotesque zombie with rotting flesh and glowing eyes reaches out."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic post-apocalyptic towns and wilderness, with a mix of decay and fortification.
*   **Atmosphere:** Desolate and dangerous. Fortified bases are beacons of safety in a hostile world.
*   **Details:** Crumbling buildings, abandoned vehicles, makeshift barriers (wood, metal, barbed wire), spike traps, and the ever-present threat of wandering zombies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A post-apocalyptic town street: crumbling buildings, abandoned cars, and a fortified police station with wooden barriers, barbed wire, and spike traps. Zombies wander in the distance."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, contrasting lighting during the day. Eerie, red-tinted lighting during Blood Moons. Dark shadows at night.
*   **Shadows:** Deep shadows hide zombies and create tension. Firelight and flashlights create small pools of safety.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the safety of fortifications (light) versus the danger outside (darkness, Blood Moon red).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the eerie, blood-red light of the Blood Moon. Shadows stretch long and dark, and the silhouettes of zombies are everywhere. A fortified building glows with warm firelight, a small island of safety."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide shots showing hordes of zombies approaching fortifications. Close-ups of tense defensive moments.
*   **Techniques:** Use aerial views to show the scale of the horde. Frame defenders against the overwhelming numbers. Show the contrast between fortified bases and the chaos outside.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An aerial, wide-angle shot of a fortified police station surrounded by hundreds of zombies during a Blood Moon. The red sky casts an ominous glow. Defenders on the roof fire down at the horde below."

## Voice

A grim, weary male voice with a gruff American accent, pacing that is terse and urgent, conveying exhaustion and the weight of survival. The emotion is a mix of grim determination and suppressed fear. Audio quality is raw, with ambient sounds of distant moans, gunfire, and the crackle of fires. Role: A survivor recounting the horror of the Blood Moons, or a radio broadcast warning others about the approaching horde.
