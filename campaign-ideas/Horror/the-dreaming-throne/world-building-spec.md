### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Dreaming Throne**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The Dreamweaver, one of the Endless Siblings who embody fundamental concepts of existence, has been captured and imprisoned for a century. In their absence, the Dreaming—the realm where all stories, myths, and dreams exist—has begun to collapse into nightmare. The party must navigate the surreal landscape of the Dreaming, encountering mythological figures, living stories, and impossible architecture as they seek to restore the realm and free its sovereign before reality and dream become fatally entangled.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the nature of the Endless—seven siblings who embody Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium. Explain their roles in the cosmic order.
    *   Write the history of how the Dreamweaver was captured by a mortal sorcerer a century ago, using forbidden rituals.
    *   Describe the structure of the Dreaming as it was meant to be—its kingdoms, its inhabitants, and its purpose in the multiverse.
    *   Explain what has happened to the Dreaming in the Dreamweaver's absence—the rise of the Nightmare Court, the destabilization of stories, the bleed into reality.
    *   Detail the relationship between dreams and reality—how mortal dreams sustain the Dreaming, and how the Dreaming influences mortal creativity and consciousness.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Endless Siblings** (Major - Cosmic Powers)
        *   **Goals:** Each sibling embodies and maintains their aspect of existence (Destiny: fate, Death: endings, Dream: stories and dreams, etc.).
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy—they are equals, siblings, but Destiny is eldest and Death is wisest.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To maintain the fundamental forces of reality.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has personal conflicts and relationships that sometimes supersede cosmic duty. Despair orchestrated Dream's imprisonment out of sibling concern.
        *   **Assets:** Infinite power within their domains, galleries and realms representing their aspects.
        *   **Relationships:** Complex family dynamics—love, resentment, ancient grudges, unspoken affections.
    *   **The Nightmare Court** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain order in the Dreaming in the Dreamweaver's absence; for some, maintain power even if the Dreamweaver returns.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Corinthian, includes other autonomous nightmares and corrupted dreams.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To keep the Dreaming from complete collapse.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some genuinely want to help; others have grown to enjoy ruling; the Corinthian is conflicted, trying to be more than he was created to be.
        *   **Assets:** Control of the Gallery of Nightmares, fear-based powers, knowledge of mortal anxieties.
        *   **Relationships:** Tenuous alliance among nightmares who normally oppose each other; feared by other dream-beings.
    *   **The Keepers of Stories** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Preserve and maintain the stories, myths, and tales that reside in the Dreaming.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Lucien the Librarian, includes archivists, muses, and living stories.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect the Library and Theater from corruption.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Lucien knows the Dreamweaver's flaws and is uncertain whether their return will be good for the Dreaming.
        *   **Assets:** The Library of Unwritten Tales, knowledge of all narratives, ability to enter any story.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral toward the Nightmare Court, loyal to the Dreamweaver but not blindly so.
    *   **The Escaped Dreams** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Exist freely in the waking world rather than being confined to the Dreaming.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Chaotic—individual dreams and nightmares that have broken free.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they're forces of chaos.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some seek to become "real," others simply follow their nature without the Dreamweaver's control.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to manifest in reality, influence over sleeping mortals.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by both the Nightmare Court and those loyal to the Dreamweaver.

    *   **Despair of the Endless:** The Dreamweaver's sibling who orchestrated the imprisonment out of misguided concern.
    *   **Death of the Endless:** The wisest and kindest of the Endless, who appears to guide the party at crucial moments.
    *   **The Curator of Nightmares:** Guardian of the Gallery, believes nightmares serve a vital purpose.
    *   **The Trickster (Puck-figure):** Has taken over the Theater, gleefully disrupting stories to keep them alive.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully complete and stabilize an unfinished story in the Library.
    *   **THEN:** In the waking world, an author suddenly completes a long-abandoned work; the characters from that story become stable allies in the Dreaming; Lucien's trust in the party increases.
    *   **IF:** The players defeat or befriend their personal nightmares in the Gallery.
    *   **THEN:** Each character gains a permanent boon related to overcoming that fear; the Curator becomes an ally; the rabid nightmares become less aggressive.
    *   **IF:** The players perform successfully in the Theater of Fables.
    *   **THEN:** Mythological figures treat them as peers; they gain the attention of the Endless (who were watching); the Trickster becomes a chaotic ally rather than opponent.
    *   **IF:** The players ally with the Corinthian genuinely.
    *   **THEN:** He provides inside knowledge of the Nightmare Court; he struggles visibly with his nature, potentially leading to his redemption or tragic fall; other nightmares view the party with suspicion.
    *   **IF:** The players meet Death (one of the Endless).
    *   **THEN:** She provides crucial wisdom about the Dreamweaver's nature; characters confront their mortality; she offers to help but in unexpected ways; the tone becomes more contemplative.
    *   **IF:** The players win the Oldest Game against Despair.
    *   **THEN:** The Dreamweaver is freed; Despair accepts defeat with grace but warns of consequences; the party earns the respect of the Endless; the Dreaming begins restructuring.
    *   **IF:** The freed Dreamweaver begins punishing those who ruled in their absence.
    *   **THEN:** Allies like the Corinthian face destruction; the party must choose between loyalty to the Dreamweaver or protection of their friends; the Dreaming becomes more ordered but also more cruel.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to oppose the Dreamweaver's vengeance.
    *   **THEN:** They violate cosmic law, summoning the Kindly Ones; the Dreamweaver must face consequences; allies rally to the party's cause; the campaign moves toward the Dreamweaver's transformation.
    *   **IF:** The Dreamweaver transforms/dies and is reborn.
    *   **THEN:** The new Dreamweaver is shaped partly by the party's influence; the Dreaming stabilizes into a healthier form; reality and dream achieve better balance; characters must choose whether to stay or leave.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to remain in the Dreaming permanently.
    *   **THEN:** They become part of the Dreaming itself—living stories, new archetypes, or guardians of specific aspects; they lose their mortal forms but gain narrative immortality.
