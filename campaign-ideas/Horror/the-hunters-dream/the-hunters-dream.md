**Campaign Type / Genre:** Gothic Horror / Eldritch Truth / Beast Plague / Cosmic Ascension
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** Gothic horror, beast plague, eldritch truth, blood ministration, insight, cosmic ascension, Victorian nightmare
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party arrives in the Gothic city of Yharnam seeking the city's famed blood healing. They find a nightmare—the city is gripped by a beast plague, with citizens transforming into monsters. As Hunters bound to a mysterious otherworldly sanctuary called the Hunter's Dream, they must cleanse the plague while uncovering a terrible truth: the beasts are symptoms, not the disease. The real horror is the city's obsession with eldritch Old Blood, ancient Great Ones who grant knowledge at the cost of sanity, and the realization that understanding the truth may mean transcending humanity itself.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Insight System:** Gaining knowledge of the eldritch truth increases Insight, which both empowers and curses characters—revealing hidden horrors but inviting madness.
*   **Death and Resurrection:** The Hunter's Dream allows resurrection, but each death extracts a cost—memories, humanity, or service to unseen masters.
*   **Beast Transformation:** Characters risk becoming what they hunt. Violence and bloodlust accelerate beast transformation.
*   **Cosmic Revelation:** The truth is horrifying. Understanding the Great Ones and their plans may require sacrificing one's humanity.
*   **Multiple Endings:** Choices throughout determine whether characters remain human, become beasts, ascend to become Great Ones, or serve eternal as Hunters.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A progression from beast hunting to cosmic revelation across four acts.

*   **Act I — The Hunt (Sessions 1–4):** The party joins the Hunt, killing beasts in Yharnam's streets. They discover the Hunter's Dream—a supernatural sanctuary where they resurrect after death. The beasts were once human, transformed by the city's blood healing.
*   **Act II — The Truth Behind the Blood (Sessions 5–8):** The party investigates the Healing Church, discovering they've been using Old Blood—blood of Great Ones. This grants power but corrupts. They uncover conspiracies, forbidden rituals, and learn that the plague is punishment for humanity's hubris in seeking godhood.
*   **Act III — The Great Ones (Sessions 9–12):** The party confronts actual Great Ones—cosmic entities beyond human comprehension. They learn the terrible truth: the Great Ones seek surrogates for their lost children, and Yharnam is a breeding ground for worthy ascendants. The Hunt is a test.
*   **Act IV — Ascension or Damnation (Sessions 13–15):** The party must choose their fate: remain human and end the Dream (freeing themselves but dooming future Hunters), become beasts (surrendering to bloodlust), serve the Dream forever (as eternal Hunters), or consume Umbilical Cords to ascend and replace a Great One (transcending humanity but losing themselves).

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between humanity and transcendence. The party seeks to end the beast plague, but the truth reveals the plague is a side effect of humanity's attempt to commune with gods. The Great Ones offer knowledge, power, and ascension—but at the cost of sanity, humanity, and mortal limitations. The Hunt itself is a test to find those worthy of becoming gods. Players must decide: cling to humanity and remain limited, surrender to beasthood and power without thought, or ascend to cosmic consciousness and lose everything that made them human.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Insight System**
*   Characters gain Insight by witnessing eldritch truths, defeating Great Ones, or consuming special items.
*   High Insight reveals hidden enemies and truths but also causes madness, frenzy, and vulnerability to mental attacks.
*   At certain thresholds, the world changes—new enemies appear, NPCs act differently.

### 2. **The Hunter's Dream**
*   Characters resurrect here after death instead of dying permanently.
*   Each resurrection costs: memories fade, humanity decreases, or they owe service.
*   The Dream can be refused (true death) or accepted (eternal service).

### 3. **Beast Transformation**
*   Violence, bloodlust, and using beast-related powers accumulate Beasthood.
*   At high Beasthood, characters risk losing control and transforming into monsters.
*   This grants power but may result in loss of character control.

### 4. **Blood Ministration**
*   Healing and power through blood consumption (potions, transfusions).
*   Short-term benefits but accelerates Beasthood and Insight-related madness.

### 5. **Umbilical Cords**
*   Rare items (One Third of Umbilical Cord) that grant immense Insight.
*   Consuming three allows one to perceive and challenge Moon Presence.
*   Required for the Ascension ending.

### 6. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Submit:** Accept Gehrman's mercy. Wake up, forget everything, return to normal life.
*   **Refuse (Insufficient Insight):** Defeat Gehrman, become new Dream host, hunt forever.
*   **Refuse (Sufficient Insight + Cords):** Defeat Gehrman and Moon Presence, become infant Great One.
*   **Beast:** Succumb to transformation completely, join the beasts as an NPC.
