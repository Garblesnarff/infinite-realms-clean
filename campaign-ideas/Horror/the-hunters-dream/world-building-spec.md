### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Hunters Dream**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party arrives in Yharnam, a Victorian Gothic city famed for blood healing, during the Night of the Hunt when a beast plague transforms citizens into monsters. Contracted to the Hunter's Dream—a supernatural sanctuary allowing resurrection—they hunt beasts while uncovering the truth: the plague stems from the Healing Church's use of Old Blood from Great Ones (cosmic entities beyond comprehension). The Hunt is eternal, designed to find humans worthy of ascending to become Great Ones themselves. The party must choose: remain human, become beasts, serve as eternal Hunters, or consume forbidden knowledge to transcend mortality and become infant gods.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Chronicle Byrgenwerth's discovery: scholars found ancient ruins and encountered Great Ones, seeking to ascend humanity through communion with cosmic entities.
    *   Detail the split between Willem (seek knowledge/Insight) and Laurence (seek blood/power), leading to the founding of the Healing Church.
    *   Explain Old Blood: blood of Great Ones grants healing and power but causes beast transformation as humans cannot contain cosmic essence.
    *   Describe the beast plague's origin: overuse of Old Blood corrupts humans, revealing their inner beast nature.
    *   Chronicle the first Hunt and Gehrman's binding: to control the plague, the Moon Presence created the Hunter's Dream, binding Gehrman as eternal host to train Hunters.
    *   Detail Great Ones' nature: cosmic beings who exist in higher dimensions, can grant "eyes on the inside" (Insight), lost their own children and seek surrogates among worthy humans.
    *   Explain the Orphan of Kos: humans killed a Great One's child, cursing hunters to eternal nightmares until someone worthy ascends to replace what was lost.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Hunters (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Initially: cleanse the plague. Then: understand the truth. Finally: choose their fate.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Bound to the Dream; mentored by Gehrman; equals among themselves.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Kill beasts, protect humanity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each hunter has personal reasons for accepting the contract; some seek power, others redemption, some were drafted unwillingly.
        *   **Assets:** Bound to Hunter's Dream (resurrection), trick weapons, blood vials, increasing Insight and power.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve Gehrman (initially); opposed to beasts; gradually become aware of Great Ones' manipulation.
    *   **The Healing Church** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain control over Old Blood distribution, hide the truth about its origin, achieve communion with Great Ones.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Church hierarchy with Vicars at top; inner Choir knows truth; outer clergy and citizens kept ignorant.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Provide miraculous healing through blood ministration.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Experimenting with Old Blood to create ascended humans; hiding that they caused the plague.
        *   **Assets:** Political power, Old Blood reserves, hidden Great One connections, armies of church servants.
        *   **Relationships:** Controls Yharnam; opposed by Byrgenwerth scholars; uses Hunters to clean up their mistakes.
    *   **Byrgenwerth** (Minor - Historical)
        *   **Goals:** Were seeking to elevate human consciousness through Insight rather than blood.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Provost Willem; now mostly abandoned.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Scholarly pursuit of knowledge.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Willem knew the dangers of Old Blood and opposed the Church, but also committed his own sins (created Rom to hide the truth).
        *   **Assets:** Ancient knowledge, connection to Rom, understanding of Great Ones.
        *   **Relationships:** Rivals to the Healing Church; failed in their mission; Willem remains as warning.
    *   **The Great Ones** (Major - Cosmic)
        *   **Goals:** Seek surrogate children among humanity; maintain the Hunt to find worthy ascendants; incomprehensible cosmic purposes.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Multiple Great Ones with different natures: Moon Presence (controls Dream), Rom (hides truth), Orphan of Kos (vengeance), others.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. Humans barely comprehend they exist.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** "The Great Ones that inhabit the nightmare are sympathetic in spirit, and often answer when called upon."
        *   **Assets:** Cosmic power, higher-dimensional existence, ability to grant Insight and blessings, control over Nightmares.
        *   **Relationships:** Indifferent to human suffering; see humanity as potential children or tools; Moon Presence specifically maintains the Hunt.
    *   **The Hunter's Dream** (Minor - Mechanism)
        *   **Goals:** Perpetuate the Hunt; train hunters; find those worthy of ascension.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Moon Presence at top; Gehrman as host/prisoner; the Doll as caretaker; Hunters as temporary residents.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Sanctuary for hunters.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** A cage and testing ground. Resurrection isn't mercy—it's ensuring hunters can't escape until worthy or broken.
        *   **Assets:** Resurrection mechanism, weapon upgrades, Insight-based revelations.
        *   **Relationships:** Serves Moon Presence; binds Gehrman; offers salvation that's actually imprisonment.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A character's Insight reaches 15+.
    *   **THEN:** They can now see Insight-based enemies invisible to others. The Doll may speak differently to them. Gehrman recognizes them as "seeing the truth." Generate new enemy spawns and NPC dialogue shifts.
    *   **IF:** A character's Beasthood reaches 7+.
    *   **THEN:** They experience violent urges in combat. NPCs react with fear. They may attack allies during frenzies. Generate moments where player must resist beast nature.
    *   **IF:** The party kills Rom, the Vacuous Spider.
    *   **THEN:** The Blood Moon rises immediately. All of Yharnam changes: new enemies appear (Amygdalae become visible, cosmic horrors spawn), NPCs react with horror, the truth is revealed. This is a major campaign turning point.
    *   **IF:** A character dies and resurrects in the Hunter's Dream repeatedly (5+ times).
    *   **THEN:** Generate costs: they forget personal memories, NPCs they knew no longer recognize them, or the Dream takes something intangible (hope, compassion). Gehrman may comment on the toll.
    *   **IF:** The party consumes three One Third of Umbilical Cord items.
    *   **THEN:** Their Insight increases dramatically. They can now perceive Moon Presence. Generate visions of cosmic truth. They are now eligible for the Ascension ending.
    *   **IF:** The party confronts Gehrman and accepts his offer (mercy killing).
    *   **THEN:** Campaign ends. They wake from the Dream, freed but stripped of all Hunter abilities and memories. Yharnam's fate is unchanged—new hunters will be found.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses Gehrman but hasn't consumed three Umbilical Cords.
    *   **THEN:** They must fight Gehrman to the death. Victory means they replace him as host of the Dream—now eternally bound to train future hunters. This is the "Honored Hunter" ending.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses Gehrman AND has consumed three Umbilical Cords.
    *   **THEN:** After defeating Gehrman, the Moon Presence descends. They must fight a Great One. Victory means they consume the Moon Presence and become an infant Great One themselves—transcending humanity but losing their individual identity. This is the "Ascension" ending.
