# The Platinum Fork Trials
## "The Critics Who Can Make or Break Kingdoms"

### Campaign Overview

The Platinum Fork Society is the most feared organization in the culinary world—a secret group of food critics whose reviews can elevate restaurants to legendary status or destroy empires overnight. When a single critic gives their Platinum Fork award (only 10 ever given in history), that restaurant becomes immortal. When they condemn an establishment, it dies within a month. The party has been selected as this generation's Platinum Fork candidates, but they don't know why or by whom. They must travel the world, judging food and restaurants, wielding immense power while uncovering the Society's dark secrets.

As the party judges their way through increasingly elaborate and desperate culinary presentations, they discover the truth: The Platinum Fork Society doesn't just critique food—they magically bind their judgments to reality. A bad review literally curses a restaurant. A Platinum Fork award grants supernatural success. But this power corrupts, and previous generations of critics became tyrants, gods, or monsters. The party must decide how to use their newfound power: Reform the system, destroy it, or become the next generation of food dictators.

This campaign combines social intrigue, moral philosophy, and the terror of having too much power. Every meal reviewed is a life changed. Every word written becomes truth. The party holds fates in their hands, and everyone wants to influence their decisions through bribery, threats, seduction, or genuine excellence.
