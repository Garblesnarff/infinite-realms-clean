## Central Conflict

Beauty versus monstrosity, art versus obsession, love versus possession. Is the phantom a victim of cruelty who deserves compassion, or a murderer who must be stopped? Can Christine's agency be preserved while respecting her complicated feelings? The party must balance justice with mercy, recognizing that the phantom's art is genuine even as his actions are monstrous.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Musical Magic**
*   The phantom's music has supernatural power. His voice can charm, his compositions can inspire or terrify. Party must resist with wisdom saves.

### 2. **Secret Passages**
*   The opera house is riddled with hidden doors, passages, and mechanisms. Investigation checks reveal shortcuts and secrets.

### 3. **Performance Pressure**
*   If party members are performers, they must succeed at performance checks during shows. Failure opens them to the phantom's sabotage.

### 4. **The Phantom's Attention**
*   The phantom is always watching. Certain actions attract his wrath (threatening Christine, disrespecting his art) or curiosity (showing mercy, appreciating music).

### 5. **Gothic Atmosphere**
*   Random encounters with phantom's tricks—rose deliveries with threatening notes, voices in walls, "accidents" on stage. Builds dread.

### 6. **The Final Choice**
*   Campaign climax allows multiple resolutions—kill the phantom, redeem him through mercy, or enable Christine's agency to resolve it herself. Different endings based on party approach.
