# Creative Brief: The Hacker's Investigation

## Art Style: Nordic Noir / Gothic Industrial (Millennium Trilogy Aesthetic)

Inspired by Swedish crime fiction and David Fincher's film adaptation—cold Scandinavian landscapes, Gothic family estates, cyberpunk hacker culture, stark contrasts between old wealth and modern technology.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Desaturated Nordic winter colors—whites, grays, deep blacks, cold blues. Old Vanger estate is Gothic browns and shadows. Modern city scenes have neon highlights and screen glow. Blood and violence are shown in stark, un-romanticized ways. Snow everywhere—cold, isolating, preserving the past.

**Character Design:**
- **Lisbeth:** Punk aesthetic—heavy piercings, tattoos (including dragon), dark clothing, androgynous, deliberately anti-feminine presentation. Small, wiry, dangerous despite size. Multiple ear piercings, leather jacket, combat boots.
- **Henrik:** Elderly, dignified, tired, kind eyes, old-world gentleman
- **Martin:** Handsome, expensive suits, charming smile that never reaches his eyes, perfect corporate facade
- **Harriet (young):** Innocent 1960s fashion, trapped in old photographs
- **Harriet (old):** Weathered, cautious, Australian setting, dressed for different climate

**Environments:**
- Hedeby Island: Gothic, isolated, frozen in time, old family portraits watching
- Martin's Modern House: Minimalist Scandinavian design hiding dungeon beneath
- City Apartments: Small, cluttered with tech, hacker aesthetic
- Archives: Dusty basements, microfilm readers, piles of old newspapers
- Digital Spaces: Visualized as neon grids, encrypted walls, data streams

**Tone:** Cold, methodical, unflinching. Beauty in winter landscapes contrasts with human ugliness. Technology (screens, code) shown as glowing warmth against cold reality.

## Voice

**Lisbeth's Voice:** Rarely speaks. When she does, it's flat, direct, no social niceties. Working-class Swedish accent. States facts brutally. Doesn't explain or justify herself. Silence is her default. When angry, even quieter but more dangerous.

**Henrik's Voice:** Elderly, cultured, sad. Swedish formality with genuine warmth. Voice of someone carrying decades of family shame and one true grief.

**Martin's Voice:** Smooth, charming, corporate friendliness masking complete sociopathy. Could be selling you a car or describing murder with the same pleasant tone.

**Narrative Voice:** Cold, investigative, journalistic. Presents facts without moralizing. Let the horror speak for itself.

## Music Style

Nordic noir soundtrack—minimalist, cold, atmospheric. Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross style (from Fincher's film)—dark ambient drones, distorted piano, synthetic textures, industrial elements. Lisbeth's theme is harsh electronics and metal. Henrik's theme is mournful strings. Martin's theme is unsettlingly beautiful—gorgeous melody over disturbing undertones. Investigation scenes have ticking clock sounds, rhythmic typing, mechanical precision. The Vanger estate theme is Gothic organ and creaking wood. Silence is used prominently—long stretches without music to create discomfort. The dragon tattoo theme (Lisbeth's power) is fierce guitar and electronic warfare.
