The party is hired by retired industrialist Henrik Vanger to solve a 40-year-old mystery: the disappearance (presumed murder) of his beloved niece Harriet from the family's island estate. As they investigate the wealthy, corrupt Vanger family, they partner with Lisbeth Salander—a brilliant but damaged hacker with her own demons. The investigation uncovers decades of family darkness: Nazi collaboration, serial murder, sexual violence, and corruption, all while Lisbeth's own story of abuse and revenge runs parallel to the main mystery.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20–25 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Hiring (Sessions 1–4):** Henrik Vanger hires the party to solve Harriet's disappearance as his final wish. Introduction to the Vanger family—wealthy, dysfunctional, hiding secrets. Meeting Lisbeth Salander, the hacker investigator. Initial research reveals family Nazi ties and internal feuds.

*   **Act II — The Photographs (Sessions 5–10):** Discovering Harriet's photographs from before her disappearance showing mysterious numbers. Decoding them reveals biblical references to violent passages. Pattern emerges: these correspond to unsolved murders across the region. Harriet wasn't victim—she was investigating a serial killer.

*   **Act III — The Family Evil (Sessions 11–15):** The serial killer was Harriet's own father and brother, killing women for decades. Harriet discovered this and was murdered by her brother Martin Vanger—now a successful CEO. Confrontation with Martin on his estate, reveals his "playroom" where he continues his father's work. Martin dies (suicide/accident during confrontation).

*   **Act IV — Lisbeth's Revenge (Sessions 16–20):** Parallel storyline: Lisbeth's legal guardian Bjurman has been sexually abusing her. She takes brutal revenge. When he hires assassins to kill her in retaliation, the party must help her survive and expose the corruption network protecting abusers in power.

*   **Act V — Harriet Lives (Sessions 21–25):** Shocking discovery: Harriet survived and has been in hiding in Australia for 40 years, afraid her brother would find her. Reunion with Henrik. Resolution of Vanger family power struggle. But the larger conspiracy—the network of wealthy men protecting each other's crimes—remains, setting up ongoing campaign or sequel.

## Central Conflict

Seeking truth and justice in a world where wealth and power protect the guilty. The investigation reveals that the wealthy Vanger family has been enabled to commit atrocities for generations because of their status. Parallel to this, Lisbeth's story shows how institutions designed to protect vulnerable people instead enable their abuse. The central question: How do you achieve justice when the system itself is corrupt?

Themes: Power protecting power, the vulnerability of women in patriarchal systems, the difference between revenge and justice, the cost of uncovering truth.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Hacking System**
*   Characters with hacking skills (or Lisbeth) can infiltrate digital systems.
*   Mechanically: series of skill checks (Arcana for magical equivalent, Investigation, Stealth) with time pressure.
*   Successes reveal: financial records, emails, deleted files, digital surveillance.
*   Failures alert security systems or leave digital fingerprints.

### 2. **The Cold Case Investigation**
*   Clues are 40 years old: witnesses dead, memories faded, evidence degraded.
*   Players must piece together: old photographs, newspaper archives, family interviews, police reports.
*   Create visual timeline board to track events of the day Harriet disappeared.

### 3. **The Biblical Code**
*   Harriet's photographs contain numbers corresponding to Bible verses about violence.
*   Decoding reveals pattern of unsolved murders.
*   Players must research both scripture and old crime records.

### 4. **Trust and Trauma**
*   Lisbeth's cooperation depends on earned trust. She won't open up immediately.
*   Mechanics: track "Trust Points" with Lisbeth unlocking her skills and backstory.
*   Betraying her trust has severe consequences.

### 5. **Wealth and Influence**
*   The Vanger family can use money and connections as weapons.
*   Antagonists can: hire legal teams, bribe officials, manipulate media, hire assassins.
*   Party must be clever rather than direct—attacking powerful enemies openly fails.

### 6. **Dual Investigation Tracks**
*   Main plot: Harriet's disappearance
*   Subplot: Lisbeth's revenge against Bjurman
*   These eventually interconnect through broader conspiracy themes.

### 7. **The Photographic Evidence**
*   Analyzing old photographs for details: reflections, backgrounds, who's missing from gatherings.
*   One crucial photo shows someone in a window during Harriet's disappearance.
