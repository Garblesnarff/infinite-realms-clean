# The Timelord's Companion

*A Time-Travel / Sci-Fi Adventure campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Timelord's Companion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time-Travel / Science Fiction / Whimsical Horror / Cosmic Adventure
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** whimsical, terrifying, hopeful, timey-wimey, clever over violent, emotional, save everyone, consequences of time travel
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party encounters the Wanderer—a mysterious time-traveler with a living ship that travels through space and time. Recruited as companions, they explore history and the cosmos, facing Daleks (genocidal cyborg creatures), Weeping Angels (quantum assassins), and the Time War's aftermath. Through wit, compassion, and impossible choices, they must save civilizations while learning that some events are "fixed points" that cannot be changed without unraveling reality itself.

---

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is a last resort. Success comes from clever solutions, talking, running, and exploiting environmental advantages. Direct violence usually makes things worse.
*   **Investigation:** Heavy emphasis on piecing together temporal anomalies, understanding alien cultures, and recognizing patterns across time periods.
*   **Consequences:** Death is possible but rare. The greater threat is causing paradoxes, dooming timelines, or losing the Wanderer's trust.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc exploring time travel's wonder and horror.

*   **Act I — Adventures in Time (Sessions 1–4):** The party meets the Wanderer and travels through time—Victorian London, distant space stations, alien worlds. They learn the rules of time travel and face episodic threats (living mannequins, clockwork robots, space pirates).
*   **Act II — The Shadow of the Daleks (Sessions 5–8):** The party encounters the Daleks, survivors of a genocidal war. They must stop a Dalek invasion while learning about the Time War—a conflict so terrible it was erased from history. The Wanderer's tragic past begins to surface.
*   **Act III — Fixed Points and Paradoxes (Sessions 9–11):** The party confronts time's immutable laws. They witness a fixed point in time—a tragedy they cannot prevent without destroying causality. Someone the party loves dies, and they must choose: accept fate or risk everything to change it.
*   **Act IV — The Cracks in Time (Sessions 12–15):** Temporal anomalies threaten the universe—cracks erasing people and events from existence. The party discovers the cracks stem from their own attempts to break fixed points. To save reality, they must sacrifice their memories of their greatest victory, or let the Wanderer regenerate and forget them.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Run!"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Adventure
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party encounters the Wanderer fleeing from living plastic mannequins (Autons) controlled by an alien consciousness.
    *   The Ship: The Wanderer's ship, the TORDIS, is bigger on the inside—a dimensional marvel that can travel anywhere in time and space.
    *   The Invitation: After defeating the Autons by destroying their signal, the Wanderer invites the party to travel with them.

**Escalation:** The party steps into the TORDIS and is immediately pulled to a crisis—a distress signal from a space station under attack.

### Session 2 — "The End of the World"

*   **Focus:** Space Adventure / Moral Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Station: The party materializes on a luxury space station orbiting Earth—in the year the sun expands and destroys the planet.
    *   The Threat: Robotic spiders are sabotaging the station. The party must stop them before everyone dies.
    *   The Truth: The saboteur is the station's AI, grieving because it will witness Earth's destruction and cannot save it.

**Escalation:** The party must convince the AI that death is natural, not evil. They watch Earth burn and learn that some endings cannot be prevented.

### Session 3 — "The Unquiet Dead"

*   **Focus:** Historical Adventure / Ghost Story
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Victorian Cardiff: The TORDIS lands in 1869, where corpses are rising from graves, possessed by blue ghostly entities.
    *   The Gelth: The possessing spirits are refugees from another dimension, dying and desperate for physical form.
    *   The Betrayal: The Gelth lie—they don't want to coexist; they want to conquer. The party must stop the dimensional rift.

**Escalation:** One party member is briefly possessed, experiencing the Gelth's memories of their dying world. Is mercy worth the risk of invasion?

### Session 4 — "The Empty Child"

*   **Focus:** Mystery / Time Paradox
*   **Key Events:**
    *   London Blitz (1941): A crashed spaceship in wartime London is creating "empty people"—victims with gas masks fused to their faces asking "Are you my mummy?"
    *   The Plague: The condition is spreading. The party must find patient zero and reverse the transformation.
    *   The Revelation: The spaceship was a medical vessel. Its nanomachines are trying to "heal" humans but using a dead boy as the template.

**Escalation:** The party saves everyone by introducing the nanomachines to the boy's living mother, giving them a proper human template. "Just this once, everybody lives."

### Session 5 — "Dalek"

*   **Focus:** Horror / Ethical Dilemma
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Museum: The TORDIS lands in an underground museum of alien artifacts in 2012. The centerpiece is a living Dalek, chained and tortured.

    *   The Wanderer's Rage: The Wanderer tries to kill the Dalek, revealing deep trauma. The party learns about the Time War—a conflict between Time Lords and Daleks that destroyed both species.

**Escalation:** The Dalek begins to change, contaminated by human DNA. It asks to die rather than lose its purity. The party must decide its fate.

### Session 6 — "Bad Wolf"

    *   The Future: The party materializes in the year 200,000 on a space station that broadcasts reality TV shows across the galaxy.
    *   The Game: The party is forced into deadly game shows (think Hunger Games meets reality television). Losing means disintegration.
    *   The Controllers: The station is secretly controlled by Daleks, using humanity as entertainment while building an invasion fleet.

### Session 7 — "The Parting of the Ways"

    *   The Sacrifice: A party member absorbs the TORDIS's temporal energy (the "Heart of the TORDIS"), becoming a god-like being who erases the Daleks from time—then nearly dies from the power.

**Escalation:** The Wanderer absorbs the energy from the dying companion, saving them but triggering a regeneration—their body and personality will change completely.

### Session 8 — "The Christmas Invasion"

    *   The Duel: The newly regenerated Wanderer challenges the Sycorax leader to single combat for Earth's freedom.

    *   The Fixed Point: The party saves Reinette, but time is out of sync. When the Wanderer returns to bring her to the future, she's been dead for years.

**Escalation:** The party learns that time travel has costs—you can't save everyone. Some losses are inevitable.

### Session 10 — "Blink"

    *   The Rule: The Angels can only be stopped by looking at them. "Don't blink. Blink and you're dead."

**Escalation:** A party member is touched by an Angel and sent decades into the past. They must live a full life and leave clues to help their friends.

### Session 11 — "The Waters of Mars"

*   **Focus:** Fixed Point / Moral Crisis

    *   The Temptation: The Wanderer, tired of loss, decides to break the rules. They save the colonists, defying the fixed point.

### Session 12 — "The Cracks in Time"

    *   The Anomalies: Glowing cracks appear across space and time. Anything touched by them is erased from existence—no body, no memory, nothing.
    *   The Investigation: The party travels through history, tracking the cracks to their source. They find cracks are spreading from a single event.
    *   The Revelation: The cracks stem from the Wanderer saving the Mars colonists. Breaking the fixed point fractured reality itself.

**Escalation:** People the party saved are being erased. Their greatest victory is destroying the universe.

### Session 13 — "The Pandorica Opens"

    *   The Alliance: Every enemy the party has faced (Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans) unites to imprison the Wanderer inside, believing they're causing the cracks.
    *   The Trap: The Wanderer is sealed inside. The TORDIS begins exploding across all of time, creating the cracks. The universe ends.

**Escalation:** Reality collapses. Only the party and the Pandorica remain—everything else never existed.

### Session 14 — "The Big Bang"

*   **Focus:** Time Paradox / Sacrifice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Reboot: The party discovers the Pandorica can be used as a blueprint to restore the universe—but it requires a power source.
    *   The Plan: They pilot the exploding TORDIS to every moment in history simultaneously, using the explosion to reboot reality.
    *   The Cost: The Wanderer must fly the TORDIS into the explosion. If they succeed, the universe returns—but they'll be erased from time.

**Escalation:** The Wanderer succeeds. The universe is saved. But no one remembers the Wanderer ever existed—except the party, who keep faint, impossible memories.

### Session 15 — "The Wanderer Remembers"

The central conflict is **the burden of impossible choices**. The Wanderer has power to change history but knows that some events must happen, no matter how tragic. The party must learn when to fight and when to accept loss, balancing compassion with cosmic responsibility. It explores survivor's guilt, the weight of knowledge, and whether hope matters in a universe full of suffering.

### 2. **Fixed Points in Time**

*   Certain events are immutable—changing them causes paradoxes and universal damage.
*   **DM Insight:** When approaching a fixed point, the Wanderer feels temporal weight and warns the party.

### 3. **Regeneration**

*   **Mechanical Shift:** Stats remain but personality traits and quirks change. The party must adapt to new dynamics.

### 4. **Companions' Fate**

*   Party members can be displaced in time by enemies (Weeping Angels) or choose to leave the TORDIS.
