## What "Medium-High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Social Challenges:** Must convince the god of death through song, negotiation, and proving love exists.
*   **Inevitable Tragedy:** The myth says Orpheus fails. Can the party change fate?

## Key Locations

1.  **The World Above:** Locked in eternal winter because Persephone spends too long below. Poverty and starvation.
2.  **The Road to Hadestown:** Dangerous journey through liminal spaces—rivers, gates, trials.
3.  **Hadestown:** Industrial underworld—factories, walls being built forever, workers in identical gray. Dystopian and eternal.
4.  **Hades' Office:** Where contracts are signed and souls are owned. Also where negotiations happen.
5.  **The Walk Back:** The narrow path from death to life where one cannot look back.

## Central Conflict

Faith versus doubt, love versus pragmatism, free will versus fate. Eurydice chooses survival over waiting for spring that may never come. Orpheus chooses impossible quest over acceptance of loss. Hades has built a perfect system that runs on souls and cynicism. The question: can love survive in a world built on contracts and inevitability? Can you change a story everyone knows ends in tragedy?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Spring Song**
*   Orpheus's unfinished song has reality-altering power. As party helps complete it, weather changes, flowers bloom, even the dead can be moved.

### 2. **The Walk of Faith**
*   Final challenge is series of wisdom saves against doubt. The Fates whisper. Sounds fade. Orpheus must resist looking back to confirm Eurydice follows.

### 3. **Bargaining with Death**
*   Negotiating with Hades requires proving abstract concepts—that love exists, that art matters, that hope is rational. Performance and persuasion checks with massive stakes.

### 4. **The Worker's Wall**
*   In Hadestown, dead souls labor endlessly. Party can try to free them, but Hades owns their contracts. Legal and moral complexity.

### 5. **Seasonal Power**
*   Persephone's presence brings spring. When she's in Hadestown, winter reigns. Her mood affects the weather and difficulty of challenges.

### 6. **Tragic Fate**
*   Campaign allows multiple endings, but fate pushes toward tragedy. Changing the ending requires extraordinary effort and perfect execution. Still possible though.
