# Creative Brief: The Industrial Underworld

## Art Style: Folk Americana meets Industrial Dystopia

Inspired by Hadestown's unique aesthetic—Depression-era folk culture combined with industrial underworld, ancient Greek myth filtered through American roots music and factory imagery.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** The world above is cold blues and whites of winter, with warm amber candlelight. Hadestown is industrial grays, rust-reds, forge-orange, coal-black. Persephone brings green and gold spring colors. Orpheus and Eurydice wear warm browns and reds. The Fates are in shadow.

**Character Design:** Depression-era working clothes mixed with ancient Greek elements—Orpheus in simple tunic and suspenders with his lyre, Eurydice in worn dress and shawl, Hades in pinstripe suit and fedora like a 1930s industrialist, Persephone in flowing green with flowers wilting in Hadestown, Hermes in sharp traveling clothes and hat. Workers wear identical gray. Everything is timeless—simultaneously ancient and industrial revolution.

**Environments:** The world above as sparse winter poverty—simple homes, empty fields. Hadestown as massive industrial complex—factories, smokestacks, conveyor belts carrying souls, walls being built forever, everything is metal and concrete and fire. Hades' office is Art Deco luxury. The descent is through gates and rivers and liminal spaces.

**Action:** Orpheus singing and reality changing—flowers blooming, weather shifting. The descent through gates of the underworld. Workers building the wall in synchronized misery. The agonizing walk back with Eurydice following unseen. Orpheus turning at the last moment. Tragedy in motion.

## Voice

A voice of folk storytelling and Southern blues—can shift between narrator commenting on the tale, characters living it, and the Greek chorus of Fates. Sometimes a weathered storyteller on a porch, sometimes a factory worker's weary determination, sometimes a god's commanding power. American roots music vernacular mixed with mythic grandeur. The voice of someone who's heard this story before, knows the ending, hopes it changes anyway.

## Music Style

New Orleans jazz meets folk Americana meets ancient Greek—think Hadestown's incredible score. "Road to Hell" as rhythmic introduction with trombone and guitar. "Wait for Me" as desperate folk ballad. "Why We Build the Wall" as industrial work chant with ominous call-and-response. "Epic III" as the moment Orpheus's song moves even death, full orchestra and emotion. Mix of acoustic folk instruments, jazz brass, and industrial percussion. Songs tell the story and drive the plot. Music makes you believe love can change fate even though you know the myth's ending.
