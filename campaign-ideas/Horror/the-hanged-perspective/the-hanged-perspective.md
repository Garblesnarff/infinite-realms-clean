# The Hanged Perspective
## "See the World Upside-Down, Understand Everything"

### Campaign Overview

The party is captured, tried for crimes they may or may not have committed, and sentenced to hanging. But in the realm of the Hanged Man, execution is enlightenment. They hang upside-down from the World Tree, suspended between life and death, and from this inverted perspective, they see reality's true nature. What seemed important hangs below them. What seemed impossible is revealed as simple. The world makes sense only when viewed backwards.

The Hanged Prophet maintains this realm, teaching wisdom through suspension. But something has corrupted the tree—those who hang are no longer achieving enlightenment but descending into madness. The party must investigate while literally hanging, navigating a world where up is down, solutions require sacrifice, and understanding means letting go of everything you thought you knew.

The campaign explores perspective, sacrifice, and the wisdom that comes from complete vulnerability and surrender. To solve the mystery and free themselves, the party must willingly remain hanged, see what others cannot, and embrace the paradox that sometimes the only way forward is to stop struggling.

### Core Themes

- **Perspective Change**: Seeing differently reveals truth
- **Willing Sacrifice**: Power through surrender
- **Suspension and Patience**: Answers come when you stop forcing
- **Paradox and Reversal**: Opposites contain each other
- **Letting Go**: Release to achieve
- **Vulnerability as Strength**: Power in powerlessness

### Key NPCs

**The Hanged Prophet**: Wise through suspension, serene, teaches letting go
**The Hanging Master**: Forces others to hang, fears vulnerability, sympathetic villain
**The Inverted One**: Lives completely upside-down, enlightened, alien perspective
**The Mad Hanged**: Lost in madness from forced suspension, tragic victims
**The Enlightened Hanged**: Achieved wisdom, choosing to remain, peaceful
**The World Tree**: Sentient, suffering from corruption, speaks through creaking

### Major Locations

**The World Tree**: Massive tree from which all hang, connecting realms
**The Hanging Grounds**: Where suspension occurs, sacred and terrible
**The Inverted Village**: Settlement of upside-down dwellers, everything reversed
**The Root Corruption**: Source of poison, deep in tree's base
**The Crown of Letting Go**: Highest branch, ultimate sacrifice point

### Unique Mechanics

**Inverted Perspective**: While hanging, see hidden truths; solutions revealed through reversal; physical skills limited, mental skills enhanced

**Sacrifice System**: Give up capabilities to gain insight; more vulnerable = more aware; can sacrifice agency for wisdom

**Suspension Time**: Time flows differently while hanging; patience is power; rushing causes madness

**The Letting Go Mechanic**: Release control to solve puzzles; counterintuitive success; trust and surrender

### Plot Twists

**Your Crime Was Necessary**: What you were hanged for was actually good, just misunderstood; perspective reveals truth

**The Hanging Master Is You**: Future self that couldn't let go, became controlling; can be prevented

**Hanging Forever Is An Option**: Some choose never to come down, ultimate enlightenment or ultimate escape?

**The Tree Hangs From Something**: From inverted view, the tree itself is suspended; turtles all the way up

### Victory Conditions

**Enlightened Freedom**: Achieve wisdom through voluntary hanging, heal tree, release all; transformed understanding

**The New Prophets**: Choose to remain hanged permanently, teaching others; sacrifice ending

**Forced Release**: Defeat Hanging Master, free everyone, but lose the wisdom; liberation without enlightenment

### Defeat Conditions

**Permanent Hanging**: Stuck forever, unable to let go enough to achieve release; paradox trap
**Madness**: Forced suspension too long, enlightenment becomes insanity; broken minds
