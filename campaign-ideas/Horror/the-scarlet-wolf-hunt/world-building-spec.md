### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Scarlet Wolf Hunt**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When the last wolf-hunter bloodline fails their sacred trial and breaks an ancient binding, the primordial wolf spirit escapes its prison in Grandmother's house, wearing stolen faces and spreading lycanthropic corruption through the Dark Woods where the party—investigating missing travelers—must hunt a predator that hunts them back, discovering that the scarlet-cloaked Red is both their greatest ally and potentially their most dangerous enemy.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

    *   Write about Red's childhood training and the final trial she was meant to complete
    *   Detail the moment Red broke the binding trying to save her Grandmother
    *   Explain the stages of lycanthropic transformation and how it corrupts the soul

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Dark Woods** - Ancient forest where paths shift based on fear and lies, trees whisper warnings
*   **Grandmother's House** - Cottage existing in temporal loop, both safe haven and wolf's den simultaneously
*   **The Village at Forest's Edge** - Medieval settlement living in constant fear, protective symbols everywhere
*   **The Huntsman's Lodge** - Abandoned guild headquarters filled with silver weapons and tragic histories
*   **The Scarlet Path** - Blood-marked trail that promises safety but leads to traps and tests
*   **The Wolf-Mother's Den** - Deep cave system where primordial wolf births new corruption
*   **The Crossroads Stone** - Ancient fey marker where terrible bargains can be struck
*   **The Deepwood Clearing** - Site of Red's failed trial, nexus of curse's spreading
*   Each location represents different stages of the hunt and the corruption spreading through the woods

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the primordial wolf remains free THEN lycanthropic corruption spreads beyond the forest
*   IF Red completes her original trial THEN the binding can be restored properly
*   IF the Grandmother dies in the loop THEN the temporal anchor breaks and worse things escape
*   IF the party trusts the wrong "grandmother" THEN they're led into wolf's trap
*   IF lycanthropy infection isn't treated THEN party members begin transforming
*   IF silver weapons run out THEN the wolves become nearly impossible to truly kill
*   IF the village falls to fear THEN they begin sacrificing travelers to appease wolves
*   IF face-stealing isn't detected THEN the wolf infiltrates party using stolen identities
*   IF Mother Thorn's price is paid THEN curse-breaking knowledge is granted
*   IF the Woodwife is honored THEN forest paths briefly become navigable
*   IF all half-transformed are killed THEN potential allies are lost but infection slows
*   IF Red's brother is redeemed THEN powerful insider knowledge of wolf's plans is gained
*   IF the original binding is restored THEN Grandmother is trapped again in eternal sacrifice
*   IF the wolf is truly slain THEN its fey nature means it reforms unless properly contained
*   IF the party chooses to flee THEN the corruption follows them beyond the forest
