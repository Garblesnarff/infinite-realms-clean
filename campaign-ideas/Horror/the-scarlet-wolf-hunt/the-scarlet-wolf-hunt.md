## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Deception Everywhere:** NPCs lie, locations shift, memories can't be trusted—the wolf wears many faces.
*   **Transformation Horror:** Characters risk lycanthropy with permanent consequences for failing saves.
*   **Predator Tactics:** The wolf hunts them as much as they hunt it, using guerrilla tactics and terror.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** "Red" is both victim and monster, the Grandmother both protector and prey.
*   **Resource Depletion:** The dark forest drains supplies, hope, and sanity over time.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act descent into the dark woods where predator and prey roles constantly reverse.

*   **Act I — The Path Through the Woods (Sessions 1–4):** Missing travelers lead the party to a forest village on edge. They meet "Red," a scarred huntress who claims to protect travelers but acts strangely. The Grandmother's house becomes a safe haven—or so it seems. First wolf attacks reveal the creatures are intelligent, organized, and hunting with purpose. They discover ancient symbols marking wolf-hunter territories.

*   **Act II — What Big Eyes You Have (Sessions 5–8):** The party realizes the Grandmother in her house is sometimes the real grandmother, sometimes the wolf in disguise, sometimes something worse. They encounter other "Reds"—failed wolf hunters who've become half-transformed. The forest itself serves the wolf, with paths leading to nowhere and safe camps compromised. They learn the original Red made a deal with the primordial wolf and broke it, spreading the curse.

*   **Act III — The Better to Eat You With (Sessions 9–12):** The true scope emerges—the primordial wolf is an ancient fey spirit of hunger that corrupted the wolf-hunter bloodline. Red's grandmother was the last pure hunter who imprisoned it in the house using herself as bait. When Red tried to save her, she broke the binding. Now multiple wolves wear familiar faces while the real victims are trapped in the Grandmother's house existing in temporal loop. The party must hunt through layers of deception.

*   **Act IV — The Huntsman's Choice (Sessions 13–16):** They must decide whether to kill Red (stopping one vector of infection), restore the original binding (trapping Grandmother again), destroy the primordial wolf (risking releasing greater horrors), or finding Red's redemption through completing her original trial. The forest itself becomes a battleground with all the transformed hunters and wolves converging. Success means saving what can be saved and accepting that some innocence, once devoured, cannot be reclaimed.

## Central Conflict

Predator versus prey and the corruption of protection. The wolf-hunters were created to protect humanity from lycanthropic predators, but their methods required dancing close to the curse they fought. Red represents the failure of that balance—she loved her Grandmother too much to let her serve as bait, but breaking the binding unleashed the very evil it contained. The party must navigate whether protection requires sacrifice, if redemption is possible for those corrupted by good intentions, and whether eliminating the wolf is worth the cost of those still trapped within its curse.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Shifting Woods:** Forest paths change based on fear and lies told, navigation requires truth
### 2. **Lycanthropy Exposure:** Failed saves against wolf attacks risk permanent transformation with rollable consequences
### 3. **Face-Stealing:** The wolf can wear faces of those it's devoured, requiring insight checks to detect
### 4. **The Grandmother's Loop:** Temporal recursion in the house where events repeat with variations
### 5. **Scarlet Markings:** Ancient wolf-hunter signs that provide protection but attract wolf's attention
### 6. **Silver Weapons:** Critical role but limited availability, must be maintained and consecrated
### 7. **The Hunt:** Role-reversal encounters where party is prey and must evade rather than fight
### 8. **Wolf Speech:** Cursed creatures can speak, negotiate, and deceive using human intelligence
### 9. **Basket of Offerings:** Items carried through the woods attract different spirits and wolves
### 10. **The Final Trial:** Endgame requires completing Red's original test to break or contain the curse
