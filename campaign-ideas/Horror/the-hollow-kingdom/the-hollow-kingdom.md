The party are wandering bugs who arrive in Hallownest, a once-great insect kingdom now fallen to the Infection—an orange plague that drives bugs into mindless rage. They discover the Pale King sealed the source of the Infection (the Radiance, a forgotten moth god) inside the Hollow Knight, a vessel with no mind to think, no will to break, no voice to cry suffering. But the seal is failing. The party must explore the depths, fight through infected hordes, enter the Dream Realm, and confront the Radiance before the kingdom is lost forever.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-22 sessions)

A descent through a dying bug kingdom seeking the source of infection.

*   **Act I — The Forgotten Crossroads (Sessions 1-7):** Arrive in Dirtmouth, the last safe settlement. Explore the Forgotten Crossroads and discover Hallownest's ruins. Learn nail combat (sword fighting), acquire charms (equipment), and map the tunnels. Discover the Infection turns bugs into orange-eyed zombies. Meet Hornet, a mysterious warrior who tests the party's strength. Learn of the Dreamers—three bugs who use their sleep to seal the Temple of the Black Egg where the Hollow Knight is imprisoned. To reach the temple, the Dreamers must die.
*   **Act II — The Dreamers' Fall (Sessions 8-15):** Travel to Deepnest (spider horrors), Fog Canyon (jellyfish towers), and the City of Tears (royal capital) to slay the three Dreamers. Each protects a seal on the Black Egg. Acquire the Dream Nail—a blade that enters minds and dreams. Learn the Pale King's plan: create vessels (children with no thoughts) to contain the Radiance. The Hollow Knight was supposed to be perfect but developed emotions, weakening the seal. The party is also a vessel—a sibling to the Hollow Knight.
*   **Act III — The Radiance (Sessions 16-22):** Enter the Black Egg and face the Hollow Knight, who's been suffering for eons. Can choose to become the new seal (basic ending), fight alongside Hornet to kill the Radiance permanently (good ending), or unite with the Shade Lord to become a void god (true ending). Final boss: The Radiance—a moth goddess of light and dreams who refused to be forgotten. In the Dream Realm, battle her manifestation. Victory saves Hallownest but costs the party—they may seal themselves, die permanently, or transcend into void.
