# Creative Brief: The Hollow Kingdom

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Bug Kingdom with Infection Horror (Hollow Knight-inspired)

Inspired by the hauntingly beautiful hand-drawn aesthetics of *Hollow Knight* with Victorian gothic and insect biology influences. This style captures the melancholic beauty of a fallen civilization, the horror of orange infection, dream realm surrealism, and the tragedy of discarded vessels.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** Bugs as characters, massive in relation to their tiny world
*   **Gothic Architecture:** Carved stone, bug-scale cathedrals, shell motifs, chitin decorations
*   **Infection Visual:** Orange eyes, glowing pustules, spreading corruption
*   **Hand-Drawn Aesthetic:** Flowing lines, expressive character designs, dark backgrounds

**Color Palette:** Deep blacks, shell whites, stone grays, infection orange, dream realm whites/golds

**Prompt Example:** "A gothic bug kingdom carved from stone. Tiny bug warriors with nail swords in a massive cavern with towering shell architecture. Orange infection spreading on walls. Hand-drawn art style, dark backgrounds with dramatic lighting."

## Voice

A silent protagonist voice—communication through actions, not words. Other bugs speak in chirps and chitters (subtitled). The tone is melancholic, lonely, gothic. The world speaks through environmental storytelling and cryptic NPC dialogue. Role: The voice of a dying kingdom where even hope is fading.
