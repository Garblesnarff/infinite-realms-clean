### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Drowning Bargain**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When voiceless women appear on beaches walking in constant agony while ships wreck from beautiful singing, the party—investigating the drownings—discovers Ursula the sea witch's systematic operation harvesting merfolk abilities through predatory contracts, with Princess Ariel as the latest victim whose stolen voice lures sailors to death while she desperately seeks true love's kiss within three days or dissolve into sea foam forever.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF three days pass without true love's kiss THEN Ariel dissolves into sea foam permanently
*   IF Ariel's voice is restored THEN she can explain herself but contract is broken unpredictably
*   IF Ursula is killed normally THEN all contract victims tied to her may die too
*   IF true love's kiss succeeds THEN transformation becomes permanent (might not be desired)
*   IF the trident is stolen THEN Ursula can flood surface world or separate realms forever
*   IF contract is broken legally THEN loopholes must be found in specific wording
*   IF polyp victims are freed THEN powerful allies but revenge-motivated and damaged
*   IF Triton learns about Ariel THEN political crisis as he tries to intervene
*   IF Vanessa's deception is exposed THEN Eric learns truth but time is running out
*   IF walking continues THEN permanent damage to Ariel's transformed legs
*   IF surface-sea politics are revealed THEN both kingdoms face diplomatic crisis
*   IF Ursula's origin as Triton's sister is exposed THEN family conflict compounds problems
*   IF other contract victims are contacted THEN warnings and potential alliance
*   IF nautilus shell is destroyed carelessly THEN voice might be lost permanently
*   IF Ariel returns to sea THEN she faces punishment for breaking kingdom laws
