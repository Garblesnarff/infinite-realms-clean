# Creative Brief: The Upside Down Protocol

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: 80s Nostalgia Horror (Stranger Things/Spielberg-inspired)

Inspired by the warm, nostalgic aesthetic of 1980s suburban America combined with the creeping horror of parallel dimensions and government conspiracies. This style captures both the innocence of childhood adventure and the terror of unknowable monsters.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Warm Nostalgia Meets Cold Horror:** Contrast cozy, warm-lit suburban homes and sunny summer days with dark forests, flickering lights, and the decayed nightmare of the Upside Down.
*   **Practical 80s Aesthetic:** Describe period details—wood-paneled station wagons, rotary-dial phones, tabletop game sets, BMX bikes, analog technology.
*   **Supernatural Contrasts:** The mundane world is safe and colorful; the Upside Down is dark, decayed, cold, and filled with floating spores and writhing vines.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** 80s nostalgia, childhood adventure, supernatural horror, government conspiracy, parallel dimension, friendship, small-town mystery, psychic powers.
*   **Feeling:** The comfort and safety of childhood shattered by impossible terrors. The atmosphere shifts from warm and nostalgic to cold and nightmarish.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic with a slightly cinematic quality. Clean lines for the normal world, distorted and decayed forms in the Upside Down.
*   **Forms:** Characters are children and teenagers with authentic proportions. The Upside Down mirrors the real world but everything is wrong—twisted, overgrown with alien vines, decayed.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic digital painting in the style of Stranger Things. A group of kids on BMX bikes riding through a suburban neighborhood at dusk, the warm glow of streetlights contrasting with the dark forest at the edge of town where something watches."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, saturated colors for the real world—golden afternoon sunlight, warm home interiors, the bright colors of 80s fashion. The Upside Down uses cold, desaturated colors—sickly greens, blues, grays, with glowing red rifts.
*   **Lighting:** Heavy use of practical light sources—flashlights, lamps, Christmas lights, and the eerie glow from the Upside Down.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a warm color palette of golden sunlight and cozy home interiors, contrasting sharply with the cold, sickly green and blue tones of the Upside Down visible through a glowing rift."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Kids and teenagers in authentic 80s clothing—jeans, graphic t-shirts, windbreakers, sneakers. Adults in period-appropriate casual or work attire.
*   **Eleven:** Often in oversized clothing, shaved head (or very short hair), minimal expression, mysterious.
*   **Government Agents:** Men in dark suits and ties, carrying modern (for the 80s) weapons and equipment.
*   **Monsters:** The Demogorgon is a tall, humanoid predator with a flower-like head that opens to reveal rows of teeth. The Mind Flayer is a massive, shadow-like entity with spider-like legs.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young girl, about 12 years old, with a shaved head and wearing an oversized pink dress. Her expression is blank but her eyes glow faintly with psychic energy. Blood drips from her nose. She stands in a defensive pose, telekinetically lifting objects around her."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Suburban 80s America—ranch-style homes, tree-lined streets, the local arcade, school gymnasiums, forests, and quarries. The Hawkridge Laboratory is a brutalist concrete complex.
*   **The Upside Down:** Everything from the real world but covered in slimy vines, decayed, dark, and filled with floating spores. The sky is dark and stormy with red lightning.
*   **Details:** Period-accurate props—walkie-talkies, rotary phones, wood-paneled basements, vintage cars, analog equipment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A suburban living room in the 1980s. Wood paneling, floral wallpaper, a CRT television, and a rotary phone on a side table. But something is wrong—Christmas lights are strung everywhere, flickering in a pattern. The lights spell out a message: 'RUN.'"

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Warm, natural lighting for daytime scenes. Nighttime scenes use practical light sources—flashlights, street lamps, car headlights. The Upside Down is perpetually dark, lit only by glowing rifts and psychic energy.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates safety (warm home lights) or danger (flickering, failing lights). Flashlights are survival tools in the dark.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by flickering flashlights held by scared children, casting dancing shadows in a dark forest. In the distance, an otherworldly glow emanates from between the trees, accompanied by floating spores."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide shots of kids on bikes riding through town, intimate shots of friends huddled around a table with a map, POV shots from the monsters' perspective.
*   **Techniques:** Use of framing to show the barrier between worlds (rifts, gates). Kids are often shot from low angles to emphasize their vulnerability or from their eye level to immerse the viewer in their experience.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot from above showing a small group of kids standing in a clearing in a dark forest, surrounded by their bikes. Their flashlights create a small circle of light in vast darkness. In the shadows beyond, something massive is approaching."

## Voice

A warm, nostalgic voice that evokes the feeling of a coming-of-age adventure, but with an undercurrent of unease. The tone is that of someone recounting a summer from their childhood that changed everything—full of wonder and friendship, but shadowed by loss and terror. The voice should be young adult, reflecting on events from youth. There's a sense of innocence lost but also of enduring bonds forged in crisis. When describing the Upside Down or the Mind Flayer, the voice becomes colder, more distant, touched by something incomprehensible. Role: The voice of one of the kids grown up, telling this story years later.
