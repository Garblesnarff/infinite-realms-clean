### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Upside Down Protocol**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A young boy vanishes into the Upside Down, a dark mirror dimension accessed through a government laboratory's failed experiment. His friends—a group of misfit kids—team up with a psychic girl who escaped the same lab to rescue him. They must face interdimensional monsters, government cover-ups, and a psychic entity that wants to consume both worlds. This is a story of childhood bravery, found family, and fighting monsters both human and otherworldly.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Hawkridge National Laboratory and its secret experiments to develop psychic weapons for the war effort.
    *   Explain how the experiments accidentally opened a Gate to the Upside Down and what the first researchers found there.
    *   Describe the Upside Down—its nature as a parallel dimension, why it mirrors the Material Plane, and the ecology of creatures that inhabit it.
    *   Write the backstory of Dr. Brenner's "MKUltra" program to create psychic children, focusing on subject Eleven.
    *   Detail the Mind Flayer—an ancient psychic entity that has consumed countless dimensions and now seeks to add this one to its collection.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Party (Player Characters)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Find their missing friend; protect Eleven; stop the Upside Down from consuming their world.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A group of childhood friends, equals who make decisions together.
        *   **Public Agenda:** They're just kids playing games and riding bikes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They're investigating supernatural phenomena and government conspiracies.
        *   **Assets:** Friendship, creativity, knowledge of the town, developing psychic powers, adult allies who believe them.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with Chief Hopper and Joyce Byers; hunted by Dr. Brenner; protected by Eleven.
    *   **Hawkridge National Laboratory** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Develop psychic weapons; contain the Gate; recapture Eleven; cover up all evidence of the Upside Down.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Dr. Brenner (director), senior researchers, security forces, government handlers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Magical defense research for national security.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Human experimentation on children; covering up the dimensional breach they caused.
        *   **Assets:** Vast funding, advanced magic and technology, armed security, government authority.
        *   **Relationships:** See the Party as threats to be eliminated; Eleven is their "property"; they answer only to shadowy government officials.
    *   **The Upside Down Hive** (Major, Alien Threat)
        *   **Goals:** Spread the Mind Flayer's influence; open more Gates; consume all living minds.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The Mind Flayer (hive mind), Demogorgons (hunters), possessed hosts, Upside Down flora/fauna.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They don't communicate.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Assimilate all dimensions into the Mind Flayer's collective consciousness.
        *   **Assets:** Army of monsters, possession abilities, the entire Upside Down dimension, immunity to conventional damage.
        *   **Relationships:** Enemies of all life; drawn to psychic energy and bleeding; can possess and control the weak-willed.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Hawkridge National Laboratory:** A sprawling concrete complex disguised as a research facility, housing dark secrets.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Rainbow Room (where psychic experiments happen), the Isolation Tanks, the Gate (glowing rift to the Upside Down in the basement), security checkpoints, Dr. Brenner's office.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Dr. Brenner, researchers, security guards, government agents, remaining experimental subjects.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None available to players—this is a hostile location.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Security patrol, escaped Upside Down creature loose in the halls, psychic subject having a violent episode, emergency lockdown, Dr. Brenner conducting an experiment.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "There are other children like Eleven still trapped here." "The Gate is growing larger." "Dr. Brenner has been collecting samples from the Upside Down."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Harsh fluorescent lighting, white tiles, observation windows, the glowing red rift of the Gate), Sound (Humming machinery, distant screams, alarms), Smell (Antiseptic, ozone, something rotting from the direction of the Gate).
    *   **The Upside Down (Mirror Hawkridge):** A dark parallel dimension that mirrors the Material Plane but decayed and wrong.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** All the same locations as Hawkridge, but covered in slimy vines, decayed, dark. Castle Byers (Willam's fort). The Library (where lights flicker to communicate between worlds).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Demogorgons, lesser Upside Down creatures, possessed echoes of people, the Mind Flayer's presence everywhere.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is a hostile survival environment.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Demogorgon hunting party, fields of floating spores (poison), vines that grab and constrict, psychic visions from the Mind Flayer, temporary rifts back to the Material Plane.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Willam is hiding in Castle Byers." "The Mind Flayer can see through the eyes of anything in the Upside Down." "Heat and fire weaken the connection between dimensions."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Everything is dark, decayed, covered in vines and slime, floating spores fill the air, red lightning in the dark sky), Sound (Absolute silence except for distant growls and your own breathing), Smell (Rot, decay, something sweet and sickly that makes you nauseous).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players discover the Gate in the laboratory.
    *   **THEN:** They become priority targets for elimination. Laboratory security mobilizes. Dr. Brenner personally takes an interest in them.
    *   **IF:** Eleven uses her full psychic power to save the party.
    *   **THEN:** She disappears or is severely weakened. The Mind Flayer becomes aware of her and the players. Her absence creates a power vacuum—who will protect them now?
    *   **IF:** The players close the Gate to the Upside Down.
    *   **THEN:** The immediate threat is reduced, but Willam remains changed. Spores from the Upside Down have spread. The Mind Flayer finds another way.
    *   **IF:** Willam is possessed by the Mind Flayer.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a heartbreaking scenario where the party must save their friend from his own body. He fights them, leaks information to the enemy, and opens new gates.
    *   **IF:** The Mind Flayer begins possessing townsfolk.
    *   **THEN:** Trust erodes. Anyone could be an enemy. The party must identify who is possessed and find a way to sever the Mind Flayer's connection without killing the hosts.
    *   **IF:** Players embrace their developing psychic powers.
    *   **THEN:** They grow stronger but attract more attention from both the Mind Flayer (who wants to consume them) and the laboratory (who wants to study them).
    *   **IF:** The Mind Flayer is destroyed or driven back.
    *   **THEN:** The Upside Down begins to collapse without its ruling intelligence. The Gate closes permanently. Hawkridge is saved, but the players are forever changed by what they've seen and done.
