# The Phantom Gauntlet - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Liminal Space Horror

**Aesthetic:** Empty familiar spaces. Wrong silence. Everything slightly off. Post-apocalyptic without destruction. Just... abandoned.

**Color Palette:**
- Phantom city: Washed out, desaturated, (#D3D3D3)
- Game arenas: Vibrant but wrong colors
- Cards: Red (#FF0000) and black (#000000), impossibly crisp
- Blood: Shockingly red against gray world
- Rare signs of life: Oversaturated

**Design:** Recognizable city landmarks but empty. No people, no animals, no sound. Lights work, water flows, but no one's there. Uncanny valley urban environment. Game arenas surge with color and danger.

## Music and Sound Design

**Ambient City:** Silence, wind, distant echoes, player's footsteps too loud, occasional inexplicable sounds. Oppressive quiet.

**Game Arenas:** Sudden music, mechanical sounds, countdown timers, alarms. Jarring contrast to city silence.

**Tension:** Heartbeat, heavy breathing, distant screams, warning sounds.

**Success/Failure:** Electronic tones, card appearance sound effects, visa updates.

**The Beach:** Artificial party atmosphere, music and laughter covering desperation.

**Voice Direction:**
- Game Announcements: Robotic, emotionless, clear rules
- Players: Escalating stress, desperate strategies, breakdown
- Game Masters (late): Varies depending on chosen truth

## Cinematic Moments

- Waking in empty city, first realization
- Finding first game card, confusion
- First game death, instant horror
- Visa expiring, countdown pressure
- Face card reveal, massive set pieces
- Beach utopia showing cracks
- Discovering game masters' true nature
- Final choice: escape or stay
- Return to real world (if achieved)
- Memory of games fading or staying
