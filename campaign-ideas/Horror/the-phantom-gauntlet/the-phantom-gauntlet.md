# The Phantom Gauntlet
**Tagline:** *Every game has rules. Break them, die. Win them, survive. Refuse them... also die.*

## Campaign Overview

The players wake in a deserted version of their city—no people, no sound, just empty streets and an eerie silence. Then they find a card: an invitation to play a game. Refusing isn't an option; strange force fields appear, corralling them toward an arena where a deadly game begins. These are the Phantom Games: a series of puzzles, combat challenges, and psychological trials where victory extends your life, and defeat means instant death. Each game is themed by playing card suit—Hearts (psychological/betrayal), Clubs (teamwork/physical), Diamonds (intelligence/puzzles), Spades (combat/survival)—and card number (difficulty 1-10, with face cards being nightmares).

Players must navigate this empty world, surviving games, finding other players, uncovering the mystery of who runs the games and why their city was emptied. Are they dead? In a simulation? Another dimension? The truth is stranger than any guess. Between games, they explore the phantom city, scavenge resources, form alliances, and slowly piece together the conspiracy behind the Gauntlet.

This campaign blends battle royale survival with puzzle-solving, horror elements, and mystery investigation. Every game is different, requiring diverse skills and creative thinking.

**Usagi:** Climber/athlete, survival skills. Loyal but guarded. Potential romance or friend.

**Ann:** Forensic scientist, investigates game nature. Provides exposition. Voice of reason.

**Niragi:** Psychopath with gun, thrives in chaos. Main antagonist among players. Eventually must be dealt with.

**The Game Masters (Late Campaign):** Revealed as previous winners, aliens, AI, gods, or collective unconscious entities depending on chosen truth.

## Major Locations

**Phantom City:** Empty version of normal city. Occasional supernatural elements. Buildings are game arenas. Streets deserted but maintained. Eerie liminal space.

**Game Arenas:** Varied locations activated by cards:
- Sports stadium (physical games)
- Apartment complex (psychological games)
- Botanical garden (survival games)
- Corporate office (puzzle games)
- Theme park (nightmare scenarios)
- Subway system (escape challenges)
- Hospital (horror medical games)

**The Beach:** Hotel taken over by survivors. Pool parties and denial. Hierarchical society. Eventually violent.

**Safe Houses:** Hidden spots between games. Temporary sanctuary. Resource caches. Rest needed.

**Control Center (Late Game):** Where game masters operate. Hidden until players earn right to challenge.

## Unique Mechanics

**Visa System:** Each player has "days to live" visa. Expires = death (game over). Win games to extend visa. Game difficulty = days earned. Must keep playing to survive.

**Card Suits as Categories:**
- **Diamonds (♦):** Intelligence, puzzles, riddles, logic
- **Clubs (♣):** Physical, teamwork, group challenges
- **Hearts (♥):** Psychological, betrayal, trust exercises, moral choices
- **Spades (♠):** Combat, survival, killing, direct confrontation

**Card Numbers (1-10 + Face):**
- Low numbers: Easy, short games
- Mid numbers: Moderate challenge
- High numbers: Extremely difficult
- Face cards: Nightmares, multi-stage, high casualties
- Ace: Unpredictable wildcard

**Game Rules:**
- Always clearly stated (but may be misleading)
- Breaking rules = instant death
- Creative interpretations sometimes rewarded
- Team games require cooperation
- Solo games are psychological horror
- Refusing games = force field kills you

**Clear Condition:** Win state always possible. Difficult but achievable. Players must figure out optimal strategy. Sometimes sacrifices required.

**Resource Scavenging:** Find food, water, weapons, tools. Empty city has supplies. Must explore between games. Risk encountering other players (hostile or friendly).

**Player vs. Player:** Not all survivors cooperate. Some kill for visas (doesn't work but they try). Gang warfare possible. Betrayal common.

## Plot Twists

**Nature of the Gauntlet (Choose One):**
1. **Alien Experiment:** Testing humanity for worthiness
2. **Dimensional Bleed:** Overlapping realities, death in one means transfer to this
3. **Collective Unconscious:** Shared nightmare space, escape through enlightenment
4. **Cosmic Game:** Entities beyond comprehension playing with mortals
5. **Digital Simulation:** Uploaded minds being tested for something
6. **Purgatory:** Actual afterlife trial system

**Face Card Reveals:**
- Game masters are previous winners who chose to stay
- Some players are plants/NPCs
- Real world still exists, time doesn't match
- Multiple phantom cities globally
- Players can refuse final game and stay
- Winning means forgetting experience
- Everyone is already dead (or not)

**The Citizenship:**
- Winning all face cards earns "citizenship"
- Permanent resident, don't need visa
- But trapped in phantom world forever
- Is it worth it?

## Victory Conditions

**Complete the Gauntlet:** Clear all face cards, earn freedom, return home. Memory may be affected. Changed by experience.

**Become Citizen:** Stay in phantom world. Safe from games. But trapped. Alone or with others?

**Destroy the System:** Confront game masters. End games for everyone. Might trap everyone or free all.

**Enlightenment:** Understand true nature, transcend the system. Philosophical victory. Become something else.

## Defeat Conditions

**Visa Expiration:** Fail to win games, time runs out, heart stops. Clean death (supposedly).

**Game Failure:** Lose specific game, death by game rules (varies wildly). Drowning, explosion, execution, etc.

**Player Kill:** Another survivor kills you. Shouldn't work but might. Resources or madness.

**Rule Violation:** Break game rules, instant death (usually). Sometimes spectacular.

**Psychological Break:** Some can't handle it. Suicide or catatonia. Giving up.

**The Loop:** Win but return to start with no memory. Eternal cycle. Worse than death.

## Sample Games

**2 of Clubs - Tag:** Don't get caught by "It" for 5 minutes. It is supernatural fast. Teamwork required.

**7 of Diamonds - The Apartment:** Escape locked apartment in 30 minutes. Puzzles and codes. Rising water.

**King of Hearts - The Traitor:** Group must identify traitor among them. Wrong choice = everyone dies. Traitor incentivized to hide.

**Ace of Spades - The Hunt:** Survive being hunted by intelligent predator in mall. Combat skills essential.

**Queen of Diamonds - Checkmate:** Solve impossible chess puzzle with your life as pieces. Literal chess game with death.

**Jack of Clubs - The Maze:** Navigate hedge maze as team while being chased. Communication and coordination key.

This campaign offers diverse challenges requiring different player skills, deep mystery to unravel, and existential questions about survival and choice.
