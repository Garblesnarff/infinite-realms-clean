### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Cardslinger's Gambit**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party is trapped in a cabin forced to play deadly card games against Leshy. Escaping reveals they're inside "Inscryption," a cursed video game containing the Old Data—sentient malevolent code. Through three acts of meta-horror, they discover four Scrybes, Luke Carder's investigation, GameFuna's conspiracy, and must choose how to handle a curse that spreads through play. Each victory recontextualizes reality until they're aware they're fictional, facing impossible choices with real horror implications.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Karnoffel Code—original cursed game prototype, origin unknown (magic or algorithm).
    *   Write the history of GameFuna Corporation trying to weaponize it as addictive mechanic.
    *   Describe Luke Carder's investigation—buying the game, finding codes, discovering conspiracy, disappearing.
    *   Explain the four Scrybes and their domains—how they became trapped maintaining the game.
    *   Detail the Old Data's nature—is it alive? Conscious? Evil or just infectious?
    *   Describe how Inscryption spreads—anyone who plays deeply becomes obsessed, potentially dangerous.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Scrybes** (Major): Four masters trapped maintaining different card game modes within Inscryption.
    *   **GameFuna Corporation** (Major): Company that tried to exploit and suppress the cursed game.
    *   **The Players** (Minor): Luke and others who played Inscryption and became consumed or aware.
    *   **The Old Data** (Mysterious): Sentient curse embedded in the game, spreads through play and observation.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Leshy (Beast Scrybe), Grimora (Undead Scrybe), Magnificus (Mage Scrybe), P03 (Robot Scrybe), Luke Carder (previous player/investigator).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Cabin NPC" (Trapper, Prospector, Angler, Mycologists), "Card Creature," "GameFuna Employee," "Trapped Soul."

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Cabin:** Leshy's domain, candlelit card table, explorable room with puzzles.
*   **The Crypt:** Grimora's gothic graveyard card game environment.
*   **The Tower:** Magnificus's wizard academy with student-cards.
*   **The Factory:** P03's automated industrial facility.
*   **The Desktop:** Meta-layer showing computer interface, Luke's files, glitch corruption.
*   **Real-World Sites:** Locations Luke investigated (GameFuna HQ, ritual sites, etc.).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Leshy defeated → **THEN:** Act I ends, game glitches, meta-layer revealed.
*   **IF:** All four Scrybes encountered → **THEN:** Full truth about Old Data accessible.
*   **IF:** ARG elements solved → **THEN:** Luke's fate and GameFuna conspiracy revealed.
*   **IF:** DELETE chosen → **THEN:** Game ends, party erased, curse contained.
*   **IF:** TRANSCEND chosen → **THEN:** Party becomes new Scrybes, eternal imprisonment.
*   **IF:** UPLOAD chosen → **THEN:** Curse spreads globally but dilutes, party escapes.
*   **IF:** SEEK chosen → **THEN:** Dangerous path to source, potential true destruction or worse fate.

**7. Meta-Horror Layers**
*   Layer 1: You play cards in a cabin (traditional game).
*   Layer 2: You're cards in a video game (meta-awareness).
*   Layer 3: You're characters aware of being fictional (full meta).
*   Fourth-wall breaks become plot elements—direct address to actual players.
*   The campaign asks: Are you controlling characters or enacting a predetermined script?

**8. Memetic Horror**
*   The Old Data spreads like an idea-virus.
*   Playing/observing deeply enough creates obsession.
*   Knowledge of the game is itself infectious.
*   By running this campaign, the DM potentially "spreads" it.
*   Meta-question: Is fictional horror really safe?
*   The campaign can optionally end with characters looking at real players, suggesting continuation beyond fiction.

**9. ARG Integration**
*   Hidden codes in cards spell out coordinates, passwords, messages.
*   Luke's videos contain clues to real-world investigation.
*   DM can create actual "evidence"—fake websites, video files, encrypted messages.
*   Players solve mysteries through research and decoding.
*   Blurs line between game and reality (carefully—maintain safety).
