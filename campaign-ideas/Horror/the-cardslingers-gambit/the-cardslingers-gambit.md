The party awakens in a dim cabin across from a mysterious figure called Leshy who challenges them to a deadly card game. To escape, they must defeat him by building a deck from sacrificed creatures, discovering hidden mechanics, and solving the cabin's environmental puzzles. But victory reveals this is only the first layer—the card game itself contains trapped souls, and the cabin exists within a cursed video game created by a murdered developer. Through three acts of escalating meta-horror, the party uncovers conspiracies, alternate game modes, and the terrible price of curiosity about games that play back.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 14-18 sessions)

A three-act structure where each act completely recontextualizes what came before.

*   **Act I — The Cabin (Sessions 1-6):** The party is trapped in a dark cabin with Leshy, a figure wearing animal skull masks who forces them to play his card game. The rules are deadly: lose and you're killed, only to respawn at the cabin's entrance to try again. The game involves sacrificing creatures to summon stronger ones, building a deck from creatures found in the cabin, and solving puzzles to unlock new cards. Strange details accumulate: photographs on walls, a caged wolf that talks cryptically, locked safes with numerical codes, a clock that doesn't move. Defeating Leshy should mean escape—but instead, the game glitches, the cabin dissolves into code, and the party realizes they're inside a video game.
*   **Act II — The Game Within (Sessions 7-12):** The perspective shifts. The party discovers they're cards in a digital game called "Inscryption" created by GameFuna Corporation. Four Scrybes (game masters) each control different card game modes: Leshy (beast cards), Grimora (undead cards), Magnificus (mage cards), and P03 (robot cards). They're trapped by a mysterious force called the Old Data—a cursed code from a prototype game that drove its creator mad. Playing through each Scrybe's game mode reveals more: the original developer Luke Carder filmed himself playing and uncovered a conspiracy. The game contains hidden coordinates, secret codes, and ARG elements pointing to a real murder. The party must complete all four game modes while unraveling what happened to Luke.
*   **Act III — The Truth and Deletion (Sessions 13-18):** The final act breaks reality further. The party discovers the Old Data is sentient and malevolent—anyone who plays Inscryption becomes obsessed and potentially dangerous. Luke died investigating it. GameFuna tried to suppress the game but couldn't destroy it completely. The party must make a choice: Delete the game (destroying themselves in the process but ending the curse), Upload the Old Data to spread it everywhere (preserve the game but risk others), or Find the Source (use the hidden codes to discover where the Old Data came from originally). Each ending has horror implications—some curses can't be solved, only passed on or accepted. The final choice determines whether they escape, sacrifice themselves, or become part of the game forever.

### Session 18 — "The Final Choice"
*   **Focus:** Multiple Endings
*   **Key Events:**
    *   **DELETE Ending:** Destroy the game, sacrificing themselves. Inscryption ends. The curse stops. But they cease to exist.
    *   **TRANSCEND Ending:** Merge with the Old Data, become the new Scrybes. Maintain the game but contain it. Eternal imprisonment as guardians.
    *   **UPLOAD Ending:** Help P03 spread the game globally. Everyone plays, curse dilutes across millions. You escape but doom others to shared obsession.
    *   **SEEK Ending:** Use all codes to find physical source—ritual site, corporate server, or cursed artifact. Maybe destroy it there. Most dangerous, highest stakes.
**Resolution:** No happy ending—horror games don't have those. The party makes the choice they can live with, understanding all options have costs. The game ends with them staring at you, the actual players, suggesting the meta-horror continues beyond the fiction.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of games as parasites, the danger of curiosity, how stories trap those who engage with them, corporate exploitation of art, and the fourth wall as a trap. It asks: Can you play a cursed game without being consumed? Is viral spread better than concentrated evil? Do you have agency or are you following a script? The central conflict is agency vs. predestination—are you solving the mystery or enacting it?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sacrificial Card Combat**
*   Play creature cards by sacrificing weaker creatures
*   Cards have blood cost (1-2 sacrifices needed)
*   Build deck from found/earned cards
*   Creatures have attack and health
*   Goal: Damage opponent's side until scale tips in your favor

### 2. **Deck-Building Through Exploration**
*   Cards found in cabin environment: drawers, safes, behind paintings
*   Rare cards earned from bosses
*   Talking to NPCs unlocks trading mechanics
*   Permanent upgrades via totems (buff all creatures of a type)
*   Deaths reset progress but knowledge persists

### 3. **The Scale Mechanic**
*   Battles tracked on physical scale
*   Damage to opponent adds weight to your side
*   When scale tips sufficiently, you win
*   Reverse for when opponent wins
*   Visual representation of victory condition

### 4. **Meta Layers**
*   Act I: You're the player
*   Act II: You're a card in the game
*   Act III: You're aware of being fictional
*   Each layer recontextualizes previous events
*   Fourth-wall breaks become plot points

### 7. **Death and Respawn**
*   Losing doesn't end campaign—you respawn
*   Each death teaches patterns
*   Some deaths reveal secrets (camera focuses on new detail)
*   Permadeath is psychological, not mechanical
*   Horror comes from inevitability of playing again

### 8. **The Old Data Corruption**
*   Rare "cursed" cards with disturbing artwork
*   Dealing with Old Data cards risks corruption
*   Corruption might grant power but costs sanity/agency
*   Meta-question: Are you controlling character or being controlled?
*   Mechanical representation of memetic horror

### 9. **Ending Choices**
*   Multiple endings based on final decision
*   No "correct" choice—all have costs
