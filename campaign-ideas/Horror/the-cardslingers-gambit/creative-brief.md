# Creative Brief: The Cardslinger's Gambit

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Mixed Media Meta-Horror (Inscryption-inspired)

Inspired by the unsettling mixed-media aesthetics and self-aware horror of *Inscryption*. This style captures the creepy cabin atmosphere, the disturbing card art, the glitching digital elements, and the ARG documentary feeling.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Unsettling Contrast:** Cozy cabin setting made horrifying, cute woodland creatures rendered disturbing
*   **Analog Horror Elements:** VHS aesthetics, found footage, dim lighting, grainy textures
*   **Meta-Awareness:** Fourth-wall breaks, glitch effects, "looking back at you" moments
*   **Multiple Art Styles:** Each Scrybe has distinct visual identity (woodcut, gothic, wizard academy, factory)

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Unsettling, meta-horror, creepy cabin, cursed game, fourth-wall breaking, analog horror, disturbing secrets
*   **Feeling:** The discomfort of being watched. The realization you're not in control. The creeping dread of a game that knows too much. The horror of curiosity punished.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Cabin (Leshy):** Dark browns, candlelight orange, deep shadows, woodland earth tones
*   **Crypt (Grimora):** Gothic blacks, bone whites, purple shadows, moonlight blue
*   **Tower (Magnificus):** Mystic purples, gem blues, magical golds, wizard academy colors
*   **Factory (P03):** Industrial grays, electric blues, cold whites, sterile lighting
*   **Glitch/Old Data:** Pixel corruption, red error colors, reality distortion
*   **Prompt Example:** "...first-person view across a table in a dim cabin lit only by candles. Across from you, a figure wearing a deer skull mask (Leshy) places cards down. The cards show disturbing woodland creatures with too many eyes. Heavy shadows, analog horror aesthetic. VHS grain texture. The scene should feel like a creepypasta—cozy setting made wrong."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Leshy:** Wears rotating animal skull masks (deer, wolf, bird), brown robes, speaks in storytelling voice
*   **Grimora:** Skeletal features, gothic dress, bone jewelry, elegant death aesthetic
*   **Magnificus:** Wizard robes, elaborate staff, shifting face (intentionally inconsistent), arrogant posture
*   **P03:** Robotic, computer monitor head with pixelated face, industrial body
*   **Cards:** Disturbing anthropomorphic animals, human faces on beasts, wrong proportions
*   **Prompt Example:** "Character designs for the four Scrybes. Top left: Leshy (figure in brown robes wearing deer skull mask holding nature staff). Top right: Grimora (elegant skeleton in black dress with bone crown). Bottom left: Magnificus (wizard with glowing staff and impossible-shifting face). Bottom right: P03 (robot with CRT monitor head showing pixelated expression). Each has distinct art style matching their domain."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Cabin:** First-person table view, cards in hand, opponent across, dim candlelight, explorable room
*   **Meta-Desktop:** Computer files, folders labeled cryptically, video files of Luke, glitch effects
*   **The Crypt:** Gothic graveyard, tombstones, mist, candlelit crypts
*   **The Tower:** Wizard academy interior, spell effects, trapped student-cards
*   **The Factory:** Conveyor belts, robotic arms, industrial automation, cold sterile lighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "First-person view of a computer desktop. Files and folders scattered. One folder named 'Inscryption_files.' A video player shows a paused frame of a young man (Luke) holding a floppy disk looking worried. Other windows show card game screenshots. VHS-quality webcam footage. ARG aesthetic—looks like a real computer screen documenting something strange."

**5. Card Art Styles:**
*   **Leshy's Cards:** Woodcut-like, disturbing anthropomorphic animals, dark humor
*   **Grimora's Cards:** Gothic illustration, skeletal, ethereal undead, beautiful decay
*   **Magnificus's Cards:** Painted wizard academy style, magical effects, student portraits
*   **P03's Cards:** Pixelated, retro game graphics, mechanical, industrial design
*   **Cursed/Old Data Cards:** Glitched, wrong, faces screaming, reality-breaking
*   **Prompt Example:** "Collection of disturbing playing card designs. Style 1: Woodcut wolf with too many eyes and human hands (Leshy). Style 2: Elegant ghost with bone mask (Grimora). Style 3: Young wizard mid-spellcast with worried expression (Magnificus). Style 4: Pixelated robot creature (P03). Each card has distinct border and art style. All slightly unsettling."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Cabin:** Heavy chiaroscuro, single candlelight source, oppressive shadows
*   **Glitch Moments:** Reality distortion, pixel corruption, color aberration
*   **ARG Footage:** VHS grain, tape warping, analog horror lighting
*   **Desktop Scenes:** Cold monitor glow, dark room, searching-in-the-dark feeling
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with single candle on table creating harsh shadows. Leshy's skull mask catches light unnaturally. Cards on table glow slightly. Background fades to complete darkness. When you look too closely, reality seems to glitch—subtle pixel distortion at edges. Analog horror aesthetic with digital corruption. First-person horror game visual style."

## Music & Sound

An ambient, unsettling soundtrack mixing acoustic instruments with digital distortion. Cabin music uses acoustic guitar, wind, crackling fire—cozy made creepy. Each Scrybe has musical identity: Grimora (haunting choir), Magnificus (orchestral magic), P03 (synthetic beeps). Glitch moments break music with harsh digital noise. ARG segments use diegetic sound—Luke's recordings, ambient room noise. Sound design emphasizes: Card slaps on table, Leshy's voice shifts, clock ticking, reality glitching. Inscryption-inspired: Comfort horror—familiar made wrong.

## Voice

Leshy speaks with theatrical storytelling voice, calling you "challenger," narrating events. Other Scrybes have personalities: Grimora (elegant, accepting), Magnificus (pompous, artistic), P03 (robotic, logical). Luke's voice comes from recordings—normal guy in over his head. The game itself occasionally "speaks" through text glitches and error messages. At meta moments, consider direct address to players. Role: The voice of a game that knows it's a game and wants to play with you.
