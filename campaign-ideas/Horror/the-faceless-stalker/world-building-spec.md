### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Faceless Stalker**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Children are disappearing from the forest town of Oakmere, and witnesses report sightings of an impossibly tall, suited figure with no face lurking among the trees. The entity, known locally as the Thin Man, stalks those who observe it, corrupting their minds and turning them into blank-eyed proxies. The players must investigate the disappearances, resist the entity's maddening influence, and discover the truth: the Thin Man is an ancient psychic predator that feeds on fear and memory, and simply looking at it marks you as prey.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Oakmere as a logging town surrounded by ancient forests.
    *   Write the history of the Thin Man's appearances over centuries, documented in various forms (old paintings, photographs, oral traditions).
    *   Describe the nature of the Thin Man: an extradimensional entity that exists partially outside normal reality.
    *   Explain how the marking process works and why the entity stalks specific individuals.
    *   Detail the creation of proxies and the psychological process that breaks victims into servants.
    *   Write about the Hollow: a pocket dimension where the entity keeps its victims in suspended animation.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create detailed profiles for each faction listed below.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Marked** (Major - includes the players)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, rescue the missing children, destroy or escape the Thin Man.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Informal alliance of investigators and concerned citizens who have seen the entity.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Find the missing children and solve the mystery.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each is fighting their own deteriorating memories and sanity. Some may consider fleeing rather than confronting the threat.
        *   **Assets:** Investigation skills, determination, knowledge gained from research, each other.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by the Thin Man; opposed by proxies; seeking help from experts and authorities.
    *   **The Proxies** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Serve the Thin Man by identifying new victims and delivering them to the Hollow.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy. All receive psychic commands from the entity and coordinate instinctively.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown. They appear as normal townspeople.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To expand the Thin Man's influence by creating more proxies and feeding it more victims.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to appear normal, insider knowledge of the town, superhuman persistence, no need for sleep.
        *   **Relationships:** Commanded by the Thin Man; hunting the players; infiltrating the community.
    *   **The Ignorant** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Live normal lives unaware of the supernatural threat.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Normal townsfolk, police, town council.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The disappearances are tragic but must have a rational explanation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some are in denial, refusing to accept the supernatural. Others are being slowly marked.
        *   **Assets:** Normal societal authority and resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Skeptical of the players' theories; potential victims; may become proxies.
    *   **The Researchers** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Document and understand the Thin Man phenomenon.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Online communities, paranormal investigators, a few academics.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To gather evidence of the entity's existence.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some have become obsessed to the point of madness. A few actively seek to be taken.
        *   **Assets:** Historical records, theories about the entity's nature, potential countermeasures.
        *   **Relationships:** May provide information to the players; often unreliable or mentally unstable; some are proxies posing as researchers.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player accumulates 10 Stalker Points.
    *   **THEN:** That player becomes a proxy. The transformation is gradual and may be role-played or result in NPC status. Other players must decide whether to save or stop them.
    *   **IF:** The players identify and stop a proxy before they deliver a victim.
    *   **THEN:** The Thin Man's influence temporarily weakens. However, it becomes more aggressive in stalking the players directly.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the location of the Hollow's entrance.
    *   **THEN:** Proxies attempt to prevent them from entering. The Thin Man appears more frequently. A confrontation becomes inevitable.
    *   **IF:** The players enter the Hollow unprepared.
    *   **THEN:** They become disoriented and separated. The entity can attack them individually. Stalker Points accumulate rapidly.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully destroy the Operator's Core in the Hollow.
    *   **THEN:** The Thin Man is banished from this reality. All proxies collapse and either die or are freed (depending on how long they've been corrupted). The suspended children awaken and can be rescued. All Stalker Points are removed from surviving players, though some memories may be permanently lost.
