*   **Core Themes:** Greek ideals of heroism, accepting mortality with dignity, justice and judgment, memory and identity, the nature of paradise and punishment, whether resurrection violates natural order.
*   **Tone Guidance:** Classical tragedy - grand, melancholic, philosophically engaged. Neither grimdark nor light. Dignified acceptance of death as Greek ideal but heroic defiance also valued.
*   **Avoid:** Making Hades evil (he's stern but fair), ignoring Greek cultural context, simplifying into good vs. evil, making the underworld purely horrific when it's more complex.
