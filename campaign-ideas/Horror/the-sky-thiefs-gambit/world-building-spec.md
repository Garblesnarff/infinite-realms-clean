### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Sky Thief's Gambit**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When magical artifacts flood markets causing economic chaos, the party—tracing their origin—discovers Jack's beanstalk operation systematically stealing from the Cloud Kingdom where exiled giants live as desperate refugees after being driven from the surface world by human genocide disguised as monster-slaying, and that the stolen "treasures" are actually necessities maintaining the realm's stability as it literally falls apart.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the ancient giant civilization that lived peacefully on the surface
    *   Explain how human expansion led to systematic giant genocide disguised as heroism
    *   Describe the Cloud Kingdom's creation as refuge for surviving giants
    *   Write about the magic beans and how they create temporary bridges between realms
    *   Detail Jack's family history as giant-slayers turned thieves
    *   Explain the stolen items' true purposes—golden goose feeds communities, harp maintains gravity
    *   Describe the Cloud Kingdom's deterioration from systematic theft
    *   Write about previous beanstalks and trapped giant rescue parties killed as "monsters"
    *   Detail the Gravity Engine and what happens when Cloud Kingdom falls
    *   Explain the political factions on both sides wanting war or peace

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Village Below** - Where Jack lives, markets flooded with stolen goods
*   **The Beanstalk Grove** - Where magic beans grow overnight into impossible bridges
*   **The Cloud Kingdom** - Giant civilization in the sky showing decline and desperation
*   **The Giant's Castle** - King Og's fortress where theft's impact is most visible
*   **The Falling Fields** - Parts of Cloud Kingdom breaking off and plummeting to surface
*   **Jack's Warehouse** - Storage and sale of stolen giant artifacts
*   **The Ancient Battlefield** - Surface ruins showing giant-human genocide
*   **The Gravity Engine** - Central mechanism keeping Cloud Kingdom aloft
*   Each location represents different aspects of theft, historical injustice, and failing reconciliation

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Jack steals the Gravity Engine THEN Cloud Kingdom falls catastrophically to surface
*   IF giants descend peacefully THEN humans must make room or face displacement
*   IF war breaks out THEN both species face mutual destruction
*   IF stolen items are returned THEN Cloud Kingdom might stabilize
*   IF beanstalks are all destroyed THEN giants are trapped in dying realm
*   IF Jack is stopped THEN theft ring collapses but political tensions remain
*   IF historical genocide is acknowledged THEN reparations become political issue
*   IF the Golden Goose is freed THEN giant food crisis worsens
*   IF the Singing Harp is returned THEN gravity stabilizes but Jack escapes justice
*   IF peaceful descent is negotiated THEN both species must address historical crimes
*   IF bean seller is confronted THEN source of beanstalks is revealed/controlled
*   IF giant families meet humans THEN prejudices might soften or harden
*   IF falling pieces continue THEN surface world faces destruction from sky stones
*   IF trade relations are established THEN economic incentive might prevent war
*   IF Grandmother Giant's testimony is heard THEN true history becomes undeniable
