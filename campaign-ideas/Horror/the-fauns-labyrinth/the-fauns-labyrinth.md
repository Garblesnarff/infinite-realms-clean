## What "Hard" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Ambiguity:** No clear good guys except the innocent—both the fairy tale and the war demand terrible prices.
*   **Brutal Consequences:** Combat is deadly and realistic; war brings atrocities; fairy tale tasks have horrifying costs.
*   **Innocence at Risk:** Children, civilians, and hope itself are endangered—failure means tragedy.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Operating in occupied territory means limited supplies, constant danger, and hard choices.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act structure paralleling escalating war brutality with increasingly dark fairy tale trials.

*   **Act I — Arrival (Sessions 1–4):** The party arrives at a military outpost in occupied territory. They encounter the faun who reveals their supposed royal heritage and assigns the first trial. Meanwhile, they witness the cruelty of the occupation and meet resistance fighters.
*   **Act II — The Trials (Sessions 5–9):** The party attempts three escalating trials while the war intensifies. Each trial requires sacrifice and reveals darker truths. They must choose between helping rebels, protecting innocents, surviving the faun's tasks, and questioning what's real.
*   **Act III — The Final Moon (Sessions 10–12):** As the resistance makes a final stand, the faun demands a terrible price for the party's "ascension." They must choose between the fantasy escape and confronting brutal reality—both choices have costs.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Session 1 — "The Captain's Mill"
*   The party arrives at a remote military mill occupied by Captain Vidal, a sadistic officer hunting rebels.
*   They witness his cruelty and meet the doctor, housekeeper, and others caught between duty and conscience.
*   **Escalation:** The faun appears privately, claiming they're lost royalty who must complete three tasks.

### Session 2 — "The First Task"
*   The faun gives them a magic book showing the first trial: retrieve a key from the belly of a giant toad beneath an ancient fig tree.
*   They navigate the dying tree's roots and face the bloated, decay-dwelling toad.
*   **Escalation:** The task seems simple, but the environment is deeply unsettling. Meanwhile, Vidal's patrols grow more violent.

### Session 3 — "The Resistance"
*   The party encounters rebels in the forest—desperate people fighting impossible odds.
*   They must decide whether to help, report them, or stay neutral.
*   **Escalation:** Vidal captures and tortures rebels. The party witnesses atrocity.

### Session 4 — "The Second Task"
*   The faun reveals the second trial: retrieve a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster.
*   The magic book warns: "Do not eat or drink anything."
*   **Escalation:** The Pale Man's lair is filled with treasures and a feast—resisting temptation becomes crucial.

### Session 5 — "The Pale Man"
*   The party enters a hall decorated with horrifying murals of the Pale Man devouring children.
*   They must retrieve the dagger without waking the creature or succumbing to temptation.
*   If they fail, the Pale Man awakens—a nightmare encounter.
*   **Escalation:** Someone may eat/drink despite warnings, causing disaster.

### Session 6 — "The Faun's Anger"
*   If the party failed the trial, the faun refuses further contact, calling them failures.
*   They must navigate war without magical escape while seeking redemption.
*   **Escalation:** Vidal discovers rebel sympathizers among the staff. Executions are planned.

### Session 7 — "Innocence in Danger"
*   A child or innocent person is targeted by Vidal's paranoia.
*   The party must choose between staying hidden or risking everything to protect them.
*   **Escalation:** The resistance plans a desperate attack on the mill's storehouse.

### Session 8 — "The Third Task Revealed"
*   The faun returns (if the party proved worthy) with the final task: bring innocent blood to the labyrinth at the full moon.
*   They're horrified—the faun insists it's necessary for their coronation.
*   **Escalation:** The task seems to require harming an innocent. Is the faun evil? Has it been a trick?

### Session 9 — "The Resistance's Stand"
*   The rebels attack. Vidal responds with overwhelming force.
*   The party is caught in brutal combat where everyone is desperate and deadly.
*   **Escalation:** Friends die. The mill becomes a war zone. The full moon approaches.

### Session 10 — "The Labyrinth"
*   The party must choose: complete the faun's dark task or refuse and face reality.
*   The labyrinth reveals its true nature—is it sanctuary or trap?
*   **Escalation:** The faun demands the blood of an innocent for the portal to open.

### Session 11 — "The Captain's Reckoning"
*   Whether in fairy tale or reality, Vidal must be confronted.
*   The party faces him in combat or watches others deliver justice.
*   **Escalation:** Victory is pyrrhic—stopping a monster doesn't stop the war.

### Session 12 — "Two Worlds"
*   Resolution depends on choices: Did they complete the trials? Did they protect the innocent? Did they resist brutality?
*   Possible endings: escape to fairy tale kingdom (but at what cost?), die as heroes in reality, survive but changed forever.
*   **Escalation:** The ending is bittersweet at best—innocence is lost either way.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Mill:** Remote military outpost, dark and oppressive, Vidal's headquarters.
2.  **The Forest:** Where rebels hide, contains the ancient fig tree and magical sites.
3.  **The Ancient Fig Tree:** Dying tree housing the giant toad, first trial location.
4.  **The Pale Man's Hall:** Nightmare palace with feast, treasures, and horror.
5.  **The Stone Labyrinth:** Ancient maze that may lead to the underground kingdom or oblivion.

## Central Conflict

Innocence versus brutality in two worlds. The war represents human capacity for cruelty—Vidal's fascism crushing hope and freedom. The fairy tale represents escape through magic but demands increasingly dark prices. The party must choose: preserve innocence by refusing dark magic, or sacrifice it for promised salvation. Neither path is clean.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dual Reality**
*   Some events have both mundane and magical interpretations. The DM describes both; players choose what their characters believe.

### 2. **The Book of Crossroads**
*   A magical book guides trials, showing illustrations that move. It provides cryptic warnings but never full truth.

### 3. **Innocence Score**
*   Track the party's moral choices. High innocence allows certain fairy tale outcomes; low innocence traps them in brutal reality.

### 4. **Temptation Saves**
*   When faced with forbidden actions (eating the Pale Man's feast, harming innocents), players make wisdom saves against overwhelming temptation.

### 5. **Brutal Combat**
*   War encounters are deadly—enemies don't play fair, wounds have lasting consequences, and victory is costly.

### 6. **The Faun's Tests**
*   Completing trials requires more than success—the party must prove worthiness through sacrifice and restraint.

### 7. **The Final Choice**
*   The campaign ends based on a pivotal choice about innocent blood—refuse and stay in harsh reality, or accept and enter the unknown.
