# Creative Brief: The Faun's Labyrinth

## Art Style: Guillermo del Toro Gothic meets Spanish Civil War Realism

Stark contrast between gritty historical realism and lush, unsettling fairy tale imagery. The mundane world uses muted, harsh tones reflecting war's brutality. The magical world uses rich, organic forms with disturbing beauty—ancient stone, twisted roots, creatures both elegant and horrifying.

### Core Principles:
*   **Beautiful Horror:** Fairy tale elements are visually stunning but deeply unsettling
*   **Stark Contrast:** Harsh military reality versus organic magical mystery
*   **Symbolic Imagery:** Visual motifs repeat—spirals, eyes, clocks, blood, roots

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** The military world is desaturated grays, browns, cold blues, harsh electric lighting. The fairy tale world uses deep earth tones—moss greens, root browns, stone grays, with accents of gold and crimson. Blood is always vivid red in both worlds. Night scenes use deep blues and blacks with isolated warm light sources.

**Character Design:** Vidal is sharply dressed, clean, cruel—military precision hiding brutality. The Faun is ancient, made of wood and moss, elegant horns, unsettling eyes. The Pale Man is pale sagging flesh, eyeless face, eye-holes in hands—body horror made fairy tale. Humans are realistically rendered, showing exhaustion and fear. Magical creatures are organic, rooted in nature but wrong.

**Environments:** The mill is imposing stone architecture, cold and functional. The forest is wild, overgrown, ancient—fig trees dying from within. The Pale Man's hall is renaissance architecture gone wrong—baroque feast table, disturbing murals, too many shoes. The labyrinth is ancient stone spiraling inward.

**Composition:** Use deep shadows and isolated light sources. Frame Vidal in rigid, symmetrical compositions showing his need for control. Frame fairy tale scenes with organic, spiral patterns suggesting ancient power. Use close-ups for horror, wide shots for emphasizing isolation and vulnerability.

## Voice

Haunting, melancholic narrator with the perspective of someone remembering a dark childhood. Gentle when describing innocence, matter-of-fact when describing horror—not sensationalizing but not shielding either. The emotion is sorrowful awareness that terrible things happen but beauty and courage exist too. Role: A survivor recounting trauma through the lens of fairy tale.

## Music Style

Javier Navarrete's approach—Spanish guitar and orchestra creating lullaby melancholy mixed with discordant horror. The faun's theme uses ancient woodwinds and strings in minor keys, beautiful but unsettling. Vidal's theme is mechanical, militaristic percussion and brass. The Pale Man has no music—just silence and breathing. The resistance has mournful, defiant folk melodies. Innocent moments use simple piano like a music box. Overall tone is deeply sad beauty punctuated by horror—lullabies over violence.
