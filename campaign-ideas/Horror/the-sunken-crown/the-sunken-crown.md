# The Sunken Crown
**Tagline:** *Ancient Secrets Sleep Beneath the Waves*

## Campaign Overview

Ten thousand years ago, the Empire of Azuria ruled both land and sea—a golden age civilization that mysteriously vanished in a single night. According to legend, their capital city sank beneath the waves, taking with it the legendary Sunken Crown, an artifact of godlike power that could command the oceans themselves.

The party discovers a weathered map leading to Azuria's ruins in an uncharted trench. They're not alone in the search—treasure hunters, scholars, and darker forces all race to claim the Crown. As they explore magnificent underwater ruins, they'll uncover the truth: Azuria didn't fall by accident. The Crown was a prison for an ancient sea titan, and those who sought to wield its power doomed their civilization. Now, disturbing the ruins threatens to release what Azuria died to contain.

The party must navigate deadly ruins, decipher ancient languages, compete with rival expeditions, and ultimately decide the Crown's fate. Claim it and risk repeating history? Destroy it and free the titan? Or find a third path that ancient Azurians never considered?

- Provides clues to traps and history
- Scholar NPCs can help but at cost (time, favors, information sharing)
- Magic translation imperfect (comedy and danger)

- Magical wards still functional after millennia
- Structural collapse zones
- Titan's influence warping reality in deeper ruins

**The Crown's Temptation**
- Once found, Crown whispers to holders
- Promises power over oceans
- Wisdom saves to resist using it
- Using it alerts Titan and begins escape

## Plot Twists

1. Map is deliberate lure—Titan influenced surface dwellers to find it
2. Baron Goldwater is descended from Azurian nobility, feels entitled to Crown
3. Last Azurian reveals final king sacrificed empire to imprison Titan
4. Crown cannot be destroyed—only reforged or used
5. Using Crown grants power but slowly transforms user into Titan's avatar
6. Dr. Stormsinger secretly dying of disease, needs Crown to heal (moral test)
7. Party member has Azurian blood, can safely wield Crown (chosen one)

## Victory Conditions

**Preservation Ending**: Secure Crown in new prison, prevent all factions from using it, protect future from Titan

**Sacrifice Ending**: One character becomes eternal guardian, wields Crown to maintain Titan's prison forever

**Destruction Ending**: Discover way to destroy Crown and Titan together, end threat permanently but lose historical treasure

**Reform Ending**: Reforge Crown into tool for good, remove Titan-prison aspect, risk eventual misuse but provide benefit

## Defeat Conditions

**Rival Claims Crown**: Enemy faction uses it, becomes tyrannical ocean overlord or releases Titan
**Titan Freed**: Crown broken improperly, monster escapes, begins rampage
**Lost in Ruins**: Party dies to traps, rivals win by default
**Corrupted**: Party uses Crown, becomes Titan's servants, lose characters to evil
