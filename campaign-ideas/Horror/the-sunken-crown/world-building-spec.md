- Advanced magical civilization ruling archipelago
- Mastered water magic, architecture, art, philosophy
- Population: 5 million at height
- Capital: Azure (coastal metropolis)
- Government: Enlightened monarchy guided by Council of Tides

### The Titan War (10,100 years ago)

### The Binding (10,050 years ago)

- Required sacrifice of 1,000 volunteers
- Final King wore Crown, walked into sea
- Titan bound but Crown could not be moved
- Solution: Sink entire capital to hide Crown
- Deliberate sacrifice of millions to save world
- Azure vanished beneath waves in one night

### The Forgetting (10,000 years - present)

## The Sunken Crown: Complete Specifications

### Physical Description
- Pure gold circlet, simple elegance
- Central sapphire size of fist
- Intricate runes covering surface (Azurian binding spells)
- Radiates soft blue light
- Feels heavy with more than physical weight

### Powers (If Worn)
- **Command Water**: Control tides, currents, weather
- **Ocean Sight**: See through any water anywhere
- **Sea Life Control**: Command all aquatic creatures
- **Pressure Immunity**: Survive any depth
- **Immortality**: Do not age while wearing

### The Curse (Hidden)
- Crown bonds to wearer permanently after 24 hours
- Gradually transforms wearer into Titan's avatar
- Final stage: Wearer becomes Thalax's vessel, Titan escapes
- Process takes weeks, subtle at first
- Cannot be removed once bonded

### True Function
- Prison anchor for Thalax
- Crown's destruction = Titan's freedom
- Crown's use = Titan's slow freedom
- Only way to defeat Titan: Crown must remain unused in its chamber
- Azurians understood—power that tempts must never be used

## Thalax the Bound: The Titan

### Nature
- Primordial sea monster, existed before gods
- Size: Miles long, shapeshifting mass
- Form: Tentacles, mouths, eyes, ever-changing nightmare
- Intelligence: Cunning, patient, manipulative
- Power: Reality warping in ocean, weather control, commanding all sea life

### Imprisonment
- Bound in dimensional pocket beneath Azure ruins
- Crown is anchor keeping pocket sealed
- Can influence surface slightly (dreams, whispers)
- Stronger as Crown is approached or used
- Full freedom = apocalypse for coastal civilizations

### Goals
- Freedom at any cost
- Revenge on surface world
- Drown all land, remake world as ocean
- Not negotiable—ancient and alien morality

### Weaknesses
- Cannot exist without Crown or water
- Vulnerable only in moment between prison and full freedom
- Defeat requires: Keep Crown intact AND in chamber, OR destroy Crown AND Titan simultaneously
