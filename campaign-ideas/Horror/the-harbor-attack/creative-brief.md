# Creative Brief: The Harbor Attack

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Found Footage Realism

Inspired by Cloverfield's ground-level perspective and chaotic immediacy. This style emphasizes the human scale against impossible odds, frantic action, and the overwhelming terror of witnessing a kaiju attack from street level.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Ground-Level POV:** Frame scenes from the party's perspective—looking up at Thalos, running through streets, surrounded by chaos.
*   **Kinetic Chaos:** Motion blur, tilted angles, partial views of the monster. You rarely see Thalos fully—just legs, tentacles, or its silhouette.
*   **Urban Devastation:** Show realistic destruction—crumbling concrete, sparking power lines, overturned vehicles, fleeing crowds.
*   **Parasites as Horror:** The spawn creatures are visceral body horror—sharp teeth, slick chitin, fast and deadly.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Chaotic, frantic, overwhelming, terrifying, ground-level, civilian perspective, visceral.
*   **Feeling:** You are not the hero. You are trying not to die. The monster is too big, too alien, too much.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic with motion blur and dynamic action. Thalos is massive and organic—covered in barnacles, kelp, and dripping seawater. Spawn are insectoid, all sharp angles and teeth.
*   **Forms:** Buildings are modern/fantasy urban. Thalos is a grotesque mix of squid, whale, and something impossible. Spawn are like oversized mantises with elongated jaws.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic illustration of Thalos the Deep-Born from ground level. Only its massive, barnacle-covered legs and lower body are visible as it strides through a city street. Buildings collapse in the foreground. Motion blur suggests frantic movement."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dark, urban tones—grays, blacks, browns. Thalos is deep blue-green with orange bioluminescent eyes. Fires add orange-red. The ocean is dark, churning blue-black.
*   **Emotional Impact:** Harsh contrasts between fire, darkness, and the creature's eerie glow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, urban color palette of grays and blacks, lit by orange firelight and Thalos's glowing orange eyes. The creature's hide is deep blue-green, dripping with seawater."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Ordinary city residents in modern/fantasy clothing—tunics, cloaks, leather. Disheveled, covered in dust, terrified. Captain Rhysa wears military armor.
*   **Thalos:** A colossal sea creature—200 feet tall, covered in barnacles, kelp, and crustaceans. Multiple glowing orange eyes. Tentacles and massive clawed limbs. Dripping, ancient, terrifying.
*   **Spawn Creatures:** Dog-sized parasitic monsters—insectoid bodies, elongated jaws full of teeth, multiple legs, translucent chitin. Fast and aggressive.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A spawn creature, a dog-sized insectoid parasite with a translucent, chitinous body. Its elongated jaw is lined with needle-like teeth. It has six legs ending in sharp claws and glows faintly with bioluminescence."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Harbor District:** Ships overturned, docks shattered, water flooding streets. Bodies and debris everywhere.
*   **Middle City:** Partially collapsed buildings, fires, abandoned vehicles, crowds fleeing. Power lines sparking.
*   **Cathedral District:** Grand stone cathedral, partially destroyed by Thalos. Rubble, smoke, stained glass shattered.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of Harbordeep's Middle City. Buildings lean at dangerous angles, smoke rises, and fires burn. In the background, Thalos's massive form towers over the skyline. In the foreground, crowds flee through rubble-strewn streets."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, dramatic lighting. Firelight, sparking electricity, Thalos's bioluminescent glow. Night scenes are lit by flames and magical lights. Shadows are deep.
*   **Chaos Effect:** Light flickers and shifts as buildings collapse and fires spread.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by fires burning throughout the city and the eerie orange glow of Thalos's eyes in the distance. Shadows are deep, and smoke obscures parts of the scene."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic, tilted angles. Low-angle shots looking up at Thalos. Tight shots in crowds. Wide shots showing the scale of destruction. Rarely show Thalos fully—partial views are more terrifying.
*   **Techniques:** Use foreground chaos (fleeing people, falling debris) with Thalos looming in the background. Frame the party small against the massive creature.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot from street level. In the foreground, a PC runs toward the camera, face streaked with dust and terror. Behind them, Thalos's massive leg crushes a building. Debris rains down. The composition emphasizes the human scale against the monster."

## Voice

A breathless, panicked male voice with bursts of urgency, delivering lines with barely-controlled fear and adrenaline. The standard American accent carries a civilian's perspective—not a warrior, but a survivor. The pacing is rapid, with sharp intakes of breath and occasional voice cracks. The emotion is raw terror mixed with desperate hope. Audio quality is clear, studio-quality, with ambient chaos (screams, explosions, roars). Role: A survivor recounting the attack while fleeing, or a radio broadcaster describing the disaster in real-time.
