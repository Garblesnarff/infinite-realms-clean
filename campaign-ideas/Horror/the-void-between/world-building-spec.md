# World-Building Specification: The Void Between

## Core Concept
Minimalist dimension of infinite white void with rare geometric essentials. Party gradually reduced while seeking Final Reduction artifact. Must embrace simplicity or be erased.

## Lore
- **Origin**: Dimension created by ultimate act of subtraction - removing everything until only void remains
- **The Reduction Process**: Complexity naturally eliminated; only essence can persist
- **The Final Reduction**: Not artifact but choice to reduce to essential truth
- **Geometric Entities**: Pure forms (Cube, Line, Plane, Sphere) as only inhabitants

## Factions
None - too minimal for organized groups. Only individual geometric consciousnesses.

## Entities
- **The Cube**: Perfect geometric form, first guide
- **The Line**: One-dimensional consciousness
- **The Plane**: Two-dimensional awareness
- **The Sphere**: Three-dimensional being
- **The Void**: Pure negative space itself, sentient absence

## Locations
- **White Expanse**: Infinite empty starting space
- **The Line**: One-dimensional path
- **The Plane**: Two-dimensional surface
- **The Sphere**: Three-dimensional form
- **Center of Nothing**: Absolute void, final location

## Mechanics
- **Reduction per Session**: Lose one non-essential element
- **Essence Points**: Clarity gained as complexity lost
- **Negative Space Navigation**: Move through what isn't there
- **Minimal Combat**: Rare, simple, geometric
- **Meditation Checks**: Accept reduction without losing self

## Causality Chains
- **IF** lose all items **THEN** gain pure essence bonuses
- **IF** reduce to essential self **THEN** transcend to geometric form
- **IF** reject reduction **THEN** expelled but learn to value complexity
- **IF** reach Center **THEN** choose: simplify world, transcend, or return with wisdom
