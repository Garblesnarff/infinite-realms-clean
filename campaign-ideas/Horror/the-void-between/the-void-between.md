# The Void Between

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Minimalist Fantasy / Existential Meditation / Negative Space Horror
- **Estimated Length**: 6-10 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 8-15
- **Tone**: Silent, Sparse, Meditative, Profound, Unsettling

### Core Premise
The Void Between is a dimension of absolute minimalism - vast empty white space with occasional single elements of pure form. A cube. A sphere. A line. Nothing unnecessary exists. There are no NPCs, no towns, no dungeons - only the party, geometric essentials, and infinite negative space. The party arrives seeking the Final Reduction, an artifact that can simplify their impossibly complicated world crisis. However, the Void is actively reducing them - each session, they lose something (equipment, abilities, memories, eventually parts of themselves). To survive and find the artifact, they must embrace minimalist philosophy: reduction to essence, appreciation of negative space, understanding that emptiness is not absence but presence. The ultimate test is whether they can exist as pure essential selves with all complexity stripped away.

### Core Themes
- **Reduction to Essence**: Stripping away all non-essential until only truth remains
- **Negative Space as Presence**: Emptiness is not nothing; void is something
- **Less is More**: Constraint reveals rather than limits
- **Pure Form**: Geometric primitives as ultimate reality
- **The Terror of Simplicity**: Being reduced to bare existence

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Stripping (Sessions 1-2)**
Party enters infinite white void. Immediately begin losing non-essential items - decorative equipment vanishes, complex weapons simplify, elaborate backstories fade from memory. Meet the only "NPC" - The Cube, a perfect geometric form that communicates through position and orientation. Learn they must reach the Center of Nothing where the Final Reduction exists.

**Act 2: The Geometric Path (Sessions 3-6)**
Navigate through minimal landmarks: The Line (infinite one-dimensional path), The Plane (two-dimensional surface), The Sphere (perfect three-dimensional form). Each location forces reduction - lose more complexity, gain existential clarity. Combat is minimal - occasional simple geometric entities that attack. More time spent in meditation and philosophical discussion about what's essential to self.

**Act 3: The Center of Nothing (Sessions 7-8)**
Reach absolute void - not even geometric forms exist here, only pure negative space. The Final Reduction is revealed: it's not an artifact but a choice. The party can reduce their world crisis to its essential elements (might not solve it but makes it comprehensible), reduce themselves to pure essence (transcend but lose individuality), or reject reduction entirely (accept complexity as necessary).

**Act 4: The Return to Complexity (Sessions 9-10)**
Based on choice, party either brings simplifying power to complex world (might help, might destroy nuance), stays in void as essential forms (become geometric entities), or returns with appreciation for complexity (wisdom rather than artifact). Epilogue explores consequences of minimalism applied to maximalist problems.

### Major NPCs
- **The Cube**: Only entity in void, perfect geometric form, communicates through position/orientation
- **The Line**: Infinite one-dimensional consciousness
- **The Plane**: Two-dimensional awareness
- **The Sphere**: Perfect three-dimensional being
- **The Void Itself**: Final entity, pure negative space with consciousness

### Key Locations
- **The White Expanse**: Infinite empty space, starting location
- **The Line**: One-dimensional path through nothing
- **The Plane**: Two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional void
- **The Sphere**: Three-dimensional form floating in space
- **The Center of Nothing**: Absolute void, final location

### Unique Mechanics
- **Reduction Mechanic**: Each session, lose one non-essential element (DM chooses with player consent)
- **Essence Points**: As you lose complexity, gain clarity - bonuses to insight and perception
- **Negative Space Navigation**: Move through void by understanding where things aren't
- **Minimal Combat**: Rare, simple, geometric. Focus is on avoiding rather than fighting.
- **Meditation Checks**: Wisdom saves to accept reduction without losing sense of self

### Plot Twists
1. **The Party Is Reducing the Void**: Their presence adds complexity; void is defending itself
2. **One PC Is the Final Reduction**: A party member is the artifact - they must choose to reduce themselves
3. **The Void Is Mercy**: Complexity causes suffering; reduction is compassion
4. **Everything Already Happened**: The white space is after the end of everything

### Victory Conditions
- **Essential Return**: Accept reduction, bring simplifying wisdom to complex world
- **Geometric Transcendence**: Become minimal entities, stay in void as pure forms
- **Complexity Appreciation**: Reject reduction, return valuing intricacy and nuance

### Defeat Conditions
- **Total Reduction**: Lose all essential elements including self-awareness, cease to exist
- **Void Rejection**: Refuse reduction entirely, expelled back to complex world having learned nothing
- **Paralysis**: Unable to choose, trapped in white space forever contemplating options
