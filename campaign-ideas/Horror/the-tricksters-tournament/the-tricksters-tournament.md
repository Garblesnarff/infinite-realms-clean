# The Trickster's Tournament
**Tagline:** *Welcome to the show! The rules are simple... and constantly changing.*

## Campaign Overview

The Archfey known as the Laughing King has grown bored with eternity and decided to host the most entertaining game show in any realm. Eighty-eight contestants have been whisked away to his impossible domain in the Feywild, where they'll compete in absurd, deadly, and constantly-changing games for his amusement and fabulous prizes. Think Willy Wonka meets Squid Game meets Alice in Wonderland—beautiful chaos with lethal consequences.

Unlike brutal survival games, the Trickster's Tournament is theatrical, whimsical, and utterly unfair. Rules change mid-game, reality bends to the host's whims, and "death" might not be permanent—but it's always humiliating. Contestants must navigate riddles, physical challenges, talent competitions, and pure chaos while maintaining their sanity in a realm where logic is optional and the audience is trees, animals, and sentient clouds who vote on outcomes.

The campaign blends dark comedy, surreal horror, and strategic gameplay. Success requires creativity, adaptability, humor, and the ability to think like a trickster yourself.

## Core Themes
- **Chaos and Unpredictability:** No stable rules
- **Entertainment Above All:** Your suffering is the show
- **Creativity Over Strength:** Clever beats powerful
- **Fey Logic:** Internal consistency not guaranteed
- **Humiliation:** Failure is embarrassing, not just fatal
- **Joy in Cruelty:** Laughing at your expense

## Key NPCs

**The Laughing King** (Archfey, Trickster God): Host, Game Master, rules-changer, chaotic neutral, genuinely finds suffering hilarious, but rewards cleverness, possibly has deeper motive.

**The Contestants:**
- Grimble Glitter (Goblin, too earnest)
- Madam Mystique (Changeling, shapeshifter)
- Sir Stalwart (Paladin, completely out of his depth)
- The Riddler (Sphinx, thinks he's smartest)
- Melody Mayhem (Bard, trying to win through performance)
- The Silent One (Never speaks, always survives)

- Sometimes contestants after elimination

**The Assistants:**
- Chesire (Cat advisor, cryptic)
- The Dealers (Card-themed enforcers)
- Bubbles (Pixie assistant, overly cheerful)

## Major Locations

**The Candy Forest:** Sweet but sinister, edible but sentient.
**The Backwards Castle:** Gravity optional, rooms shift.
**The Giggling Gardens:** Beautiful flowers that laugh at you.
**The Maze of Mirrors:** Reflects worst selves.
**The Audience Chamber:** Where everything is watched.
**The Prize Vault:** Wish fulfillment with ironic twists.

## Unique Mechanics

**Rule Chaos:** Rules announced, then immediately change. Players must adapt mid-challenge. No consistent logic. Creativity rewarded over optimization.

**Audience Votes:** Sentient Feywild creatures vote. Can be swayed by entertainment value. Sometimes votes ignored by King. Democracy is theater.

**Death Not Permanent (Usually):** Eliminated players often return. Cursed, transformed, or as audience. True death possible but rare. Humiliation is real punishment.

**Fey Bargains:** Can negotiate with King or others. Always backfires hilariously. Exact wording matters. Monkey's paw territory.

**Reality Bending:** Arena changes mid-challenge. Up becomes down, time loops, size shifts. Sanity checks common.

**Entertainment Value:** How funny your failure is matters. Dying entertainingly might earn resurrection. Boring competence punished. Spectacular failure rewarded.
