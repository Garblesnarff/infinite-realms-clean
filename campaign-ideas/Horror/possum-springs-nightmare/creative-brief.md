## Art Style: Flat 2D Cartoony with Melancholic Atmosphere (Night in the Woods-inspired)

Inspired by the distinctive flat-color aesthetic and emotionally rich environments of *Night in the Woods*. This style captures the melancholic beauty of small-town decay, the contrast between cute animal characters and dark themes, the cozy-yet-unsettling atmosphere, and the visual language of millennial/Gen-Z anxiety.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Flat Color Design:** Simple shapes, solid colors, no gradients, paper-cutout aesthetic
*   **Anthropomorphic Animals:** Cute character designs discussing heavy themes
*   **Small Town Decay:** Boarded windows, closed shops, autumn colors, nostalgic but dying
*   **Cozy Horror:** Warm colors and friendly designs hiding existential dread

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Melancholic, relatable, cozy-yet-unsettling, small town decay, autumn atmosphere, existential, millennial anxiety, hopeful sadness
*   **Feeling:** The bittersweet ache of returning home to find everything smaller and sadder. The comfort of old friendships. The dread of cosmic insignificance mixed with mundane economic anxiety.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Autumn Dominance:** Orange, red, brown leaves, golden hour lighting
*   **Town Colors:** Faded paint, rust, brick red, concrete gray
*   **Night Scenes:** Deep blues, sodium-vapor streetlight orange, starlit purples
*   **Character Colors:** Mae (dark gray/black cat), Bea (teal gator), Gregg (yellow fox), Angus (brown bear)
*   **Horror Elements:** Deep blacks, cosmic void colors, wrong geometry
*   **Prompt Example:** "...flat 2D art style showing a small town main street in autumn. Closed storefronts with 'FOR SALE' signs, leaves on the ground, old brick buildings. Simple geometric shapes, solid colors without gradients. Golden hour lighting. A black cat character (Mae) walks down the sidewalk looking small against the decaying architecture. Melancholic but beautiful atmosphere."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Mae Borowski:** Black cat, slouchy posture, hoodie or band t-shirt, big eyes, expressive
*   **Bea Santello:** Teal-green alligator, flannel and jeans, cigarette, tired expression
*   **Gregg Lee:** Yellow-orange fox, leather jacket, manic energy, sharp grin
*   **Angus Delaney:** Large brown bear, glasses, gentle expression, sweater
*   **Townspeople:** Various animals, middle-aged, tired, regular working-class designs
*   **All Flat Style:** Simple shapes, solid colors, expressive despite minimal detail
*   **Prompt Example:** "Character lineup in flat 2D style. Left to right: Mae (black cat, red flannel, jeans, bass guitar), Bea (teal gator, work shirt with name tag, cigarette, exhausted eyes), Gregg (yellow fox, leather jacket, ripped jeans, energetic pose), Angus (brown bear, cardigan sweater, glasses, calm smile). Paper-cutout aesthetic with solid colors. Night in the Woods art style."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Main Street:** Brick buildings, boarded shops, autumn trees, small-town architecture
*   **The Woods:** Simplified tree shapes, deep shadows, mysterious but not immediately threatening
*   **The Mines:** Angular industrial decay, geometric darkness, wrong spaces
*   **Mae's Room:** Teen bedroom frozen in time, band posters, cluttered
*   **The Church:** Gothic simplified, looming but flat style
*   **Interiors:** Warm lighting, cozy but tinged with sadness
*   **Prompt Example:** "Flat 2D scene: Interior of 'The Pickaxe' hardware store. Shelves with tools rendered as simple shapes. Counter with old register. Bea behind counter looking tired. Warm overhead lighting. Autumn sunset visible through storefront window. Cozy but emphasizes economic struggle. Solid colors, no gradients, geometric simplification."

**5. Slice-of-Life and Horror Contrast:**
*   **Day Scenes:** Warm, inviting, activities with friends feel genuine and comforting
*   **Dream/Horror:** Sharp angles, impossible geometry, cosmic void colors, stars that watch
*   **Transition:** Horror emerges from familiar—regular places becoming wrong
*   **Visual Language:** Straight lines and order become chaotic angles during horror
*   **Prompt Example:** "Split scene in flat 2D style. Top half: Mae and friends hanging out on church roof at golden hour, laughing, autumn colors, cozy. Bottom half: Mae's nightmare—same roof but geometry is wrong, angles don't make sense, vast black void with staring eyes replaces sky, deep unsettling blues and blacks. Same flat art style but distorted."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Flat Lighting:** No complex shading, solid color fills
*   **Atmospheric Depth:** Multiple flat layers create depth without gradients
*   **Time of Day:** Orange (golden hour), Yellow (day), Deep Blue (night), Black (horror moments)
*   **Streetlights:** Sodium-vapor orange pools of light in night scenes
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit with flat lighting—no gradients or complex shading. Autumn afternoon with warm orange-gold tones. Streetlights cast solid circles of light on sidewalk. Deep blue sky above. Geometric buildings create depth through overlapping flat shapes. A cat silhouette walks beneath a streetlight. Melancholic autumn atmosphere in paper-cutout style."

## Music & Sound

An indie folk-rock soundtrack mixing acoustic instruments with ambient atmosphere. Features banjo, guitar, bass, and drums—Mae's band practice is diegetic music. Day music is warm and contemplative, night music adds tension and mystery, horror moments use dissonance and drones. Each friend has a musical motif. The soundtrack should feel like small-town America falling apart slowly. Night in the Woods-inspired: Alt-folk with emo energy, nostalgia mixed with dread. Sound design emphasizes autumn: leaves crunching, wind, distant trains, the emptiness of closed shops.

## Voice

Mae's internal voice is sarcastic but vulnerable, making dark jokes to cope with anxiety. Dialogue between friends is naturalistic—how real people talk, with inside jokes and comfortable silence. Cultists speak with desperate hope that sounds wrong when you know what they're doing. The cosmic horror doesn't speak—it's utterly silent, making human voices seem small. Role: The voice of millennials/Gen-Z facing unfixable systemic problems with humor as armor against despair.
