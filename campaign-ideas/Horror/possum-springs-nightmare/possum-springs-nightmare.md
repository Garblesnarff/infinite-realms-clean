## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A slow-burn mystery where cosmic horror emerges from economic despair.

*   **Act I — Homecoming and Weird (Sessions 1-7):** Mae returns home to Possum Springs, a rust belt town slowly dying as jobs disappear and young people leave. Days are spent hanging out with friends, exploring town, attending parties, and dealing with personal issues—Mae's anxiety and unspecified "incident" that made her leave college, Bea's crushing family responsibility running the hardware store, Gregg and Angus planning to escape to the city. At night, Mae has vivid dreams and sees a ghostly figure. Arms start appearing randomly. People whisper about someone going missing. The tone is cozy and relatable until unsettling details accumulate: a man falls off his balcony ranting about "the hole," teenagers find a severed arm in the woods, strange hymns heard from the old church.
*   **Act II — Investigation and Darkness (Sessions 8-14):** The party begins actively investigating after a friend's family member disappears. They explore locations: the abandoned mines where the town's prosperity once came from, the old church where a cult meets, the woods where strange things happen. They discover the Cult of the Black Goat—desperate middle-aged townsfolk who believe sacrificing people to an ancient entity will bring back jobs and prosperity. The cultists aren't evil monsters—they're regular people driven to horror by economic hopelessness. The party also deals with personal arcs: Bea confronting her dying mother, Gregg's manic energy hiding desperation, Angus's trauma from abusive childhood, Mae's dissociative episodes and fear of turning out like her mentally ill relatives.
*   **Act III — Confrontation and Choice (Sessions 15-20):** The cult's final sacrifice is planned—they'll feed enough people to fully awaken the entity. The party descends into the abandoned mines to stop them. They face both cultists (some are neighbors, parents of friends, familiar faces) and the cosmic horror itself—an incomprehensible entity that has slept beneath Possum Springs for eons, feeding on despair. The party can't kill it—it's too vast—but they can stop the cult and seal the mine. The choice: Destroy evidence and protect the town's ignorance, or Reveal the truth and shatter what little remains. Either way, the cosmic horror isn't defeated, just delayed. The real victory is in friendship—Mae and her friends supporting each other through impossible circumstances. They can't fix the economy or banish the horror, but they can be there for each other.

    *   Must decide: Tell the town the truth or protect them from knowledge
    *   Truth option: Reveal cult, cause trauma, some won't believe, town splits

    *   Neither option fixes the economic decay or removes the entity permanently
    *   Real resolution: Friends commit to staying together, supporting each other
**Resolution:** Possum Springs is still dying economically. The cosmic horror still sleeps below. But Mae and her friends face it together. They plan futures: Maybe leave together, maybe stay and fight the slow death, maybe just survive. The campaign ends not with victory over the horror, but with human connection mattering despite cosmic insignificance. Final scene: Mae and friends on the roof of the church, watching stars, talking about nothing and everything. The horror exists, but so does friendship.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of economic anxiety, quarter-life crisis, mental health, small town decay, cosmic insignificance, and finding meaning through friendship. It asks: How do you cope when systemic problems are unfixable? Can friendship matter in a meaningless universe? What drives normal people to horror? The central conflict is between human connection and cosmic/economic despair—neither fully wins.
