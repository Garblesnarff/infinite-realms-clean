### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Constant's Curse**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party awakens in the Constant, a nightmarish pocket dimension where the laws of nature are twisted into a gothic, Tim Burton-esque parody of reality. To survive, they must gather strange resources, craft bizarre contraptions, and manage their deteriorating sanity as shadows whisper and monstrous creatures emerge from the darkness. The Constant is ruled by the Shadow King, an entity that feeds on despair, and the party must endure increasingly harsh seasonal cycles—culminating in the Eternal Winter, when the Deerclops and worse nightmares hunt them. Escape requires unlocking the secrets of the ancient Gateways scattered across the land and confronting the Shadow King in his throne room at the heart of the Nightmare dimension.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Constant: a pocket dimension created by the Shadow King as a prison and feeding ground for lost souls.
    *   Write the history of Maxwell, a stage magician who made a deal with the Shadow King for power, inadvertently creating the modern Constant and becoming its first warden.
    *   Describe the nature of the Shadow King: an entity of pure nightmare that exists by consuming fear, despair, and sanity.
    *   Explain the Gateways: ancient structures left by a previous civilization that once tried to escape the Constant, leaving clues to their method.
    *   Detail the seasonal curse: why the Constant cycles through increasingly hostile seasons, and how the Eternal Winter represents the final test.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Nightmare Court** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain the Constant, feed on trapped souls, and ensure a warden always sits on the Nightmare Throne.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Shadow King, served by shadow creatures (Terrorbeak, Crawling Horror) and nightmare manifestations.
        *   **Public Agenda:** (None. They operate through fear and whispers.)
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Shadow King needs a warden to stabilize the Constant. Without one, the dimension collapses, and the Shadow King starves.
        *   **Assets:** Control over shadows, ability to manifest nightmares, the Nightmare Throne.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to all souls in the Constant; seeks to break their wills and turn them into wardens.
    *   **The Survivors** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To survive, maintain sanity, and hopefully escape the Constant.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy. Individuals like Wilson, Willow, and Wolfgang are scattered across the land.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Share knowledge, trade resources, and support each other.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some, like Maxwell, have hidden motives (seeking redemption, escape, or even revenge on the Shadow King).
        *   **Assets:** Crafting knowledge, bases, resourcefulness.
        *   **Relationships:** Generally friendly to each other, though sanity loss can turn them hostile.
    *   **The Pig-Men** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To live simple lives, trade with outsiders, and avoid the full moons that transform them.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Tribal, with a Pig King who hoards gold and trinkets.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Trade meat and resources for gold and shiny objects.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They fear the curse that turns them into Were-Pigs and would do anything to break it, even if it means betraying allies.
        *   **Assets:** The Pig Village, a steady supply of meat and manure, knowledge of safe foraging areas.
        *   **Relationships:** Friendly during the day; hostile during full moons.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

    *   **Maxwell (The Puppet Master):** The former warden of the Constant, now free but guilt-ridden and bitter.
    *   **The Shadow King:** The incomprehensible ruler of the Nightmare dimension, feeding on fear and despair.

    *   "Sanity-Broken Former Adventurer"

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party's sanity collectively drops below 100 total.
    *   **THEN:** Shadow creatures (Terrorbeak, Crawling Horror) begin spawning near the party, even in daylight. Generate random attacks.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully defeats the Deerclops.
    *   **THEN:** They can harvest its eye for powerful crafting recipes (Eyebrella, which protects from rain and heat). The Constant becomes slightly safer until the next major boss spawns.
    *   **IF:** The party activates all five Gateways.
    *   **THEN:** A portal to the Nightmare Dimension opens. The Shadow King's whispers intensify, and shadow creatures become more aggressive. The party must enter to finish the campaign.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats the Shadow King.
    *   **THEN:** The Constant begins to collapse. All trapped souls are freed. The party escapes, but Maxwell remains, choosing to stay and ensure the dimension is truly destroyed.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to sit on the Nightmare Throne.
    *   **THEN:** One character becomes the new warden of the Constant, freeing all others but condemning themselves to eternal imprisonment. The campaign ends with a bittersweet victory.
