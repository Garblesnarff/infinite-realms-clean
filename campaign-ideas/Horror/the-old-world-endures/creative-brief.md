# Creative Brief: The Old World Endures

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grimdark Fantasy with Multiple Faction Aesthetics (Total War: Warhammer-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal fantasy warfare of *Total War: Warhammer* with distinct visual identities for each faction. This style captures massive army battles, grimdark fantasy horror, legendary heroes, and reality-warping Chaos corruption.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Faction Diversity:** Each race has completely unique architecture, units, and visual language
*   **Mass Battle Scale:** Thousands of troops clashing, monsters towering over infantry, magic devastating battlefields
*   **Grimdark Aesthetic:** Dark, brutal, gothic, nothing is clean or bright except magic
*   **Chaos Corruption:** Visual reality warping, mutations, daemonic horror

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grimdark fantasy, mass warfare, legendary lords, faction diversity, chaos corruption, brutal, gothic
*   **Feeling:** Overwhelming scale of army battles. Each faction visually distinct and powerful. Chaos as existential horror warping reality.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Empire:** Reds, golds, imperial purples, steel armor, baroque gothic
*   **Dwarfs:** Bronze, stone gray, orange firelight from forges, runic blue glow
*   **Greenskins:** Dirty browns, toxic greens, rusted metal, chaotic warpaint
*   **Vampires:** Blood reds, corpse grays, midnight blacks, sickly green necromancy
*   **Chaos:** Corrupted purples, pus yellows, blood reds, impossible colors, mutations
*   **Prompt Example:** "...showing faction diversity. Empire soldiers in red and gold uniforms with steel plate and feathered hats. Dwarf warriors in bronze armor with runic glow. Greenskin Orcs in dirty browns with crude weapons. Vampire skeletal warriors in tattered armor. Behind them all, Chaos warriors in spiked black armor with purple corruption auras."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Empire:** Renaissance-era soldiers, knights in plate armor, wizards in robes, steam tanks
*   **Dwarfs:** Short but broad, massive beards, heavy armor, axes and hammers, runic inscriptions
*   **Greenskins:** Brutish Orcs and small Goblins, crude weapons, tribal aesthetics
*   **Vampires:** Pale aristocratic vampires, skeletal warriors, zombies, ethereal ghosts
*   **Chaos:** Spiked armor, mutations (extra limbs, tentacles), daemonic features
*   **Prompt Example:** "Emperor Karl Franz riding his griffon Deathclaw: regal armor in red and gold with feathered mantle. His runefang sword glows with magical runes. Deathclaw is a massive lion-eagle hybrid with golden plumage. Behind them, Empire state troops in formation with halberds and handguns."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Empire Cities:** Gothic baroque architecture, massive walls, castle-cities, steam technology
*   **Dwarf Holds:** Underground halls carved from mountains, forges, ancient vaults
*   **Greenskin Camps:** Ramshackle structures, crude fortifications, garbage heaps
*   **Vampire Lands:** Gothic castles, perpetual night, graveyards, corrupted forests
*   **Chaos Wastes:** Reality warps, floating rocks, impossible geometry, daemon-infested
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive battlefield: Empire state troops in formation face a Greenskin WAAAGH! Thousands of Orcs charge screaming. Steam tanks fire cannons. Cavalry clash on flanks. A giant troll towers over infantry. In the sky, a griffon duels a wyvern. Gothic castle burns in background."

**5. Magic and Chaos Corruption:**
*   **Empire Magic:** Bright wizard fire, celestial lightning, amber beast transformation
*   **Vampire Magic:** Green necromantic energy raising corpses, life drain
*   **Greenskin Magic:** Wild green energy, random chaotic effects
*   **Chaos Magic:** Reality warps, mutation, summoning daemons, purple-pink horror
*   **Prompt Example:** "Chaos corruption spreading: A settlement with purple-pink corruption tendrils growing like vines. Buildings warp and twist into impossible angles. Citizens mutate—extra limbs, eyes, tentacles. A Chaos rift tears reality, daemons pouring through. Everything feels wrong and nightmarish."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Battlefield:** Dark and brutal, lit by fire and magic
*   **Faction Cities:** Each has unique lighting (Empire: torches, Dwarfs: forge glow, Vampires: moonlight)
*   **Chaos:** Light doesn't behave correctly, shadows wrong
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by burning buildings casting orange glow. Lightning from wizards illuminates battlefield in flashes. Vampire necromancy creates sickly green glow. Chaos corruption warps light into purple-pink nightmarish hues."

## Voice

A voice that begins with commanding battlefield presence ("Hold the line! For the Empire!"), carries weight of historical grudges, and ultimately speaks with desperate determination against Chaos apocalypse. The pacing is powerful and authoritative. The tone shifts between faction pride ("The Dwarfs never forget a grudge"), tactical command, and existential dread facing Chaos ("If we fall here, reality itself ends"). Slightly British/Germanic accent for Empire, Scottish for Dwarfs, brutish for Orcs. Role: The voice of legendary command and desperate survival.
