The party is assembled by Professor Van Helsing to hunt Count Dracula, an ancient vampire who has left his Transylvanian castle to prey upon London society. This is not a simple monster—Dracula is intelligent, aristocratic, seductive, and commands an army of undead servants. The hunters must gather knowledge of vampire lore, protect the innocent, and pursue Dracula from the gaslit streets of London back to his unholy castle, all while he turns their chase into a game of predator and prey.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **The Hunter Becomes Hunted:** Dracula actively hunts the party, infiltrating their safe houses, corrupting their allies, and turning investigation into survival.
*   **Vampire Powers:** Dracula can shapeshift, control animals, charm victims, and create thralls. Traditional combat is suicide.
*   **Time Pressure:** Each night, Dracula feeds and grows stronger. Delay means more victims and a more powerful enemy.
*   **Corruption:** Characters can be bitten, charmed, or turned, requiring allies to save them—or destroy them.

## Central Conflict

Civilization versus primal predation. Dracula represents ancient aristocracy that views humans as property, seduction that corrupts moral purity, and death that refuses to stay buried. The party represents modern rationality, faith, friendship, and the belief that evil can be destroyed. But Dracula is patient, powerful, and turns the hunt against them. Can they destroy him before he destroys them—or worse, turns them?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Corruption Tracking**
*   Characters bitten by vampires gain corruption. High corruption grants powers but risks turning fully.

### 2. **Vampire Weaknesses**
*   The party must discover and exploit weaknesses: sunlight, stakes, holy symbols, running water, garlic.

### 3. **Mina's Connection**
*   When hypnotized, Mina can sense Dracula's location and plans, providing intel but risking exposure.

### 4. **Dracula's Lairs**
*   Dracula has multiple safe houses. Each destroyed weakens him and limits his options.

### 5. **The Chase Mechanics**
*   The journey to Transylvania is a race against time with Dracula ahead of them.

### 6. **Final Confrontation Timer**
*   Must defeat Dracula before sunset. After dark, he's nearly impossible to kill.
