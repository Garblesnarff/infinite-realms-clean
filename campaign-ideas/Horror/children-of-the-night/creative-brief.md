# Creative Brief: Children of the Night

## Art Style: Victorian Gothic (Hammer Horror meets Bram Stoker)

Rich, dramatic gothic imagery combining Victorian propriety with seductive horror. Think Christopher Lee's Dracula aesthetic—elegant, predatory, aristocratic evil.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Deep crimsons, velvet blacks, pallid skin tones, gaslight yellows, moonlight silvers. Dracula wears black with touches of red. Blood is vividly bright against dark backgrounds.

**Character Design:** Victorian fashion—high collars, long coats, corsets, top hats. Dracula is tall, pale, aristocratic with hypnotic eyes. Vampires are beautiful but subtly wrong—too pale, too still, predatory grace.

**Environments:** Gothic London—fog-shrouded streets, gas lamps, Victorian interiors. Castle Dracula is all stone arches, coffins, cobwebs, and ancient evil.

**Lighting:** Chiaroscuro—deep shadows and dramatic highlights. Gaslight creates warm pools in darkness. Moonlight is cold and revealing. Sunrise is salvation.

## Voice

A deep, aristocratic voice with Romanian/Eastern European accent, every word deliberate and seductive. The voice of immortal evil that has perfected the art of manipulation. Underneath cultured sophistication lurks ancient hunger.

## Music Style

Gothic orchestral horror—organ for ominous atmosphere, strings for tension, choir for religious battle between good and evil. Use Romantic era classical (Wagner, Liszt) meets horror film scores. Dracula has a powerful, seductive theme. The hunters have a desperate, heroic counter-theme. Moments of silence emphasize dread.
