**Onett Anomalies**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Ordinary children develop PSI (psychic) powers after a meteor crash in the modern town of Onett. A time-traveling bee warns that the cosmic entity Giygas will destroy the world. The players must journey across Eagleland, stopping alien-influenced threats while collecting eight melodies from sanctuary locations. The campaign blends quirky slice-of-life moments with increasingly surreal horror, culminating in a confrontation with incomprehensible cosmic evil that can only be defeated through prayer and emotional connection.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.

    *   Write the prophecy that identifies specific children as the chosen ones capable of facing Giygas.
    *   Describe the nature of PSI (psychic powers) and how they manifest in humans through emotional connection to Earth.
    *   Explain the Eight Sanctuaries - special locations tied to Earth's spirit and the player's own memories.
    *   Detail the Apple of Enlightenment - a device that can predict the future, which identified the chosen children.
    *   Write about the Magypsies - psychic guardians protecting needles that seal darker powers.

    *   **IF:** Players help NPCs (defeat local threats, retrieve items, solve problems).
    *   **THEN:** Add those NPCs to the "prayer list." Paula can call on them during battle, especially crucial for Giygas fight.
    *   **IF:** Players collect all eight melodies.
    *   **THEN:** Unlock access to Magicant, face the inner nightmare, gain massive power increase necessary for final battle.
    *   **IF:** Jeff successfully repairs broken items.
    *   **THEN:** Gain unique gadgets - bottlerockets, shield killers, HP suckers. Reward exploration and item collection.
    *   **IF:** Players face Giygas without sufficient prayer support.
    *   **THEN:** Conventional PSI damage is minimal. Prayer becomes essential, calling on everyone helped throughout journey.
    *   **IF:** Players maintain childhood normalcy (call home, eat favorite foods, rest properly).
    *   **THEN:** Mechanical benefits through healing and removing homesickness, thematic reinforcement of staying grounded.
    *   **IF:** Players pray during Giygas fight.
    *   **THEN:** NPCs from throughout the journey respond - family, friends, people helped, even enemies redeemed. Their emotional support damages Giygas.
    *   **IF:** Sufficient prayers weaken Giygas.
    *   **THEN:** The incomprehensible entity becomes vulnerable, can finally be destroyed, timeline saved.
    *   **IF:** Players complete the journey maintaining hope and connection.
    *   **THEN:** Ending emphasizes they remain normal children who did extraordinary things, returning to normal life forever changed but hopeful.
