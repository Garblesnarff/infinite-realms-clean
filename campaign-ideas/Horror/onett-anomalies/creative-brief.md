# Creative Brief: Onett Anomalies

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Quirky Americana Horror (Earthbound-inspired)

Inspired by the distinctive contrast of *Earthbound/Mother 2*, blending bright, colorful, cartoony Americana with increasingly surreal and horrifying imagery. This style aims to capture the quirky, surreal, hopeful, and cosmically horrifying tone of "Onett Anomalies," where children heroes face incomprehensible evil.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Contrast:** Juxtapose cheerful 1990s suburban America with cosmic horror. Show innocence confronting the incomprehensible.
*   **Surreal Escalation:** Start relatively normal, gradually introduce increasingly bizarre and unsettling elements.
*   **Childlike Perspective:** View the adventure through children's eyes - both the wonder and the terror are amplified.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Quirky, surreal, hopeful, cosmic horror, childhood adventure, Americana, psychic powers, incomprehensible evil, modern mundane meets alien terror.
*   **Feeling:** The dissonance between ice cream shops and eldritch horrors. The atmosphere balances childhood wonder and contemporary normalcy with increasing dread and surrealism. Things start fun and weird, escalate to deeply unsettling.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Simple, cartoony character designs with exaggerated proportions (big heads, simple features). Enemies range from silly (possessed flowers, walking trees) to increasingly disturbing (abstract horrors, Giygas's incomprehensible form).
*   **Textures:** Clean and simple for normal world, increasingly distorted and organic for alien/psychic elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cartoony illustration in Earthbound style. The focus is on a child with a striped shirt and baseball cap, wielding a baseball bat. The art style is simple and charming with bright colors."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Early game uses bright, primary colors - blue skies, green grass, red-brick buildings, yellow signs. As the campaign progresses, colors become more unsettling - sickly purples, pulsing reds, reality-breaking color combinations. Giygas's domain is overwhelming red.
*   **Psychological Use:** Color reflects mental state - bright for hope, distorted for fear, incomprehensible combinations for cosmic horror.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered in bright, cheerful primary colors showing a small American town with blue sky and green trees. However, in the distance, the sky has a subtle sickly purple tint suggesting something wrong."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Children in contemporary 1990s clothing - striped shirts, jeans, baseball caps, backpacks. Enemies start weird but comprehensible (zombie dogs, cult members) and progress to abstract (Starmen, Giygas). Mr. Saturn are adorably bizarre.
*   **Expression:** Despite simple features, characters convey clear emotions - determination, fear, confusion, hope.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A simple cartoony character design of a teenage girl with pink dress and bow. She has a peaceful expression and psychic energy (pink sparkles) around her hands, suggesting PSI powers."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Starts as realistic Americana - suburban streets, shopping districts, schools, burger joints, hotels. Gradually introduces surreal elements - caves that feel alive, departments stores that are too large, eventually the Cave of the Past where reality breaks down.
*   **Atmosphere:** Normal locations feel safe and nostalgic. Sanctuaries feel special and meditative. Late-game areas feel wrong - perspectives shift, backgrounds pulse, the red overwhelms.
*   **Details:** Modern details ground the setting - ATMs, payphones, neon signs, vending machines, bus stops. These familiar touchstones make the horror more effective.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cartoony illustration of a small American town main street with shops - a drugstore, a burger restaurant, a hotel. The style is simple and colorful. But the sky in the background has started to turn an unnatural red, and a strange starman figure stands in the distance."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Simple cel-shading for normal areas. PSI powers create colorful glows - blue for PK, pink for healing. Giygas's influence manifests as pulsing red lighting that makes no physical sense.
*   **Special Effects:** PSI attacks are bright, colorful, almost cheerful. Giygas's attacks are incomprehensible - backgrounds distort, colors invert, visual static, impossible shapes.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting and effects sell the contrast - the normal and comprehensible vs. the alien and incomprehensible.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh, pulsing red light that doesn't seem to come from any source. The background is distorted, with wavy lines and visual static suggesting reality breaking down. A simple cartoony character faces this with determination."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** SNES-RPG inspired compositions. Diagonal views for towns, straight-on for battles. Wide shots establish locations, tight shots show character reactions. Giygas breaks compositional rules - no clear focal point, unsettling symmetry, overwhelming presence.
*   **Techniques:** Use familiar framing for normal scenes, then deliberately break those rules for horror. Show scale - small children before massive incomprehensible entities.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide composition showing four children in simple cartoony style standing at the bottom of the frame, looking up at an overwhelming mass of red, pulsing, incomprehensible horror that fills most of the image. The entity has no clear form - just pain and wrongness visualized."

## Voice

A warm, nostalgic voice with an undercurrent of melancholy, like an adult reflecting on the bittersweet adventure of their childhood. The pacing shifts between cheerful and conversational (during normal moments) to hushed and disturbed (when discussing Giygas). The emotion balances childhood wonder and hope with cosmic dread - remembering both the ice cream and the incomprehensible horror. Audio quality has a slight vintage quality, like an old cassette tape, with occasional subtle distortions during horror moments. Role: An older version of one of the player characters, or the narrator from the player's mind-world (Magicant), reflecting on the adventure that changed everything.
