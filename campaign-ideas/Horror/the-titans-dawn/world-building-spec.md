# The Titan's Dawn - World Building Specification

## Cosmological History

**The Primordial Era** (Before Time Was Measured):
- Universe new, chaos dominant
- Six fundamental forces manifest as conscious beings: the Primals/Titans
- Terra (solid matter), Nyx (space/void), Marix (liquid), Pyron (energy/heat), Khione (stillness/cold), Tempest (change/motion)
- Titans shape early world through interactions—battles and alliances
- No life yet—world too violent

**The First Dormancy** (20,000+ years ago):
- Titans exhaust themselves
- Fall into deep sleep naturally
- World stabilizes around their bodies
- Life emerges: primordial organisms

**The First Awakening** (18,000 years ago):
- Titans wake naturally after millennia
- First civilization (not human—uncertain what species) destroyed in awakening
- Titans fight each other, reshape continents, return to sleep exhausted
- Reset cycle begins

**The Age of Gods** (15,000-10,000 years ago):
- Gods emerge from Titan-dreams or mortal belief (unclear)
- Recognize Titans as threat to their mortal worshippers
- Cast **The Great Binding**: magical seals preventing Titans from waking
- Requires divine maintenance every millennium
- Gods promise to uphold this

**The Second Awakening (Prevented)** (8,000 years ago):
- Seals begin failing
- Gods reinforce just in time
- Previous civilization (possibly elven empire) assists in ritual
- Successful prevention but barely

**The Age of Mortals** (8,000 years - present):
- Gods withdraw/die/ascend (unclear which)
- No divine maintenance performed for millennia
- Current civilization rises (humans, dwarves, elves, others)
- Built on Titan-geography without knowing
- Seals deteriorate slowly

**Campaign Present**:
- Magical saturation reaches critical threshold
- Seals fail simultaneously
- Titans begin waking naturally
- 8-month timeline to full awakening

## Geography of Titans

**Terra** (Earth Titan):
- Location: Largest continent's central mountain range
- Size: 50 miles long when standing (currently curled)
- Features: Spine = mountain range, shoulders = plateaus, hands = peninsula
- Population above: ~50 million across multiple kingdoms
- Awakening signs: Increasing seismic activity, "breathing" tremors

**Marix** (Ocean Titan):
- Location: Pacific-equivalent ocean basin
- Size: 80 miles long (serpentine)
- Features: Coiled on ocean floor, creates trenches and shelves
- Population above: Island nations, coastal cities (~30 million at risk)
- Awakening signs: Irregular tides, temperature changes, whirlpools

**Pyron** (Flame Titan):
- Location: Volcanic island chain
- Size: 40 miles (compact, muscular)
- Features: Heart = magma chamber, veins = lava tubes, skin = volcanic rock
- Population above: Hardy islanders (~5 million)
- Awakening signs: Accelerating volcanic eruptions, rising temperatures

**Khione** (Frost Titan):
- Location: Polar ice cap
- Size: 60 miles (spread wide)
- Features: Frozen in place, ice cap literally IS titan's frozen body
- Population above: Arctic peoples (~2 million)
- Awakening signs: Internal warming, ice melting from beneath

**Tempest** (Storm Titan):
- Location: Atmospheric phenomenon
- Size: Uncertain (non-solid, extends miles)
- Features: Manifests as permanent storm system, consciousness in weather patterns
- Population affected: All air-traveling species, sky cities
- Awakening signs: Storm intensification, lightning increase

**Nyx** (Sky Titan):
- Location: Everywhere/nowhere (exists in dimensional overlap)
- Size: Incomprehensible (theoretical infinite)
- Features: Space itself, void between stars, potential of emptiness
- Population affected: Reality itself
- Awakening signs: Physics instability, gravity fluctuations, dimensional thinning

## The Seals (Great Binding)

**Mechanism**: Six divine pillars anchoring Titans' consciousness in dormancy. Each pillar maintains one seal. All six created simultaneously in coordinated god-effort.

**Locations**: At junction points of Titan territories (where their bodies/domains intersect).

**Current State**: Degraded. No maintenance for 5,000+ years. Running on reserve power. Magic saturation acts as corrosive, eating away at structural integrity.

**Failure Progression**:
- Month 1-3: Minor cracks, leaking divine energy
- Month 4-6: Major structural weakness, Titans stirring
- Month 7-8: Complete failure imminent
- Month 9+: All seals break, full awakening cascade

**Repair Requirements**: Divine-level magic (demigod minimum), six casters simultaneously, permanent sacrifice (casters become living anchors).

## Magic System

**Titan Essence Pollution**:
- All magic use releases trace "essence" into world
- Titans unconsciously absorb it (like plants absorbing CO2)
- After millennia: saturation reached
- Titans must wake to expel/process it
- Analogy: World's magical "carbon dioxide" buildup

**Communion Magic** (Special):
- Allows mortal consciousness to perceive on Titan scale
- Extremely dangerous: risk of ego-death, madness, permanent dissociation
- Required for communication attempts
- Ritual components: titan-touched artifacts, time-dilation spells, psychic shielding

**Titan-Touched Abilities**:
- Rare mortals born with fragment of Titan essence
- Minor elemental control, geological sense, enhanced durability
- Party member could be one (plot device for communication)

**Divine Ascension** (Seal Replacement):
- Ritual transforms mortal into demigod
- Consciousness expanded to maintain seal
- Permanent: cannot be undone
- Requires willing sacrifice
- Six needed (one per Titan)

## Inhabitants

**Mortal Civilizations**: Standard D&D races. Multiple nations, conflicts, but united by Titan threat. Total population: ~500 million globally.

**The Returners** (Cult): Eco-extremists believing mortals are parasites. Active across all nations. ~10,000 members, organized cells. Led by Prophet who experienced communion vision (driven mad/enlightened depending on interpretation).

**Dragon Witnesses**: Ancient dragons remember previous near-awakening. Provide historical testimony. Some terrified (flee to other planes), others fascinated (study Titans).

**Elemental Entities**: Minor elementals are extensions of Titans' dreams. Become more active as Titans wake. Not hostile—confused, seeking direction.

**The Last Gods**: Few remaining deities. Most fled material plane. Those remaining: war god (duty-bound to protect mortals), nature goddess (conflicted—Titans are ultimate nature), trickster god (sees opportunity for mischief).

## Cultural Impact

**Religious Crisis**: All religions based on creation myths. Titans' existence challenges them:
- Gods didn't create world—Titans did (or vice versa—debate rages)
- Apocalypse theologies activate—interpretations vary
- New cults emerge: Titan worship, nihilism, unity faiths

**Economic Collapse**: Knowledge of impending apocalypse destroys markets, currency, trade. Societies revert to survival mode. Looting, hoarding, breakdown of order in some regions.

**Unity Movements**: Unprecedented cooperation. Historical enemies ally. "Council of All Peoples" forms—every nation sends representatives.

**Evacuationist Preparations**: Massive planar gateway construction. Magic/technology fusion projects. Resource allocation debates (who gets to leave?).

**Denialists**: Some refuse to believe. Conspiracy theories: government manipulation, mass hallucination, divine test. Dangerous because they don't prepare.

## Titan Biology/Psychology

**Physical Nature**: Hybrid of matter and essence. Not quite alive in mortal sense—more like fundamental forces given form.

**Consciousness**: Slow, vast, alien. Single thought might take days to formulate. Perceive mortals like humans perceive bacteria—aware theoretically but don't really register individuals.

**Emotions**: Do feel, but differently. Terra: contemplative sadness. Pyron: passionate joy. Marix: roiling changeability. Khione: serene acceptance. Tempest: manic energy. Nyx: incomprehensible abstraction.

**Needs**: Don't eat/sleep/reproduce in conventional sense. Dormancy is rest/digestion of accumulated magic. Awakening is metabolic necessity.

**Mortality**: Uncertain. Possibly immortal. Possibly have lifespan measured in millions of years. Injury regenerates over centuries.

**Relationships**: Have history with each other. Terra and Khione are allies (stability partners). Pyron and Marix are rivals (fire vs water). Tempest and Nyx are enigmas even to other Titans.

## Key Secrets

- Titans are prison AND prisoners—they contain worse entities (pre-universal chaos)
- Gods are Titans' children/creations (family conflict, not species war)
- Mortal magic was GIFT from sleeping Titans (dreamlike generosity)
- Previous civilizations ARE still alive (evacuated successfully, exist in other planes, watching)
- One Titan (Pyron) WANTS to wake and live—others conflicted or resistant
- Controlled awakening creates new magical age (Renaissance of power)
- Party member prophesied in Titan dreams (one is "Key")
- Seals don't imprison—they're life support (keeping Titans healthy in sleep)
- Titan awakening resets magic (all spells/artifacts stop working temporarily)
- Earth is ONLY world with Titans (they're unique, precious, irreplaceable)

## Campaign Variations

**Heroic**: Party successfully implements Coexistence path, ushering golden age

**Tragic**: All paths fail, world destroyed, campaign continues in survival horror mode

**Bittersweet**: Seal path works but requires beloved NPC sacrifices, party lives with guilt and gratitude

**Transcendent**: Party discovers hidden fourth path (merge mortal civilization with Titans symbiotically, becoming new composite species)

## Timeline Summary

- **Month 1**: Discovery and investigation
- **Month 2-3**: Political unification and solution seeking
- **Month 4-5**: Implementation of chosen path
- **Month 6-7**: First Titan awakening events
- **Month 8**: Cascade and resolution
- **Post-Campaign**: Whatever world remains/emerges

This world asks: **What is our responsibility to forces that created us but don't need us?** The Titans existed first. They'll exist after. We're temporary. But does "temporary" mean "worthless"? The campaign says no—small and brief can still matter. The Titans wake, and we prove we deserve to witness their dawn.
