# Wavebreakers - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

**Aesthetic**: Pipeline POV footage meets Polynesian art meets bioluminescent ocean life
- Crystal barrels with rainbow spray
- Traditional tattoos and carvings showing wave patterns
- Underwater temples with coral architecture
- Corporate platforms as industrial scars on pristine seascapes
- Dream-waves: Impossible formations, geometric perfection, liquid light

**Colors**:
- **Ocean**: Turquoise, deep blue, foam white, sunset gold
- **Dream Magic**: Bioluminescent cyan, pearl iridescence, aurora effects
- **Corporation**: Oil-slick black, industrial rust, chemical green
- **Cultural**: Tribal patterns in natural earth tones, sacred red, shell white

**Key Visuals**:
- Barrel-riding from inside the tube
- Aerial views of perfect wave sets
- Underwater shots looking up at surfers
- Ancient petroglyphs coming alive
- Goddess manifestations in water patterns

## Audio Design

**Music**:
- **Action**: Jack Johnson meets Hans Zimmer—acoustic guitars with orchestral swells
- **Cultural**: Traditional Polynesian drums, chanting, conch shells
- **Emotional**: Melancholic ukulele, ocean ambience
- **Corporate**: Harsh industrial, discordant
- **Goddess**: Whale song mixed with ethereal female vocals

**Sound Effects**:
- Wave sounds (critical—different wave types, barrel echo, whitewash crash)
- Board on water (gliding, spray, cutback slash)
- Wind and seabirds
- Underwater silence then heartbeat
- Dream-realm: Distorted, echoing water sounds
- Magic: Crystalline water chimes

## Voice Acting

**Kumu Kai**: Deep, weathered, Hawaiian accent, speaks slowly with wisdom
**Kalani**: Young, cocky Australian accent, competitive energy
**CEO Marlowe**: Corporate smooth American, hiding possession's malice
**Naia**: Singing, ethereal, gender-ambiguous, speaks in water metaphors
**Reef**: Ghostly echo of young Hawaiian male, regret and warning
**Moana-Nui**: Layered female voices, oceanic resonance, vast and ancient

## Cinematics

**Opening**: Dawn patrol—surfers paddling out, camera underwater looking up, sun rays, first wave ridden into dream-realm, title appears in barrel spray

**Legendary Breaks**: Each gets slow-motion perfect ride sequence, barrel vision, spiritual transformation visual, seal forming in goddess's consciousness

**The Final Wave**: All Wavebreakers paddling into Jaws together, goddess's full manifestation, ride into her consciousness, choice made mid-barrel

## Tone

**Primary**: Spiritual connection through surf
**Secondary**: Environmental protection
**Tertiary**: Cultural preservation versus industrial exploitation

Every session should feel like being in the ocean—peaceful dawn patrols, sudden storms, the terror of being held under, the ecstasy of perfect tubes, the brotherhood in the lineup.
