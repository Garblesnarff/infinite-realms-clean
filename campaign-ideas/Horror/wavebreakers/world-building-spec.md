# Wavebreakers - World-Building Specification

## Moana-Nui (The Sleeping Goddess)

**Origin**: Primordial water deity who dreamed the oceans into existence. Her sleeping generates waves; her nightmares create storms.

**Current State**: Has been sleeping for millennia. Dream-drain by Crimson Tide is disturbing her slumber, causing more frequent hurricanes and tsunamis.

**Consciousness**: Fragmented across all oceans. Each Legendary Break is a pressure point in her dream-consciousness.

**Awakening Consequences**: Full awakening would give her conscious control but potentially drown all land. Continued sleep maintains status quo. Death would turn seas lifeless.

## The Wavebreakers Order

**Founded**: 10,000 years ago by first Polynesian navigators who discovered dream-surfing

**Purpose**: Maintain goddess's peaceful dreams, prevent catastrophic awakening, protect ocean's magic

**Structure**:
- **Kumu (Elders)**: 7 masters who guard knowledge
- **Riders**: Active surfers who can access dream-waves
- **Shapers**: Craft magical boards from sacred wood
- **Navigators**: Find Legendary Breaks using star charts and wave reading
- **Healers**: Treat wipeout trauma, both physical and psychic

**Sacred Traditions**:
- Dawn patrol meditation
- Board blessing ceremonies
- Fallen surfer memorials (paddling out, lei into ocean)
- Respecting locals (never dropping in on spiritual waves)
- The Oath: "The ocean gives, the ocean takes, we ride with respect"

## The Seven Legendary Breaks

**Pipeline of Souls** (North Shore): Gateway to ancestor spirits, perfect left barrel over shallow reef

**Bonzai Barrel** (Hawaii): Tests precision, closes out violently if ridden wrong

**Cloudbreak Cathedral** (Fiji): Offshore reef, cathedral-like formations, requires boat tow-in

**The Washing Machine** (Southern Ocean): Chaotic shore pound, tests endurance and courage

**Ghost Reef** (Unknown, appears randomly): Haunted by drowned surfers, shifts location

**Thunder Point** (Storm-following break): Only appears during electrical storms, lightning hazard

**Jaws/Pe'ahi** (Maui): 100-foot faces, near-impossible, final test of worthiness

Each seals specific aspect of goddess's consciousness when surfed perfectly.

## Crimson Tide Corporation

**Public Face**: Renewable ocean energy company, claims to "harvest clean power from tidal forces"

**Reality**: Extracting dream-energy from goddess's subconscious, processing it into industrial fuel source

**Leadership**: CEO Marlowe Grimm (possessed by goddess's nightmare aspect), board of unknowing executives

**Operations**:
- Floating harvester platforms worldwide
- Private military protecting assets
- PR campaign demonizing Wavebreakers as eco-terrorists
- Sponsored pro surfers as propaganda (Kalani's crew)
- Employing locals (creates community division)

**Technology**:
- Dream-extractors (massive pylons draining magic)
- Reality stabilizers (suppress supernatural phenomena)
- Hybrid patrol boats (fast enough to catch surfers)
- Underwater drilling rigs
- Consciousness dampening fields

## Mer-Touched

**Origin**: Humans who drowned and were reborn by Moana-Nui's mercy

**Characteristics**:
- Can breathe water and air
- Enhanced swimming speed
- Communicate with marine life
- Slowly losing human memories
- Eventually become fully aquatic (lose land ability)

**Role**: Messengers between surface and goddess, guides to underwater locations, tragic figures caught between worlds

**Famous Mer-Touched**: Naia, Reef (semi-Mer), ancient guardians of Blue Cathedral

## Magic System

**Dream-Wave Surfing**: Accessing goddess's subconscious through perfect rides
- Requires flow state + technical skill
- Opens doors to pocket dimensions
- Grants water-manipulation abilities
- Risk: Losing self in goddess's dreams

**Water Magic**:
- **Wave Shaping**: Temporarily alter swell formation
- **Breath of Deep**: Infinite underwater breathing
- **Ocean Speech**: Talk to sea creatures
- **Dream Navigation**: Surf between dimensions
- **Soul Riding**: Slow time perception in barrel
- **Water Walking**: Brief surface running

**Limitations**:
- Must be in/on water to cast
- Requires spiritual attunement with ocean
- Blocked by corporate reality stabilizers
- Overuse risks permanent Mer-Touched transformation
- Wipeouts cause psychic backlash

## Sacred Geography

**Kapu Village**: Home base, traditional architecture, beach access to Pipeline of Souls, contains board-shaping workshops and shrine to Moana-Nui

**Blue Cathedral**: Underwater temple at deepest reef, contains petroglyphs revealing break locations, air-pocket chambers for meditation

**Dream Swells**: Pocket dimensions accessed through perfect rides—surreal ocean-scapes with impossible physics, testing grounds for spiritual growth

**Crimson Fleet**: Mobile industrial platforms, main antagonist base, harvest stations across all major ocean basins

## Cultural Details

**Surf Culture Integration**:
- Localism (respecting territorial waters)
- Session etiquette (sharing waves, encouraging progression)
- Board craftsmanship as sacred art
- Ocean forecasting as divination
- Wipeout stories as rite of passage

**Indigenous Polynesian Elements**:
- Navigation by stars and swells
- Oral history and genealogy

**Surfing Slang**: "Dropping in," "getting barreled," "stoked," "kook," "gnarly," "send it," "charging"—all have magical significance in this world
