# The Infinite Stacks - Creative Brief

## Art Direction

### Visual Aesthetic
**Primary Influence**: M.C. Escher meets Jorge Luis Borges meets The Pagemaster
- Impossible geometry that somehow makes sense
- Hexagonal patterns everywhere—in tiles, in shadows, in magical effects
- Books themselves are vibrant and varied while the hexagonal rooms are uniform
- Color coding by genre section (warm tones for romance, cool for mystery, vivid for fantasy)
- Contrast between infinite sameness and incredible variety

### Character Design Guidelines

**Librarians**
- Victorian-era academic clothing with practical modifications
- Robes with infinite pockets for bookmarks and cataloging tools
- Reading glasses (even if they don't need them—professional habit)
- Ink-stained fingers
- Hair in severe, practical styles
- Carrying quills, stamps, library cards as accessories
- Subtle aging based on years in the Stacks (time moves strangely)

**The Lost**
- Appearance shifts subtly based on nearby books
- Clothing is a patchwork of different story genres
- Eyes appear unfocused, looking through reality rather than at it
- Carry multiple books at all times
- Features become indistinct—hard to remember their faces
- Leave trailing after-images like narrative echoes

**Shelf-Walkers**
- Living archetypes made semi-solid
- Protagonist: Perfect heroic proportions, literal glowing aura, clean and idealized
- Antagonist: Sharp features, dramatic shadows following them, intimidating presence
- Love Interest: Impossibly attractive, soft lighting follows them, others become flustered nearby
- Mentor: Aged but spry, wise eyes, always appears when needed
- Comic Relief: Exaggerated features, colorful costume, reality bends comedically around them

**Epilogue (The Arsonist)**
- Burn scars tell a story across his skin
- Coat lined with fireproof bookmarks like armor plates
- Silver torch burns with cold fire (paradox made visual)
- Eyes reflect flames constantly
- Ash falls from him like snow
- Carries a bag of burned book covers—trophies or memorials

### Environmental Design

**Hexagonal Rooms**
- Each hexagon is identical: 20 feet across, 12 feet high
- Four walls are bookshelves floor to ceiling
- Two walls have archways to adjacent hexagons
- Central brass ladder in some rooms leads up/down
- Single hanging lamp per room (various styles based on section)
- Slight variations emerge based on genre proximity

**Spatial Impossibility Indicators**
- Staircases that loop back on themselves
- Rooms that are larger inside than outside
- Perspective lines that don't converge properly
- Shadows falling from impossible angles
- Reflections showing different rooms than what's there
- Books whose spines are wider than their depths

**The Burned Sections**
- Charred hexagonal frames like ribs of a great beast
- Ash piled in drifts like snow
- Ghostly impressions of text floating in air
- Shelves reduced to carbonized shadows on walls
- Silence so complete it has weight
- Faint echoes of destroyed narratives—visual glitches of scenes that never happened

### Magical Effects

**Reading Aura**
When someone reads a book, their eyes glow softly and the text projects faintly around them like AR overlays.

**Narrative Navigation**
Choosing a thematic direction causes hexagons ahead to shift in lighting—warmer for getting closer, cooler for moving away.

**Genre Transition**
When crossing genre boundaries, a ripple effect passes through reality like walking through a curtain of water, and the color palette shifts.

**Silver Flames**
Epilogue's fire burns white-silver, consumes without heat, and leaves behind pure white ash. Destroys books instantly but can burn for hours through reality itself.

**Plot Armor Visualization**
Characters with active plot armor have a subtle golden outline, like an aura. When they would take damage that shouldn't kill them narratively, it shatters like glass instead.

**The Lost Reader Effect**
When someone is becoming Lost, their outline becomes sketchy and uncertain, like a charcoal drawing. Multiple overlapping versions of themselves become visible.

## Music Direction

### Main Theme
**Instrumentation**: String quartet with music box elements and whispered vocals
**Mood**: Wonder mixed with unease, the vastness of knowledge, the loneliness of infinity
**Reference Tracks**:
- "Time" by Hans Zimmer (for the building intensity)
- "The Bookshelf" from Interstellar (for emotional resonance with infinite space)
- "Comptine d'un autre été" by Yann Tiersen (for delicate melancholy)

### Location Themes

**The Hexagonal Rooms (Ambient)**

- Unsettling in its chaos

### Combat Music

**Standard Encounters**
Genre-appropriate battle music (epic for fantasy monsters, tense for mystery conflicts, etc.)

**Epilogue Boss Fight**
- Combines his cello theme with building intensity
- Fire crackling becomes aggressive percussion
- Choir singing in Latin about endings and finality
- Rising tension through accelerating tempo
- Final phase shifts to tragic beauty—he believes he's the hero

**Narrative Battles**
When fighting with story logic rather than weapons:
- Spoken word poetry over ambient soundscape
- Typewriter percussion
- Page-turning sounds as rhythmic element
- Building intensity through layered reading voices
- Reality glitching with electronic distortions

## Voice Acting Direction

### General Casting Notes
All voice actors should be able to switch between different "reading voices" and their normal voice, as characters often quote from books.

### Madam Catalogue
**Voice Type**: Mature British RP accent, crisp diction
**Characteristics**:
- Speaks in complete, properly punctuated sentences
- Tends to enumerate things ("First, second, third...")
- Pronounces library terms with reverence
- Never uses contractions
- Occasionally lapses into Dewey Decimal numbers mid-sentence
**Emotional Range**: Controlled excitement to stern disapproval
**Reference**: Think stern university professor who secretly loves her subject

### Epilogue
**Voice Type**: Warm baritone with a melancholic edge, slight rasp from smoke damage
**Characteristics**:
- Speaks slowly, choosing words carefully
- Often quotes from burned books from memory
- Voice carries weight of terrible knowledge
- Gentle even when being threatening
- Pauses for thought mid-sentence
**Emotional Range**: Quiet sadness to passionate conviction
**Reference**: Michael Fassbender in Shame (haunted quality) meets Ian McKellen (gravitas)

### Index
**Voice Type**: Multi-vocal—shifts gender, age, accent constantly
**Characteristics**:
- Speaks in citation format ("See also...", "Cross-reference...")
- Multiple voices overlapping slightly
- Always sounds like reading from a book
- Emotionless but not robotic—scholarly
- Interrupts themselves with cross-references
**Emotional Range**: Minimal—knowledge is neutral
**Reference**: Computer voice but human, like GLaDOS but more academic

### The Lost Reader Thomas
**Voice Type**: Young adult, American accent, uncertain
**Characteristics**:
- Trails off mid-sentence
- Asks questions seeking confirmation
- Voice qualities shift based on location (deeper in adventure, higher in romance)
- Often sounds like he's trying to remember something
- Repeats phrases unconsciously
**Emotional Range**: Confusion to brief moments of clarity to wonder
**Reference**: Someone just waking from a dream trying to hold onto it

### Protagonist (Shelf-Walker)
**Voice Type**: Strong, clear, heroic—almost too perfect
**Characteristics**:
- Speaks in complete heroic declarations
- Unconsciously narrates their own actions
- Can't help but make dramatic statements
- Confusion when reality doesn't follow story logic
- Genuine but comes across as performative
**Emotional Range**: Heroic confidence to existential confusion
**Reference**: Classic Superman-type hero voice with self-aware sadness beneath

### Definition (Dictionary Alliance Leader)
**Voice Type**: Stern academic, German or Scandinavian accent
**Characteristics**:
- Defines words mid-conversation
- Corrects others' grammar and pronunciation
- Speaks with absolute certainty
- No tolerance for metaphor or ambiguity
- Uses technical terminology excessively
**Emotional Range**: Pedantic satisfaction to frustrated precision
**Reference**: Think strict linguistics professor

### Supporting Character Voice Notes

**Fictional Characters (Escaped from Books)**
Should sound slightly "wrong"—too dramatic, too perfect, like actors playing roles rather than people being themselves. Their emotional ranges are exaggerated, their voices too clear, their diction too precise.

**Other Librarians**
Various accents and ages, but all share:
- Gentle reverence when handling books
- Tendency to whisper in the Stacks
- Habit of reading passages aloud unconsciously
- Educated vocabulary without being pretentious

**The Shelf-Walkers (Various Archetypes)**
- Antagonist: Villainous voice, must sound threatening but slightly theatrical
- Love Interest: Soft, alluring, makes everyone listening slightly distracted
- Mentor: Aged, wise, speaks in aphorisms
- Comic Relief: Exaggerated, timing is more important than words

## Interactive Audio Elements

### Musical Reactivity
The music should respond to player choices:
- Reading a book: Music fades, replaced by the book's internal soundtrack
- Making a narratively "correct" choice: Musical sting of affirmation
- Going against story logic: Dissonant notes, reality protesting
- Genre transitions: Musical style shifts between sentences

### Ambient Reactivity
The environmental sounds should telegraph danger and discovery:
- Approaching burned sections: Sounds become muffled, then silent
- Near important books: Increased whisper activity
- When Epilogue is near: Crackling fire becomes audible
- When becoming Lost: Your own sounds start echoing oddly

### Dialogue Reactivity
NPCs should respond to player vocal tone if using voice chat:
- Whisper, they whisper back
- Shout, they remind you this is a library
- Speak confidently about books, they treat you as a colleague
- Admit ignorance, they become educational

- Helps players visualize the setting

### Playlist for Players
Provide curated playlist:
1. Main theme (for character creation)

4. Epilogue's theme (villain theme)
5. The Final Chapter (climax music)

Players can listen between sessions to stay immersed.

## Accessibility Notes

### Visual Accessibility
- Genre color coding should not be the only indicator—also use symbols
- Text that appears should have high contrast options
- Impossible geometry should be describable in words for players with vision impairments

### Audio Accessibility
- Critical information should not be audio-only
- Provide text descriptions of important sounds
- Whispers should be transcribed or amplified
- Musical cues should have visual equivalents

### Cognitive Accessibility
- The complex metafiction should be explained clearly
- Players should be able to ask "what does this mean in-game?" about any concept
- Narrative navigation can be simplified if needed without losing core concept
