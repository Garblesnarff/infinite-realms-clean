**Character Arc:**
1. Innocent princess
2. Betrays family for love (divine-induced)
3. Increasingly violent actions to help Jason
4. Abandoned wife
5. Vengeful monster
6. Divine figure (some versions have her become goddess)

**The Question:** Is she villain or victim? Aphrodite made her love Jason. Jason betrayed her. Her crimes are horrific but motivated by forces beyond control.

## The Curse Mechanics

**How Fleece Corrupts:**
1. Grants power/authority
2. Creates ambition and greed
3. Destroys relationships
4. Leads to betrayal
5. Ends in death and ruin

**Jason's Trajectory:**
- Heroic prince seeking rightful throne
- Successful quester
- Married to powerful sorceress
- Grows ambitious
- Betrays wife for political marriage
- Loses everything
- Dies alone, forgotten

**Medea's Trajectory:**
- Innocent princess
- Commits murders for love
- Betrayed despite sacrifices
- Becomes monster driven by pain
- Murders own children
- Escapes to divine realm

**The Argonauts' Fates:** Mixed. Some die gloriously (combat), some survive to have famous children (Achilles, Ajax), some forgotten. Quest's glory doesn't guarantee happy endings.

## Divine Politics

**Hera's Plan:**
- Wants Pelias dead (he dishonored her)
- Uses Jason as tool
- Arranges Medea falling in love
- Medea eventually kills Pelias
- Plan succeeds but collateral damage immense

**Athena's Support:**
- Helps build Argo
- Provides tactical advice
- Represents wisdom supporting heroism

**Aphrodite's Role:**
- Hera asks her to make Medea love Jason
- Uses son Eros to shoot arrow
- Artificial love created
- Doesn't consider consequences

**Poseidon's Opposition:**
- Sea god dislikes Greeks' hubris
- Sends storms
- Opposes return journey
- Eventually allows success

## Historical Context

**Bronze Age Setting:** ~1300 BCE (traditional dating)

**Pre-Trojan War:** Most Argonauts' children fight at Troy (Achilles, Ajax, Odysseus, etc.)

**Black Sea Exploration:** Quest represents historical Greek colonization of Black Sea region. Mythologized historical expansion.

**Cultural Memory:** Actual Bronze Age expeditions to Caucasus for gold (Georgia has ancient gold mining). Myth preserves trading/raiding memories.

## Navigation and Seamanship

**Celestial Navigation:**
- Steer by stars (Ursa Major, Polaris)
- Sun position during day
- Limited maps (mostly oral tradition)

**Coastal Sailing:**
- Ancient ships hugged coastlines
- Overnight stops common
- Rarely sailed in winter (storm season)

**The Symplegades:**
- Possibly based on Bosphorus currents
- Legendary obstacle mythologized from difficult navigation
- "Last ship" suggests colonization route discovery

## The Tragedy Structure

**Classical Greek Tragedy Elements:**
- **Hubris:** Jason's ambition
- **Hamartia:** Fatal flaw (greed, betrayal)
- **Peripeteia:** Reversal (victory becomes ruin)
- **Anagnorisis:** Recognition (too late, understands curse)
- **Catharsis:** Audience purges emotions through pity/fear

**Medea as Tragic Figure:**
- Neither pure villain nor pure victim
- Driven by forces beyond control (divine manipulation)
- Commits horrific acts (murder)
- Suffers terribly (betrayal)
- Becomes monster through pain
- Escapes but destroyed

**The Question:** Can you win cursed prize? Should you? Is some knowledge/power worth pursuing even if it destroys you?

## Campaign Moral

**The Fleece Paradox:**
- Quest succeeds (Fleece obtained)
- Heroes return (mission accomplished)
- Jason reclaims throne (goal achieved)
- But curse ruins everything (victory hollow)

**The Lesson:** Some prizes carry their own punishment. Beware what you seek—you might get it. Glory and tragedy are twins.

The campaign asks: **Is impossible quest worth pursuing if success destroys you?**

Greek answer: Maybe not. But the quest makes you legendary. Better to quest and fail/succeed tragically than never quest at all. The story survives even when heroes don't.
