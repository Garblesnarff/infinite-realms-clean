# Creative Brief: The Nine Trials of Mictlan

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign.

## Art Style: Aztec Primal Horror

Inspired by Aztec codices, stone carvings, temples, and the primal aesthetic of Mesoamerican death imagery. Bold colors (red, black, turquoise, gold), geometric patterns, stylized skeletal imagery, and symbolic representations. The style combines beautiful ritualistic art with brutal, primal horror.

### Core Principles:

*   **Geometric and Bold:** Strong lines, symbolic patterns, codex-style imagery mixed with dimensional environments.
*   **Blood and Obsidian:** Red sacrificial blood, black obsidian glass, the sharp aesthetic of Aztec culture.
*   **Skeletal Majesty:** Death lords are skeletal but crowned and royal, not grotesque but terrifying in their grandeur.

## Voice

Ritualistic and primal, like an Aztec priest narrating sacred texts. Formal but visceral. Emotional range from ceremonial calm to primal fear. The voice respects death as cosmic necessity.

## Music Direction

Pre-Columbian instruments: conch shells, drums, flutes, rattles. Primal percussion dominates. Ceremonial chants. Each level has distinct sound profile. Music should feel ancient, ritualistic, and increasingly intense.

## Sound Design

Obsidian scraping, wind howling, water rushing, arrows whistling, jaguar roars, the rattle of bones, ceremonial drums, the Xolo's panting and barking, footsteps on stone. The environment sounds primal, deadly, ritualistic.
