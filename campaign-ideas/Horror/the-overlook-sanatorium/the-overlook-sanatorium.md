# The Overlook Sanatorium

*A Psychological Horror / Isolation campaign — Short Campaign (6–8 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Overlook Sanatorium
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Psychological Horror / Isolation / Haunted Location
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **8–9**
**Tone (keywords):** claustrophobic, psychological, haunted, isolated, descent into madness, family trauma
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is hired as winter caretakers for the Overlook Sanatorium, a massive mountaintop resort and medical facility closed for the season. Cut off by snow and avalanches, they're promised easy money to maintain the property for three months. But the Overlook has a dark history, and it feeds on the psychological weaknesses of those trapped within its walls, twisting reality until the party can't distinguish memory from hallucination, past from present, or friend from foe.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Psychological Combat:** Traditional combat is rare. The real battle is against the party's own minds, traumas, and the building's psychic influence.
*   **Trust Erosion:** The Overlook creates paranoia and hallucinations specific to each character. Players must decide what's real and who to believe.
*   **No Escape:** The party is physically trapped. Leaving means death by exposure or avalanche. They must endure or find the source of the haunting.
*   **Madness Mechanics:** Characters gain escalating mental afflictions. The longer they stay, the more they lose themselves.
*   **Moral Descent:** The Overlook pushes characters toward violence, especially against each other. Resisting becomes harder over time.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

An escalating psychological breakdown across three acts, each week deeper into winter isolation.

*   **Act I — The Honeymoon (Sessions 1–2):** The party arrives and settles in. The Overlook seems merely old and eerie. Strange occurrences are easily dismissed. But subtle wrongness accumulates: doors that were closed are now open, whispers in empty halls, brief glimpses of people who aren't there.
*   **Act II — The Haunting (Sessions 3–5):** The supernatural becomes undeniable. The party experiences personalized hauntings tied to their pasts. Ghosts of the sanatorium's violent history manifest. Reality becomes unreliable. Party members begin turning on each other as the Overlook's influence grows.
*   **Act III — The Shining (Sessions 6–8):** One or more party members with psychic sensitivity (The Shining) discover they can see the truth: the Overlook is a psychic vampire feeding on trauma and death. The party must either destroy the building's dark heart, escape into the deadly winter, or succumb entirely and become part of the Overlook forever.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Welcome to the Overlook"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party is hired by the mysterious Grady Foundation to caretake the Overlook during its winter closure. The pay is excellent for what seems like easy work.
    *   The Tour: The estate manager, Mr. Ullman, gives a perfunctory tour, mentioning in passing that a previous caretaker "had a difficult time" and there were "unfortunate incidents."
    *   First Night: The party settles in. The Overlook is vast, beautiful, and unsettling. That night, each character hears something: music from the ballroom, children laughing, weeping in the walls.

**Escalation:** A character wakes to find they've sleepwalked to Room 237—a locked room Ullman specifically said never to enter.

### Session 2 — "The Grand Ballroom"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Subtle Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Exploration: The party explores the massive facility. They find records in the office: the Overlook was a tuberculosis sanatorium in the 1800s, became a resort in the 1920s, and has a history of suicides and murders.
    *   The Ballroom: One evening, a character hears music and finds the ballroom filled with ghostly revelers from the 1920s. They're invited to join the party. The ghosts seem real, tangible, even friendly.
    *   The Boiler: The ancient boiler requires regular maintenance or it will explode. This becomes a ticking clock—the party must maintain it while dealing with supernatural threats.

**Escalation:** A character accepts a drink from a ghostly bartender and wakes hours later with no memory, but their hands are bloodied.

### Session 3 — "Room 237"

*   **Focus:** Personal Horror / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Room: Someone opens Room 237. Inside is a beautiful woman bathing. She beckons. When approached, she transforms into a rotting corpse. This is the first undeniable supernatural encounter.
    *   Personal Hauntings Begin: Each character starts experiencing visions tied to their deepest traumas, regrets, or fears. A character who failed to save someone sees that person begging for help.
    *   The Scrapbook: In the basement, someone finds a scrapbook detailing the Overlook's dark history: mob connections, illegal medical experiments, a massacre in 1921.

**Escalation:** A character finds a journal entry from the previous caretaker, Charles Grady, describing his descent into madness and his murder of his family. The handwriting becomes increasingly erratic.

### Session 4 — "All Work and No Play"

*   **Focus:** Paranoia / Social Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Isolation Deepens: An avalanche blocks the only road. The sending stone to contact the outside world stops working. The party is truly trapped.
    *   Turning on Each Other: The Overlook amplifies negative emotions. Old party tensions resurface and escalate into arguments and accusations.
    *   The Grady Ghosts: The party encounters the ghosts of Charles Grady's twin daughters, murdered with an axe. They speak in unison, offering cryptic warnings: "Come play with us forever and ever."

**Escalation:** A party member blacks out and wakes to find they've written the same phrase hundreds of times: "All work and no play makes [name] a dull adventurer."

### Session 5 — "The Maze"

*   **Focus:** Chase / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Hedge Maze: The Overlook's exterior hedge maze seems to change configuration. A character becomes lost in it during a snowstorm and is pursued by something—possibly a ghost, possibly another party member who's been possessed.
    *   The Shining Awakens: One or more characters with psychic potential start experiencing "the Shining"—visions of past and future events, telepathic warnings, and contact with benevolent spirits trying to help them escape.
    *   Violence Escalates: A possessed party member attacks the others with murderous intent. The party must subdue them without killing them.

**Escalation:** The benevolent spirit—a former cook named Mr. Hallorann—manifests and explains the truth: the Overlook feeds on psychic energy, especially from those who "Shine." It wants to consume the party's life force.

### Session 6 — "The Dead Speak"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Occult Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Gold Room: The party is drawn to the Gold Room bar where ghostly parties occur nightly. Here, they meet the ghost of Delbert Grady (Charles's father, also a killer) who tries to convince them to "correct" party members who won't submit to the Overlook.
    *   The Basement's Heart: Using clues from Hallorann, the party finds the Overlook's true foundation: an ancient burial ground where a dark ritual was performed in the 1800s, binding restless spirits to the location.
    *   The Choice: The ghosts offer a terrible bargain: join them willingly (eternal life of a sort) or be taken by force.

**Escalation:** The Overlook manifests its full power. Walls bleed, ghosts become corporeal and hostile, and reality breaks down. The ballroom holds a grand masquerade where everyone is expected to attend.

### Session 7 — "REDRUM"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Moral Crisis
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Possession Intensifies: One or more party members are fully possessed by vengeful spirits, particularly Charles Grady. They hunt the others through the Overlook.
    *   The Ritual: The party can destroy the Overlook's power by breaking the dark ritual in the basement, but it requires enormous sacrifice—burning the building (and dying in the fire) or offering their own psychic energy to sever the binding.
    *   REDRUM/MURDER: Characters with the Shining see "REDRUM" written everywhere—murder backwards. A horrifying vision shows the future: the possessed party member killing everyone unless stopped.

**Escalation:** The boiler, neglected during the chaos, begins to overload. The Overlook will explode soon. This provides an alternative solution but also a ticking clock.

### Session 8 — "The Long Winter"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Escape
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Final Confrontation: The party faces the possessed member(s) in a climactic battle of will and strength. Killing them may be the only option, or a powerful psychic can force the spirit out.
    *   Destroying the Overlook: If the party completes the counter-ritual or lets the boiler explode, the Overlook is destroyed, freeing the trapped spirits.
    *   Escape: The survivors must brave the deadly winter to reach civilization before they freeze or the building collapses.
    *   Aftermath: Those who survive are forever changed. Some may retain aspects of the Shining. Others may carry mental scars. The campaign ends with the party looking back at the burning Overlook, unsure if they truly escaped or if the trauma will haunt them forever.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Grand Ballroom:** An art deco masterpiece where ghostly parties occur. The bar (the Gold Room) serves phantom drinks that seem real. This is where Grady manifests most often.
2.  **Room 237:** A locked suite with a rotting bathtub. The center of the Overlook's seductive and decaying nature.
3.  **The Hedge Maze:** An exterior maze that changes configuration and becomes deadly during snowstorms. Easy to get lost, impossible to find your way out.
4.  **The Boiler Room:** Deep in the basement, the ancient boiler requires constant maintenance. If neglected, it will explode and destroy the Overlook.
5.  **The Colorado Lounge:** The main gathering space with a massive fireplace. The party likely uses this as their base, but it's also where the scrapbook and darkest secrets are hidden.
6.  **The Caretaker's Apartment:** Where the party sleeps. Increasingly unsafe as hauntings intensify.
7.  **The Basement Burial Ground:** The source of the Overlook's power—an ancient Native American burial site desecrated by early settlers.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between human will and supernatural corruption. The Overlook represents trauma, addiction, and violence made manifest. It feeds on weakness—alcoholism, rage, regret—and amplifies these traits until its victims destroy themselves and others. The party must confront not only ghosts but their own inner demons. The horror is both external (malevolent spirits) and internal (the potential for evil within themselves). Victory requires sacrifice: sanity, safety, or even life itself. The question is not whether they'll be changed by the Overlook, but whether they'll retain enough humanity to escape.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Shining**

*   One or more characters possess psychic sensitivity called "the Shining."
*   This allows them to: see ghosts and past events, sense danger, communicate telepathically, and receive warnings.
*   However, it also makes them primary targets for the Overlook's influence. The stronger their Shining, the more the building wants to consume them.

### 2. **Isolation and Madness Tracker**

*   Each week (2 sessions) in the Overlook, characters gain 1 Isolation point.
*   At certain thresholds, they roll on a Madness table: paranoia, hallucinations, violent urges, catatonia.
*   Environmental factors (witnessing supernatural events, failing to maintain the boiler, drinking ghostly alcohol) accelerate the accumulation.

### 3. **The Unreliable Narrator**

*   The DM occasionally describes events differently to different players, creating confusion about what's real.
*   Players may be experiencing events that aren't happening or missing events that are.
*   Trust between players becomes a resource to manage.

### 4. **Possession Saves**

*   When characters experience intense hauntings or fail madness saves, they risk possession.
*   Possessed characters receive secret notes from the DM with dark urges: sabotage the boiler, attack another character, or open Room 237 again.
*   Players must roleplay the struggle between their will and the possessing spirit.

### 5. **The Boiler**

*   Every session, someone must successfully maintain the boiler (skill check).
*   Failure means pressure builds. After 3 failures, the boiler explodes, destroying the Overlook but likely killing anyone still inside.
*   This creates dramatic tension: maintain safety while dealing with supernatural threats.
