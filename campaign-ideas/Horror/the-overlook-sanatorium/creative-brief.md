# Creative Brief: The Overlook Sanatorium

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Kubrickian Symmetry Meets Gothic Horror

Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's obsessive symmetry and the decaying grandeur of Gilded Age architecture, this style captures both the beautiful and the sinister. The Overlook is gorgeous and terrifying in equal measure—art deco elegance corrupted by supernatural malevolence and the weight of tragic history.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Perfect Symmetry:** Use bilateral symmetry in compositions, especially for interior shots. This creates an uncanny, artificial feeling.
*   **Decaying Grandeur:** The Overlook was once magnificent. Show peeling wallpaper, tarnished fixtures, and faded elegance.
*   **Isolation Through Scale:** Emphasize how small humans are against the vast, empty halls. Long corridors should feel endless.
*   **Warm Colors Turned Sinister:** Use rich reds, golds, and browns that should feel warm but instead feel oppressive and blood-like.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Psychological horror, isolation, symmetrical, claustrophobic, decaying elegance, haunted, snowbound, art deco, madness.
*   **Feeling:** A beautiful prison. The viewer should feel trapped despite the opulence. Every elegant detail hints at death and madness. The building itself feels alive and watching.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, precise lines for architecture emphasizing geometric patterns and art deco motifs. Human figures should feel dwarfed and out of place.
*   **Textures:** Rich but worn: patterned carpets with stains, wallpaper with water damage, polished wood now scratched and dull, velvet curtains thick with dust.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hyper-realistic illustration of an art deco hotel corridor in perfect bilateral symmetry. The geometric carpet pattern leads to a distant vanishing point. The walls show signs of age—peeling wallpaper, water stains—but the underlying elegance is still visible."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by deep reds, burnt oranges, tarnished golds, rich browns, and sickly greens. Outside scenes are pure white snow against gray skies.
*   **Accent Colors:** The color of blood is important—fresh red, dried brown, rust stains. Also use the green-blue of ghostly apparitions and the warm yellow of vintage lighting.
*   **Emotional Effect:** Colors that should be warm and inviting instead feel oppressive and threatening, like old blood or jaundice.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of deep crimson reds, tarnished golds, and burnt umber browns, reminiscent of a 1920s grand hotel but with an undertone of decay. The lighting is warm but sickly, like old incandescent bulbs giving off a jaundiced glow."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic human characters showing progressive mental breakdown—disheveled appearance, wild eyes, increasing signs of stress and madness.
*   **Ghosts:** Rendered as if they're from different eras—1920s formal wear, Victorian medical garb, etc. They should look simultaneously solid and slightly translucent.
*   **Transformation:** Show the gradual degradation of characters: day 1 they're neat, by day 30 they're unshaven, hollow-eyed, wearing the same stained clothes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic portrait of a caretaker on their 20th day of isolation. Their eyes show strain and paranoia, stubble growing unshaven, hair unkempt. They're clutching an axe, and behind them in perfect symmetry, a baroque wallpaper pattern seems to writhe. The warm hotel lighting casts deep shadows under their eyes."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Art deco and baroque architecture—geometric patterns, ornate fixtures, grand staircases, endless corridors. Everything in pristine symmetry but showing age.
*   **Atmosphere:** Inside: oppressive warmth, old wood smells, the sense of too much space creating isolation. Outside: blinding white snow, gray skies, total isolation.
*   **Details:** Repeating patterns (hexagons, triangles), vintage fixtures (brass, cut glass), family photographs from different eras all watching, and everywhere the subtle wrong detail—a stain, a crack, a shadow that shouldn't be there.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The grand ballroom of an art deco mountain resort, shot in perfect bilateral symmetry. A massive chandelier hangs at center. The floor is polished wood inlaid with geometric gold patterns. The walls feature ornate sconces casting warm light, but the windows show only white snow and gathering darkness. The room is empty but feels occupied—chairs at tables as if guests just left."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Warm interior lighting from vintage sources—chandeliers, sconces, fireplaces. But use strategic shadows to create unease.
*   **Kubrickian Lighting:** Bright, even lighting in public spaces that somehow feels more threatening than darkness. Harsh overhead lights eliminating hiding places.
*   **Shadows:** Use them sparingly but effectively—a shadow in a doorway, a silhouette in a window, the shadow of something that isn't there.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm yellow light from art deco sconces, creating an even, flat lighting that eliminates shadows except for one: a human silhouette standing at the end of the corridor where no one should be. Outside the windows, the white snow creates harsh backlight."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Kubrick's one-point perspective is essential—perfectly symmetrical shots with the vanishing point dead center. Long, slow reveals down corridors.
*   **Techniques:** Use doorways and windows as frames within frames. Show characters centered and small against vast spaces. The hedge maze should use overhead shots showing its impossible geometry.
*   **Breaking Symmetry:** When you break symmetry, make it disturbing—a door slightly ajar that should be closed, one light out in a perfect row, a figure standing off-center.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A one-point perspective shot down an impossibly long hotel corridor. Perfect bilateral symmetry. The geometric carpet pattern leads to a vanishing point where two small girls in old-fashioned dresses stand holding hands, centered perfectly in the frame. The walls on either side are identical—sconces, doors, picture frames—creating a hypnotic, unsettling regularity."

## Voice

A warm, cultured male voice with a slight Western American accent, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's measured cadence before the madness sets in. The tone starts friendly and conversational, like a tour guide sharing the Overlook's interesting history, but as the campaign progresses, the voice becomes increasingly strained. Pauses become longer, words are chosen more carefully, and there's an underlying tension—as if the speaker is fighting to maintain control. By the end, there are moments of manic energy breaking through the civility. The emotion shifts from welcoming warmth to barely suppressed rage and paranoia. Audio quality is pristine with careful use of silence and echo to emphasize the vast, empty spaces of the Overlook. Role: The caretaker, documenting his descent, trying to convince himself and others that everything is fine, just fine, everything is fine here.
