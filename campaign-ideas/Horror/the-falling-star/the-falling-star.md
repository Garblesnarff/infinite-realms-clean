# The Falling Star
*The sky is falling. The world has 100 days. Heroes must rise higher than ever before.*

## Campaign Overview

The astronomers at the Celestial Observatory detected it six months ago: A massive celestial object hurtling toward the planet. Not a natural asteroid—scans reveal artificial construction, magical signatures, and something alive within. The Starborn Colossus, an ancient cosmic entity imprisoned in crystalline form and launched into deep space eons ago, is returning home. Impact predicted in 100 days. Size: 50 miles across. Impact velocity: Catastrophic. Result: Extinction-level event—total planetary destruction.

The party must race against astronomical time to prevent Armageddon. Options: Destroy the asteroid (requires incredible power), deflect its course (nearly impossible physics), evacuate the planet (insufficient time/magic), or discover why it's returning and negotiate with the entity inside. Each path requires journeying to the sky, beyond the sky, and ultimately into space itself to confront the falling star.

The countdown is literal. Every session brings impact closer. The world knows doom approaches. How will civilization spend its final days? And can heroes prevent the end of everything?

## Core Themes

- **Cosmic Scale**: Threats beyond planetary scope, astronomical stakes
- **Countdown to Extinction**: Exact time until world ends, pressure mounting
- **Space as Frontier**: Journey beyond atmosphere, alien environments
- **Scientific Solutions**: Magic + science to solve impossible problem
- **Societal Collapse**: How people react to certain doom
- **Ultimate Sacrifice**: What price to save a world?

## Session Breakdown (30-40 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Discovery (Sessions 1-8)
**Sessions 1-3**: Campaign opens at Celestial Observatory during charity gala. Astronomers burst in with dire news: Massive object approaching planet, will impact in 100 days. Calculations confirmed, no error. World leaders summoned. Party recruited as heroes. Initial denial turns to panic. Introduction to countdown mechanics, astronomical concepts.

**Sessions 4-6**: Global preparation begins. Party works with scientists, wizards, military. Three primary solutions proposed: 1) Project Deflection (change asteroid's course), 2) Project Destroyer (blow it up), 3) Project Exodus (evacuate planet). Party must help gather resources, recruit experts, prepare expeditions.

**Sessions 7-8**: Cult of the Falling Star emerges, worshipping the asteroid as divine judgment. Led by Prophet Starlight. Believe impact will bring "transcendence." Sabotage preparations, spread panic. Meanwhile, close scans reveal shocking truth: Something is ALIVE inside the asteroid. It's not rock—it's a prison.

### Arc 2: The Preparations (Sessions 9-18)
**Sessions 9-12**: Party joins expedition to upper atmosphere using magical skycities and airships. Must establish orbital platform for space missions. Face environmental challenges: Thin air, extreme cold, magical navigation. Encounter sky whales, cloud giants, air elementals (some hostile to mortal presence).

**Sessions 13-15**: First test mission to nearby moon. Learn basics of space travel (magical/technological hybrid). On moon, discover ancient lunar civilization ruins. Find records: Starborn Colossus was imprisoned here eons ago, launched to deep space. Now it's returned. Learn it's a titan of cosmic destruction, sealed in crystalline asteroid.

**Sessions 16-18**: Return to planet to find social collapse accelerating. Riots, looting, mass suicides, cult growing powerful. Military attempts coup, believing only they can manage crisis. Party mediates or chooses sides. Meanwhile, asteroid visible in night sky now—growing larger daily. Psychological horror of watching doom approach.

### Arc 3: To the Stars (Sessions 19-30)
**Sessions 19-22**: Launch mission to reach the asteroid. Space travel hazards: Vacuum, radiation, debris fields, hostile cosmic entities. Journey takes weeks. Encounter other celestial bodies, ancient satellites, space-dwelling creatures. Discover the cosmos is not empty—many threats between planets.

**Sessions 23-26**: Reach the asteroid. It's impossibly huge up close, crystalline surface, magical energies pulsing through it. Must land and explore. Interior is vast cavern system. Temperature extremes, alien environment. Find the Starborn Colossus at core—titan of cosmic matter, slowly awakening. Its consciousness begins communicating: It seeks revenge on those who imprisoned it.

**Sessions 27-30**: Learn the truth: Ancient civilization imprisoned Colossus for trying to consume their world (it eats planetary matter). They sealed it in crystal and launched to deep space. But prison is failing. Colossus is steering itself home for revenge—will destroy planet to feed and free itself. Party must decide: Attempt destruction, repair prison, negotiate, or something else.

### Arc 4: The Impact (Sessions 31-40)
**Sessions 31-33**: Return to planet with dire news. 20 days until impact. Final preparations. All solutions still require impossible feats. Party must gather ultimate resources: Wishes, artifacts, elder magic, divine intervention. Multiple simultaneous quests under extreme time pressure.

**Sessions 34-36**: Cult attempts to sabotage final solution, believing they'll ascend during impact. Military tries to seize control. Social chaos at maximum. Party fights on multiple fronts while countdown continues. Manage to launch final mission with days to spare.

**Sessions 37-39**: Final confrontation with Starborn Colossus on/in asteroid. Multi-stage battle across crystalline landscapes. Environmental hazards: Vacuum, gravitational anomalies, reality warping. Boss mechanics involve cosmic powers. Multiple solutions possible: Destroy it (hard), repair prison (sacrifice required), redirect away from planet (complex ritual), merge with it to control (ultimate sacrifice).

**Session 40**: Resolution based on party choice. If successful: Asteroid destroyed/deflected/redirected, world saved. Epilogue showing aftermath: Heroes celebrated, world rebuilding, night sky forever changed. If failed: Impact sequence, apocalypse, possible survival in bunkers/other planes, post-apocalyptic new campaign.

## Key NPCs

**Cosmic Scale**: Everything is HUGE, distance measured in astronomical units
**Social Collapse Meter**: Track civilization's breakdown as impact approaches
**Multiple Solutions**: Party chooses which approach, affects missions
**Point of No Return**: After certain date, deflection impossible, only destruction

## Plot Twists

- **The Asteroid is Artificial Prison** containing cosmic titan
- **The Cult Leader** is being mind-controlled by Colossus
- **Ancient Civilization** that imprisoned it was planet's precursors
- **The Moon** was the original prison before asteroid
- **Destroying Asteroid** releases Colossus anyway
- **Evacuation Impossible**: No magic powerful enough to move billions
- **The True Solution**: Must sacrifice something precious to save world

## Victory Conditions

**Optimal Victory**: Repair prison, redirect asteroid to stable orbit, Colossus contained
**Heroic Victory**: Destroy asteroid and Colossus, massive magical explosion visible from surface
**Sacrifice Victory**: Party member merges with Colossus as eternal jailer in space
**Negotiation Victory**: Convince Colossus to leave peacefully to feed elsewhere
**Deflection Victory**: Change course, asteroid misses by narrow margin, world saved

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: Impact occurs, planet destroyed, campaign ends (or shifts to survival)
**Partial Defeat**: Asteroid partially destroyed, smaller pieces hit, millions dead
**Colossus Freed**: Titan released, begins consuming planet slowly
**Cult Victory**: Sabotage successful, impact occurs, cultists believe they ascend (they don't)
