*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players save towns and NPCs in the World of Balance.
    *   **THEN:** Those same towns and NPCs survive in the World of Ruin and offer aid, better shops, or quest assistance.
    *   **IF:** Celes catches healthy fish for Cid on Solitary Island.

    *   **IF:** The players complete character-specific side quests in the World of Ruin.
    *   **THEN:** Each completion grants that character their ultimate weapon and resolves their character arc (Locke revives Rachel, Cyan releases his family's spirits, Shadow faces his past).
    *   **IF:** The players defeat all Eight Dragons in the World of Ruin.
    *   **THEN:** The Crusader Esper appears, granting powerful magic and a significant World Hope increase.
    *   **IF:** The party's World Hope score is high when assaulting Kefka's Tower.
    *   **THEN:** NPCs from across time appear to aid them, the tower is slightly easier, and the ending is more optimistic.
    *   **IF:** The players recruit all possible party members in the World of Ruin.

    *   **IF:** Kefka is defeated.
    *   **THEN:** Magic begins to fade from the world as the Espers return to their realm. Terra, being half-Esper, must choose between her human side (remaining with friends) or her Esper nature (fading with the magic).
    *   **IF:** The players chose redemption and hope throughout the campaign.
    *   **THEN:** The ending shows the world recovering - flowers bloom, communities rebuild, the party members find peace, and hope for a magic-free future.
