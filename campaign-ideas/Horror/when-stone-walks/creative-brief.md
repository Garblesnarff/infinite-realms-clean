# When Stone Walks - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Ancient monumental architecture meets animated golem. Think Colossus of Rhodes, Easter Island Moai, Buddha statues—but moving. Classical beauty with subtle wrongness.

**Sentinel Design**: Each unique, reflecting culture that carved it. Some humanoid, others abstract, some multi-armed, animal-headed, or geometric. All impossibly large. Show age (weathering, moss, cracks) but also majesty.

**Movement**: Slow, deliberate, earth-shaking. Emphasize weight—dust clouds, cracking ground, debris falling. Not fluid—more like stop-motion animated stone.

**Scale Shots**: Always include humans for comparison. Sentinel's foot is building-sized. Hand can hold entire party.

## Music and Sound Design
**Sentinel Themes**: Low rumbling bass, stone grinding, tectonic sounds. When speaking: multiple resonant voices overlapping, ancient and immense.

**Ancient Mystery**: Choral elements, no lyrics, otherworldly instruments. Sense of deep time.

**Catastrophe**: When Sentinels move: percussion like earthquakes, building collapses, crowd panic ambience.

**Individual Sentinels**: Slight musical differentiation—Merciful has softer tones, Strict Judge has harsher, angular music.

## Voice Acting
**Sentinels**: Deep, echoing, slow cadence (they think on geological timescale). Multiple voice layers suggesting emergent consciousness. Emotionless but not hostile—alien intelligence.

**Malthus**: Fanatic certainty, believes firmly in righteousness of cleansing. Articulate, not ranting. Cultured villain.

**Professor Yvaine**: Academic excitement becoming existential horror. Enthusiastic initially, increasingly desperate.

## Atmosphere
**Inevitability**: Sentinels cannot be stopped by force. Their judgment approaches like tide. Pressure builds constantly.

**Moral Complexity**: No clear heroes/villains among humans. Sentinels have valid criticisms of humanity. Party must acknowledge truths while arguing for mercy.

**Awe and Terror**: Statues are beautiful and horrifying. Religious/spiritual reactions appropriate even for non-religious characters.

This campaign should feel like **ancient judgment day**—the past awakens to evaluate the present. Massive scale, moral weight, beauty and destruction unified.
