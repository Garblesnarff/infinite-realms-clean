## Faction Deep Dive

### Culinary Archivists
- Founded 1000 years ago to prevent knowledge loss
- Wandering Library holds millions of recipes
- Believe all knowledge should be preserved
- Oppose destruction but fear misuse
- Will ally with party if they donate recipes
- Ultimate goal: Complete library of all culinary knowledge

### Flavor Tyrants
- Military dictatorship seeking ultimate power
- Already conquered three kingdoms
- Use lesser food magic in warfare
- Codex would make them unstoppable
- Some members sympathetic, can defect
- Represent power without wisdom

### Death Cult of the Final Feast
- Believe world is corrupt, must be unmade
- Recipe 100 is their religious prophecy
- Surprisingly organized and well-funded
- Members from all walks of life
- Truly believe they're saving creation
- Can't be reasoned with, only stopped

### Independent Collectors
- Individuals seeking Codex for various reasons
- Isabella represents this group
- Some want power, some knowledge, some profit
- Most flexible faction
- Can be allies or enemies situation by situation
- Represent personal ambition

### The Guardian Order
- Ancient organization protecting specific recipes
- Not seeking complete Codex, just defending their charges
- Can be negotiated with if party proves worthy
- Some guardians are constructs, some families
- Respect earned through tests
- Represent responsibility and duty

## The Corruption of Power

### Stages of Codex Corruption
1. **Wonder** (1-10 recipes): Amazement at power, no downsides yet
2. **Confidence** (11-30): Feeling invincible, taking more risks
3. **Hunger** (31-50): Obsession with collecting, priorities shift
4. **Justification** (51-70): Excusing morally questionable actions
5. **Transformation** (71-90): Physical and mental changes from power
6. **Transcendence/Damnation** (91-100): Become something more or less than human

### Signs of Corruption

- Aura of seasoning scents
- Can't enjoy normal food anymore
- Disconnect from regular people
- Obsessive thoughts about next recipe
- Willing to sacrifice more for power

### Redemption Paths
- Donating recipes to Archivists (dilutes personal power)

- Final choice to scatter Codex again

## Recipe Creation Mechanics

### Requirements
- Original recipe page
- Linguistic decryption (Professor Basil)
