# The Living Bookmark - Creative Brief

## Art Direction
**Aesthetic**: Translucent, ghostly, existing between pages. Characters appear slightly out of phase with reality. Beautiful but sad. Everything has ribbon texture—bookmark material.

**Color Palette**: Muted and faded, like old book pages. Gold and silver highlights (bookmark materials). When story-hopping, briefly take on colors of destination genre.

**Character Design**: Partially transparent, ribbon-like qualities, flowing fabrics, carry marks from all stories visited. Eyes reflect infinite narratives.

## Music Direction
**Main Theme**: Music box playing infinite variations, never completing. Melancholic beauty. Represents endless stories.

**The Spine**: Rushing wind, pages flipping, infinite whispers. Movement through narrative space.

**Memory Sequences**: Overlapping themes from various genres, creating palimpsest of sound.

**The Repository**: Soft, sad, archival. Music of forgotten things.

## Voice Acting
**Bookmarks**: Speak with slight echo, as if channeling multiple characters. Occasionally slip into quotes from books they've marked.

**The Librarian**: Cold, precise, emotionless. Like autocorrect made sentient. Finality in every word.

**Memoria**: Fractured speech, quoting from hundreds of sources, occasionally coherent, tragic confusion.

## Sound Design
**Story-Hopping**: Page-turning whoosh, reality shifting, genre sound effect changes.

**Marking**: Ribbon unfurling sound, gentle chime, moment crystallizing.

**Erasure**: Bookmark burning, screaming, then absolute silence. Horrifying deletion.

**The Margin**: Complete silence except heartbeat and breathing. Maddening quiet of between-spaces.
