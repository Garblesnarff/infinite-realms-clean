### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Operation Cold Harbor**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** An Arctic research expedition discovers an alien organism frozen for millennia in glacial ice. After bringing it to their isolated outpost for study, the creature thaws, escapes, and begins assimilating team members. The party realizes they're trapped in perpetual Arctic darkness with a perfect shapeshifter that can imitate anyone it absorbs. They must identify and eliminate all infected individuals while preventing the Thing from reaching civilization, knowing that failure means the extinction of humanity.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Thing's origin: an extraterrestrial organism that crash-landed on this world thousands of years ago, frozen before it could spread.
    *   Describe the Thing's biology: a collection of individual cells that can assimilate and perfectly imitate any living organism. Each cell is independently intelligent and survival-driven.
    *   Explain the assimilation process: physical contact allows Thing-cells to infiltrate a host, consuming and replacing them at the cellular level over 1-4 hours, leaving a perfect copy.
    *   Chronicle the previous expedition: a Norwegian research team found the alien craft first. Their camp is now a frozen tomb of horror, evidence of how the Thing spreads.
    *   Detail the Thing's mathematical threat: If even one infected person reaches a populated area, mathematical models show total planetary assimilation in 27,000 hours (approximately 3 years).
    *   Describe Arctic isolation: The outpost is 1,000 miles from civilization. Winter storms make evacuation impossible for weeks. Radio has limited range and can be sabotaged.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Research Team (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, identify all Thing-infected individuals, prevent the Thing from reaching civilization, maintain humanity.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Leader/senior researcher, specialists (biologist, mechanic, pilot, doctor), support staff. Hierarchy breaks down as paranoia sets in.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Scientific research in glaciology and climate science.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some members may have hidden motives: corporate espionage, government surveillance, or personal demons they're hiding from.
        *   **Assets:** The outpost with supplies for 6 months, limited weapons (flamethrowers, axes, explosives), a helicopter (sabotaged), radio equipment.
        *   **Relationships:** Initially cooperative; devolves into factions as paranoia grows; some members secretly assimilated.
    *   **The Thing (Collective Intelligence)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, spread, assimilate all life, escape to civilization.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No traditional hierarchy. Each cell is independent but all work toward survival and spread. Larger masses have more processing power and can coordinate.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. It hides by imitating humans perfectly.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Patient and intelligent. Will imitate victims flawlessly for days, only revealing when threatened or to assimilate others. Sabotages escape routes and communication.
        *   **Assets:** Perfect imitation, assimilation, shape-shifting, regeneration, can split into multiple entities, cellular intelligence, extreme resilience except to fire.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to all non-Thing life; will imitate to infiltrate; each infected individual potentially a separate Thing working toward the same goal.
    *   **The Norwegian Expedition (All Dead)** (Minor - Historical)
        *   **Goals:** Were trying to contain or destroy the Thing.
        *   **Hierarchy:** All deceased. Their camp is now a cautionary tale.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Scientific research.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Their records (if found) reveal they discovered the alien craft, excavated the Thing, and were systematically hunted and replaced.
        *   **Assets:** None remaining. Their camp contains evidence, destroyed equipment, and corpses—some of which may still contain dormant Thing-cells.
        *   **Relationships:** Their fate foreshadows the party's potential future.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Dr. Kate Lloyd:** Lead paleontologist, pragmatic and intelligent, develops the testing protocols.
    *   **MacReady:** Helicopter pilot, practical and cynical, excellent in crisis.
    *   **Blair:** Biologist who studies the Thing and calculates its threat, becomes unstable.
    *   **Nauls:** Cook, young and loyal, trusted by most until suspicion spreads.
    *   **Palmer:** Mechanic, relaxed and seemingly harmless, potential hidden Thing.
    *   **The Thing (Core Mass):** The original organism that escaped, now potentially split into multiple entities.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Paranoid Researcher" (sees threats everywhere, may execute innocents)
    *   "Thing-Assimilated (Hidden)" (plays human perfectly, secret saboteur)
    *   "Thing-Creature (Revealed)" (grotesque multi-body horror)
    *   "Trusted Ally" (someone the party trusts who could be replaced)
    *   "Accused Innocent" (falsely suspected, creating moral dilemmas)
    *   "Dog-Thing" (Thing-assimilated sled dogs, early warning of threat)

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Main Outpost Building:** The central facility where most of campaign occurs.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Mess hall, lab, generator room, cold storage, sleeping quarters, radio room, rec room with blood-testing equipment.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The research team, some of whom become Thing-infected.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Shelter, heat, food for months, medical supplies, improvised weapons (especially flamethrowers).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Discovering evidence of sabotage, finding a room's occupant has been replaced, Thing-creature hiding in a storeroom, fire breaking out from damage, finding blood samples that react to heat test.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The generator is vulnerable to sabotage." "There's enough fuel to burn the entire outpost." "The blood test isn't perfect—Thing-cells can stay dormant."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Metal walls, frost buildup, harsh fluorescent lights, shadows in corridors), Sound (Generator hum, wind howling, footsteps on metal, someone breathing—or is it two someones?), Smell (Propane heater, coffee, cold metal, and occasionally something organic and wrong).
    *   **The Norwegian Camp:** Ruins of the previous expedition.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Burned buildings, the excavation site where they found the Thing, frozen corpses in horrific positions, their destroyed helicopter.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** All dead. Possibly dormant Thing-cells in frozen corpses.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Evidence of what happened, research notes in Norwegian, dangerous salvage.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Finding a survivor's video log, discovering a frozen Thing-corpse that might not be fully dead, triggering a booby-trap left by the Norwegians, uncovering the alien spacecraft, a corpse that's been assimilated thawing and attacking.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "They knew about the Thing and tried to warn us." "One of their people was assimilated and walked to our camp." "They found something else in the spacecraft—a weapon or warning."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Burned wreckage, frozen corpses, alien craft buried in ice, Norwegian writing on walls), Sound (Wind, silence, ice creaking), Smell (Nothing—too cold for smell, but blood and burned material frozen in place).
    *   **The Kennel:** Where sled dogs are kept.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Dog pens, equipment storage, feeding area.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Initially sled dogs, then Dog-Thing hybrids.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Transportation (if dogs survive), cold-weather gear.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Finding dogs merged into Thing-mass, a dog attacking with tentacles, discovering one dog is Thing and killing the others, dogs acting strangely (infected but not transformed), finding remains of absorbed animals.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The dogs won't go near someone who's been assimilated." "Or can the Thing fool even them?" "Whatever infected the dogs came from the Norwegian camp."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Dog pens, straw, chains, blood and worse), Sound (Dogs barking frantically or dead silence, growling that sounds wrong), Smell (Animal musk, fear pheromones, and something alien).
    *   **Generator Room:** The outpost's power source and heating.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The main generator, fuel tanks, electrical panels, heating controls.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Usually engineers, but becomes a strategic location.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Heat and power for the outpost, fuel for fire weapons.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Finding sabotage, a Thing-creature hiding here, generator failing at critical moment, fuel leak creating danger, someone barricading themselves inside.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "If the generator fails, everyone freezes in hours." "The fuel tanks are enough to burn the entire outpost." "There's a manual override if the controls are sabotaged."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Industrial equipment, fuel gauges, warning signs, cramped space), Sound (Generator roar, fuel pumps, ventilation), Smell (Diesel fuel, hot metal, oil).
    *   **The Ice Sheet (Exterior):** The endless Antarctic landscape.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The excavation pit where the spacecraft was found, the helicopter landing area, supply cache, markers to the Norwegian camp.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** None. This is certain death without proper gear and heat.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** The ultimate quarantine—anything left here will freeze. Also potential escape route if vehicles can be repaired.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Blizzard reducing visibility to zero, frostbite damage, becoming lost, finding evidence of Thing in the snow, discovering the alien spacecraft.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The ice preserved the Thing for millennia—it can survive out here." "A person exposed to this cold dies in minutes." "The spacecraft might contain answers—or more Things."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (White everywhere, darkness, stars in unpolluted sky, northern lights, storm walls), Sound (Wind howling, ice creaking, absolute silence when wind stops), Smell (Cold so intense it burns the nose, sterile ice).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A party member is isolated with another individual (NPC or PC) and suffers damage or is unconscious.
    *   **THEN:** The DM secretly determines if assimilation occurs (based on the other individual's status). If assimilation happens, secretly inform the player they're now Thing-infected. They continue playing normally but receive hidden objectives.
    *   **IF:** A blood test is performed correctly on a Thing-infected individual.
    *   **THEN:** Their blood reacts violently—screaming and leaping away from heat. The individual immediately transforms into Thing-form and attacks. Generate combat encounter with Thing-creature.
    *   **IF:** A Thing-infected individual is accused but the test is sabotaged or inconclusive.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a social encounter where the accused must defend themselves. If they're executed despite being human, the party loses an ally and gains guilt. If they're Thing and escape justice, they continue sabotage.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully identifies and kills all Thing-infected individuals.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a final twist: a hidden Thing-mass in the facility, a dormant infection in someone thought clear, or Thing-cells that survived in unexpected places (frozen samples, cracks in the floor).
    *   **IF:** The generator is destroyed or fails.
    *   **THEN:** The outpost begins freezing. The party has 4-6 hours to restore heat or evacuate before cold becomes lethal. This creates desperate time pressure.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to evacuate before confirming all Things are destroyed.
    *   **THEN:** Generate pursuit by Thing-creatures or reveal that an infected individual is among the escapees. The moral weight of potentially dooming humanity is emphasized.
    *   **IF:** The party decides to destroy the outpost to ensure no Thing survives.
    *   **THEN:** They must gather in one location, activate explosives or fuel fire, and evacuate to a minimal survival shelter, accepting they might die in the cold but preventing global catastrophe. Generate final encounter with Things trying to stop the destruction.
