# Operation Cold Harbor

*A Paranoia Horror / Survival campaign — Short Campaign (6–8 sessions) — Extreme difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Operation Cold Harbor
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Paranoia Horror / Survival / Shapeshifter Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **8–9**
**Tone (keywords):** paranoia, trust erosion, isolation, body horror, shapeshifter, bleak, cold
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is part of an Arctic research expedition studying ancient glacial formations when they discover something frozen in the ice—something that shouldn't exist. After bringing a specimen back to their remote outpost, it thaws and escapes. Now the party realizes they're trapped with a perfect shapeshifter that can imitate anyone it absorbs. In the perpetual darkness of Arctic winter, isolated from help, the party must determine who is still human and who has been replaced, knowing that a single infected person who reaches civilization could doom the world.

## What "Extreme" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Trust Is the Enemy:** The shapeshifter can perfectly imitate absorbed victims. Any party member could be the Thing at any time. Players must suspect everyone, including each other.
*   **Perma-Death with a Twist:** If a character is absorbed, the player continues playing them—but now secretly works for the Thing. They receive hidden objectives to sabotage and infect others.
*   **No Safe Haven:** The outpost is remote. Weather makes evacuation impossible. The radio is destroyed. They're alone in the dark with a monster.
*   **Assimilation Horror:** The Thing doesn't just kill—it absorbs and replaces. Characters can be replaced between sessions without other players knowing.
*   **Impossible Detection:** There's no perfect test. Magic can be fooled. Detection methods the party develops can be circumvented. Paranoia is justified.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A descent into paranoia across three acts, as trust dissolves and the body count rises.

*   **Act I — Discovery (Sessions 1–2):** The party finds an alien organism frozen for millennia and brings it to the outpost for study. It thaws, attacks, and escapes. The party organizes to hunt it, not yet realizing it can perfectly imitate humans.
*   **Act II — Paranoia (Sessions 3–5):** Someone has been replaced. The party develops tests to identify the Thing, but these tests are imperfect and create false positives. Accusations fly. The group fractures. Violence erupts as paranoia takes hold. Multiple assimilations occur.
*   **Act III — Endgame (Sessions 6–8):** The party realizes they must destroy the outpost to prevent the Thing from reaching civilization. In a desperate gambit, the survivors must determine who is human and who is the Thing, then blow the facility, accepting they may all die in the frozen waste.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Discovery"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Wonder Turned Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: While drilling ice cores, the party discovers something impossible—a massive crashed vessel frozen for thousands of years, clearly not of this world.
    *   The Excavation: They carefully extract a frozen creature—bipedal, vaguely humanoid, but fundamentally wrong.
    *   The Specimen: Back at the outpost, they place it in cold storage for study. That night, the power to the storage unit fails mysteriously.

**Escalation:** The morning reveals an empty storage unit. There's a hole burned through the floor. The creature is loose in the outpost.

### Session 2 — "The First Kill"

*   **Focus:** Hunt / Body Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Search: The party searches the outpost. They find it hiding in the kennel, having absorbed the sled dogs. The scene is grotesque—scattered limbs, alien biomass.
    *   The Battle: They confront it. The creature is a nightmarish mass of tentacles, teeth, and absorption. They manage to burn it with flamethrowers.
    *   False Victory: They believe they've killed it, not realizing a piece escaped and has already absorbed someone.

**Escalation:** A party member who was alone briefly begins acting oddly—small behavioral changes, memory gaps. The player is secretly informed they've been assimilated.

### Session 3 — "Who Goes There?"

*   **Focus:** Paranoia / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Revelation: The party finds research notes from a similar expedition that ended in disaster, revealing the creature's true nature: it assimilates and imitates perfectly.
    *   The Tests Begin: Paranoia sets in. The party develops tests—blood samples burned with hot wire (Thing cells react defensively), magical detection, observing behavior.
    *   The First Accusation: Someone fails a test or behaves suspiciously. Do they execute them? Isolate them? What if they're wrong?

**Escalation:** The accused transforms, confirming the threat is real. But in the chaos, another assimilation occurs. Now multiple party members may be Things.

### Session 4 — "Quarantine"

*   **Focus:** Social Horror / Isolation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Fractured Group: The party splits into factions. Some want to test everyone. Others refuse. Accusations escalate into violence.
    *   Sabotage: Equipment is destroyed. The radio, vehicles, and heating systems are sabotaged by Thing-infected members.
    *   The Blizzard: A massive storm hits, making evacuation impossible. They're trapped for at least a week.

**Escalation:** The party realizes with horror that if even one Thing reaches civilization, it could assimilate all humanity in a matter of months.

### Session 5 — "The Long Night"

*   **Focus:** Siege / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Barricaded: The confirmed humans barricade in the main hall. Thing-assimilated members (whether revealed or hidden) stalk them.
    *   Resource Depletion: Food, fuel, and ammunition are running low. The cold is becoming dangerous.
    *   The Dilemma: A supposed survivor begs to be let in from the cold. Are they human or Thing? Letting them in risks infection; leaving them out is murder if they're innocent.

**Escalation:** A Thing attacks in horrifying form—a grotesque fusion of multiple absorbed humans. The battle is desperate.

### Session 6 — "The Test"

*   **Focus:** Judgment / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Ultimate Paranoia: The surviving party members (including hidden Things) conduct a final, definitive test using scarce resources.
    *   The Executions: Those who fail are killed. But the tests aren't perfect. Innocent people may die. Thing-infected players act human convincingly.
    *   The Truth: The true nature of remaining party members is revealed in crisis moments where Things can no longer hide.

**Escalation:** The party realizes the Thing has assimilated the rescue team coming for them. The infection is already spreading.

### Session 7 — "Scorched Earth"

*   **Focus:** Action / Desperate Sacrifice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Decision: The survivors decide to destroy the outpost entirely using the fuel tanks and explosives from the excavation site.
    *   The Gauntlet: They must gather supplies while Thing-creatures hunt them through the dark, frozen facility.
    *   The Betrayal: A player thought to be human reveals they're a Thing, attacking at the worst moment.

**Escalation:** The outpost begins burning. The extreme cold and the fire create a deadly race against time.

### Session 8 — "Frozen Hell"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Ambiguous Ending
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Final Stand: The last survivors face off against any remaining Things in the burning outpost.
    *   The Detonation: They activate the charges. The outpost explodes, presumably killing all Things—and possibly all humans.
    *   The Aftermath: Any survivors huddle in the frozen waste. Help won't come for days or weeks. Can they trust each other? Did they get all the Things? Or is one still hidden among them?

**Final Scene:** The survivors sit around a fire, eyeing each other with suspicion, knowing that even now, one of them might not be human.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Dr. Kate Lloyd** — *The Scientist Leader (Possible PC)*
    *   **Role:** Lead researcher, pragmatic, develops the testing protocols.
    *   **Personality:** Intelligent, skeptical, increasingly paranoid but justified.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Knows more about the Thing from classified files than she's admitted.

2.  **MacReady** — *The Pilot*
    *   **Role:** Helicopter pilot, practical survivalist.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, cynical, but loyal to those he trusts.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Willing to kill suspects with less evidence than others would require.

3.  **Blair** — *The Researcher Turned Paranoid*
    *   **Role:** Biologist who studies the Thing and realizes its threat.
    *   **Personality:** Brilliant but unstable. Early in campaign calculates the Thing's exponential spread rate.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** May be assimilated early, making his research suspect, or may sabotage vehicles to prevent anyone leaving (even if uninfected).

4.  **The Thing** — *The Shapeshifter*
    *   **Role:** The antagonist, but also potentially some PCs.
    *   **Personality:** Alien intelligence. Survival-driven. Will imitate perfectly to avoid detection.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Cannot imitate non-organic materials (clothing, equipment). Burns easily. Isolated cells act independently to survive.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Main Outpost:** Central research facility with living quarters, lab, mess hall, and generator room.
2.  **The Excavation Site:** Where the alien craft was found, now a frozen pit in the ice.
3.  **The Kennel:** Where sled dogs were kept. Site of the first absorption.
4.  **Cold Storage:** Medical and biological storage. Potential safe room or deadly trap.
5.  **The Generator Room:** Keeps power and heat running. Vulnerable to sabotage.
6.  **The Helicopter Hangar:** Potential escape route, but the helicopter has been sabotaged.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is trust versus paranoia. The Thing is terrifying not just because it kills, but because it replaces. Your ally, your friend, your fellow party member might be the monster wearing their face. Every interaction is suspect. Every moment alone with someone could be the moment they're replaced—or the moment they replace you. The horror comes from the breakdown of human cooperation in the face of existential threat. The party must work together to survive, but working together means trusting people who might be monsters. It's an impossible situation with no good choices—only terrible ones that might lead to survival.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Secret Assimilation**

*   When a character is absorbed by the Thing (through combat damage, isolation, or other means), the DM secretly informs that player.
*   The player continues playing their character normally but receives hidden objectives: sabotage tests, infect others, prevent the outpost's destruction.
*   Thing-players can reveal dramatically or stay hidden, creating genuine player paranoia.

### 2. **The Blood Test**

*   Party members can test each other by heating blood samples. Thing cells react defensively when isolated and threatened.
*   However, Thing-infected players can sabotage tests, swap samples, or ensure the test equipment is destroyed.
*   The test is only reliable if conducted properly with witnesses—creating paranoid rituals.

### 3. **Isolation Danger**

*   Any time a character is alone with another character or isolated from the group, there's a risk of assimilation.
*   DMs should occasionally call for secret rolls or pass notes to create paranoia even when nothing happens.

### 4. **Cold Damage**

*   The Arctic environment is hostile. Characters outside or in unheated areas take cold damage over time.
*   This limits options and makes certain strategies (like living in separate barricaded rooms) untenable.

### 5. **Thing Transformation**

*   When a Thing is revealed or threatened, it transforms into its true form—a grotesque mass of tentacles, teeth, and absorbed biomass.
*   Thing-creatures have high HP and regeneration but are vulnerable to fire.
*   They can split apart, with each piece acting independently if the whole is destroyed.
