# Creative Brief: The Guillotine's Shadow

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Revolutionary Fervor (A Tale of Two Cities meets The Terror)

Inspired by the revolutionary drama of *A Tale of Two Cities* and the ideological horror of *The Terror*. This style aims to capture the passionate idealism of revolution, the bloody reality of political violence, the paranoia of purity testing, and the tragic transformation from hope to horror.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Duality:** Focus on the contrast between noble ideals and bloody methods, hope and terror.
*   **Revolutionary Iconography:** Show tricolor flags, liberty caps, guillotines, revolutionary symbols everywhere.
*   **Accelerating Violence:** Highlight how executions become normalized spectacle.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Revolutionary, paranoid, idealistic, bloody, transformative, tragic, passionate.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of historical momentum becoming unstoppable horror—idealism curdling into terror. The atmosphere should evoke revolutionary fervor, the intoxication of political power, the dread of denunciation, and the tragedy of noble causes becoming monstrous. The world feels like it's being reborn and dying simultaneously.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic revolutionary art—the dynamic compositions of Jacques-Louis David meets the horror of Goya's war scenes.
*   **Forms:** The guillotine dominating public squares, revolutionary tribunals, tricolor flags, liberty caps, mob scenes, execution carts, political speeches.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dramatic illustration in revolutionary French style, showing the guillotine's blade falling in the Place de la Révolution while crowds in liberty caps cheer, tricolor flags wave, and tumbrils bring more condemned aristocrats, all under a sky heavy with historical significance."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** The French tricolor dominates—revolutionary blue, white, and red. Add the gold of former aristocratic excess now seized, the brown of common people's clothing, the blood red of violence.
*   **Luminosity:** Dramatic and theatrical—revolutionary rhetoric happens in harsh daylight, executions are public spectacles, paranoia lurks in shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a revolutionary color palette dominated by the French tricolor: liberty blue, equality white, fraternity red (increasingly just blood red), with touches of tarnished aristocratic gold and the earth tones of common people ascending to power."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Revolutionary fashion—sans-culottes in working trousers and liberty caps, former aristocrats in rags, revolutionaries in tricolor sashes, Committee members in severe republican dress.
*   **Revolutionary Elements:** Tricolor cockades, liberty caps (Phrygian caps), carmagnole jackets, revolutionary slogans on clothing, guillotine imagery.
*   **Expression:** Faces show revolutionary fervor, paranoid suspicion, idealistic hope, terror of denunciation, courage before execution, crowd madness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of revolutionaries: a sans-culotte in liberty cap waving tricolor, a Committee member with death list and severe expression, an accused aristocrat in rags showing dignity, a radical orator mid-passionate speech—all representing different aspects of Revolutionary France."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Paris transformed—aristocratic palaces repurposed as Revolutionary offices, public squares dominated by guillotines, prisons overflowing with accused, streets decorated with revolutionary slogans.
*   **Atmosphere:** Revolutionary fervor made visible—everywhere shows the old world dying and the new world being born in blood.
*   **Details:** Tricolor flags everywhere, revolutionary posters declaring festivals of Reason, execution schedules posted publicly, defaced royal symbols, renamed streets (Revolutionary Calendar), bread lines, political clubs meeting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Place de la Révolution: the guillotine stands center on a raised platform, daily execution schedules posted, crowds gathering for the public spectacle, tricolor flags flying from repurposed aristocratic buildings, Revolutionary slogans painted on walls, all showing how death has become public theater."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh and unforgiving—the bright light of revolutionary transparency exposes everything, deep shadows of paranoid suspicion hide denunciations.
*   **Shadows:** Used dramatically to show the duality—public revolutionary fervor versus private terror, idealistic speeches versus midnight arrests.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reinforces the campaign's theme of contradictions—bright revolutionary hope shadowed by dark revolutionary terror.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by harsh midday sun during public executions making everything cruelly visible, contrasted with deep shadows of suspicious glances and midnight Committee meetings, emphasizing the duality of enlightenment ideals and terroristic methods."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Revolutionary propaganda composition meets execution horror—heroic framing of revolutionary moments juxtaposed with the mechanical horror of the guillotine.
*   **Techniques:** Diagonal compositions suggesting revolutionary change, the guillotine as vertical focal point, crowds as horizontal waves of popular will, split compositions showing ideals versus reality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A complex composition: foreground shows an orator passionately declaring revolutionary ideals before the Convention, middle ground reveals Committee members marking death lists, background shows the guillotine's daily work visible through windows, all connected by tricolor imagery suggesting how noble means become bloody ends."

## Voice

A voice that captures both the passionate idealism and tragic horror of revolutionary France. The narrator speaks with the conflicted tone of someone who believed in the Revolution's ideals but witnessed its terror—simultaneously proud and horrified. During revolutionary moments: passionate and inspiring, echoing genuine belief in liberty, equality, fraternity. During Terror scenes: increasingly horrified yet trying to justify it, recognizing the tragedy. During denunciations: paranoid and careful, knowing anyone might be listening. During executions: numbed by repetition yet struggling to maintain humanity. The pacing accelerates with the Revolution—starting hopeful and slow, becoming frantic and bloody. The emotion is tragic awareness—the voice of someone watching heroes become monsters. Audio quality features: crowds chanting revolutionary slogans, the guillotine's blade falling, tumbrils rattling, passionate political speeches, whispered denunciations, execution drums, the Marseillaise, desperate defenses at tribunals, the silence after the blade. Role: The voice of a revolutionary who survived the Terror and must reckon with what they helped create.
