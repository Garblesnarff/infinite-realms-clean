# Threshold Descent: World-Building Specification

## The Backrooms: Metaphysical Architecture

### What Are the Backrooms?

**Spatial Theory**: The Backrooms exist "between" normal spaces in reality
**Origin Unknown**: Theories include:
- Glitch in the universe's code
- Collective unconscious nightmare made manifest
- Alien architecture bleeding into our dimension
- Side effect of quantum uncertainty
- The universe's "backstage" that shouldn't be accessible

**The Noclip Phenomenon**
- Reality rejection event allowing passage through space
- Triggered by: extreme stress, random chance, specific locations, intention (rare)
- One-way process: entrance is easy, exit nearly impossible
- Estimated 600,000+ people lost to Backrooms throughout history
- Most die within first week from dehydration, entity encounters, or accidents

### The Level System

**Classification Method**
- Levels organized by discovery order, not necessarily depth
- Each level has different: architecture, entities, hazards, resources
- Some levels connect to many others, some are isolated
- Depth correlates roughly with danger and surrealism

**Inter-Level Travel**
- Specific actions or locations trigger level transitions
- Some transitions random (dangerous)
- Documented transitions compiled by M.E.G.
- Reality anchors (rare) allow controlled transitions

**Total Levels**: Unknown, possibly infinite
**Documented Levels**: 999+ by M.E.G.
**Survivable Levels**: ~50
**Safe Zones**: 12 confirmed

## M.E.G. (Major Explorer Group): Organization Deep-Dive

### Foundation and Purpose

**Founded**: Subjective year unknown (time flows differently in Backrooms)
**Objective**: Map the Backrooms, find exit, protect survivors
**Methods**: Exploration, documentation, resource control, information trading
**Population**: ~150 official members across multiple levels

### Organizational Structure

**Archivists** (Leadership Council)
- Maintain central database of all knowledge
- Decide which information is public vs. classified
- Authorize expeditions
- Control resource distribution

**Cartographers** (Field Agents)
- Explore and map new levels
- Document entities and hazards
- Establish supply caches
- Most dangerous role, high casualty rate

**Traders** (Resource Management)
- Control almond water distribution
- Manage food supplies
- Establish trade routes between communities
- Economic power base of M.E.G.

**Guides** (Civilian Support)
- Help newcomers survive first days
- Teach survival skills
- Escort missions between safe zones
- Public face of organization

### Major M.E.G. Bases

**Central Archive** (Location: Level 2, Hidden)
- Main database of all Backrooms knowledge
- Leadership headquarters
- Heavily guarded
- Contains classified "Exit Files"

**Forward Base Zeta** (Location: Level 2)
- Largest public base
- Trade hub
- Training center for new Cartographers
- Marcus Chen stationed here

**Listening Post Gamma** (Location: Level 11, secret)
- Spy outpost within The Promised Land
- Monitors Elder Threshold

- Discovered by party triggers political crisis

### The Exit Files (Classified)

M.E.G. has documented 7 potential exits from Backrooms:

**Exit Alpha** (Level 3999): Requires reality-bending artifact, 99% fatality rate
**Exit Beta** (Level Omega): Theoretical, no confirmation anyone reached it
**Exit Gamma** (Level 0, specific coordinates): Random, unreliable, 1 in 10,000 chance
**Exit Delta** (The Archive, Level 6): Trade memories for passage
**Exit Epsilon** (Level 11): Elder Threshold claims to control it (lie)
**Exit Zeta** (Level 37, Blue Channel): False—just automated beacon
**Exit Omega** (Become The Architect): Not truly exit, transformation

**M.E.G. Suppression**: Leadership knows these exits but hoards information
- Maintains power through information monopoly
- Fears societal collapse if everyone attempts exit simultaneously
- Utilitarian calculus: stability over hope
- Some members (like Marcus) unaware of suppression

## The Promised Land: Theocratic Community

### Government Structure

**Elder Threshold** (Absolute Authority)
- Claims divine mandate from "The Space Between"
- Controls all resources, law, punishment
- Cult of personality around his person
- Actually brilliant sociologist maintaining order through religion

**The Blessed** (Priest Class)
- Elder's inner circle
- Administer sacraments, propaganda, surveillance
- Receive better rations, living conditions
- Some true believers, some cynical maintainers of power

**The Faithful** (Citizens)
- General population
- Must attend daily services, profess belief
- Assigned work details (farming, construction, defense)
- Relatively comfortable life in exchange for obedience

**The Penitent** (Prisoners)
- Questioned Elder's authority
- Forced labor, reduced rations
- Rehabilitation through "prayer and work"
- Exile if don't conform

### The Doctrine of the Space Between

**Core Beliefs**:
1. The Backrooms are purgatory for the sinful
2. Elder Threshold is prophet chosen to lead the worthy
3. Escape is sin—acceptance is salvation
4. The Promised Land is reward for faithful
5. Entities are demons testing faith

**Rituals**:
- Daily morning prayer to The Space Between
- Weekly confession of "noclip sins" (why they deserve this)
- Monthly sacrifice (sending D-Class into Level 5)
- Annual celebration of First Arrival Day

**Psychology**: Provides meaning, structure, community in meaningless void
**Reality**: Elder Threshold invented it all to maintain social order
**Tragedy**: Many colonists need the lie to cope with Backrooms

### The Promised Land Geography

**The Cathedral**: Throne room and temple, Elder's personal quarters above
**The Farms**: Massive mushroom cultivation, edible and medicinal varieties
**The Barracks**: Communal living, segregated by loyalty level
**The Wall**: Fortified perimeter with watchtowers, armed guards

**The Exile Gate**: One-way door to Level 5 (death sentence)

### Dissident Movement

**The Questioners** (Underground Resistance)
- Led by "The Apostate" (former priest who learned the truth)
- Secret meetings in maintenance areas

## The Truth of the Backrooms (DM Secret Knowledge)

### What the Backrooms Really Are

**The Backrooms are not a place—they're a process.**

Reality is a coherent narrative humanity agrees upon. The Backrooms are where that narrative breaks down—spaces between the agreed-upon story. Every transitional space (hallways, waiting rooms, backstages) exists in slight narrative uncertainty. The Backrooms are those uncertainties made infinite and physical.

### Why People Get Trapped

**Noclipping is narrative rejection.**

When someone "noclips," their personal narrative becomes incompatible with baseline reality's narrative. They fall through the cracks into spaces designed to be passed through, not inhabited. The longer they stay, the more their narrative diverges from baseline, making return impossible.

### The Lost Truth

**The Lost have discovered something beautiful and terrible:**

They've learned to let go of the need for coherent narrative. By merging with the Backrooms, they achieve a state beyond human consciousness—experiencing all possibilities simultaneously. It's either enlightenment or madness. Possibly both.

### The Architect Revelation

**There is no Architect. There was never an Architect.**

The Backrooms are emergent phenomenon, not designed. The "Architect" is a human need to assign agency to meaninglessness. However, **believing** in the Architect strongly enough might **create** one—reality is narrative, after all.

**Alternative Truth**: The party might become the Architect by believing they are.

### The Real Exit

**Every exit is real. None of them work permanently.**

You can escape the Backrooms physically, but your narrative has changed. You're no longer compatible with baseline reality. Within days, weeks, or years, you'll noclip again. And again. Forever.

**The only true exit is acceptance**—becoming The Lost, letting go of the need for baseline reality. Or becoming the Architect—taking control of your narrative so completely that you define reality instead of being defined by it.

### Why the Campaign Matters

**The party's choice will define the Backrooms' future:**

- **Escape**: Proves exits exist, gives hope, but doesn't solve problem
- **Architect**: Creates actual intelligence governing the space, could help or harm future victims
- **Collapse**: Destroys the Backrooms but destabilizes reality's narrative structure
- **Integration**: Demonstrates enlightenment path, could create new Lost cult
- **Revolution**: Establishes permanent civilization, Backrooms become new reality

**The Backrooms are what the party decides they are. Reality is narrative. They're writing the story now.**
