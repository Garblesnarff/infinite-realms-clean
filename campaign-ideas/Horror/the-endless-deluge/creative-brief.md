# Creative Brief: The Endless Deluge

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Oceanic Survival Simplicity (Raft-inspired)

Inspired by the clean, vibrant aesthetic of *Raft*, blending serene ocean beauty with the tension of survival and the terror of the shark. This style emphasizes the contrast between the peaceful, infinite ocean and the constant threat lurking beneath.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Infinite Ocean:** Every scene should emphasize the vastness of the water—endless horizons, clear blue water, and the sense of being small and alone.
*   **Raft as Home:** The raft is the central focus—a growing, customizable structure that represents progress and safety.
*   **Bruce the Menace:** The shark should be depicted as large, intimidating, and ever-present, a constant shadow beneath the waves.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Isolating, resourceful, expansive, aquatic, hopeful-yet-desperate, shark-stalked, serene-but-dangerous.
*   **Feeling:** A mix of calm beauty (the ocean) and underlying dread (the shark, the endless expanse). The mood shifts from vulnerable survival to confident expansion.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, simple linework with a focus on functional, modular design for the raft. Smooth, hydrodynamic forms for the ocean and sea life.
*   **Forms:** The raft is made of simple, rectangular foundations and practical structures. The ocean is vast and flat. Islands are small and welcoming.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A clean, stylized digital painting of a wooden raft floating on an endless, calm ocean. The raft is composed of simple, modular wooden planks. The water is smooth and reflective."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Bright, vibrant colors. The ocean is clear, tropical blues. Islands are lush greens and sandy yellows.
*   **Ocean Colors:** Azure blues, deep cerulean, white foam (waves), the golden glow of sunlight on water.
*   **Raft Colors:** Natural wood tones (browns, tans), green from crop plots, colorful fabric (sails, flags).
*   **Shark Colors:** Dark grays, whites (underbelly), the menacing shadow beneath the surface.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette dominated by azure blues for the ocean, golden yellows for sunlight on the water, and natural brown tones for the wooden raft. A dark shadow beneath the waves hints at Bruce's presence."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers in practical, sun-worn ocean gear (shorts, hats, vests). Appearance shows exposure to sun and salt.
*   **Bruce:** A massive, great white shark with scarred skin, a powerful tail, and menacing eyes. He is large enough to dominate the frame.
*   **Expression:** Adventurers show determination, hope, and wariness. Bruce is a predator—cold, patient, and relentless.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer in sun-faded clothing and a wide-brimmed hat, standing on a wooden raft, fishing with a rod. Beneath the clear blue water, the massive silhouette of Bruce the shark circles."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, open ocean with endless horizons. Islands are small, tropical paradises or rocky outcrops.
*   **Atmosphere:** The ocean is serene and beautiful but also isolating and dangerous. The sky is often clear, with occasional dramatic storms.
*   **Details:** Floating debris (barrels, planks, plastic), seagulls circling, distant islands on the horizon, waves gently lapping at the raft, and Bruce's fin cutting through the water.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of an endless ocean: calm, azure blue water stretching to the horizon. A small wooden raft floats in the center. In the distance, a tiny tropical island is visible. Floating debris drifts past."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Bright, naturalistic lighting. The sun dominates, creating reflections on the water. Shadows are soft and diffused.
*   **Shadows:** The ocean's depth creates dark areas where Bruce hides. The raft casts a small shadow, emphasizing the vastness around it.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates a sense of hope (bright sun) and danger (shadows beneath the waves).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...brightly lit by the tropical sun, creating shimmering reflections on the calm ocean. The water is clear, but beneath the raft, a dark shadow (Bruce) moves slowly, contrasting with the bright surface."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide, expansive shots to show the ocean's vastness. Close-ups of the raft to show detail and progress. Low-angle shots from the water to emphasize Bruce's menace.
*   **Techniques:** Use the raft as a focal point against the infinite ocean. Show the progression from a tiny raft to a large, multi-level structure. Frame Bruce as a massive, looming threat.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot from the water's surface, looking up at a multi-level wooden raft with crop plots, storage, and a sail. The adventurers are busy working. In the foreground, Bruce's massive head emerges, jaws open, ready to attack."

## Voice

A calm, optimistic male voice with a slight coastal accent, pacing that is steady and encouraging, conveying resilience and hope. The emotion is a mix of serene appreciation for the ocean's beauty and underlying wariness of its dangers. Audio quality is clear with ambient ocean sounds—waves lapping, seagulls calling, the creak of the raft. Role: A survivor recounting their journey across the endless ocean, or a guide teaching others how to survive on the raft.
