---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Endless Deluge
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Ocean Survival / Raft Expansion / Island Hopping / Shark Horror / Environmental Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12-15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **10**
**Tone (keywords):** isolating, resourceful, expansive, aquatic, hopeful-yet-desperate, shark-stalked
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party awakens on a tiny wooden raft drifting in an endless ocean, the result of a cataclysmic flood that has swallowed the world. With only a hook to fish debris from the water, they must expand their raft, gather floating resources, and survive the relentless attacks of Bruce, a massive, territorial shark. As they explore scattered islands, they uncover clues about the Deluge: it was no natural disaster but a magical cataclysm, and the only way to end it is to reach the Tower of Tides, an ancient structure on the farthest island, and reverse the ritual. But the ocean is vast, resources are scarce, and Bruce is always circling.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-15 sessions)

A journey across the endless ocean, from a tiny raft to a floating fortress.

*   **Act I — Drifting & Building (Levels 2–5):** The party starts on a 2x2 raft with a simple hook. They must fish debris (wood, plastic, rope) from the water to expand the raft, craft tools, and establish a sustainable food and water source (fishing, desalination). Bruce, the shark, attacks periodically, forcing them to defend the raft or drive him off. They discover their first small island, which has a research station with clues about the Deluge and a map showing other islands.
*   **Act II — Island Hopping (Levels 6–8):** With a larger, multi-level raft (complete with storage, a garden, and defenses), the party begins exploring scattered islands. Each island offers resources, lore, and unique challenges (hostile wildlife, environmental hazards, rival rafters). They meet other survivors—some friendly, some desperate enough to raid. They learn of the Tower of Tides, the source of the Deluge, located on the farthest island. To reach it, they need advanced navigation tools and a raft strong enough to survive a massive storm.
*   **Act III — The Tower of Tides (Levels 9–10):** The party navigates through the Eye of the Storm, a massive, permanent hurricane surrounding the final island. They face the worst ocean hazards yet (whirlpools, waterspouts, colossal sea creatures), and Bruce makes his final, most aggressive attack. On the island, they explore the Tower of Tides, face its magical guardians, and confront the truth: the Deluge was cast by a desperate mage trying to cleanse the world of corruption. The party must choose: reverse the ritual and risk the corruption returning, or let the world remain flooded but pure.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "Adrift"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Basic Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens on a tiny wooden raft (2x2 squares) in the middle of an endless ocean. They have a simple hook and nothing else.
    *   They must use the hook to fish floating debris from the water: wooden planks, plastic, rope, barrels.
    *   They craft basic tools (a spear, a water purifier, a fishing rod) and expand the raft to 3x3.
    *   They must manage thirst (desalination takes time) and hunger (fishing is unreliable).
**Escalation:** Bruce, the massive shark, appears. He circles the raft and attacks, biting off a corner. The party must drive him away or repair the raft quickly.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Building the Home"
*   **Focus:** Raft Expansion / Resource Management
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party expands the raft to multiple levels: a lower deck for storage, an upper deck for a garden (growing potatoes, beets) and a lookout.
    *   They craft defenses against Bruce: a spear, a bow, and eventually a shark net.
    *   Floating debris becomes less common. They must venture further from the raft (using a makeshift sail) to find resource-rich areas.
    *   They spot their first island on the horizon and navigate toward it.
**Escalation:** A storm hits. The party must secure loose items, hold on as the raft is tossed by waves, and repair damage afterward.

### Sessions 5-6 — "The First Island"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Lore Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party reaches a small, rocky island with a research station. Inside, they find journals detailing the Deluge: a magical flood cast 10 years ago.
    *   The island has resources (metal, vines, fruit trees) and wildlife (seagulls, wild boars).
    *   They find a map showing other islands and the location of the Tower of Tides, marked with a warning: "Do not go there."
    *   They meet another rafter, Mira, who has been island hopping for years. She offers trade and advice.
**Escalation:** Bruce attacks while the party is on the island. He destroys part of their anchored raft, forcing them to rebuild before leaving.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Mira — The Drifter** — *The Veteran Survivor*
    *   **Role:** A lone rafter who has survived for years by scavenging islands. She serves as a guide and trader.
    *   **Personality:** Weathered, pragmatic, and cautiously friendly. She has seen the worst the ocean can offer and trusts no one fully.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Mira knows the location of a legendary island with advanced tech, but she's too afraid to go there alone. She'll trade the information if the party helps her.

2.  **Captain Thorne — The Raider** — *The Hostile Survivor*
    *   **Role:** The leader of a crew of desperate rafters who survive by raiding others.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic but ruthless. He believes the strong deserve to survive, and the weak are resources to be exploited.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Thorne was once a noble ship captain who tried to save people during the Deluge. He failed, lost his crew, and descended into raiding to cope with his guilt.

3.  **The Tidecaller** — *The Guardian of the Tower*
    *   **Role:** An ancient, elemental being that guards the Tower of Tides. It is bound to the tower and cannot leave.
    *   **Personality:** Alien and sorrowful. It speaks in riddles and water imagery. It does not want to fight but will defend the tower.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Tidecaller was the mage's familiar, forced to maintain the Deluge ritual even after the mage died. It longs for release.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about survival, expansion, and exploration in a world that has been swallowed by water. It captures the core loop of *Raft*: gather floating debris, expand your raft, explore islands, and survive the shark. The central conflict is the party's struggle to survive in an endless ocean while uncovering the mystery of the Deluge and deciding the fate of the world. Bruce, the shark, is a constant, terrifying presence, and the ocean itself is both a resource and a threat.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Raft Expansion & Customization**
*   The raft starts as a tiny 2x2 platform. The party can expand it by adding more foundation pieces (wood, plastic).
*   Multi-level rafts can be built: lower decks for storage, upper decks for gardens, lookouts, and defenses.
*   Functional structures: Storage chests, water purifiers, cooking stations, crop plots, sails (for faster travel), anchors (to stop at islands).

### 2. **Resource Gathering: The Hook**
*   Floating debris drifts by the raft in the current. The party must use a hook to grab it: wood, plastic, rope, barrels, scrap metal.
*   The further they sail, the rarer the debris becomes, forcing them to explore islands for resources.

### 3. **Bruce the Shark**
*   Bruce is a persistent threat. He attacks the raft periodically, biting off foundation pieces or attacking characters in the water.
*   Defenses: Spears, bows, shark nets (block his attacks). Fighting him head-on is dangerous; driving him away is safer.
*   Bruce cannot be permanently killed (he respawns), representing the ocean's constant threat.

### 4. **Island Exploration**
*   Islands are scattered across the ocean, each with unique resources, lore, and challenges:
    *   **Tropical Islands:** Fruit trees, animals, peaceful.
    *   **Rocky Islands:** Metal ore, caves, hostile wildlife.
    *   **Ruins Islands:** Pre-Deluge structures, treasure, environmental hazards (flooding, unstable floors).

### 5. **Hunger, Thirst, & Weather**
*   Hunger: Managed by fishing, farming on the raft, or scavenging islands.
*   Thirst: Seawater must be desalinated (requires a purifier and fuel). Coconuts and rainwater are alternatives.
*   Weather: Storms damage the raft and reduce visibility. The party must secure items and repair damage.

### 6. **Navigation**
*   The ocean is vast. Without a map or compass, navigation is difficult.
*   Landmarks (distant islands, the sun's position) and crafted tools (compass, receiver) help guide the party to the Tower of Tides.
