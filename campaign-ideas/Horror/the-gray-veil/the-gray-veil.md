## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A descent into madness and the breakdown of civilization in microcosm.

*   **Act I — The Mist Descends (Sessions 1–2):** A massive thunderstorm strikes Millhaven. In its wake, an unnatural gray fog rolls in. The party witnesses tentacled horrors in the mist and flees to the General Store with other survivors. They barricade the doors and windows. Outside, inhuman screams echo through the fog. The party learns that the mist came from the ruins of an old wizard's tower on the hill—a failed ritual tore a hole between worlds.
*   **Act II — The Madness Within (Sessions 3–4):** As days pass, supplies run low and tensions rise. Sister Mordane, a traveling priestess, begins preaching that the mist is divine judgment for humanity's sins. She gathers followers and demands blood sacrifice to "appease the gods." The party must navigate the growing cult, maintain order, and venture into the mist to scavenge supplies—where the creatures are waiting. Each trip into the mist tests their sanity.
*   **Act III — The Choice (Sessions 5–6):** With no rescue coming and Sister Mordane's cult preparing to sacrifice "the sinners," the party faces impossible choices. They can attempt to flee through the mist to reach the wizard's tower (hoping to reverse the ritual), execute Sister Mordane and her cult (becoming killers themselves), or accept their fate. The campaign ends with the party's choice—and the consequences may be far bleaker than they imagined.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Something in the Mist"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Escalation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is in Millhaven during a violent thunderstorm. They witness a massive explosion on the hill where the old wizard's tower stands—a pillar of purple light shoots into the sky, then collapses.
    *   An unnatural gray mist rolls down from the hill, consuming the town. A farmer stumbles out of the mist, screaming about "things with too many legs." Tentacles pull him back into the fog.
    *   The party and ~60 townsfolk flee into the General Store (the largest building on the main street). They barricade doors and windows. Outside, shapes move in the mist—incomprehensible, multi-limbed horrors.
**Escalation:** The mist does not dissipate. The town's alarm bells are silenced. No one comes to help.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Trapped"
*   **Focus:** Survival / Psychological Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must organize the survivors: ration food, assign watches, keep morale up. Key NPCs emerge: merchant Torven (owner of the store), soldier Markus, and Sister Mordane (a priestess of the Ascended Sun).
    *   The party realizes they need more supplies. They must venture into the mist to reach the nearby tavern's cellar. In the fog, they encounter the creatures: Veil Stalkers (spider-like things), Mist Serpents (floating tentacled masses), and Whisper Wraiths (entities that drive you mad with their voices).
    *   Sister Mordane begins preaching. "This is the end! We have sinned, and the gods have sent judgment! Only through sacrifice can we be saved!" Some desperate survivors begin to listen.
**Escalation:** Markus reports: "I saw the mist take someone. It didn't kill them—it changed them. Twisted them. We can't let that happen to us."

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Cult"
*   **Focus:** Social Breakdown / Moral Dilemma
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Sister Mordane has converted 20-30 survivors into a cult. She demands they "offer the unbelievers to the mist." The party is on her list.
    *   The party must choose sides: ally with Torven and Markus to resist the cult, negotiate with Mordane, or eliminate her (which may make martyrs of her followers).
    *   A desperate plan emerges: the wizard's tower is the source of the mist. If someone can reach it and destroy the ritual site, the rift might close. But it's a mile through the mist, and no one who has entered the fog for long has returned sane.
    *   The party conducts another supply run and discovers a horrifying truth: the mist is spreading. It now covers the entire region. There is no rescue coming.
**Escalation:** Sister Mordane's cult captures a survivor and prepares to throw them into the mist as a sacrifice. The party must intervene—or let it happen.

### Session 6 — "The End"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Tragedy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party has three final options:
        1.  **Flee Through the Mist:** Attempt to reach the wizard's tower and close the rift. This requires multiple Wisdom saves to resist madness, combat with mist creatures, and a desperate ritual at the tower. Success closes the rift, but at great personal cost (insanity, death, or mutation).
        2.  **Execute Sister Mordane:** Stop the cult by force. This requires the party to become killers, and the cult may martyr her, causing a bloodbath in the store. The mist remains.
        3.  **Accept Fate:** The party realizes there is no hope. They can choose to die on their own terms, protect the innocent until the end, or succumb to Sister Mordane's madness.
    *   The session ends with the consequences of the party's choice. In the style of *The Mist*, the ending may be tragic regardless.
**Resolution:** The mist does not forgive. Even "victory" is pyrrhic. The party may survive, but they are changed—haunted, broken, or hollow.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Sister Mordane** — *The Zealot*
    *   **Role:** A traveling priestess who interprets the mist as divine punishment and leads a doomsday cult.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic, fervent, and genuinely believes she is saving souls. She is terrifying in her conviction.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Mordane is using the crisis to seize power. She fears death as much as anyone, but hides it behind religious fervor.

2.  **Torven Halleck** — *The Merchant*
    *   **Role:** Owner of the General Store, pragmatic and trying to maintain order.
    *   **Personality:** Rational, self-interested, but ultimately decent. He opposes Sister Mordane's madness.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Torven knows the wizard who owned the tower. He supplied ingredients for the ritual. He blames himself.

3.  **Markus Varn** — *The Soldier*
    *   **Role:** A veteran soldier who becomes the party's ally in maintaining order.
    *   **Personality:** Disciplined, brave, but haunted by the horrors in the mist. He's seen things that broke his worldview.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Markus wants to flee, but his sense of duty keeps him protecting the civilians. He's one bad day from breaking.

4.  **The Veil Stalker** — *The Face of the Mist*
    *   **Role:** A recurring monster—a massive, spider-like creature with too many legs and an eyeless, tooth-lined face.
    *   **Personality:** Alien and incomprehensible. It hunts with patient malevolence, toying with prey.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Veil Stalker is just one of countless creatures in the mist. Killing it changes nothing.

## Key Locations

1.  **Millhaven:** A small rural town, now consumed by the Gray Veil. Only the General Store is "safe."
2.  **The General Store:** A two-story wooden building, cramped and claustrophobic with 60+ survivors inside.
3.  **The Mist:** An ever-present gray fog that obscures vision beyond 10 feet and is filled with nightmarish creatures and sanity-breaking whispers.
4.  **The Wizard's Tower (Ruined):** The source of the rift, a crumbling ruin on the hill surrounded by the thickest concentration of mist and monsters.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of faith vs. reason, the fragility of civilization, and the horror of cosmic insignificance. The central conflict is not just surviving the mist, but maintaining humanity in the face of hopelessness. Every choice is lose-lose. The party must decide what they are willing to sacrifice—and whether survival is even worth it.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity System**
*   Each PC has a **Sanity Score** equal to their Wisdom score.
*   When exposed to horrific sights (mist creatures, the aftermath of attacks, witnessing sacrifice), PCs make **Wisdom saving throws**.
*   Failure reduces Sanity by 1d4. At half Sanity, the PC gains a madness (hallucinations, paranoia). At 0 Sanity, the PC is catatonic or turns on the party.
*   Sanity can be restored by long rests in "safety" (relative), Lesser Restoration (1d4), or Greater Restoration (full).

### 2. **Mistwalking**
*   Traveling through the mist requires a **Navigation check (Survival DC 15)** to avoid getting lost.
*   Every 10 minutes in the mist, roll for a random encounter:
    1.  Veil Stalker ambush
    2.  Mist Serpent (floating tentacles)
    3.  Whisper Wraith (must save vs. madness)
    4.  Corpse of a previous victim (Sanity check)
    5.  Twisted survivor (mutated by the mist, hostile)
    6.  Safe passage (for now)
*   The mist obscures vision beyond 10 feet. Creatures in the mist have advantage on Stealth.

### 3. **Cult Influence**
*   Sister Mordane's cult grows over time. Track **Cult Influence** (starts at 20%, increases by 10% each day or after traumatic events).
*   When Cult Influence exceeds 50%, Mordane can demand blood sacrifice. The party must intervene or lose NPC allies.
*   If Cult Influence reaches 80%, the cult attempts to overthrow Torven and Markus, forcing the party to choose sides in a bloodbath.

### 4. **The Hopeless Ending**
*   This campaign does not guarantee a happy ending. The DM should embrace tragedy:
    *   If the party closes the rift, they may sacrifice their sanity or lives.
    *   If they kill Sister Mordane, the cult may turn violent.
    *   If they flee, they may discover the mist has consumed the entire world.
*   The goal is not "win," but "what will you do when there's no hope?"
