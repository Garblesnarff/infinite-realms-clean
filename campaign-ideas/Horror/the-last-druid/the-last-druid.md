---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Last Druid
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Mythological / Druid Adventure
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12-14**
**Tone (keywords):** ancient druid, hiding from gods, Irish mythology, talking dog, magic tattoos, Arizona
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In modern Tempe, Arizona, the party discovers one of them is a 2,000-year-old druid—possibly the last trained by the ancient druids—who has been hiding from gods, vampires, and magical beings for centuries under various identities. Bound to Earth through magic tattoos that channel Gaia's power, and accompanied by their telepathic Irish wolfhound Oberon, they must navigate Celtic pantheons (Tuatha Dé Danann), Norse gods, witches' covens, vampires' nests, and werewolf packs. When ancient enemies discover their location—particularly Aenghus Óg who seeks vengeance and the dark god Loki who needs a druid for his schemes—they must stop hiding and face threats that span millennia. In this world, gods are real and deadly, every pantheon has an agenda, and being the last druid makes you invaluable or target number one.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of revealed identity, divine conspiracies, and mythological warfare.

*   **Act I — Hidden in Plain Sight (Sessions 1-6):** The druid party member has been running an occult bookshop in Tempe while hiding from supernatural attention. When Celtic gods discover their location, they're drawn into conflicts with witches seeking power, vampires wanting druid magic, and werewolves needing territory. They're introduced to Tuatha Dé Danann politics, particularly Brighid (fire goddess and patron) and Aenghus Óg (love god turned vengeful). Their faithful hound Oberon provides telepathic commentary and wisdom (mostly about food). They discover Asgard is involved—Norse gods have their own plans.
*   **Act II — War of the Gods (Sessions 7-13):** The party becomes embroiled in divine conflicts as various pantheons seek to use or eliminate the last druid. They face dark elves, vampires with Old World power, witches wielding hex magic, and gods walking the mortal plane. Loki recruits them for his plan to trigger Ragnarok, while the Tuatha Dé Danann demand loyalty to their ancient pacts. They discover other druids survive in hidden groves worldwide. The party must navigate conflicts between pantheons while Aenghus Óg marshals forces for revenge.
*   **Act III — Ragnarok Rising (Sessions 14-20):** Loki's endgame is revealed—he seeks to trigger Ragnarok and destroy the current order of gods. The druid must choose sides in conflicts between pantheons, protect their found family, and prevent apocalypse. Final confrontations involve facing Aenghus Óg in direct combat, stopping dark gods from consuming Earth's power, and potentially participating in actual Ragnarok. They must decide whether to maintain the old ways, forge a new path for druidic magic, or let the age of gods finally end. Some prices include immortality, divine enemies made permanent allies, or becoming a god themselves.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of immortality's burden, hiding versus facing destiny, loyalty to ancient pacts, and whether gods deserve worship or should be opposed. It asks: What is the cost of immortality? Can you escape your past? Do gods have right to rule? The central conflict pits the druid's desire to live peacefully against divine forces that view them as weapon, threat, or prize, while ancient enemies seek revenge for centuries-old actions.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Druidic Magic and Tattoos**
*   Magic tattoos channel Gaia's power directly
*   Can shapeshift into any animal studied
*   Accelerated healing and immortality through Earth connection
*   Drawing power requires contact with earth

### 2. **Oberon's Bond**
*   Telepathic communication with bound Irish wolfhound
*   Oberon provides tactical insight (and commentary about food)
*   Bond allows sharing senses and magical protection
*   Oberon can be resurrected through druidic magic if killed

### 3. **Divine Politics**
*   Multiple pantheons with competing agendas
*   Making deals with gods has permanent consequences
*   Gods can grant boons but always extract prices
*   Pantheons war with each other; neutrality is difficult

### 4. **Immortality and Identity**
*   Must change identity periodically to avoid attention
*   Memories of 2,000 years provide knowledge but also trauma
*   Watching loved ones age and die repeatedly
*   Some beings remember the druid's past identities

### 5. **The Old Ways**
*   Network of ley lines connecting sacred sites
*   Can teleport between bound trees instantly
*   Drawing too much power alerts supernatural beings
*   Sacred groves provide sanctuaries

### 6. **Otherworlds**
*   Multiple parallel realms (Tír na nÓg, Asgard, etc.)
*   Time flows differently in each
*   Gods are stronger in their own realms
*   Mortals can be trapped or lost

### 7. **Ancient Languages and True Names**
*   Speaking in Old Irish empowers druidic magic
*   Knowing someone's true name grants power over them
*   Gods have secret names that bind them
*   Magical oaths spoken in ancient tongues are unbreakable

### 8. **Gaia's Power**
*   Direct connection to Earth's life force
*   Can sense disturbances in natural order
*   Environmental destruction physically hurts
*   In desperation, can channel massive power at great personal cost
