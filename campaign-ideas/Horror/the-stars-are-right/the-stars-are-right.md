# The Stars Are Right

*A Cosmic Horror / Investigation campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Stars Are Right
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Cosmic Horror / Investigation / Lovecraftian
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** sanity-eroding, unknowable, cultist conspiracies, ancient evil, inevitable doom
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party, a group of scholars, investigators, and occult experts, begins investigating strange disappearances in the coastal city of Innsmouth Harbor. What starts as a simple missing persons case soon reveals a web of ancient cults, forbidden knowledge, and the impending awakening of an eldritch abomination that dwells beyond the stars. As the party delves deeper, they must balance their pursuit of truth against the cost to their sanity, knowing that some knowledge is too terrible for mortal minds to bear.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Sanity System:** This campaign uses a custom Sanity mechanic. Witnessing eldritch horrors, casting forbidden spells, or learning terrible truths causes Sanity damage. At certain thresholds, characters gain permanent mental afflictions that affect their abilities and roleplaying.
*   **Unwinnable Fights:** Some encounters cannot be won through combat. The party must learn when to flee, hide, or seek alternative solutions. Direct confrontation with cosmic entities is almost always fatal.
*   **Knowledge Has a Price:** Every revelation brings the party closer to the truth but also closer to madness. Players must decide how much they're willing to sacrifice for victory.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** There are rarely clear "good" choices. The party may need to make terrible sacrifices, destroy innocent lives, or allow minor evils to prevent cosmic catastrophe.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A descent into madness across three acts, each revealing a deeper layer of cosmic horror.

*   **Act I — The Shadow Over Innsmouth (Sessions 1–4):** The party investigates disappearances in the decaying coastal city, uncovering a cult worshiping an entity from beneath the waves. They discover that many townspeople bear the "Innsmouth Look" and are slowly transforming into fish-like Deep Ones.
*   **Act II — The Esoteric Order (Sessions 5–8):** Following clues from Innsmouth, the party uncovers the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a centuries-old cult preparing for a cosmic alignment. They must infiltrate the cult, decipher ancient tomes (at great cost to their sanity), and learn the true scope of the threat.
*   **Act III — When the Stars Align (Sessions 9–12):** The stars are coming into alignment, and the Great Old One stirs in its cosmic prison. The party must race against time to perform a counter-ritual, knowing success may require the ultimate sacrifice: their lives, their sanity, or their souls.

### Session 6 — "The Necronomicon Fragment"

*   **Focus:** Heist / Occult Research
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Museum: The party learns a fragment of the forbidden Necronomicon is held in the Royal Museum's restricted vault.
    *   The Heist: They must steal the fragment without alerting guards or triggering magical wards.
    *   The Translation: Reading the fragment reveals the ritual to awaken the Great Old One and hints at a counter-ritual, but the knowledge comes at a terrible cost.

**Escalation:** The fragment's translator goes mad, speaking in tongues and clawing at their own eyes. The party must restrain them.

### Session 7 — "The Shunned Monastery"

*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Sanity Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Journey: Following Necronomicon clues, the party travels to a shunned monastery in the mountains where monks once guarded cosmic secrets.
    *   The Empty Halls: The monastery is abandoned, but signs suggest the monks didn't leave—they were taken.
    *   The Chamber of Angles: Deep beneath the monastery is a chamber where reality itself is warped. Here, the party finds the second half of the counter-ritual.

**Escalation:** In the chamber, the party encounters a Hound of Tindalos, a creature that hunts through angles. The encounter cannot be won by fighting.

### Session 8 — "The Order's Stronghold"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Voyage: The party sails to the coordinates where R'lyeh will rise from the ocean floor.
    *   The Sunken City: As the alignment begins, R'lyeh surfaces—a nightmare city of green stone and impossible geometry.
    *   The Threshold: Entering R'lyeh requires another major Sanity check. The very architecture is maddening.

**Escalation:** Time itself behaves strangely in R'lyeh. The party experiences moments out of sequence, seeing their own corpses or future actions.

### Session 10 — "The Dreamer Stirs"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Temple: At R'lyeh's heart is a massive temple where the Great Old One—Cthulhu—sleeps in death.
    *   The Counter-Ritual: The party must perform the counter-ritual while cultists attempt to awaken Cthulhu.
    *   The Components: The ritual requires sacrifices: magical items, memories, sanity, or even a life willingly given.

**Escalation:** Cthulhu begins to wake. His dreams alone cause madness and physical transformations in those nearby.

### Session 11 — "That Is Not Dead"

*   **Focus:** Epic Confrontation / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Awakening: Despite efforts, Cthulhu partially awakens. The party faces an entity whose mere presence kills lesser beings.
    *   The Binding: The counter-ritual doesn't destroy Cthulhu but can re-bind him to slumber for another eon.
    *   The Cost: Completing the ritual requires ultimate sacrifice—permanent loss of sanity, a character's life, or binding their soul to R'lyeh as eternal guardians.

**Escalation:** The city begins sinking back into the ocean. The party must complete the ritual and escape before they're pulled into the depths.

### Session 12 — "The Stars Go Dark"

*   **Focus:** Epilogue / Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Aftermath: The party survives (or some do). R'lyeh sinks, Cthulhu returns to dreaming, and the alignment passes.
    *   The Scars: Each character bears permanent changes—scars, madness, or supernatural alterations. They are no longer who they were.
    *   The Knowledge: They know the truth: Cthulhu will wake again when the stars align. This victory is temporary. In cosmic terms, humanity has bought mere moments.

**Final Scene:** The survivors look to the stars, knowing that one day, they will be right again.

## Key Locations

1.  **Innsmouth Harbor:** A decaying coastal town where the Esoteric Order holds sway. Architecture features wrong angles and fish motifs. The air smells of brine and rot.
2.  **Devil Reef:** A rocky outcrop offshore where Deep Ones gather. Beneath the waves are flooded tunnels leading to their underwater city.
3.  **The Grand Lodge:** The Order's opulent headquarters in the capital, hidden in plain sight as a gentleman's club for the wealthy elite.
4.  **The Shunned Monastery:** An abandoned mountain monastery that once guarded forbidden knowledge. Reality is thin here, and strange angles allow extradimensional creatures to enter.
5.  **R'lyeh:** The nightmare corpse-city that rises from the Pacific. Green stone buildings with impossible geometry that hurts to perceive. At its heart lies Cthulhu's tomb.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between mortal comprehension and cosmic indifference. The party seeks to save the world from Cthulhu's awakening, but they must confront the terrifying truth: in the vast cosmos, humanity is insignificant. The Great Old Ones existed before the world and will exist after. Victory isn't about defeating cosmic evil—it's about delaying the inevitable and maintaining one's sanity in the face of existential horror. The real battle is internal: can the characters retain their humanity when confronted with the knowledge that everything they know, love, and value is ultimately meaningless?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity System**

*   Characters have a Sanity score equal to their Wisdom score × 5 (maximum 100).
*   Witnessing horrors, reading forbidden texts, or encountering eldritch entities causes Sanity damage.
*   Sanity thresholds (75, 50, 25, 0) trigger increasingly severe mental afflictions: phobias, paranoia, delusions, complete breakdown.
*   Sanity can be restored through rest and therapy, but some losses are permanent.

### 2. **Forbidden Knowledge**

*   Learning certain truths (from the Necronomicon, from Cthulhu's dreams, etc.) grants advantage on specific checks but costs permanent Sanity.
*   Players choose whether to read/learn, creating agonizing risk-reward decisions.

### 3. **Mythos Magic**

*   Spells from forbidden tomes are more powerful than standard magic but cost Sanity to cast.
*   Repeated use risks permanent mental corruption and physical transformation.

### 4. **Cosmic Indifference**

*   Divine magic (clerics, paladins) may fail or backfire when confronting Great Old Ones, as mortal gods have no power over cosmic entities.
*   The party cannot simply pray for salvation—they must rely on their own wits and terrible choices.

### 5. **The Innsmouth Look**

*   Extended exposure to Deep Ones or their magic may cause characters to slowly transform, gaining aquatic features and abilities but losing their humanity.
*   This can be mechanically advantageous (water breathing, enhanced swimming) but comes with severe social and psychological costs.
