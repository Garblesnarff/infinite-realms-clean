# Creative Brief: The Grand Theater

## Art Style: Baroque (Caravaggio / Rubens / Bernini-inspired)

Dramatic emotion, harsh light and deep shadow (chiaroscuro), dynamic diagonal movement, theatrical gestures, sensual excess, memento mori symbolism.

### Core Principles:
- **Chiaroscuro**: Extreme contrast between light and shadow
- **Dynamic Movement**: Diagonal compositions, spiraling forms, theatrical gestures
- **Emotional Intensity**: Faces in ecstasy, agony, rapture
- **Sensual Excess**: Rich fabrics, luxurious details, abundant forms
- **Memento Mori**: Skulls, hourglasses, vanitas symbols amid grandeur

### Visual Style:
Caravaggio's dramatic lighting, Rubens' dynamic flesh, Bernini's theatrical sculpture. Everything in motion, everything emotional, everything excessive.

## Music: Baroque Opera / Orchestral Drama
Handel, Vivaldi, Bach's Passions. Dramatic arias, full orchestral swells, harpsichord recitatives. Music that demands attention and emotional response.

## Voice Acting:
Operatic delivery. Everything sung or spoken with theatrical intensity. Recitative for dialogue, aria for emotion. Vibrato, dramatic pauses, excessive emotion.
