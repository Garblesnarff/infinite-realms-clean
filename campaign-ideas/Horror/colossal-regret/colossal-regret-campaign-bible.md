# Colossal Regret: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The world is a man. A single, colossal, sentient human being, the last survivor of a previous, failed universe. This universe was destroyed by a single, terrible mistake made by this individual. Now, their body has grown to planetary size, a living landscape of their own self-loathing. Their skin is the earth, their tears are the oceans, their nightmares are the monsters that plague the land. The "cities" are not cities; they are festering wounds on its body, places where the parasites (humanity) have burrowed too deep. The "mountains" are its knuckles, the "valleys" its wrinkles. The "Colossal Regret" is this being, eternally tormented by its past, its every twitch, every spasm, every desperate attempt to scratch an itch it cannot reach, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. Humanity lives in its flesh, utterly unaware that their entire existence is a manifestation of someone else's cosmic guilt.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Mistake (The Previous Universe):** A nameless individual makes a single, terrible choice that unravels their entire universe.
2.  **The Cosmic Growth (The Void):** This individual, consumed by regret, begins to grow, their body expanding to planetary size, their mind becoming a landscape of self-loathing.
3.  **The Birth of a World (The Present Universe):** The Colossal Regret's body becomes a new world. Its tears form the oceans, its nightmares become the first monsters.
4.  **The Parasites (c. 200,000 years ago):** Humanity, a new, tiny species, appears on its skin, burrowing into its flesh, building their cities in its wounds.
5.  **The First Twitch (c. 10,000 years ago):** The Colossal Regret has its first major spasm, causing a continent-shattering earthquake. Humanity interprets this as a natural disaster.
6.  **(Surreal) The Day the Sky Wept Blood (c. 5,000 years ago):** For 24 hours, the sky rains blood. This is the Colossal Regret's own blood, weeping from a particularly deep wound (a major city). The blood causes temporary madness in those who touch it.
7.  **The Great Itch (c. 500 years ago):** The Colossal Regret develops a persistent, agonizing itch on its "back" (a vast desert). Its attempts to scratch it cause massive sandstorms and desertification.
8.  **(Surreal) The Whispering Mountains (c. 100 years ago):** The mountains (the Colossal Regret's knuckles) begin to whisper the names of everyone who has ever died on its surface. The whispers drive many hermits and mountain-dwellers mad.
9.  **The Deep Burrow (c. 50 years ago):** Humanity develops deep-drilling technology, burrowing too deep into the Colossal Regret's flesh. This causes immense pain, leading to more frequent and violent spasms.
10. **(Surreal) The Heartbeat of Regret (The Present Day):** The Colossal Regret's "heart" (a massive, underground cavern system) begins to beat erratically. Each beat causes a localized tremor, and the sound of it is a deep, mournful thrum that can be heard by those sensitive to psychic energy. The campaign begins as these tremors become more frequent and violent.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against an inescapable, cosmic guilt. The players are not just fighting for survival; they are fighting for their right to exist on a being that wishes it had never been born. The horror comes from the realization that their entire world is a manifestation of someone else's self-loathing. The goal is not to "kill" the Colossal Regret, which would destroy their world, but to find a way to "heal" it, to alleviate its suffering, or, perhaps, to convince it that its existence is not entirely a mistake. The ultimate enemy is not a monster, but the crushing weight of an individual's regret, made manifest on a planetary scale.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Scalpel of Forgiveness
**Type:** Legendary Dagger
**Description:** A surgical scalpel made of pure, solidified light. It hums with a gentle, healing energy.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 dagger. It deals radiant damage. When used to make a successful attack against a creature born from the Colossal Regret's nightmares, it deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage and forces the creature to make a WIS save. On a failure, the creature is "healed" of its negative emotion and dissipates peacefully. It can also be used to perform a "Great Excision" on a city, removing its "wound" from the Colossal Regret's body, but at the cost of destroying the city.

### 2. The Grand Atlas of Regret
**Type:** Artifact (Book)
**Description:** A massive, leather-bound book containing the Anatomist's complete maps of the Colossal Regret's body. The pages are made of a strange, translucent material, and the maps are drawn in blood.
**Mechanics:** A creature who studies this atlas for 1 hour gains a deep understanding of the Colossal Regret's anatomy. They can pinpoint the location of any "wound" (city), "organ" (cavern system), or "nerve ending" (sensitive area). It also contains the "true name" of the Colossal Regret, which, if spoken aloud, can cause it immense pain or, if spoken with love, can soothe it.

### 3. The Dream-Weaver's Loom
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A small, intricate loom made of bone and sinew. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature attuned to this loom can enter the dream-state of the Colossal Regret. While in the dream-state, they can manipulate the landscape, create objects, and interact with the Colossal Regret's memories. They can also "weave" new dreams for the Colossal Regret, replacing its nightmares with peaceful visions. **Curse:** If the user spends too long in the dream-state, they risk becoming trapped there, their own mind merging with the Colossal Regret's.

### 4. The Scab-Priest's Flail
**Type:** Legendary Flail
**Description:** A brutal flail made of rusted iron and barbed wire. It is covered in dried blood and hums with a faint, agonizing pain.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 flail. It deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage. Any creature struck by it must make a CON save or gain a level of "Itch-Corruption." Each level of Itch-Corruption causes a cumulative -1 penalty to all attack rolls and ability checks. At 5 levels, the creature becomes a follower of the Cult of the Great Itch.

### 5. The Core Regret (Orb)
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A single, glowing, pulsating orb of pure, concentrated guilt. It is the heart of the Colossal Regret.
**Mechanics:** The orb cannot be destroyed. If a creature touches it, they are flooded with the "First Mistake" that destroyed the previous universe. They must make a high DC Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 minute and take 10d10 psychic damage. If the orb is "healed" (by a powerful act of forgiveness or self-acceptance), the Colossal Regret will be healed, and the world will be transformed into a paradise. If it is "destroyed" (by an act of ultimate self-loathing), the world will be destroyed.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Empathy
The world is a living being, and its suffering is palpable. This affects all magic and interaction.
*   **Empathic Feedback:** Any spell or action that causes pain to the Colossal Regret (e.g., deep drilling, large-scale construction) causes psychic feedback to the user. The user must make a WIS save or take 1d6 psychic damage per level of the spell/magnitude of the action.
*   **Healing the Planet:** Spells and actions that soothe or heal the Colossal Regret (e.g., planting trees, performing acts of kindness, alleviating suffering) can have a global effect. A successful healing spell on a "wound" (city) might temporarily reduce the frequency of tremors.
*   **Nightmare Manifestation:** The Colossal Regret's nightmares are real. If a character has a particularly vivid or recurring nightmare, it has a chance of manifesting as a physical monster in the world.

### Subsystems: Regret-Corruption and Empathy Score
*   **Regret-Corruption:** Players can gain "Regret-Corruption" by performing actions that cause pain to the Colossal Regret (e.g., deep drilling, building cities in sensitive areas, ignoring its suffering). Each level of Regret-Corruption imposes a cumulative -1 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. At 5 levels, the character becomes a "Regret-Bound" NPC under the DM's control, driven by self-loathing.
*   **Empathy Score:** Players have an "Empathy Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they perform acts of kindness, compassion, or selflessness towards the Colossal Regret or its inhabitants. A high Empathy Score can grant them advantages when dealing with creatures born from the Colossal Regret's dreams or tears. It can also allow them to communicate directly with the Colossal Regret's consciousness.
