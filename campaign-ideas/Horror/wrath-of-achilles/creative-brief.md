## Voice

An epic narrator's voice that tells Homeric tale—formal, grand, measuring words for maximum impact. Speaks in heightened poetic language as befits legendary events. Pacing is rhythmic, almost musical. Tone shifts between celebrating heroic glory, mourning beautiful deaths, and questioning the cost of fame. Accent suggests ancient Greek formality. Role: The voice of epic poetry made speech, singing glory of doomed heroes.
