## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act epic spanning years of siege and glory.

*   **Act I — The Gathering Storm (Sessions 1-6):** Paris' theft of Helen unites Greek kingdoms for invasion. The party arrives at Troy—massive walled city thought impregnable. First battles on beaches and plains. Meet legendary heroes on both sides. Achilles dominates but refuses to fight after insulted by Agamemnon. Realize this isn't glorious war but grinding siege. Gods interfere, taking sides.

*   **Act II — Wrath of Achilles (Sessions 7-13):** With Achilles refusing combat, Trojans push Greeks back to ships. Patroclus wears Achilles' armor to inspire troops, dies at Hector's hand. Achilles' grief and rage return him to battle. Epic duel: Achilles vs Hector outside Troy's walls. Achilles desecrates Hector's body in grief-fueled madness. Party sees glory's dark side.

*   **Act III — The Long War (Sessions 14-19):** More years pass. Heroes die. Party levels up, grows weary. Glory seems less important than going home. Gods continue meddling. Achilles knows prophecy—stay and die with eternal glory, or leave and live in obscurity. Paris kills Achilles with divine help. Both sides exhausted. Stalemate.

*   **Act IV — The Fall (Sessions 20-25):** Odysseus proposes the wooden horse. Party may be inside it or defending against it. Sneaky entry vs heroic siege. Troy falls through deception, not strength. Massacre of royal family. Helen returned. Victory hollow—most heroes dead, cities ruined. Odysseus' journey home begins. Party decides if glory was worth the cost. Final scene shows ruins of proud Troy.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores glory vs life, honor worth dying for, and whether fame justifies cost. It asks: Is being remembered forever worth dying young? Can love justify war? Do gods play with mortals for sport? Is clever victory as honorable as brave defeat? The central conflict pits Greek desire for glory against Trojan defense of home, Achilles' divine rage against Hector's human nobility, and the question of whether this ten-year bloodbath matters or is just gods' game.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Glory & Kleos**
*   Track "Kleos" (glory) earned through heroic deeds
*   High Kleos ensures songs remember you forever
*   Can trade life for Kleos (Achilles' choice) or preserve life at cost of obscurity
*   Post-death, high Kleos characters mentioned in epilogue songs

### 2. **Divine Favor**
*   Gods actively interfere—Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Zeus
*   Party can earn divine favor through worship and deeds
*   Gods provide advantages but expect worship and sacrifice
*   Divine intervention can turn battles but angers opposing gods

### 3. **Epic Duels**

*   Duels follow ritual format with boasts and divine omens
*   Audience on both sides watches and reacts
