### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Tangent Universe**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Troubled teenage adventurers experience visions of Frank the Rabbit warning that the world ends in 28 days. They're trapped in a Tangent Universe—a corrupted timeline that will collapse unless they guide an Artifact back through a portal. One is the Living Receiver who must sacrifice themselves to save both universes, while others must manipulate reality to make this sacrifice possible.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the cosmology of the Prime Universe and Tangent Universes according to "The Philosophy of Time Travel."
    *   Write the history of Roberta Sparrow's time as Living Receiver and how she survived.
    *   Describe the nature of Artifacts and why they appear in Tangent Universes.
    *   Explain the role of Manipulated Living and Manipulated Dead in guiding events.
    *   Detail past incidents of temporal collapse and their effects on reality.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Manipulated Living** (Major): Ordinary people unconsciously guided to create the conditions for the Artifact's return.
    *   **The Manipulated Dead** (Major): Those who die in the Tangent Universe, gaining power to influence events from beyond.
    *   **The Unaware** (Minor): Most of society, oblivious to temporal distortions until the final days.
    *   **Previous Living Receivers** (Minor): Those like Roberta Sparrow who survived or failed their missions.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Frank the Rabbit (Manipulated Dead/harbinger), Roberta Sparrow (former Living Receiver), Gretchen (Manipulated Living), Jim Cunningham (false prophet/corruption).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Suburban Parent" (oblivious authority), "School Authority" (enforces normalcy), "Therapist" (attempts to explain away visions), "Time-Aware Teen" (partially remembers loops).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Bedroom:** Ground zero where the Artifact appears, temporal epicenter.
*   **Roberta Sparrow's House:** Former Living Receiver's home, filled with time travel calculations and prophecies.
*   **The High School:** Social nexus where many manipulation events must occur.
*   **The Golf Course:** Where the Living Receiver experiences sleepwalking visions.
*   **Storm Drain System:** Underground network where temporal energy concentrates.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Countdown reaches zero without Artifact return → **THEN:** Both universes collapse into nothing.
*   **IF:** Living Receiver dies guiding Artifact → **THEN:** Tangent Universe collapses, Prime restored, only dreams remain.
*   **IF:** Reality corruption increases → **THEN:** NPCs experience nightmares, black holes appear, physics fails.
*   **IF:** Time loop occurs → **THEN:** Party retains partial memories, can alter small details.
*   **IF:** Manipulated Dead created → **THEN:** Gain powers to influence events, provide prophecy.
