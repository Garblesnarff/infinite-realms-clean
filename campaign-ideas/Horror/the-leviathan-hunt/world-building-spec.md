## The Leviathan King's Philosophy

### The Ancient Pact (10,000 years ago)
- Surface and ocean civilizations coexisted
- Leviathan King mediated disputes
- Balance maintained through respect

### The Breaking (5,000 years ago)
- Surface nations expanded aggressively
- Overfishing, pollution, hunting leviathans for sport
- King protested, was ignored
- Retreated to sleep, waiting for balance to restore naturally

### The Awakening (Present)
- King wakes to find situation worse
- Leviathans near extinct from hunting guilds
- Oceans polluted, ecosystems collapsing
- Decides surface-dwellers failed to steward properly
- Begins coordinating leviathans to push back surface civilization

### His Ultimatum
**Option 1**: Surface retreat from oceans, leave 75% of sea untouched, cease pollution
**Option 2**: War—leviathans vs. surface world, mutual destruction

### Can He Be Reasoned With?
- Yes, if convinced surface has changed
- Requires: Proof of conservation efforts, alliance with Deepwhisper scholars, party's reputation
- Negotiate: Protected zones for leviathans, limited hunting with quotas, cleanup of pollution
- Alternative: King agrees to sleep again if balance restored

## Crafting System

### Materials by Leviathan Type

**Reaver Shark**
- Teeth → Saw-blade weapons
- Hide → Light armor, water resistant

- Tentacle suckers → Climbing gear
- Ink → Smoke bombs, invisible ink

**Dragon Turtle**

- Claws → Legendary weapons (vorpal quality)

**Legendary Materials** (Moby, King, etc.)

- If killed: Materials craft artifacts of extreme power
- Trade-off: Ecological damage vs. power

## Extended NPC Details

**Captain Mara Tidebreaker**: Lost family to kraken as child, became hunter for protection not revenge; realizes over career that hatred of leviathans was misplaced; wants sustainable future; final act may be reforming guild she built

**Finn Hookhand**: Comic relief hiding trauma; lost arm to kraken but harbor no hate; understands monsters are animals; can communicate party's changing perspective to guild; possible romance option

**Scholar Deepwhisper**: Merfolk who've always lived with leviathans; sees surface hunters as invaders; party's actions determine if they become ally or enemy; holds key to communicating with King

**Admiral Stormwright**: Not cartoonishly evil—genuinely believes monsters must die for safety; lost city to leviathan attack; understandable villain; can be convinced if shown alternative

**The Leviathan King**: Patient, sad, ancient beyond comprehension; sees surface civilizations rise and fall; wants ocean to endure; not malicious but will do what's necessary; if defeated, final words forgive party (they didn't know better)

**Captain Ahab**: Cautionary tale; was good hunter until obsession consumed them; hunts Moby specifically for years; will betray party, sabotage peace, anything for revenge; final confrontation shows what party could become

This campaign explores humanity's relationship with nature through epic monster hunting, asking whether we can coexist with what we fear.
