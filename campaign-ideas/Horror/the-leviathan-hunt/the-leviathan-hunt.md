# The Leviathan Hunt
**Tagline:** *Monster Hunters Beneath the Waves*

## Campaign Overview

The party joins the Tidebreakers—an elite guild of leviathan hunters who protect shipping lanes and coastal cities from the ocean's most dangerous predators. What starts as lucrative contract work hunting giant sharks and aggressive krakens escalates into something far more dangerous. A new breed of leviathan is emerging—larger, smarter, and seemingly coordinated. Ships are disappearing not just attacked but taken. Entire islands evacuated due to siege by organized sea monsters.

Investigation reveals a horrifying truth: Someone is breeding and controlling these leviathans. The party must hunt increasingly dangerous creatures while uncovering a conspiracy that leads to the Leviathan King—an ancient dragon turtle of godlike power who seeks to reclaim the oceans from surface-dwellers by raising an army of monsters. The party will track beasts across the seas, face legendary creatures, build a reputation as master hunters, and ultimately face the choice: Kill the Leviathan King and doom his species to extinction, or find a way to coexist with the ocean's most apex predators.

## Plot Twists

1. Leviathan King isn't villain—surface pollution killing his species, this is desperate defense
2. Admiral funding guild to exterminate leviathans for commercial exploitation
3. Some "monsters" are intelligent, have families, don't want conflict
4. Party member has leviathan blood (distant ancestry), can communicate with them
5. Moby the whale is actually protecting party from worse threats
6. Captain Ahab working with Admiral, wants genocide of ocean life
7. Tidebreakers guild founded by Leviathan King centuries ago to maintain balance, now corrupted

## Victory Conditions

**Hunter's Victory**: Defeat Leviathan King in combat, end coordinated attacks, but ocean remains hostile, future uncertain

**Peacemaker's Victory**: Negotiate treaty between surface and Leviathan King, establish protected zones, balance restored

**Conservationist Victory**: Side with Leviathan King, turn against Admiral's exploitation, reform guild's purpose

**Extinction Victory** (Dark): Hunt every major leviathan to extinction, oceans "safe" but ecologically dead

## Defeat Conditions

**The King's Wrath**: Leviathan King wins, floods coastal cities, surface-dwellers pushed inland
**Hunters Hunted**: Party dies on hunt, never return from deep
**Ahab's Folly**: Obsessed like Ahab, lose humanity in pursuit of perfect hunt
**Ecological Collapse**: Too many leviathans killed, ocean ecosystems fail, everyone loses
