# Walls of Last Hope - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction

### Overall Aesthetic
**Style**: Dark military realism meets gothic horror. Think World War I trench warfare aesthetics combined with medieval walled cities and kaiju body horror. Muted, desaturated colors punctuated by violent splashes of red. Verticality emphasized in every shot.

**Color Palette**:
- **Dominant**: Gray stone, brown earth, faded military greens
- **Accent**: Crimson blood, brass ODM gear, steel blades
- **Sky**: Oppressive overcast, occasional stark blue for false hope moments
- **Titans**: Sickly pink flesh, exposed muscle red, inhuman features

**Lighting**: Harsh and dramatic. Long shadows from walls. Dust particles in light shafts. Bioluminescent glow from Paths sequences. Firelight during night battles. Stark daylight making horror worse, not better.

### Environmental Design

**The Three Walls**
- **Scale**: 50-60 meters tall, smooth surface, impossible to climb without gear
- **Material**: Off-white stone with crystalline sheen
- **Deterioration**: Cracks showing age, moss in places, but structurally pristine
- **Secret**: Faint humanoid shapes visible if you know to look—faces in the wall
- **Districts**: Cities built directly against walls, concentric organization
- Reference: Medieval fortifications meets Berlin Wall, brutalist architecture

**Within the Walls (Human Territory)**
- **Architecture**: Germanic/European 1800s aesthetic, industrial revolution starting
- **Class Division**: Visible poverty in outer districts, opulence in inner city
- **Military Presence**: Constant patrols, recruitment posters, memorials to fallen
- **Atmosphere**: Oppressive order, fragile normalcy over constant dread
- Reference: Napoleonic era cities, Victorian slums, early industrialization

**Beyond the Walls (Titan Territory)**
- **Ruins**: Overgrown cities, nature reclaiming civilization
- **Desolation**: Empty fields that should be farmland, abandoned villages
- **Giant Footprints**: Craters and destroyed terrain marking Titan paths
- **Atmosphere**: Post-apocalyptic silence, beauty and horror coexisting
- Reference: Chernobyl exclusion zone, post-industrial ruins, Ghibli nature

**Marley (Enemy Nation)**
- **Urban**: Industrial military state, smokestacks, ethnic ghettos
- **Technology**: More advanced—trains, early automobiles, machine guns
- **Eldian Internment**: Walled ghetto marked with armbands, dehumanization
- **Atmosphere**: Fascist aesthetic, militaristic, "civilized" evil
- Reference: 1920s-1940s totalitarian states, industrial Europe

### Character Visual Design

**Survey Corps Uniform**
- Distinctive green cloak with "Wings of Freedom" emblem
- Tan jacket and white pants, brown leather ODM gear harness
- Functional but identifies them immediately (target for Titans)
- Worn, weathered appearance for veterans
- Clean and ill-fitting for recruits

**ODM Gear (Equipment)**
- Brass/bronze gas cylinders on lower back
- Leather harness with grappling hooks on hips
- Sword holsters on waist—replaceable blades
- Practical but complex appearance
- Steam/gas venting during use creates visual drama

**Titans (Pure/Mindless)**
- **Proportions**: Uncanny valley—almost human but wrong
- **Sizes**: 3-15 meters (10-50 feet), various body types
- **Features**: Skinless appearance, exposed muscle and teeth, vacant staring eyes
- **Movement**: Jerky, unnatural, disturbing gait
- **Expressions**: Unsettling smiles, neutral faces while eating
- **Variety**: Fat, thin, grotesque variations—individualized nightmares
- Reference: Junji Ito body horror, Francis Bacon paintings

**Titans (Shifters)**
- More aesthetically coherent than Pure Titans
- Unique features identifying them:
  - **Colossal**: Skinless, extreme height (60m), steam emission
  - **Armored**: White plating covering body, more mechanical
  - **Female**: Feminine features, athletic build, blonde hair-like protrusions
  - **Attack**: Determined expression, black hair, lean fighter build
  - **Beast**: Ape-like, fully furred, intelligent eyes
  - Others similarly distinctive

**Character Appearance Evolution**

## Voice Acting Direction

### Commander Erwin Smith
**Voice Profile**: Deep, authoritative, inspiring. Think military leader who commands instant respect.
**Tone**: Measured, strategic, occasional passion breaking through calculated exterior.
**Direction**: Every word chosen carefully. Speeches should inspire even when commanding suicide missions.
**Emotion**: Hides personal obsession behind professional demeanor. Final speech shows true passion.
**Key Lines**:
- "My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!"
- "Give up your dreams and die. Lead the recruits straight into hell."

### Captain Levi Ackerman
**Voice Profile**: Lower register, flat affect, occasional deadpan humor.
**Tone**: Bored-sounding until angered, then cold fury. Never loud.
**Direction**: Understated but menacing. Pauses carry weight. Crude language delivered casually.
**Emotion**: Deep care hidden behind professional distance. Rage is cold, not hot.
**Key Lines**:
- "If you begin to regret, you'll dull your future decisions and let others make choices for you."
- *After violence* "I'm fine. This is just a bruise."

### Hange Zoë
**Voice Profile**: Energetic, higher pitch, rapid speech when excited.
**Tone**: Enthusiastic about terrible things, pragmatic about hard choices.

**Voice Profile**: Starts passionate and raw, becomes cold and detached.
**Tone**:
  - Early: Angry determination, emotional, impulsive

**Key Lines**:
- *Early* "I'll kill them all! Every last Titan!"
- *Late* "I had no choice. To save Paradis, this is what had to be done."

### Reiner Braun (Enemy to Ally)
**Voice Profile**: Splits between confident soldier and traumatized child.
**Tone**: Dissociative—two distinct vocal patterns for split personality.
**Direction**: "Soldier" voice is heroic, strong. "Warrior" voice is dutiful, strained. "Broken" voice is quiet, suicidal.
**Emotion**: Overwhelming guilt, PTSD, desire for death but inability to give up.
**Key Lines**:
- "I'm the Armored Titan. Annie's the Female Titan." *Casual, dissociated*
- "Why did you all have to be good people? Why couldn't you just be monsters?"

- "I can't be the good girl everyone wants. I'll be humanity's ally instead."

### Pure Titans (Non-Verbal)
**Sounds**: Groaning, roaring, almost-words but not quite
**Direction**: Disturbing human quality to inhuman sounds
**Variation**: Each Titan should have distinct vocal signature
**Emotion**: Mindless hunger, but occasional flickers of something that might be suffering

### Announcements/Propaganda
**Voice Profile**: Official, detached, propagandistic
**Tone**: False cheerfulness, authoritarian, dehumanizing
**Examples**:
- "Please remain calm during Titan incursion."

## Atmospheric Direction for DM

### Session Opening
Begin each session with:
1. **Date and Location**: Military precision (Year 850, Trost District, etc.)
2. **Weather**: Often oppressive—overcast, threatening
3. **Casualties**: Mention recent losses, memorial services
4. **Tension Level**: Adjust based on arc—paranoia, grief, determination

### Describing Titans
Always emphasize:
- **Scale**: "It's as tall as the three-story building you're standing in"
- **Horror**: Specific unsettling details (vacant stare, exposed teeth, wrong movements)
- **Individuality**: Each Titan is unique and memorable
- **Sound**: Footsteps shake ground, breathing is audible
- **Uncanny Valley**: Almost human but fundamentally wrong

### ODM Gear Combat

### Emotional Safety
Heavy themes require care:
- **Session Zero**: Discuss tolerance for body horror, graphic death, genocide themes
- **X-Card System**: Allow skipping uncomfortable content
- **Check-Ins**: Regular player comfort checks
- **Debrief**: Process difficult sessions together
- **Boundaries**: Know your table's limits on fascism, war crimes, child soldiers

### Tactical Combat Representation

- **Height**: Use dice or tokens to show elevation
- **Titan Behavior**: Randomly determine targets/movements for mindless Titans

## Final Creative Vision

**Walls of Last Hope** should feel like **war documentary meets monster movie meets political thriller**. The aesthetic is grim and grounded—this isn't heroic fantasy, it's survival against overwhelming odds and impossible choices.

Visual language emphasizes:
- **Scale disparity** creating helplessness and need for cleverness
- **Military aesthetic** grounding fantasy in pseudo-realism
- **Body horror** making Titans genuinely disturbing
- **Verticality** in all combat and exploration
- **Moral grayness** shown through muted colors and harsh lighting

References to channel:
- **Attack on Titan** (obviously)—faithful adaptation of tone and themes
- **World War I/II Films** (1917, Dunkirk)—military horror and sacrifice
- **Kaiju Films** (Godzilla, Pacific Rim)—scale and destruction
- **Political Thrillers** (V for Vendetta)—conspiracy and rebellion
- **Body Horror** (Cronenberg, Junji Ito)—Titans as disturbing, not just dangerous

Ultimate goal: Players should feel **small but significant**, **horrified but determined**, **victorious but at terrible cost**. Every win should raise the question: "Was it worth it?" And the answer should be: "It had to be."
