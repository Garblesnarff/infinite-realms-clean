**Campaign Type / Genre:** Gothic Horror / Moral Philosophy / Tragedy
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **8–10**
**Tone (keywords):** gothic, tragic, philosophical, grotesque, lonely, hubristic, morally ambiguous
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party discovers that a brilliant but reckless mage, Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, has achieved the impossible—creating life from death through forbidden necromancy and alchemy. His creation, a sentient being stitched from corpses and animated by lightning, has escaped and seeks either acceptance into society or revenge against its creator. The party must navigate the moral complexity of hunting a "monster" that may be more human than its creator, while Frankenstein's hubris threatens to unleash even greater horrors.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Complexity:** The "monster" is not evil—it's tragic, eloquent, and desperate. Combat encounters can often be resolved through conversation or compassion.
*   **Investigation:** Tracking the creature requires following clues, interviewing witnesses, and understanding both the creation process and the creature's motivations.
*   **Environmental Challenges:** The campaign moves through treacherous alpine regions, storm-lashed laboratories, and isolated communities.
*   **The Creator's Madness:** Frankenstein himself becomes increasingly unstable and may create more creatures, each more dangerous than the last.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A three-act arc exploring creation, rejection, and the consequences of playing god.

*   **Act I — The Investigation (Sessions 1–3):** The party is hired to investigate mysterious murders in a mountain village. They discover evidence of necromancy and track it to Viktor Frankenstein's isolated laboratory. They meet the creature and must choose: destroy it, help it, or understand it.
*   **Act II — The Creature's Tale (Sessions 4–6):** The creature reveals its tragic story—awakening with no guidance, rejected by all who see it, educated through observation, and driven to violence only after exhausting all attempts at acceptance. The party must navigate both the creature's desperation and Frankenstein's refusal to take responsibility.
*   **Act III — The Final Creation (Sessions 7–10):** Frankenstein, driven to madness by guilt and obsession, attempts to create a companion for the creature—or destroy it permanently. The party must prevent catastrophe, whether from the creature's vengeance, Frankenstein's reckless experiments, or the moral weight of choosing who deserves to exist.

    *   Hook: The party arrives in the alpine village of Waldheim where several people have died mysteriously—their bodies seemingly drained of life force.
    *   The Evidence: Investigation reveals the victims had strong constitutions—the killer seemed to be selecting specific physical traits.
    *   The Trail: Tracks lead up the mountain toward an isolated castle laboratory during a lightning storm.

**Escalation:** A villager's child witnesses something and describes "a giant man, stitched and wrong, crying in the woods."

### Session 2 — "The Castle Laboratory"

*   **Focus:** Exploration / Horror Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Ascent: The party climbs to Frankenstein's castle during a storm, facing treacherous conditions.
    *   The Laboratory: They discover the lab filled with alchemical equipment, stolen corpses, and Viktor Frankenstein's journals documenting his experiments.
    *   The Confrontation: Frankenstein is found, sleep-deprived and manic. He initially tries to drive them away, then breaks down and reveals what he's done.

**Escalation:** The creature itself appears, watching from the shadows. When spotted, it flees into the storm.

### Session 3 — "First Contact"

*   **Focus:** Chase / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Pursuit: The party tracks the creature into the wilderness. It's incredibly fast and strong but also clumsy, clearly still learning its own abilities.
    *   The Cornered Beast: They corner it in a cave. It prepares to fight but then speaks—eloquently pleading for understanding in a deep, pained voice.
    *   The Request: The creature asks only to be left alone, to hide where no one can see its grotesque form. It swears it harmed no one intentionally—it was seeking its creator, trying to understand why it exists.

**Escalation:** Viktor arrives with armed villagers, demanding the party help him destroy his "mistake." The party must choose sides or find another solution.

### Session 4 — "The Creature's Education"

*   **Focus:** Backstory / Moral Philosophy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Tale: If the party protects the creature, it shares its story: awakening in the lab with no knowledge, fleeing in horror from Viktor's screams, learning language by secretly observing a cottage family, reading stolen books (philosophy, history, poetry).
    *   The Rejection: Every attempt to approach humans resulted in terror and violence against it. It tried to save a drowning child and was shot by the father who saw only a monster.
    *   The Question: The creature asks the central question: "If I am a monster because I was made wrong, who is the monster—me or my maker?"

**Escalation:** The creature reveals it killed (accidentally) in desperation and rage, but now only wants one thing: for Viktor to create a companion so it won't be alone forever.

### Session 5 — "The Maker's Guilt"

*   **Focus:** Negotiation / Character Study
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Viktor's Refusal: The party returns to Viktor, who absolutely refuses to create another creature, fearing they would breed and create a race of monsters.
    *   The Evidence: The party can explore Viktor's journals, learning his motivation wasn't noble—it was ego, the desire to conquer death and be remembered as the greatest mind who ever lived.
    *   The Ultimatum: The creature sends a message: create a companion or it will destroy everything Viktor loves.

**Escalation:** The creature begins systematically murdering people close to Viktor—not innocents, but those who funded and supported his research, proving its intelligence and determination.

### Session 6 — "The Bride"

*   **Focus:** Moral Choice / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Agreement: Viktor, broken, agrees to create a female companion but demands the party help him acquire the necessary materials (fresh corpses, rare alchemical components, channeling lightning).
    *   The Process: The party witnesses the horrifying process of creation—this is necromancy pushed beyond all limits, borrowing from the life force of the living, challenging divine order.
    *   The Activation: In a scene of lightning and dark ritual, the second creature awakens—but something is wrong.

**Escalation:** The "bride" is sentient but traumatized by the violation of being created. She rejects the male creature violently. In his rage, the first creature destroys Viktor's laboratory and swears total vengeance.

### Session 7 — "The Monster's Revenge"

*   **Focus:** Protection / Desperate Defense
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Hunt: The creature goes on a rampage, hunting Viktor's remaining family members. The party must protect them while Viktor descends into total breakdown.
    *   The Confrontation: The party faces the creature in combat, but mid-battle it speaks, reminding them of all the rejection and pain it has endured. "You call me monster, but you are the ones who made me this!"
    *   The Choice: The party can fight to kill, try to subdue and imprison, or attempt one last negotiation.

**Escalation:** Viktor, in his madness, has been creating more partial creatures—failed experiments that now animate and attack indiscriminately.

### Session 8 — "The Arctic Exile"

*   **Focus:** Chase / Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Flight: The creature flees far north into frozen wastelands, with Viktor in pursuit, abandoning all reason in his obsession to destroy what he made.
    *   The Tundra: The party must follow through deadly cold, facing environmental hazards and the remnants of Viktor's other failed experiments that have somehow found their way here.
    *   The Confrontation: In the frozen wastes, creator and creation face each other one final time.

**Escalation:** Both Viktor and the creature are dying—Viktor from exposure and exhaustion, the creature from wounds and the fundamental instability of its existence.

### Session 9 — "The Final Question"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Moral Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Duel: If combat occurs, it's brutal and tragic. The creature is immensely powerful but doesn't want to kill its creator—it wants acknowledgment, apology, acceptance.
    *   Viktor's Choice: Viktor must decide: ask forgiveness and accept responsibility, or curse the creature to his dying breath.
    *   The Party's Judgment: The party ultimately decides the fate of both. Kill the creature as a threat? Allow it to live in exile? Try to find a way to give it a true life? What of Viktor's punishment?

**Escalation:** The bride appears, having followed them, and reveals she has learned to speak. She adds her voice to the judgment.

### Session 10 — "What We Leave Behind"

*   **Focus:** Epilogue / Consequences
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Aftermath: Depending on the party's choices, show the outcomes. Did the creature find peace or remain tormented? Did Viktor redeem himself or die cursed?
    *   The Knowledge: Viktor's notes on creating life are recovered. What does the party do with this forbidden knowledge? Destroy it? Preserve it? Use it?
    *   The Question Lingers: A final scene showing that the question of who was the monster—creator or creation—remains unresolved, and perhaps unresolvable.

## Key Locations

1.  **Waldheim Village:** A picturesque alpine village where the deaths occur, showing the contrast between beauty and horror.
2.  **Castle Frankenstein:** Viktor's isolated laboratory filled with alchemical equipment, electrical apparatus, and corpses in various states.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is creation versus responsibility, appearance versus humanity, and who has the right to judge what should exist. The creature is rejected for being grotesque, but it has more humanity than most of its persecutors. Viktor created life but refused to nurture it, parent it, or take responsibility. The party must navigate these questions: Is the creature a monster because it was made wrong, or because it was treated monstrously? Does creating something give you the right to destroy it? Can something created by hubris still deserve life and dignity?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Creature's Eloquence**

*   In conversation, the creature can make Persuasion checks modified by its tragic story. The more the party learns, the harder it becomes to see it as simply a monster to be slain.

### 2. **Moral Alignment Shifts**

*   Player actions toward the creature and Viktor can shift alignment. Showing compassion toward the creature or holding Viktor accountable shifts toward Good. Treating the creature as just a monster shifts toward Evil or Lawful.

### 3. **The Instability**

*   The creature is literally coming apart. It has a "Stability" score that decreases over time and when damaged. If it reaches zero before finding peace, it dies regardless of other factors.

### 4. **Viktor's Experiments**

*   Viktor's other failed creations serve as combat encounters, but they're pitiable—partial things that shouldn't exist, suffering and lashing out. Defeating them feels hollow rather than heroic.

### 5. **The Forbidden Knowledge**

*   If the party studies Viktor's notes, they can learn to create life, but doing so requires moral checks and has consequences. Will they use it to heal or to play god themselves?

### 6. **Environmental Storytelling**

*   Each location the creature has visited shows signs of its passage—broken doors (too strong), stolen books (seeking knowledge), hidden spaces (seeking shelter)—building sympathy without words.
