### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Creature Awakens**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A brilliant but reckless mage has created life from death through forbidden necromancy and alchemy. His sentient creation seeks either acceptance or revenge while the party must navigate the moral complexity of hunting a "monster" that may be more human than its creator.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of necromancy in this world. Why is it forbidden? What natural laws does it violate?
    *   Write about Viktor Frankenstein's academic background. Where did he study? Who were his mentors? What led him to pursue creating life?
    *   Describe the alchemical and arcane theory behind creating life. What components are needed? What is the role of lightning/electricity?
    *   Explain the societal view of corpses and resurrection. How do different religions and cultures in this world view death?
    *   Detail the creature's education through observation. What books did it steal and read? How did it develop philosophy and language?
    *   Write about previous attempts to create artificial life in this world's history. Were there others who tried? What happened to them?
    *   Describe the nature of the soul in this world. Does the creature have a soul? If so, where did it come from?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Creature** (Major - Complex Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** Initially, to understand its existence and find acceptance. Later, to have a companion or exact vengeance.
        *   **Hierarchy:** N/A—it is alone.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be left alone to hide its grotesque form.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Desperately wants connection but fears rejection. Its violence stems from this contradiction.
        *   **Assets:** Immense strength and durability, high intelligence, capacity for learning, immunity to many forms of damage.
        *   **Relationships:** Created by Viktor (who rejects it), feared by all who see it, seeks connection with anyone who will listen.
    *   **Viktor Frankenstein and Supporters** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Initially, to create life and achieve fame. Later, to destroy his creation and erase his mistake.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Viktor leads, supported by his friend Henry Clerval, funded by aristocratic patrons.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Scientific advancement.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Viktor's creation was driven by ego and the desire to conquer death, not altruism. He now wants to hide his failure.
        *   **Assets:** Wealth, scientific knowledge, aristocratic connections, the ability to create more creatures.
        *   **Relationships:** Pursued by the creature, supported by friends and funders who don't know the full truth, hiring the party for help.
    *   **Waldheim Village** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To protect themselves from the mysterious deaths and the "monster."
        *   **Hierarchy:** Village council, magistrate, ordinary citizens.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Safety and normalcy.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some villagers know more than they admit—some may have stolen corpses for Viktor, others may have persecuted the creature beyond reason.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers, local knowledge, pitchforks and torches (literally).
        *   **Relationships:** Fear the creature, don't fully understand what Viktor has done, look to the party for protection.
    *   **The Academy of Natural Philosophy** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To suppress knowledge of Viktor's success—it threatens established doctrines about life and death.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Academic institution with a council of scholars.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Preserve knowledge and advance understanding.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They will suppress Viktor's work to maintain control over necromantic knowledge. They may want his research—or the party—silenced.
        *   **Assets:** Magical resources, authority in academic circles, ability to brand Viktor's work as heresy.
        *   **Relationships:** Viktor was once their star pupil. They now see him as a threat.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Creature:** Eloquent, tragic, powerful, slowly dying from instability, desperate for acceptance, capable of both gentleness and terrible violence.
    *   **Dr. Viktor Frankenstein:** Brilliant, obsessive, cowardly when facing consequences, driven by ego, descends into madness.
    *   **The Bride:** Second creation, traumatized, rejects both Viktor and the first creature, represents bodily autonomy.
    *   **Henry Clerval:** Viktor's loyal friend, moral but enabling, becomes a victim of the creature's revenge.
    *   **The Waldheim Magistrate:** Practical authority figure, fears the creature, has his own dark secrets.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party shows compassion to the creature in Session 3.
    *   **THEN:** The creature becomes a potential ally, sharing information and even protecting the party from Viktor's failed experiments. It desperately wants to believe in their kindness.
    *   **IF:** The party attacks the creature on sight in Session 3.
    *   **THEN:** The creature fights to defend itself but flees rather than killing them. It becomes more dangerous and paranoid, harder to reason with later.
    *   **IF:** The party helps Viktor create the bride in Session 6.
    *   **THEN:** They are complicit in the moral violation. The bride holds them partially responsible. Their alignment may shift.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to help Viktor create the bride.
    *   **THEN:** Viktor attempts it alone, creating a more unstable and dangerous creature. The first creature blames the party for not convincing Viktor.
    *   **IF:** The party destroys Viktor's research before the final act.
    *   **THEN:** The knowledge is lost, preventing future abuses, but Viktor descends into complete madness, having lost his life's work.
    *   **IF:** The party preserves Viktor's research.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where others attempt to replicate his work, creating new ethical dilemmas. The party must decide what to do with this knowledge.
    *   **IF:** The party helps the creature find acceptance (incredibly difficult but possible).
    *   **THEN:** Generate an ending where the creature finds a place in society—perhaps disguised, perhaps among those who can see past appearance. It becomes a tragic hero rather than a monster.
    *   **IF:** The party kills the creature.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an ending exploring the moral weight. Did they slay a monster or murder a thinking, feeling being? Viktor escapes justice, having manipulated them into doing his dirty work.
