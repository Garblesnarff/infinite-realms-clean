**The Black-Eyed Visitors**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Strange children are appearing at doors across the city late at night, asking to be let inside with flat, emotionless voices. Those who look into their eyes see only solid black—no whites, no iris, no humanity. People who invite them in are found the next day changed—emotionless shells with their memories and personalities slowly fading. The players must investigate what these Black-Eyed Children are, why they need to be invited in, and stop them before more victims are claimed.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the urban legend origins of Black-Eyed Children.
    *   Write the history of the entity trying to cross into our reality.
    *   Describe the rules of invitation and threshold magic that bind the children.
    *   Explain the changeling replacement process and the In-Between dimension.
    *   Detail previous incidents and how they were covered up or forgotten.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Victims** (Minor): People who encountered the children but refused entry, now being stalked.
    *   **The Changed** (Major): Changeling replacements, emotionless copies working to create more opportunities for invasion.
    *   **The Researchers** (Minor): Online communities documenting the phenomenon. Some helpful, some compromised.
    *   **The Entity** (Major - Hidden): An extradimensional being trying to cross over using invitation magic.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Black-Eyed Children (multiple), Dr. Evelyn Cross, Father Miguel Santos, Amy Chen
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Changed Victim," "Protective Parent," "Skeptical Authority," "Stalked Witness"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The City:** Modern urban environment where homes become invasion points
*   **Victim Homes:** Ordinary houses and apartments that have become gateways
*   **The Threshold Site:** Central location where reality is thin—the original invitation point
*   **The In-Between:** Pocket dimension where real victims are held in stasis

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A player invites the children in → **THEN:** That player is replaced by a changeling, real player held in the In-Between, party must decide on rescue mission
*   **IF:** Invitation threshold reaches critical mass → **THEN:** The entity begins manifesting physically, reality distortions increase across the city
*   **IF:** Players destroy the Threshold Site → **THEN:** All Black-Eyed Children vanish, changelings collapse, real victims can be rescued from In-Between
