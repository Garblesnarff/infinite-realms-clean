# Creative Brief: The Dusty Gates of Irkalla

## Art Style: Ancient Mesopotamian Desolation

Inspired by Sumerian and Akkadian art, cuneiform tablets, ancient cylinder seals, and archaeological ruins. Everything is ancient, dusty, eroding. Colors: dust browns, shadow blacks, dull golds of ancient artifacts, the absence of vibrant color.

### Core Principles:

*   **Ancient and Eroding:** Everything is incredibly old, crumbling, turning to dust. Nothing is new or alive.
*   **Cuneiform and Cylinder Seals:** Ancient writing, symbolic imagery, showing the immense age.
*   **Feathered Dead:** The deceased wear feathers like birds, a distinctive Mesopotamian underworld image.

## Voice

Ancient and dusty, like someone who's forgotten how to speak for centuries. Formal archaic language. Emotional range from empty resignation to ancient sorrow. The voice carries the weight of humanity's oldest afterlife.

## Music Direction

Ancient Mesopotamian instruments reconstructed: lyre, drums, reed instruments. Drone-heavy, monotonous, hypnotic. Creates oppressive atmosphere. Dust settling as music. Silence is common.

## Sound Design

Dust falling constantly, ancient stone grinding, feathers rustling, wind through ruins, the flow of dark water, cuneiform being carved, the echo of immense age, footsteps in dust that never settles, breathing that's dry and dusty.
