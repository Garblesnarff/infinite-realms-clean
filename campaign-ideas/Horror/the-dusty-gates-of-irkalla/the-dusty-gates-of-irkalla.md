- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Mesopotamian Mythology / Dark Descent / Ancient Horror / Forgotten Realm

- **Player Level Range**: 3-11
- **Tone**: Desolate, Ancient, Oppressive, Dusty, Forgotten

### Core Premise
The players died and descended to Irkalla, the ancient Mesopotamian land of no return. Unlike other afterlives with purpose or variety, Irkalla is simply dust, darkness, and eternal sameness. The dead eat dust, wear feathers like birds, and exist in dreary tedium forever. There is no judgment, no punishment, no reward - just endless dreary existence in the House of Dust. The players must descend through the seven gates (each stripping away something precious), face Ereshkigal the Queen of the Dead in her court, and discover they're part of an ancient pattern - they're not the first to try escaping, but all who try face the same fate. They must break this cycle or accept eternity in dust and darkness.

### Major NPCs

- **Ereshkigal**: Queen of the Dead. **Role**: Tragic Ruler / Antagonist / Prisoner. **Personality**: Bitter, lonely, powerful, trapped in her own kingdom, envies the living, sister to Ishtar. **Flaw/Secret**: She doesn't want to be here either; she rules a realm she hates; was tricked into becoming death's queen; desperately lonely; her anger is centuries of trapped grief.

- **Nergal**: God and consort to Ereshkigal. **Role**: Authority / Potential Ally / Complex Figure. **Personality**: Once a living god who descended and stayed; fierce, protective of Ereshkigal, understands both life and death. **Flaw/Secret**: He chose to stay with Ereshkigal out of love/pride; regrets it sometimes; the only being who ever stayed willingly; might help if convinced.

- **The Seven Gatekeepers**: Guardians of the seven gates. **Role**: Obstacles / Tests / Implacable Forces. **Personality**: Ancient, merciless, follow protocols established when the world was young. **Flaw/Secret**: They're trapped too, bound to their posts eternally; some remember when they were mortal; might be reasoned with if you understand their nature.

- **Namtar**: Ereshkigal's vizier and executioner. **Role**: Enforcer / Messenger / Disease. **Personality**: Embodies plague and natural death, neither cruel nor kind, simply inevitable. **Flaw/Secret**: Follows orders absolutely; if Ereshkigal commanded him to help, he would; actually respects courage in the face of death.

- **Gilgamesh's Shade**: The legendary hero failed to escape death. **Role**: Warning / Guide / Tragic Hero. **Personality**: Still seeking immortality even in death, bitter about failure, has explored every corner of Irkalla. **Flaw/Secret**: He faced the same choice the players will; chose wrong; might help them succeed where he failed; but also might sabotage them out of resentment.

### Key Locations

- **The Seven Gates**: Each gate strips something - clothing, weapons, jewelry, courage, hope, identity, and finally life itself. Must be passed to reach Ereshkigal's throne. Symbolic descent into complete vulnerability.

- **The House of Dust**: Main realm of Irkalla. Everything is dust and shadow. The dead eat dust bread, drink dust water, wear feathers. Eternal tedium. Neither torment nor peace - just existence slowly forgetting itself.

- **Ereshkigal's Dark Throne**: Where the Queen of the Dead sits in perpetual isolation. Court of dust and shadow. The throne room echoes with loneliness. Here all fates are decided.

- **The Ganzer (Netherworld River)**: Dark river that flows through Irkalla. Ancient and terrible. Contains secrets and dangers. Those who drown in it are lost forever, not even dust remains.

- **The Forgotten Archives**: Ancient tablets recording every death since the world began. Contains patterns, prophecies, and perhaps the secret to escape. But guarded and forbidden.

- **The Locked Gate**: A mythical eighth gate that supposedly leads out. Never been opened. All who sought it failed. Its existence might be legend, or Irkalla's greatest secret.

### Central Conflict
Irkalla is a land of no return - the name itself means that. Everyone who dies comes here eventually. The gates strip away all that makes you alive, then you exist in dust forever. The players must navigate this oppressive realm while maintaining will to escape, discover why attempts at escape always fail, and either break the cycle or expose a deeper truth about death's necessity. The central question: is escape from death even possible, or is acceptance the only wisdom? The campaign explores themes of mortality's inevitability, the horror of meaningless existence, whether death can be fought or must be accepted, and what makes undeath worse than life.

### Unique Mechanics

- **The Seven Strippings**: At each gate, players lose something (equipment, abilities, memories, identity traits). Creates increasing vulnerability and desperation. What they lose depends on choices.

- **Dust Sustenance**: Must eat dust and drink shadows to survive. Each consumption makes you more like the dead, less like the living. Creates disturbing survival mechanic.

- **Fading Into Dust**: Track transformation into dust-being. Higher levels mean losing physical form, memories, will. Eventually become indistinguishable from environment. Creates urgency and horror.

- **The Weight of Ages**: Irkalla is ancient beyond measure. Time feels different, oppressive. Players age psychologically if not physically. Creates existential weight.

- **Forgotten Lore**: Ancient Sumerian and Akkadian knowledge is required to navigate. Must learn or remember ancient ways. Creates puzzle and lore challenges.

- **The Pattern of Attempts**: Evidence shows others tried to escape. Players must learn from past failures or repeat them. Creates meta-narrative and investigation.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players discover the truth - escape is possible but requires something unprecedented (sacrifice, convincing Ereshkigal, opening the eighth gate, or proving death itself needs reform). They break the pattern and escape.

**Tragic Victory**: Players learn death cannot be escaped but can be accepted with dignity. They cease fighting and find peace in the dust. Not defeat, but wisdom.

**The Nergal Path**: Convince Ereshkigal to let them stay willingly (like Nergal did). Become her court, changing Irkalla from prison to chosen realm. Paradoxical victory.

**Defeat**: Transform completely into dust beings, forgetting they ever wanted to escape. Join the mindless dead eating dust eternally. True horror - existence without memory or will.

**The Eighth Gate**: Find and open the legendary eighth gate, discovering it leads not out but deeper into mysteries of death. Become something between living and dead, neither state fully.
