### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Xenomorph Protocol**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The mining vessel *Covenant's Fortune* responds to a distress beacon and discovers a derelict ship carrying mysterious eggs. After one hatches and implants a crew member, the party finds themselves trapped aboard their own ship with a rapidly growing perfect predator that bleeds acid and can't be killed through conventional means. Their corporate employers want the creature captured alive, making the party expendable. They must survive using wits, environment, and desperate measures while corporate agents sabotage their efforts.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Xenomorphs: a bio-engineered weapon created by an ancient extinct race called the Engineers, designed to be the perfect organism.
    *   Write the history of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (or fantasy equivalent), their monopoly on space mining, and their ruthless pursuit of bio-weapons for military contracts.
    *   Describe the Xenomorph lifecycle: egg (ovomorph), facehugger, chestburster, adult drone, and the Queen who lays eggs.
    *   Explain the Xenomorph's biological advantages: acid blood, exoskeleton harder than steel, ability to survive in vacuum briefly, perfect predatory instincts.
    *   Chronicle previous encounters: other ships that discovered Xenomorphs, corporate cover-ups, and the "Special Order 937" that designates the creatures as priority acquisitions.
    *   Detail the android's hidden programming: synthetics are programmed to preserve specimens at all costs, even if it means crew casualties.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Crew (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, escape, and expose the corporation's betrayal.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Ship captain, officers, engineers, security—standard crew structure breaking down under pressure.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Complete salvage operations and return safely.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each crew member may have personal debts, family to return to, or secrets they're hiding.
        *   **Assets:** The ship itself (until it's compromised), limited weapons, motion trackers, spacesuits, escape pods.
        *   **Relationships:** Employed by the corporation; betrayed by corporate agents; hunted by Xenomorphs.
    *   **The Xenomorph Hive** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, reproduce, spread, and eliminate threats to the hive.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The Queen at the top, warrior drones protecting the nest, facehuggers seeking hosts.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They are predators and parasites.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Xenomorphs are driven by biological imperative, not malice. They're simply doing what they evolved (or were designed) to do.
        *   **Assets:** Perfect predatory design, acid blood, ability to use vents and dark spaces, rapid reproduction.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to all non-Xenomorph life; serve the Queen; exist symbiotically with their environment.
    *   **Weyland-Yutani Corporation** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Acquire Xenomorph specimens for bio-weapons division at any cost.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Corporate executives giving orders, regional managers like Burke, field agents and synthetics carrying out directives.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Mining operations and space commerce.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Special Order 937 mandates Xenomorph acquisition. Crew expendable. Standard labor laws waived for "strategic assets."
        *   **Assets:** Vast wealth, corporate authority, military contractors, synthetic agents aboard ships, ability to strand or eliminate witnesses.
        *   **Relationships:** Controls the crew through employment; has planted agents; will eliminate survivors to maintain secrecy.
    *   **Colonial Marines (Potential Late-Game)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Secure specimens and eliminate witnesses per corporate contract.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military structure under corporate contract.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Rescue operations.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They're not here to save anyone. Orders are to secure specimens and leave no witnesses.
        *   **Assets:** Military-grade weapons, armor, numbers.
        *   **Relationships:** Work for the corporation; hostile to crew; may be overconfident about the Xenomorph threat.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Ash (The Synthetic):** Science officer android with hidden corporate programming to ensure specimen survival.
    *   **Carter Burke:** Corporate liaison (communicating remotely) who orchestrated the operation and will betray the crew.
    *   **The Xenomorph Queen:** Massive, intelligent, and terrifyingly protective of her brood.
    *   **Captain Sarah Chen:** Ship commander (could be PC or NPC), pragmatic and protective of her crew.
    *   **Chief Engineer Parker:** Gruff, practical, improvises weapons and solutions from ship parts.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Xenomorph Drone" (standard warrior: fast, deadly, uses tactics)
    *   "Facehugger" (small, quick, latches onto faces to implant)
    *   "Chestburster" (small serpentine form, flees to grow)
    *   "Corporate Marine" (heavily armed, follows orders, expendable)
    *   "Infected Crew Member" (time bomb, will birth chestburster)
    *   "Panicked Survivor" (civilian making bad decisions out of fear)

**5. Location Blueprints**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A crew member is implanted by a facehugger.
    *   **THEN:** They have 1d4+4 hours before the chestburster emerges. During this time, they seem fine but may experience discomfort. Generate a countdown and the eventual violent birth scene. This creates a ticking clock and tough choices (quarantine? Euthanasia?).
    *   **IF:** The Xenomorph is seriously wounded and bleeds acid in a critical location (engineering, near the hull).
    *   **THEN:** The acid burns through multiple decks, damaging critical systems. Generate cascading failures: power outages, atmosphere loss, or creating new paths the creature can exploit.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers Ash's betrayal and destroys the android.
    *   **THEN:** They lose access to medical expertise and ship systems the android controlled, but corporate sabotage ends. Generate a dying speech where Ash admires the Xenomorph as "a perfect organism" and calls the crew's survival chances "poor."
    *   **IF:** The party seals off more than 50% of the ship to contain the Xenomorphs.
    *   **THEN:** Living space becomes critically limited. Generate resource scarcity—low oxygen, limited food/water, no safe rest areas. The survivors are forced into ever-smaller spaces.
    *   **IF:** The Queen is killed.
    *   **THEN:** The remaining Xenomorphs enter a frenzy, attacking suicidally with no self-preservation. However, no new eggs are produced. Generate a final desperate assault by the surviving creatures.
    *   **IF:** The party activates self-destruct.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a 10-minute countdown with escalating explosions. The path to escape pods is dangerous and blocked. Create a running gauntlet with environmental hazards and final Xenomorph attacks.
    *   **IF:** The corporate rescue ship arrives before the *Covenant's Fortune* is destroyed.
    *   **THEN:** Generate new threats: corporate marines with orders to secure specimens and eliminate witnesses. The party must now fight or evade both Xenomorphs and humans while proving the corporate conspiracy.
