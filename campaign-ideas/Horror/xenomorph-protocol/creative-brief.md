# Creative Brief: Xenomorph Protocol

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Industrial Sci-Fi Horror (H.R. Giger meets Ridley Scott)

Inspired by the biomechanical nightmares of H.R. Giger and the claustrophobic industrial aesthetic of Ridley Scott's Alien, this style merges cold, utilitarian technology with organic horror. The Xenomorph is a creature of terrible beauty—perfectly designed to kill. The environments are cramped, dark, and hostile.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Biomechanical Fusion:** The Xenomorphs blend insectoid, skeletal, and phallic imagery into something utterly alien yet disturbingly organic.
*   **Industrial Claustrophobia:** Corridors are narrow, ceilings low, pipes everywhere. Characters should feel trapped in a maze of metal.
*   **Chiaroscuro Lighting:** Extreme contrast between harsh industrial lights and absolute darkness. Shadows hide death.
*   **Wet, Dripping Horror:** Everything glistens—condensation on pipes, slime from the Xenomorph, blood and acid.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Survival horror, biomechanical, claustrophobic, industrial, hunted, wet, dark, acid, predatory, desperate.
*   **Feeling:** Trapped in a metal coffin with a perfect killer. Technology offers no comfort—it's cold, harsh, and failing. The creature is beautiful in its lethality, a nightmare made flesh.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** For technology: hard edges, rivets, pipes, industrial grunge. For Xenomorphs: smooth biomechanical curves, elongated proportions, skeletal structure visible through translucent skin.
*   **Textures:** Weathered metal, grime, cables, steam, slime, blood, acid burns.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed illustration of an industrial spaceship corridor. Pipes and cables run along low ceilings. The walls are riveted metal showing wear and tear. Everything glistens with condensation. The lighting is harsh and creates deep shadows."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by cold industrial colors—steely grays, dark blues, harsh whites from fluorescent lights. Warm colors (red, orange) only appear as warning lights, blood, or fire.
*   **Accent Colors:** The sickly yellow-green of acid, the amber of motion trackers, the red of emergency lighting.
*   **The Xenomorph:** Black with hints of blue and green iridescence, like an oil slick.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of cold industrial grays and blues, lit by harsh fluorescent white light and the amber glow of emergency lighting. The only warm color is the red of blood and warning strobes. In the shadows, something black and glistening moves."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Humans in practical industrial workwear—jumpsuits, engineer coveralls, boots. As sessions progress, they become increasingly ragged, bloodied, and desperate.
*   **Xenomorphs:** Elongated humanoid forms with eyeless dome heads, secondary jaws, skeletal structure, long segmented tails ending in blades. Black exoskeleton glistening with slime.
*   **The Queen:** Massive, nearly three times the size of warriors, with a crowned head crest and egg sac.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A desperate crew member in a torn engineer's jumpsuit, holding a improvised flamethrower. Behind them, emerging from shadows, a Xenomorph: elongated black biomechanical form, eyeless domed head, skeletal jaws visible beneath translucent skin, clawed hands reaching, tail curled. The creature's exoskeleton glistens with slime and condensation."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Industrial spaceship interiors—cramped corridors, engineering spaces filled with machinery, cargo holds with shipping containers, ventilation shafts barely large enough to crawl through.
*   **Atmosphere:** Dark, claustrophobic, everything dripping with condensation. Steam vents, flickering lights, the constant hum of failing systems.
*   **Details:** Riveted metal, warning signs, pipe networks, exposed wiring, emergency lockers, motion tracker screens, the Xenomorph's resin coating the walls in infested areas.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The engineering deck of an industrial mining ship. Low ceilings crisscrossed with pipes dripping condensation. Harsh white lights flicker. The floor is metal grating showing the machinery below. Emergency warning lights strobe red. In the distance, a shadowy bipedal form moves through the steam."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Extreme chiaroscuro. Harsh industrial fluorescent lights create stark highlights but leave deep, impenetrable shadows.
*   **Lighting Sources:** Emergency strobes, flashlight beams cutting through darkness, the amber glow of motion trackers, fire, sparking damaged electronics.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates fear through what it doesn't show. The Xenomorph should be revealed in pieces—a tail in light, a silhouette, a flash of teeth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a single swinging emergency light casting wild shadows. A flashlight beam cuts through steam, revealing acid burns on the metal floor. In the darkness beyond the light, two highlights suggest the curve of a biomechanical head. The scene is mostly deep black with strategic highlights."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use narrow aspect ratios to emphasize claustrophobia. Point of view shots looking down corridors. Extreme close-ups of the Xenomorph's details. Over-the-shoulder shots showing the motion tracker with blips approaching.
*   **Techniques:** Frame characters within narrow corridors or doorways. Use environmental details (pipes, cables) to create visual barriers. Show the Xenomorph in pieces or silhouette until the reveal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A first-person perspective looking down a narrow spaceship corridor. Pipes and cables create a claustrophobic tunnel effect. At the far end, silhouetted against emergency lighting, a Xenomorph stands motionless, tail raised, perfectly still. In the foreground, a motion tracker screen shows multiple blips converging on the viewer's position."

## Voice

A tense, urgent female voice with a slight working-class British accent, reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. The tone is that of someone running on adrenaline and fear—clipped sentences, breathing audible between words, the strain of someone pushed to their absolute limit. Early sessions have some dark humor and camaraderie; later sessions are pure survival instinct. Pacing is quick and breathless during action, slower and haunted during quiet moments. Emotion shifts from professional competence to barely controlled panic to grim determination. Audio quality includes environmental sounds—the hum of ship systems, hissing steam, distant metallic clangs, and the terrifying electronic ping of the motion tracker. Role: The sole survivor, recording a log for whoever finds the ship, knowing they probably won't make it but determined to warn others.
