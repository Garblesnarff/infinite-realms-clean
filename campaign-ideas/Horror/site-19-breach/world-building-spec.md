### Containment Procedures for Major SCPs

- Minimum three personnel in presence
- Cell cleaned biweekly (blood and feces accumulate)

**SCP-106 "The Old Man"**
- Containment: Magnetic force field chamber
- Bait protocol: Use of live human sacrifice to lure back (D-Class)
- Pocket dimension: Corrosive, nightmarish, inescapable except by 106's will
- Hunting pattern: Prefers young victims, plays with prey

## Additional Lore and World History

### The Origin of the Foundation

**1883: The Paranormal Industrial Revolution**
- Surge in anomalous phenomena tied to human technological advancement
- Governments begin secret studies of "impossible occurrences"
- Multiple secret societies compete to control anomalies

**1901: The Convergence**
- American Secure Containment Initiative, British Occult Service, and three other organizations merge
- First use of "SCP" designation (originally "Special Containment Procedures")
- O5 Council formed from each organization's leader

**1924: The Insurgency**
- Foundation personnel rebel against ethics violations
- Takes 100 SCPs and significant resources
- Foundation retaliates with assassination campaign
- Cold war between organizations begins

**1945: Post-WWII Expansion**

**2000s: The Modern Era**
- Foundation controls 500+ sites globally
- Estimated 5,000+ contained SCPs
- Masquerade maintained through mass amnestics and media control
- Growing threat: anomalies appearing more frequently

### The Nature of Anomalies (In-World Theory)

**Pataphysics Theory**
- Reality has "layers" like narrative structures
- Anomalies are places where higher narrative bleeds through
- Foundation works to maintain "baseline reality" narrative
- Some SCPs aware they're in a "story" (SCP-3999, SCP-2747)

**The Veil of Normalcy**
- Human consensus reality is fragile
- Anomalies exist because enough people believe reality should work differently
- Foundation suppresses knowledge to maintain consensus
- If everyone knew about SCPs, reality might permanently alter

**The Origins Question**
- Where do SCPs come from?
- Theories: God, evolution, parallel dimensions, future/past time travel, human collective unconscious
- Foundation has no definitive answer
- Some O5s believe Foundation itself creates anomalies through observation

### The Scarlet King Mythology

**The First Demon**
- Primordial entity of destruction and chaos
- Exists beyond normal reality
- Goal: Destroy all of creation and return to void
- Has seven brides and countless children

**SCP-999 Prophecy**
- The Orange Slime is supposedly seventh child
- Prophesied to destroy the Scarlet King
- Foundation doesn't know if prophecy is real
- Kept in comfortable containment "just in case"

**SCP-2317 Connection**
- May be the Scarlet King or his avatar
- Chains represented seven seals of creation
- All are broken; Foundation lies to prevent panic
- Estimated 20-30 years until full manifestation

### Memory, Identity, and Project Memoria

**The Party's True Origin (Gradually Revealed)**
- Each party member volunteered for Project Memoria
- Experimental program to create "perfect anomaly hunters"
- Memory erasure removes trauma, allowing fresh perspective
- Side effect: Also removes identity, relationships, purpose

**What They Were Before**
- Mix of D-Class, junior researchers, and MTF operatives
- Each had reason to volunteer (terminal illness, grief, guilt, desperation)
- Foundation promised them "new life" after service
- Lied: Planned to terminate them after beta test

**Memory Restoration Options**
- SCP-2000 can restore original memories
- SCP-3008 infinite IKEA has memory fragments in merchandise
- Chaos Insurgency has partial files
- Full restoration may be more curse than blessing

### Alternate Dimensions and Parallel Foundations

**Three Portlands**
- Extra-dimensional city-state
- Anomalous beings live openly
- Foundation maintains covert surveillance
- Potential refuge for party

**Alagadda**
- Decadent extra-dimensional city of masquerades
- Ruled by tyrannical Hanged King
- SCP-701 (play) summons its ambassadors
- Reality there operates on narrative logic

**Timeline-B (Chaos Insurgency Victory)**
- Accessible through SCP-507's dimension hopping
- Foundation destroyed, Insurgency rules with anomalies
- World is chaotic but strangely free
- Shows what "liberation" might actually look like

**Timeline-G (Global Occult Coalition Victory)**
- All anomalies destroyed, including helpful ones
- World is "safe" but gray and lifeless
- Magic and wonder extinct
- Shows cost of absolute security

### The Broken Masquerade Scenario

**If the Public Learns the Truth**
- Mass panic, economic collapse, religious upheaval
- Some call for SCP freedom, others for destruction
- Foundation loses funding and authority
- Anomalies increase as consensus reality weakens
- Potential campaign extension into post-revelation world

### Ultimate Mysteries (DM Knowledge Only)

**What is SCP-001?**
- Multiple proposals exist, all might be true simultaneously
- Could be the sun turning hostile, the first anomaly, the database itself, the world ending
- O5 Council doesn't agree on which is real
- May not matter: all are equally terrifying

**Is the Administrator Human?**
- O5-1 has been "alive" for over 100 years
- Appears differently to everyone who sees them
- May be SCP-990 (Dream Man), SCP-343 (God), or something else
- Potentially not bound by normal reality

**The Foundation's True Purpose**
- Publicly: Protect humanity from anomalies
- Secretly: May be preventing heat death of universe
- Darkly: Could be prolonging suffering for unknown reason
- Conspiracy: Might be creating the anomalies it contains

**Party's Actual Purpose (Final Revelation)**
- They were never test subjects
- Project Memoria was to create reality anchors in human form
- Their amnesia makes them "narratively neutral"
- They exist to witness and record, stabilizing reality through observation
- Final choice: Accept role as eternal witnesses or reject and embrace chaos
