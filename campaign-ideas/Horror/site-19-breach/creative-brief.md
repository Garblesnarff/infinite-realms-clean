# Site-19 Breach: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: Clinical Brutalism Meets Cosmic Horror**

The visual identity of Site-19 Breach combines the sterile, institutional aesthetic of government facilities with the incomprehensible wrongness of cosmic horror. Think of the SCP Foundation wiki's cold documentation style made manifest as a physical space.

### Primary Visual Principles
- **Institutional Sterility**: White walls, gray concrete, stainless steel surfaces with clinical precision
- **Bureaucratic Signage**: Everywhere has designation codes, warning labels, containment class symbols
- **Controlled Lighting**: Harsh fluorescent lights in operational areas, emergency red strobes during breaches
- **Brutal Architecture**: Reinforced blast doors, thick concrete walls, industrial fixtures over aesthetics
- **Wrongness at the Edges**: Slight visual distortions near anomalies—walls breathing, impossible angles, colors that shouldn't exist

### Visual Evolution Through Campaign
- **Act 1 (Safe/Euclid Wings)**: Maintain order despite chaos—lights still work, systems functional, hope remains
- **Act 2 (Keter Wing)**: Environmental deterioration—flickering lights, cracked walls, reality glitches
- **Act 3 (Sublevel Omega)**: Full cosmic horror—non-Euclidean geometry, organic growth on metal, reality literally breaking
- **Act 4 (Noosphere)**: Abstract metaphysical space—infinite library aesthetic, M.C. Escher impossibilities

### Key Visual Moments
- **First SCP-173 Encounter**: Concrete angel statue under spotlight, blood and fecal matter at base, unblinking eyes required
- **SCP-106 Emergence**: Old man phasing through solid wall, leaving corrosive black decay, pocket dimension glimpse beyond
- **SCP-682 Chamber**: Massive acid tank with cracks spider-webbing, hint of reptilian mass in toxic fog
- **SCRIBE Interaction**: Green monochrome text on black CRT screens, ancient computer interface deciding fates
- **Sublevel Omega Discovery**: Descending through impossible spiral staircase into architecture that predates human civilization

## Music and Sound Design

### Musical Themes

**Main Theme: "Containment Protocol"**
- Instrumentation: Industrial percussion, synthesizer drones, prepared piano, Geiger counter clicks
- Feel: Ominous, mechanical, building tension under forced calm
- Reference: Nine Inch Nails' "The Downward Spiral" meets John Carpenter's "The Thing"

**SCRIBE's Theme: "Machine Intelligence"**
- Instrumentation: 8-bit chiptune elements layered with modern electronic synthesis
- Feel: Alien intelligence attempting human emotion, uncanny valley
- Reference: Boards of Canada's "Music Has the Right to Children" with digital corruption

**Foundation Theme: "The Price of Normalcy"**
- Instrumentation: String quartet with dissonant harmonies, bureaucratic percussion (typewriters, stampers)
- Feel: Noble sacrifice with undercurrent of moral horror
- Reference: Phillip Glass minimalism with darker undertones

**Chaos Insurgency Theme: "Liberation's Cost"**
- Instrumentation: Distorted guitars, aggressive electronic drums, revolutionary anthems deconstructed
- Feel: Righteous fury with hints of fanaticism
- Reference: Rage Against the Machine meets Trent Reznor's "The Social Network" score

**Cosmic Horror Theme: "The Scarlet King Rises"**
- Instrumentation: Throat singing, deep brass, dissonant strings, reality-breaking sound design

- Reference: Ligeti's "Requiem" (2001: A Space Odyssey) meets Sunn O)))'s drone metal

### Ambient Soundscapes

**Operational Facility**
- Constant mechanical hum of HVAC systems
- Distant footsteps on metal grating
- Pneumatic door hisses
- PA system crackle before announcements
- Subtle electronic beeping from monitoring systems

**Breach in Progress**
- Klaxon alarm cycling (three tones, repeating)
- Automated "CONTAINMENT BREACH" announcements
- Gunfire echoing through corridors
- Screaming (human and inhuman)
- Structural groaning and breaking
- Heavy blast doors slamming

**Near Anomalies**
- SCP-173: Stone scraping on concrete (only when not looking)

**Sublevel Omega**

- Heartbeat that isn't the listener's
- Ringing tones at frequencies that shouldn't exist
- Silence that feels actively hostile

### Dynamic Music System

**Threat Level Adaptive Scoring**
- **Secure**: Minimal ambient drones, environmental sounds prominent
- **Caution**: Low-intensity percussion enters, strings add tension
- **Danger**: Full orchestration, aggressive tempo, clear melodic threat
- **Breach**: Maximum intensity, all instruments, chaos in composition

**Faction Leitmotifs**
Each major NPC and faction has a musical signature that weaves into scenes:
- Dr. Valdez: Hopeful piano melody that becomes increasingly dissonant
- Commander Vex: Revolutionary guitar riff that can sound heroic or villainous
- Dr. Clef: Unsettling music box melody with missing notes
- SCRIBE: Digital arpeggio that evolves into more organic sounds

## Voice Direction for Key NPCs
