# The Unexpected Guardian

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Family Drama / Parenting Slice of Life / Wholesome Growth
- **Estimated Length**: 12-15 sessions (episodic)
- **Player Level Range**: 2-5
- **Tone**: Gentle, Heartwarming, Realistic, Emotional, Wholesome

### Core Premise
The players are adventurers or working adults whose lives change dramatically when they suddenly become responsible for raising a young child – perhaps an orphaned relative, a child of a deceased party member, or a youngster in need. With no parenting experience, they must navigate the daily challenges of childcare, school, cooking proper meals, bedtime routines, and emotional support while maintaining their own lives and growth. The campaign is about unexpected responsibility becoming profound love, learning that caring for someone changes you in the best ways, and discovering that family is what you build together.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Sudden Responsibility (Sessions 1-3)**
- A child unexpectedly enters the players' lives. Initial panic, clumsiness, and overwhelming responsibility. They must quickly learn basics of childcare while processing their own feelings about this dramatic life change.

**Act 2: Growing Together (Sessions 4-11)**
- As players adjust to parenting, they face daily challenges and small victories. The child begins to trust and open up. Players discover unexpected depths in themselves – patience, love, responsibility – while maintaining work and personal growth. The family bonds form gradually and genuinely.

**Act 3: Belonging & Future (Sessions 12-15)**
- The makeshift family faces challenges that test their bond. Perhaps questions of formal adoption, family appearances from the child's past, or the child's fear of abandonment. The players must prove that their commitment is real and permanent, and accept that they've been changed forever by love.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Unexpected Arrival**: A child enters the players' care suddenly – perhaps after a funeral, found alone, or requested by a dying friend. Initial panic and clumsiness. The first night together is both touching and chaotic.
- **Session 2: The First Morning**: Players experience the reality of morning routines with a child – breakfast, dressing, getting to school. Everything takes longer than expected. Small things become challenges but also sweet moments.
- **Session 3: Learning the Basics**: Players seek advice from friends with children, shop for necessities, childproof their home. They're overwhelmed but determined. The child slowly begins to trust them.
- **Session 4-5: School Days**: Managing school drop-off/pickup, helping with homework, meeting teachers, navigating parent-child social dynamics. Players discover they care deeply about the child's happiness and education.
- **Session 6: The First Crisis**: The child gets sick, or has a nightmare, or faces bullying. Players must provide comfort and protection. They realize how much the child means to them.
- **Session 7: Cooking Lessons**: Players learn to cook nutritious meals instead of their usual quick food. Cooking together becomes bonding time. Small domestic moments reveal deep love.
- **Session 8-9: Work-Life Balance**: Players struggle to maintain their careers/adventures while parenting. Compromises must be made. They discover what truly matters to them.
- **Session 10: The Child Opens Up**: The child shares fears, memories, or feelings about their past. An emotional breakthrough in trust. Players offer comfort and make promises about the future.
- **Session 11: Found Family Moments**: Everyday activities – park visits, bedtime stories, eating together – reveal they've become a real family. Love has grown from responsibility.
- **Session 12: Challenges from the Past**: Someone from the child's past appears (relative, legal system, biological parent) raising questions about custody or the child's future.
- **Session 13-14: Proving Commitment**: Players must demonstrate they're a true family, not just temporary arrangement. Legal, social, or emotional challenges test their bond.
- **Session 15: Forever Family**: Resolution of custody/belonging questions. Formal or informal recognition that they're family now. An emotional scene of commitment and belonging. Flash-forward showing their continued life together.

### Major NPCs

- **Rin Rabbit-child**: The young child at the center. **Role**: The Heart / Catalyst for Growth. **Personality**: Initially quiet and wary, gradually opening up, occasionally wise beyond years, innocent but perceptive. **Flaw/Secret**: Fears abandonment due to past losses; tests whether the players will really stay.
- **Kouki Childhood-Friend**: The players' friend with parenting experience. **Role**: Mentor / Support System. **Personality**: Practical, encouraging, offers advice without judgment, supports both players and child. **Flaw/Secret**: Envies how easily the players seem to bond with Rin despite their initial clumsiness.
- **Granny Yukari Nextdoor**: An elderly neighbor who helps and observes. **Role**: Wise Elder / Community Support. **Personality**: Kind but direct, offers traditional wisdom, notices everything, becomes surrogate grandmother. **Flaw/Secret**: Lost her own grandchildren to distance and regrets; sees second chance in Rin.
- **Teacher Reina Classroom**: Rin's teacher at school. **Role**: Outside Observer / Reality Check. **Personality**: Professional, caring about students, concerned about Rin's situation, gradually approving of players' efforts. **Flaw/Secret**: Struggled with her own decision to choose career over having children; questions if she made right choice.

### Key Locations

- **The Home**: Players' residence transformed gradually into a family space – child's room, kitchen with scheduled meals, living room with toys, evidence of shared life.
- **The Elementary School**: Where Rin spends days and players experience parent responsibilities – pickup lines, teacher meetings, school events.
- **The Neighborhood Park**: A regular destination for play and bonding, becoming a special place for the family.
- **The Family Restaurant**: A modest place where they often eat together, marking special occasions and everyday moments alike.

### Central Conflict
The internal struggle of accepting profound responsibility and vulnerability that comes with caring deeply for someone. It's about learning that love means sacrifice, that parenting changes you, and that family is built through daily choices, not just biology.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Bonding Track & Daily Moments**: The campaign uses a "Family Bonding" track (0-100) that increases through everyday care activities, emotional breakthroughs, and keeping promises to the child. High bonding provides mechanical benefits – the child cooperates, players feel fulfilled, challenges are easier to face together. Players accumulate "Parenting Points" through successful care, learning from mistakes, and small daily victories. These can be spent to: automatically succeed at parenting challenges, trigger heartwarming bonding scenes, unlock important conversations, or provide comfort during crises. The DM should emphasize that parenting isn't about grand gestures but daily presence – making meals, bedtime routines, listening to small problems, showing up consistently. Each session should include at least one quiet domestic scene focused on relationship building. The campaign measures success not by combat or achievement but by the strength and authenticity of the family bond formed.
