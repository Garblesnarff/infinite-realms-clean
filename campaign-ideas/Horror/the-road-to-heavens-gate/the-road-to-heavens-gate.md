## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Cosmic Stakes:** The party is caught between Heaven, Hell, and powers beyond both.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** No faction is purely good. Angels are cruel bureaucrats, demons are pragmatic, humans are complicated.
*   **Extreme Violence:** The campaign features brutal combat and dark humor about violence.
*   **Unstoppable Antagonist:** The Saint of Killers cannot be defeated, only delayed.

## Major Session Beats

*   Establishing the party's quest to find God and demand accountability for Creation's suffering.
*   Introducing the Saint of Killers—an undead gunslinger who cannot miss and cannot be killed.

### Late Sessions — "Alamo"
*   Making a stand against overwhelming forces.
*   The Saint catches up—cannot be defeated, only survived.
