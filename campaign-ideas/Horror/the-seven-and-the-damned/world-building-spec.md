# World-Building Specification Brief: The Seven and the Damned

**Core Concept:** Players are ordinary people fighting superhero"Supes"—who are actually corporate-controlled monsters. Vought Corporation creates Supes through Compound V experimentation, then markets them as heroes while covering up atrocities. The party uses Compound X weapons, blackmail, and ultraviolence to expose Vought and kill Supes, knowing they're becoming villains themselves. The campaign explores power corrupting absolutely.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Vought Corporation—mega-corp that creates Supes through Compound V injections into babies.
*   The Seven—most powerful Supe team, beloved by public, monstrous in reality.
*   Compound V—serum granting superpowers through human experimentation.
*   Compound X—anti-Supe substance that grants temporary powers to ordinary humans.

**Factions:**
*   **Vought International:** Corporation controlling Supes, massive PR machine, above the law.
*   **The Seven:** Most powerful Supes—Homelander (flight/lasers), Queen Maeve (strength), A-Train (speed), etc.
*   **The Boys:** Anti-hero vigilantes (the party) using violence and blackmail to fight Supes.
*   **Public Opinion:** Manipulated by Vought, slowly turning against Supes as evidence emerges.

**Locations:**
*   **Vought Tower:** Corporate headquarters, Supe residences, PR machine.
*   **The Basement:** Party's safe house, evidence storage, planning room.
*   **Vought Labs:** Human experimentation sites, Compound V production.
*   **Public Spaces:** Where Supes perform staged heroics while committing crimes.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party kills a Supe publicly, THEN Vought brands them terrorists, turning public against them.
*   IF the party exposes Compound V, THEN Congressional hearings begin, Vought's power weakens, but Homelander becomes unhinged.
*   IF the party uses Compound X repeatedly, THEN addiction and personality changes occur—becoming what they fight.
