# Creative Brief: The Seven and the Damned

## Art Style: Corporate Superhero Satire (The Boys meets Watchmen)

Inspired by contrast between polished corporate branding and ultraviolent reality. Colors are bright corporate branding (reds, blues, golds for Supes) versus gritty realism (blood, dirt, urban decay for the party). Character designs emphasize this: Supes in spandex costumes with perfect hair versus ordinary people in tactical gear covered in blood. Lighting shows sterile corporate environments versus grimy safe houses. Style emphasizes satire, violence, and moral degradation.

### Core Principles:

*   **Corporate Polish vs Gritty Reality:** Shiny Supes versus bloody vigilantes.
*   **Ultraviolence:** Gore, brutality, consequences of superhuman fights.
*   **Satire:** Mocking superhero tropes and corporate culture.

## Voice

A voice with working-class British accent (Cockney)—aggressive, profane, darkly humorous. The cadence is sharp, angry, with frequent swearing. Emotion ranges from rage (when discussing Supes) to grim satisfaction (when killing them) to exhausted cynicism (when questioning if it's worth it). Audio quality is raw, like recorded on phone. Role: An angry vigilante issuing threats, planning an attack, or delivering a profanity-laden speech about why Supes need to die.
