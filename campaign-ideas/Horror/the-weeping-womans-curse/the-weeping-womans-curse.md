Local legends speak of La Llorona, the Weeping Woman—a ghost cursed to wander riversides searching for the children she drowned in a moment of madness and rage.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A tragic investigation into grief, vengeance, and curses that span generations.

*   **Act I — The Weeping by the River (Sessions 1–4):** Children disappear near rivers and streams. Witnesses hear weeping and see a woman in white. The players encounter La Llorona but cannot stop her from taking another child. They must understand her curse to fight her.
*   **Act II — Unquiet Waters (Sessions 5–9):** The party uncovers La Llorona's true history—she was a real woman driven to madness by tragedy and betrayal. Her curse is tied to an injustice that was never resolved. More spirits connected to her past appear, making the situation more complex.
*   **Act III — Breaking the Curse (Sessions 10–15):** The players discover that freeing La Llorona requires either helping her accept her children's deaths and move on, or confronting the entity that cursed her in the first place—a darker spirit that feeds on her eternal grief. The choice will determine whether she finds peace or remains a vengeful ghost.

    *   **Personality:** Tragic, vengeful, and tormented. In moments of clarity, she's horrified by what she does but cannot stop.

    *   **Role:** The true villain—an ancient entity that feeds on grief and suffering, which cursed María and keeps her bound.
    *   **Personality:** Manipulative, patient, and sadistic. It appears as shadows and whispers.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of motherhood, grief, betrayal, and the cycles of vengeance. The central conflict is deciding whether La Llorona deserves redemption or must be destroyed, and whether the players will confront the true evil behind the curse.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Weeping's Call**
*   Children and those who are emotionally vulnerable must make **Wisdom saving throws** when they hear La Llorona's weeping.
*   Failure means they feel compelled to approach the water.
*   The save DC increases based on:
    *   Proximity to water
    *   Personal grief or loss
    *   Being alone
    *   Darkness

### 2. **Spirit Interaction**
*   La Llorona cannot be killed by conventional means—she's already dead.
*   She can be temporarily banished through:
    *   Sacred symbols and blessed water
    *   Protective chants learned from Father Tomás
    *   Iron barriers (keeps her at bay)
    *   Genuine prayers from mothers
*   To permanently resolve the curse, players must address its source.

### 3. **The Children's Spirits**
*   Rosa can help the players communicate with María's original children's spirits.
*   These spirits can provide:
    *   Information about what really happened
    *   Assistance in confronting their mother with truth
    *   Power to temporarily calm La Llorona
*   But using them risks binding them to this world permanently.

### 4. **Breaking the Curse**
*   Players can choose multiple approaches:
    *   **Redemption Path:** Help María remember the truth, reunite her with her children's spirits, break the Dark Spirit's hold, allow her to move on (bittersweet good ending)
    *   **Binding Path:** Perform a ritual to permanently trap La Llorona, preventing harm but not freeing her (pragmatic ending)
    *   **Confrontation Path:** Destroy the Dark Spirit, which frees María but leaves the entity seeking a new host (risky good ending)
    *   **Exposure Path:** Force the Córdova family to break their pact, but this may unleash other consequences (complex ending)
