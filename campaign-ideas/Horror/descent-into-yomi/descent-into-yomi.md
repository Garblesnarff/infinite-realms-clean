- **Tone**: Dark, Defiling, Desperate, Horrific, Tragic

### Core Premise
The players died and descended into Yomi, the Japanese land of the dead - a realm of eternal darkness, decay, and pollution (kegare). Unlike other afterlives with judgment or purpose, Yomi is simply where the dead rot eternally. The players must escape before they decay too far to leave, navigating a labyrinthine underworld of darkness and filth while pursued by Izanami, the death goddess who refuses to let anyone leave her realm. They'll face yokai born from corruption, fellow dead who've lost all hope, and the ultimate horror: seeing what they're slowly becoming. The campaign is a desperate race against decay itself.

### Difficulty Context: **High**
This is survival horror in D&D form. Resources are scarce, light is precious, and the environment itself drains life. Players accumulate "pollution" that limits abilities and attracts dangers. Combat should often be avoided in favor of stealth and clever escape. The campaign is intentionally oppressive - players should feel the weight of Yomi's darkness.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Descent (Sessions 1-5)**
- Players wake in darkness, their bodies already showing signs of decay. They learn they're in Yomi from other confused dead. They must find light sources, navigate the darkness, and search for the exit while avoiding the Yomotsu-shikome (hags of Yomi) and understanding the pollution mechanic. They hear Izanami's voice in the darkness, claiming them as her eternal subjects. They must descend deeper into Yomi to find the path that leads up and out.

**Act 2: The Land of Pollution (Sessions 6-12)**
- Deeper in Yomi, players encounter the Peach Tree Guardians, spirits who can slow their decay temporarily. They learn the truth: Izanami blocks the exit, refusing to be abandoned again (referencing her mythological abandonment by Izanagi). The players must gather three sacred items that can repel pollution long enough to reach and pass Izanami: the Peach of Purification, the Comb of Separation, and the Boulder of Sealing. Each quest takes them through different regions of Yomi's horror.

**Act 3: The Confrontation (Sessions 13-16)**
- With the sacred items, players make their final push toward the exit. Izanami hunts them personally, her form horrifying and tragic. They must decide: fight their way past her (nearly impossible), convince her to let them go (requires understanding her pain), or seal her behind the boulder like in mythology (cruel but effective). The escape is a desperate chase through darkness as Yomi itself collapses behind them.

**Act 4: The Return (Sessions 17-18)**
- Having escaped Yomi, players discover they're changed - carrying pollution back to the living world. They must undergo purification rituals (reminiscent of Izanagi's purification) to truly return to life or face becoming permanent bridges between life and death. Their choices about Izanami affect what hunts them in the living world.

### Major NPCs

- **Izanami-no-Mikoto**: Goddess of death and creation, ruler of Yomi. **Role**: Tragic Antagonist / Hunter / Lonely Goddess. **Personality**: Once beautiful creator goddess, now rotting corpse-queen, desperate for companionship, refuses abandonment, tragic and terrifying. **Flaw/Secret**: Not evil, just infinitely lonely; every soul that escapes wounds her; was abandoned by her husband Izanagi who fled when seeing her decayed form; her rage is grief manifesting as possession.

- **The Peach Tree Guardian**: Ancient spirit who grows purifying peaches. **Role**: Ally / Guide / Living Memory. **Personality**: Wise, sad, remembers when Yomi wasn't always this way, helps those trying to escape out of defiance against Izanami. **Flaw/Secret**: Is actually a piece of Izanami's original pure self, separated when she died; helping souls escape is her rebellion against what she became.

- **The Yomotsu-shikome**: Hags of Yomi, Izanami's servants. **Role**: Hunters / Obstacles / Tragic Victims. **Personality**: Once beautiful women, now rotting witches, hunt the living and escaping dead, serve Izanami out of fear and hopelessness. **Flaw/Secret**: Remember being human; some might be convinced to help if offered hope of escape; their existence is punishment for failing to escape themselves.

- **The Thousand-Warriors**: Ancient soldiers who died and have become partially integrated with Yomi. **Role**: Obstacles / Information / Warning. **Personality**: Stoic, resigned, exist more as obstacles than people, warn players about decay. **Flaw/Secret**: Were sent to block Izanagi's escape in mythology; have been stationed here for thousands of years; barely remember being human.

- **The Recently Dead**: Souls who arrived shortly before the players. **Role**: Companions / Victims / Warnings. **Personality**: Vary from desperate to resigned, decay at different rates, some try to escape, others give up. **Flaw/Secret**: Watching them decay faster shows players their potential fate; some become dangers as they lose humanity.

- **The Comb Spirit**: Imprisoned spirit of separation. **Role**: Quest Goal / Magical Item / Memory. **Personality**: Remembers Izanagi throwing it to create bamboo shoots and delay pursuit; represents separation and loss. **Flaw/Secret**: Using it to escape means rejecting Izanami completely; it's a tool of abandonment.

- **Amaterasu's Messenger**: A small light-spirit that followed the players into death. **Role**: Light Source / Hope / Divine Interest. **Personality**: Silent, persistent, provides the only reliable light, represents the sun goddess's interest in the players. **Flaw/Secret**: Cannot survive long in Yomi; dims gradually; its death would leave players in absolute darkness.

### Key Locations

- **The Threshold of Darkness**: Where players wake. Still close to the living world, less corrupted. Darkness is near-absolute. Other confused dead wander. This is the last place that feels like escape might be possible. The decay is subtle here, easy to ignore.

- **The Labyrinth of Bones**: Twisting passages made of ancient bones. Easy to get lost. Yomotsu-shikome hunt here. Finding the correct path requires navigation and courage. Bones whisper the stories of their deaths. The pollution grows thicker.

- **The Peach Grove**: Impossible light in Yomi's darkness - a grove of purifying peach trees that shouldn't exist. The Guardian dwells here. Temporary sanctuary where decay halts. Beautiful but tragic - these trees came from peaches Izanagi threw while fleeing his wife.

- **The Palace of Rot**: Izanami's domain, a grotesque parody of heaven. Once beautiful halls now crumbling with decay. Maggots and rot everywhere but arranged in elegant patterns. Izanami holds court here, both tragic queen and horror. This is where truth about her loneliness is revealed.

- **The River of Pollution**: Separates upper and lower Yomi. Black water that accelerates decay. Must be crossed but touching it means rapid corruption. Contains bloated corpses and worse things. The sound is wrong - like crying.

- **The Boulder Pass**: The mythological exit where Izanagi sealed Yomi with a massive boulder. The boulder has been moved aside (Izanami can leave when she chooses), but she guards this passage personally. Narrow, dark, climbing upward toward the living world. Final confrontation location.

- **The Fields of Decay**: Vast open areas in Yomi where the long-dead have become landscape. Bodies merged with ground. This is the ultimate fate of those who don't escape - losing individual existence, becoming part of Yomi itself. Horrifying reminder of stakes.

### Central Conflict
Players are trapped in Yomi, racing against their own decay. The environment itself is the enemy - darkness, pollution, the slow rot of existence. Izanami hunts them not from evil but from desperate loneliness, refusing to be abandoned again. The players must gather tools to escape while staying human enough to want to. The central tension is between the horror of Yomi and the tragedy of Izanami - she's a villain and victim simultaneously. The campaign explores themes of decay and purity, abandonment and connection, the horror of death without transcendence, and whether those trapped in darkness have the right to trap others.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Pollution (Kegare) Accumulation**: Everything in Yomi pollutes. Track pollution points. High pollution causes mechanical penalties, attracts Yomi's creatures, limits magical abilities (connected to purity), and causes physical decay. Purification is difficult but possible. Creates desperation and resource management.

- **Decay Stages**: Characters visibly decay. Stage 1 (fresh death, minor discoloration), Stage 2 (pallor, minor rot), Stage 3 (visible decomposition, missing parts), Stage 4 (barely human, mostly corpse), Stage 5 (integrated with Yomi, NPC now). Each stage makes escape harder. Visual horror with mechanical consequences.

- **Light is Life**: Darkness in Yomi is absolute. All light sources are precious. Magical light requires resources. The Messenger provides limited light. In complete darkness, players can't see dangers, navigation is impossible, and decay accelerates. Managing light is crucial.

- **Sound Navigation**: In absolute darkness, players must navigate by sound. Yomi has distinctive audio landscape - dripping, whispers, Izanami's voice, the scratch of yomotsu-shikome. Perception checks replace sight. Creates tense, blind navigation sequences.

- **The Peach of Purification**: Limited-use magical fruit that reduces pollution and halts decay temporarily. Must be rationed. Creates desperate decisions about when to use precious resources.

- **Izanami's Awareness**: As players move through Yomi, Izanami becomes increasingly aware of them. Track her attention level. High levels mean she hunts personally. Stealth and distraction can reduce awareness. Boss fight is avoidable if clever.

### Plot Twists and Complications

- **We Didn't Just Die**: Players discover they were specifically sent to Yomi by someone in the living world. Their deaths weren't accidental. Someone wanted them in hell. This recontextualizes everything.

- **Izanami Isn't Lying**: Her claims about Izanagi abandoning her when he saw her decay are true. She reached out to her husband and he fled in horror, sealing her in darkness forever. Her motivation is sympathetic even while her actions are horrifying.

- **The Guardian's Identity**: The Peach Tree Guardian is Izanami's original pure self, split off when she became the rot-queen. Helping it means helping Izanami in a way, but also means there's redemption possible.

- **Some Chose to Stay**: Not everyone in Yomi is trapped. Some dead, tired of life's burdens, chose to accept decay and rest. They oppose escape attempts, believing death should be final. They're not wrong, just different.

- **The Living World is Worse**: If players escape and return, they might find the living world has become corrupt or dangerous in their absence. Yomi's honest horror might be preferable to the living world's hidden rot.

- **Yomi Followed Them**: Pollution can't be entirely cleansed. Players who escape carry Yomi's taint, seeing spirits, attracting yokai, existing between worlds. They're changed permanently.

- **Izanami Offers a Deal**: She'll let one player escape if the others stay. Forces terrible choice about sacrifice and survival. Who deserves to live most?

- **The Exit is a Lie**: The boulder passage isn't the real exit. It's a test. The true escape is accepting death, reconciling with Izanami, and being reborn properly. Fighting makes it worse.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players gather all sacred items, purify themselves sufficiently, and either convince Izanami to let them go or successfully seal her. They escape Yomi with minimal pollution, undergo proper purification rituals, and return to life changed but intact. Izanami's loneliness is addressed.

**Partial Victory**: Players escape but at cost - some didn't make it, pollution remains significant, Izanami hunts them in the living world, or they're trapped between life and death. They're alive but not whole.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Players escape by sealing Izanami cruelly, perpetuating the cycle of abandonment. They survive but condemn her to eternal loneliness. The moral cost is high. They're haunted by what they did.

**Defeat**: Players decay to Stage 5, losing humanity and becoming part of Yomi. They exist as NPCs, obstacles for future escape attempts, warnings of failure. Alternatively, they accept death and stop trying to escape, finding peace in finality.

**Tragic Victory**: Players help Izanami confront her grief and loneliness. She lets them go not because they defeated her but because she chooses to release them, breaking her cycle of possession. They escape but Yomi remains, and she remains alone. Bittersweet ending where everyone gets what they need but not what they want.
