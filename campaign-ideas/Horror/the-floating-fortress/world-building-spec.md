### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Floating Fortress**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party awakens trapped inside Aincrad, a massive floating fortress of 100 floors, each more deadly than the last. They cannot log out, cannot leave, and if their bodies die here, they die in the real world—their souls are bound by necromancy. The only way out is up: fight through each floor's challenges and bosses until reaching Floor 100 and confronting the mad archmage Kayaba who imprisoned them all.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Archmage Kayaba's background: a brilliant wizard obsessed with creating a "true" fantasy world, who discovered forbidden necromantic rituals to bind souls to magical constructs.
    *   Write the history of Aincrad's creation: how Kayaba built the floating fortress over decades, embedding it with reality-warping magic and populated it with increasingly deadly monsters.
    *   Describe "The Trapping"—the day 10,000 adventurers were lured to Aincrad under false pretenses and had their souls bound to the fortress.
    *   Explain the structure of the 100 floors: each floor is a unique biome and challenge, growing progressively more dangerous and reality-warping as one ascends.
    *   Detail the early days: the chaos, deaths, despair, and eventual organization of the survivors into clearing guilds.
    *   Write the legend of the beta testers: a group who had entered Aincrad briefly before The Trapping and possess valuable knowledge.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Knights of the Blood Oath** (Major - Clearing Guild)
        *   **Goals:** Clear floors systematically and safely, minimize deaths, eventually beat the game.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military structure led by Heathcliff, with Asuna as second-in-command.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are humanity's best hope, the strongest fighters organized for maximum efficiency.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Heathcliff uses the guild to control the pace of clearing—he wants his "game" to last.
        *   **Assets:** Best equipment, largest membership, dedicated scouts, Floor 55 headquarters.
        *   **Relationships:** Respected by most, resented by some for their elitism, opposed by Laughing Coffins.
    *   **The Army** (Major - Clearing Guild)
        *   **Goals:** Clear the game through overwhelming force and strict military discipline.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Strict rank structure led by General Kobatz.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Discipline and order will get us through this.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Leadership hoards rare items and prioritizes their own survival.
        *   **Assets:** Large numbers, coordinated tactics, Floor 1 presence.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrusted for their harsh methods, competitive with Knights of the Blood.
    *   **Laughing Coffins** (Minor - Player Killer Guild)
        *   **Goals:** Murder other players for items, wealth, and the thrill of it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose hierarchy led by PoH, with various sadistic lieutenants.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they operate in secret.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** PoH believes if they kill enough people, Kayaba will reward them with freedom.
        *   **Assets:** Ambush tactics, fear, knowledge of isolated hunting grounds.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by everyone, feared universally.
    *   **The Merchants** (Minor - Economic Guild)
        *   **Goals:** Profit from the death game by controlling trade and rare resources.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Council of wealthy players.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We provide essential services and keep the economy stable.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They manipulate prices and hoard resurrection items (if any exist) to maintain power.
        *   **Assets:** Wealth, shops in every safe zone, information networks.
        *   **Relationships:** Necessary but disliked, neutral with most factions.
    *   **Solo Players** (Minor - Independents)
        *   **Goals:** Survive on their own terms, avoid guild politics and obligations.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None—each player for themselves.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We don't need guilds to survive.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many are traumatized and can't trust others, hiding pain behind independence.
        *   **Assets:** Flexibility, specialized skills, ability to act without consensus.
        *   **Relationships:** Viewed as either admirable or foolish, sometimes recruited by guilds.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A floor boss is defeated.
    *   **THEN:** The next floor becomes accessible. Generate celebration scenes, memorial services for those who died, tension about the next challenge, and distribution of rare boss loot.
    *   **IF:** A party member or important NPC dies.
    *   **THEN:** Their name gets crossed off the Monument of Life. Generate mourning scenes, eulogies, impact on other NPCs who knew them, and potential succession or revenge plots.
    *   **IF:** The party encounters Laughing Coffins and survives.
    *   **THEN:** They become targets for revenge. Generate ambush attempts, warnings from allies, and moral dilemmas about hunting the player-killers preemptively.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers Heathcliff's invincibility secret.
    *   **THEN:** Generate confrontation scenes, Kayaba revealing himself, other NPCs' reactions (disbelief, anger, fear), and the acceleration toward the final battle.
    *   **IF:** The party befriends Yui and discovers she's an AI.
    *   **THEN:** She can access system information, reveal Kayaba's location, and provide tactical advantages—but may face deletion by the system's anti-virus protocols, creating an emotional rescue mission.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to stay in safe zones rather than push forward.
    *   **THEN:** Generate time-passage consequences: other guilds take the glory, more players die to random encounters, resources become scarcer, and guilt from NPCs who are still fighting.
