# Creative Brief: The Shattered Perspectives

## Art Style: Analytical Cubism (Picasso / Braque-inspired)

Visual aesthetic embodying multiple simultaneous viewpoints, geometric fragmentation, and the breakdown of three-dimensional form into angular, overlapping planes.

### Core Principles:
- **Multiple Viewpoints Simultaneously**: Show front, back, sides, top, bottom all at once
- **Geometric Reduction**: Complex forms broken into cubes, spheres, cones, cylinders
- **Monochromatic Palette**: Browns, grays, ochres - subdued colors emphasizing form over color
- **Overlapping Planes**: Surfaces intersect and overlap, creating impossible geometries
- **Fragmented Reality**: Objects shattered across perspectives, reassembled in single image

### Visual Direction:
Objects should appear as if viewed through a prism and reassembled - all angles visible simultaneously. Faces show profile and frontal view merged. Bodies are geometric assemblages. Space itself fragments into angular planes.

## Music: Atonal / Serialist / Polyrhythmic
- Composers: Schoenberg, Webern, Stravinsky (Rite of Spring era)
- Multiple rhythms simultaneously, no tonal center, geometric structure in composition
- Instruments layered in competing perspectives

## Voice Acting:
Characters speak from multiple perspectives simultaneously - voices overlapping, finishing each other's sentences, contradicting themselves coherently.
