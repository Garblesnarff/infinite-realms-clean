### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Iron Prayer**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In a world of industrialized magical warfare reminiscent of World War I, the party are elite battle mages in the Imperial Army who receive mysterious blessings from a divine entity called Being X after a near-death experience. As they rise through military ranks during the brutal Great Continental War, they must survive horrific battles, navigate military politics, and unravel why the gods have made them pawns in a cosmic game to prove mortals need divine guidance.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the political history leading to the Great Continental War. What alliances formed? What territorial disputes sparked the conflict?
    *   Write the complete technological and magical history of computation orbs—the devices that allow mages to fly and enhance combat magic.
    *   Describe the theology of Being X. What is this entity? Where does it come from? What does it truly want?
    *   Explain the military doctrine of aerial mage warfare. How did it develop? What are the tactics and formations used?
    *   Chronicle the history of the Empire—its founding, expansion, and current political structure under military leadership.
    *   Detail the Republic's revolutionary history and why it opposes the monarchical Empire.
    *   Describe the Federation—its vast size, endless manpower, and strategic challenges.
    *   Explain how magic integrates with military technology in this world—magical artillery, enchanted fortifications, computation-enhanced strategy.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**

    *   **IF:** The party increases their Divine Favor through ruthless victory.
    *   **THEN:** Being X grants enhanced powers and praises them. However, their troops begin to fear them as fanatics. Viktoria's faith strengthens while Lehrgen's suspicion deepens.

    *   **IF:** The party decreases Divine Favor by showing mercy or questioning Being X.
    *   **THEN:** Divine blessings weaken. Being X appears to chastise them. However, their troops respect them more as compassionate leaders. Viktoria begins to doubt while Lehrgen becomes a potential ally.

    *   **IF:** The party executes the deserter in the side quest.
    *   **THEN:** Battalion morale drops but discipline increases. Being X approves. The party gains reputation as harsh but effective. Sergeant Hauer becomes distant.

    *   **IF:** The party spares the deserter.
    *   **THEN:** Battalion morale improves but discipline suffers. Being X disapproves. The party gains reputation as merciful. Sergeant Hauer becomes loyal. Risk of more desertions.

    *   **IF:** The party defeats the enemy ace in honorable single combat.
    *   **THEN:** Huge morale boost. Propaganda value. Respect from enemies. However, the ace's squadron seeks revenge in later encounters.

    *   **IF:** The party uses Dr. Schugel's experimental orb and it explodes.
    *   **THEN:** The character is severely injured. The resulting explosion kills nearby allies. Schugel is undeterred and offers an even more dangerous prototype.

    *   **IF:** The party successfully extracts the defector.
    *   **THEN:** They gain crucial intelligence about Being X's interference across all factions and enemy force dispositions. However, Federation forces mount a massive manhunt.

    *   **IF:** The party participates in propaganda efforts.
    *   **THEN:** Public support increases, providing better supplies and reinforcements. However, they become high-value targets. Enemy blessed soldiers seek them out specifically.

    *   **IF:** The party maintains high battalion morale through Session 6.
    *   **THEN:** Their troops fight exceptionally in Operation Ark. Lower casualties, better performance. The battalion becomes legendary.

    *   **IF:** Battalion morale is low by Session 6.
    *   **THEN:** Troops are unreliable in the final battle. Higher casualties. Some may break and retreat. The party must do more themselves.

    *   **IF:** The party breaks a Divine Commandment.
    *   **THEN:** Immediate divine punishment (damage, loss of blessing, disadvantage). Being X appears to condemn them. However, breaking free of divine control becomes possible.

    *   **IF:** The party chooses Path A (Serve Being X fully).
    *   **THEN:** Generate epilogue showing them as legendary war heroes but eternal divine servants. They win the war decisively but lose free will. Being X uses them in future conflicts.

    *   **IF:** The party chooses Path B (Reject Being X).
    *   **THEN:** Generate epilogue showing them as normal soldiers who won through skill, not divine favor. The war ends but with heavy cost. They keep their souls but lose extraordinary power.

    *   **IF:** The party chooses Path C (Attack Being X).
    *   **THEN:** Generate epilogue showing them attempting the impossible—a fight against a god. Success would free the world from divine manipulation but failure means damnation. The outcome is uncertain and legendary.

**7. Magic System Specifics**
*   **Directive:** Define the unique magical elements of this world.
*   **Computation Orbs:** Brass spheres containing crystallized magic cores. Allow mages to perform complex calculations required for advanced combat magic and flight. User interfaces with orb mentally. Different models have different capabilities—Type 95 is most advanced but temperamental.
*   **Aerial Magic:** Flight requires constant concentration and computation orb support. Maximum altitude ~20,000 feet before oxygen becomes lethal. Speed ~100-200 mph. Creates visible thrust contrails. Requires tremendous stamina.
*   **Combat Magic:** Artillery-enhancement, shield barriers, explosive projectiles, targeted strikes. All require computation support. Without orb, mages are limited to basic spells. Magic is treated as military asset, not mysterious art.
*   **Divine Blessings:** Being X's power overlays natural magic. Grants enhanced computation, supernatural durability, rapid regeneration, and ability to exceed normal magical limits. Comes with divine marks and compulsions.
*   **Prayer as Mechanism:** Being X literally feeds on prayers. Desperate prayers from the battlefield empower it. The more desperate the war, the stronger divine entities become.

**8. Military Doctrine & Warfare**
*   **Directive:** Define how war is fought in this world.
*   **Combined Arms:** Infantry holds ground, artillery provides fire support, aerial mages perform reconnaissance and strike missions. All three must coordinate.
*   **Trench Warfare:** Static front lines defended by elaborate trench systems, minefields, and fortifications. Breaking through requires massive casualties or brilliant maneuver.
*   **Aerial Superiority:** Control of airspace is crucial. Aerial mages scout, strike supply lines, support ground forces, and duel enemy mages. Anti-air defenses are deadly.
*   **Total War:** All of society mobilized. Industry produces weapons, civilians support war effort, propaganda maintains morale. The war consumes everything.
*   **Logistics:** Supply lines are critical. Armies cannot fight without ammunition, food, and magical supplies. Disrupting enemy logistics is primary objective.

**9. Timeline of Events (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Directive:** This is the default timeline if the party doesn't intervene. Use this to create urgency.
*   **Session 1:** Rhinefall Offensive fails catastrophically. Party dies without divine intervention.
*   **Session 2:** Without the "Miracle," Imperial lines collapse. War turns against Empire.
*   **Session 3:** Eastern Front collapses without the party's intervention.
*   **Session 4:** Federation offensive breaks through, threatening Imperial heartland.
*   **Session 5:** Without intelligence, Operation Ark is planned with flawed information.
*   **Session 6:** The party is not available to lead the assault.
*   **Session 7:** Operation Ark fails. Republican capital remains intact.
*   **Session 8:** Multi-front collapse. Empire surrenders unconditionally. Being X selects new pawns from the victors and the cycle continues.

This specification ensures a militarily realistic, theologically horrifying world where player choices matter tactically, strategically, and philosophically.
