## Campaign Overview

*   **Title**: The Iron Prayer
*   **Campaign Type/Genre**: Military Fantasy with WW1-inspired magical warfare
*   **Estimated Length**: A medium campaign of 7-8 sessions.
*   **Player Level Range**: Starting at Level 3, ending around Level 9.
*   **Tone**: Cynical, morally gray, tactically demanding, with dark humor and religious satire.
*   **Core Premise**: The players are elite battle mages in the Imperial Army during the Great Continental War—a brutal conflict mixing trench warfare with devastating combat magic. After a near-death experience, the party receives mysterious blessings from a divine entity known only as "Being X," granting them extraordinary powers but binding them to an unknown purpose. As they rise through military ranks, they must survive horrific battles, navigate military politics, and unravel why the gods themselves have taken interest in their fates. The campaign asks: What does it mean to have faith when the divine is both real and cruel?

## Difficulty Context

**Hard Difficulty**: This campaign is tactically demanding with limited resources and high lethality. Combat encounters are designed to be challenging, requiring creative use of terrain, combined arms tactics, and careful resource management. The party faces intelligent enemies who use cover, flanking, and combined magic-artillery strikes. Rest opportunities are rare during active campaigns. Uses Gritty Realism rest variant (short rest = 8 hours, long rest = 7 days). Death is a real possibility, and retreating is sometimes the only winning move.

## Story Arc

The narrative follows a three-act structure chronicling the party's rise from lieutenants to legends over 7-8 sessions.

*   **Act I: Baptism by Fire (Sessions 1-2)**: The party commands a mage company during the disastrous Battle of the Rhinefall, where Imperial forces attempt to break through Republican lines. After being wounded in a catastrophic aerial battle, the party experiences visions of a divine entity—Being X—who offers them power in exchange for faith. They awaken with mysterious blessings and new magical abilities. Returning to command, they must use these gifts to survive the grinding warfare while questioning the price they've paid.

*   **Act II: The Eastern Front (Sessions 3-5)**: Promoted for their miraculous survival and effectiveness, the party is transferred to the Eastern Front to face the Federation's endless armies. They command an elite rapid-response battalion, conducting dangerous operations behind enemy lines. Investigation reveals disturbing truths: Being X's blessings are appearing among enemy forces too. The war itself may be orchestrated by divine entities using mortals as pawns in a cosmic game. The party must balance following orders, keeping their troops alive, and investigating the divine conspiracy.

*   **Act III: The Devil's Gambit (Sessions 6-8)**: The war reaches a breaking point. Multiple nations marshal for a final offensive. Being X makes its demands clear: prove your faith by winning an impossible battle, or be abandoned to die. The party must execute a desperate strategic gambit—a massive aerial assault on the enemy's capital combined with a ground offensive that violates every rule of war. Success could end the war but requires sacrificing countless lives. The campaign culminates in a choice: serve Being X and achieve victory at any cost, or reject divine will and find another path, even if it means defeat.

## Session Breakdown

*   **Session 1: The Rhinefall Offensive**
    *   **Focus**: Tactical combat, Survival
    *   **Key Events**: The party leads their mage company in a massive offensive against entrenched Republican positions. The battle goes poorly—artillery rains down, enemy mages counter-attack, and infantry is slaughtered in no-man's-land. During a desperate aerial mage duel, the party is shot down behind enemy lines. As they lay dying, Being X appears, offering power in exchange for faith.
    *   **Escalation**: The party awakens in a field hospital with mysterious glowing marks and new abilities. They're immediately ordered back to the front.

*   **Session 2: The Miracle of Rhine**
    *   **Focus**: Mass combat, Command
    *   **Key Events**: Using their new powers, the party leads a counter-attack that breaks the Republican flank. Their impossible victory is labeled "The Miracle of Rhine" by Imperial propaganda. They're decorated and promoted to Major, given command of a rapid-response battalion. In private, a military intelligence officer warns them that high command has special plans for "blessed" soldiers.
    *   **Escalation**: Orders arrive: transfer to the Eastern Front immediately. The Federation has broken through Imperial lines.

*   **Session 3: Frozen Hell**
    *   **Focus**: Survival, Tactical missions
    *   **Key Events**: The Eastern Front is a frozen nightmare. The party's battalion conducts raids to disrupt Federation supply lines. They discover Federation forces have their own "blessed" warriors bearing marks similar to the party's. After capturing one, they learn Being X has appeared to soldiers on all sides.
    *   **Escalation**: Intelligence reports that the Federation is massing for a major offensive. The party must stop it with limited forces.

*   **Session 4: The Frozen Fortress**
    *   **Focus**: Infiltration, Sabotage
    *   **Key Events**: The party leads a strike team to infiltrate and destroy a Federation command bunker coordinating the offensive. Inside, they find documents revealing a pattern: Being X appears to soldiers in all nations, always offering power for faith. The war is being prolonged deliberately. They complete their mission but face a Federation "blessed" officer in a deadly duel.
    *   **Escalation**: High Command orders the party to the capital for a special briefing. Something big is being planned.

*   **Session 5: The War Council**
    *   **Focus**: Political intrigue, Planning
    *   **Key Events**: At the Imperial War Ministry, the party meets other blessed soldiers from different fronts. A secret council reveals the truth: High Command knows about Being X and believes winning the war decisively will free them from divine manipulation. They're planning Operation Ark—a massive simultaneous assault on all fronts to force total victory. The party will lead the aerial mage assault on the Republic's capital.
    *   **Escalation**: Being X appears to the party again, making its demands clear: "Prove your faith through service, or face damnation."

*   **Session 6: The Devil's Brigade**
    *   **Focus**: Preparation, Special operations
    *   **Key Events**: The party has one week to prepare. They can requisite special equipment, train their battalion in new tactics, and conduct reconnaissance. Optional missions include: destroying an enemy super-weapon, recruiting a defecting Federation scientist, or securing experimental magical weapons. Choices made here affect the final battle's difficulty.
    *   **Escalation**: The night before the offensive, Being X grants the party enhanced powers—but at a cost. Each player must accept a divine commandment that restricts their actions.

*   **Session 7: Operation Ark—Assault on the Skies**
    *   **Focus**: Epic aerial combat, Mass battle
    *   **Key Events**: Operation Ark begins. The party leads 200 aerial mages in a high-altitude assault on the Republic's capital while ground forces attack across the entire front. They face the Republican Ace Mage Squadron, anti-air artillery nets, and enemy blessed soldiers. The battle is desperate and costly. Breakthrough requires difficult choices about sacrificing troops to achieve objectives.
    *   **Escalation**: The party reaches the capital's airspace, but the enemy unveils a secret weapon—a massive magical fortress that can shoot down entire mage battalions.

*   **Session 8: The Final Prayer**
    *   **Focus**: Boss battle, Moral choice
    *   **Key Events**: The party assaults the flying fortress while the ground war rages below. Inside, they face the enemy's greatest blessed warrior—a mirror to themselves. Being X appears, revealing this was always its plan: force blessed soldiers to battle for its entertainment while mortals pray desperately for salvation. The party must choose:
        *   **Path A**: Serve Being X fully, winning the battle and ending the war, but becoming divine instruments forever.
        *   **Path B**: Reject Being X, losing their blessings mid-battle, but retaining free will. Victory becomes much harder but remains possible through mortal skill.
        *   **Path C**: Find a third way—turn their blessed powers against Being X itself, potentially ending divine interference but risking catastrophic consequences.
    *   **Epilogue**: Consequences of the choice reshape the world. The war ends, but what comes after depends on the path taken.

## Key Locations

*   **The Rhinefall Front**: A massive network of trenches, fortifications, and no-man's-land stretching for hundreds of miles. Characterized by constant artillery, aerial mage battles, and grinding infantry warfare. The sky is always choked with smoke and magical ordinance.

*   **Imperial Capital - Berun**: A grand city of military parades, government buildings, and war industry. The War Ministry houses the command staff planning Operation Ark. The Imperial Palace looms over everything, a symbol of authority the party serves.

*   **The Eastern Steppe**: Endless frozen plains where the Federation's seemingly infinite armies march. Blizzards rage constantly. Federation bunker complexes dot the landscape, each a fortress that must be taken at great cost. The cold is as deadly as the enemy.

*   **The Aerial Combat Zone**: The three-dimensional battlefield where aerial mages fight. At high altitudes, mages duel with flight magic and combat spells while dodging anti-air fire. Visibility is poor, oxygen is scarce, and falling means death.

*   **The Republican Capital - Parisee**: The final battle's setting. A beautiful city turned fortress, ringed by anti-air batteries and defended by the Republic's best. The flying fortress "Valkyrie's Wrath" floats above it, a massive magical platform bristling with weapons.

*   **The Divine Realm (Vision)**: When Being X appears, characters are pulled into a space outside reality—white void, filled with overwhelming presence. Here, Being X makes its demands and grants its blessings.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict operates on three levels:

**Military**: Survive and win an apocalyptic war using tactical brilliance, combined arms warfare, and devastating magical firepower. The party must balance objectives with keeping their troops alive.

**Political**: Navigate military hierarchy, propaganda, and conspiracy. High Command, Intelligence, and rival blessed soldiers all have agendas. Trust is rare.

**Theological**: Being X has made the party pawns in a cosmic game to prove mortals need gods. The party must decide whether to serve, rebel, or find a third option. The ultimate question: Can mortals have free will when gods are real and actively interfering?

## Side Quests

*   **The Deserter's Tale**: A soldier from the party's battalion deserts. They're ordered to execute him as an example. Investigating reveals he fled because Being X appeared to him and drove him mad. The party must choose: follow orders or show mercy.

*   **The Ace Duel**: A famous enemy ace challenges the party to single combat. Defeating them in honorable dueling could boost morale and earn respect, but it's also very dangerous.

*   **Dr. Schugel's Experiment**: The mad scientist wants the party to field-test a prototype computation orb that amplifies magical power tenfold—but has a chance of exploding. High risk, high reward.

*   **The Defector**: A high-ranking Federation officer wants to defect, claiming to have intelligence about Being X's plans. The party must extract them from behind enemy lines. But is it a trap?

*   **The Propaganda War**: High Command wants the party to participate in propaganda efforts—rallies, interviews, photo opportunities. They can refuse, but it affects public morale and resource allocation.

*   **The Spy Hunt**: Someone is leaking the party's battle plans to the enemy. Colonel von Lehrgen tasks them with finding the spy within their own battalion. The truth is complicated and morally gray.

## Unique Mechanics

*   **Difficulty - Hard/Gritty Realism**:
    *   Short rests require 8 hours. Long rests require 7 days of downtime.
    *   Injury rules: Dropping to 0 HP may result in lingering injuries (DMG p. 272).
    *   Ammunition and resources are tracked carefully. Supply lines matter.
    *   Retreating is a valid tactical choice and sometimes necessary for survival.

*   **Mass Combat System**:
    *   The party commands battalions, not just themselves. Use simplified mass combat rules:
        *   Battalion Morale: Tracked on a scale of 1-10. Drops from casualties, failed objectives, or seeing blessed enemies. Rises from victories and inspiring leadership.
        *   Unit Actions: Each round, the party can order their battalion to Attack, Defend, Maneuver, or Special Action.
        *   Commander's Advantage: Party members can use their actions to grant their battalion advantage on attacks or saves.
    *   Casualties are permanent. Losing too many troops affects future mission capability.

*   **Being X's Blessing System**:
    *   Each character has a Divine Favor track from 0-10.
    *   Favor increases by: winning battles decisively, performing acts Being X considers "faithful," accepting divine commands.
    *   Favor decreases by: questioning divine will, showing mercy when ruthlessness would win, rejecting commands.
    *   **High Favor (7-10)**: Gain powerful blessings—+2 to spell attack/save DC, bonus action to cast a cantrip, resistance to damage, or flight speed increase.
    *   **Low Favor (0-3)**: Being X withdraws support—disadvantage on saves against fear, vulnerability to radiant damage, visions that impose disadvantage on concentration.
    *   **The Catch**: Players don't know exactly what increases or decreases favor. Being X's logic is alien.

*   **Tactical Combat Environment**:
    *   **Cover is King**: Battlefields have heavy cover (trenches, buildings, rubble). Enemies use it intelligently.
    *   **Combined Arms**: Enemies attack with magic, artillery, and infantry simultaneously. Players must coordinate responses.
    *   **Aerial Advantage**: Aerial mages have tactical superiority but are vulnerable to anti-air. Positioning matters.
    *   **Command Decisions**: Mid-combat, players must make command decisions: "Send reinforcements to the left flank or hold reserves?" These affect battle outcomes.

*   **Divine Commandments** (Session 6):
    *   Being X grants enhanced power but binds each character with a specific commandment:
        *   "Thou shalt show no mercy to enemies who resist."
        *   "Thou shalt pray before each battle."
        *   "Thou shalt never retreat from combat."
        *   "Thou shalt place faith above reason."
    *   Breaking a commandment causes immediate divine punishment (loss of blessing, disadvantage, divine damage).
    *   This creates tension between tactical optimization and divine demands.

***

*Campaign design emphasizes tactical depth, moral ambiguity, and the horror of war mixed with magical spectacle. Players must think like military commanders while questioning whether victory at any cost is worth serving a cruel god.*
