# World-Building Specification Brief: Abyssal Descent

**Core Concept**: An expedition descends an impossible chasm into cosmic horror. Survival horror where the environment, madness, and unknowable entities threaten the party. No way out but through.

**Lore Prompts**:
* The Infinite Chasm's discovery and previous failed expeditions.
* The Thing Below—an entity from outside reality that exists in the deepest darkness.
* Progressive madness symptoms and how they manifest.
* Previous expedition members' journals found along the way—showing descent into madness.

**Factions**:
* **The Expedition**: Scientists, guards, guides, party—all descending together before fracturing.
* **The Compromised**: Party members slowly influenced by the Thing Below without knowing.
* **The Lost**: Previous expedition survivors, now insane, cannibalistic, or worse.
* **The Things in Dark**: Creatures that exist in absolute darkness, break natural laws.

**Key NPCs**:
* **Professor Darkwater**: Knows more than he admits; obsession leads to doom.
* **Captain Reeves**: Makes brutal survival choices; may sacrifice party members.
* **The Compromised One**: Party member secretly influenced; player might not know their own character is corrupted.
* **The Thing Below**: Cannot be comprehended without sanity loss.

**Locations**:
* **Level 1-3**: Normal caves transitioning to impossible.
* **The Blind Cathedral**: Hunt by sound; absolute silence or death.
* **The Inverted Halls**: Gravity wrong, geometry impossible.
* **The Screaming Gallery**: Walls that remember and replay death sounds.
* **The Bottom**: Reality breakdown; The Thing Below's domain.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF sanity drops to 0 THEN NPC/PC becomes mad, may attack party or flee into darkness.
* IF light sources run out THEN must navigate in absolute darkness; near-certain death from creatures or falls.
* IF party tries to ascend THEN cave-ins or creature pursuit forces descent; no retreat.
* IF party discovers the truth THEN massive sanity loss but understanding of how to possibly survive.
* IF party reaches The Bottom THEN final confrontation with incomprehensible horror.

**Mechanics**:
* **Sanity Point System**: Witnessing horrors reduces sanity; 0 means madness (character may become NPC).
* **Light Tracking**: Torches, spells, magical items—all limited. Darkness means danger.
* **No Long Rests**: Unsafe environment; only short rests possible, with risk.
* **Permadeath**: Character death is likely; creates real tension.
* **Paranoia**: Secret notes from DM to players suggesting their character is compromised.
* **Impossible Physics**: Saving throws vs reality breakdown—fall damage from falling "sideways," etc.
