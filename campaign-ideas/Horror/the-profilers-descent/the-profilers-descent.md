## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Recruitment (Sessions 1–3):** Rookie investigator Clarice Starling (PC or NPC) is pulled from academy training by Jack Crawford to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter—imprisoned cannibal and brilliant psychiatrist. Initial meeting establishes rules: quid pro quo—information for information. Buffalo Bill case introduced: serial killer abducting large women, killing them after 3 days, skinning portions of their bodies. Lecter begins profiling Clarice, not Buffalo Bill.

*   **Act II — The Interviews (Sessions 4–7):** Series of tense interviews with Lecter, trading Buffalo Bill insights for personal revelations from Clarice. Lecter provides crucial profiling: "He covets. He sees himself as transformation." Discovery of death's-head moths left in victims' throats. Lecter manipulates Clarice into revealing childhood trauma (the screaming lambs). Senator's daughter Catherine Martin is kidnapped—time pressure intensifies.

*   **Act III — The Escape (Sessions 8–10):** Lecter is transferred to another facility to "help" directly with the case—actually a scheme by Senator Martin. During transfer, Lecter brutally escapes by killing two guards in horrifically creative fashion, disappearing. Now the party faces two serial killers, but Lecter continues helping via mysterious messages—he enjoys the game too much to stop.

*   **Act IV — The Profile Completed (Sessions 11–13):** Using Lecter's insights and their own investigation, the party profiles Buffalo Bill: Jame Gumb, transgender individual denied surgery, trying to create woman suit from victims' skin to "become" female. Discovery that Lecter knew Bill's identity all along, was testing if Clarice could solve it. Race to Gumb's house before Catherine dies in the well.

*   **Act V — The Descent (Sessions 14–15):** Final confrontation in Gumb's basement labyrinth—night vision goggles, victim in pit, moths everywhere. Catherine rescued. But Lecter escapes completely, leaving a final communication for Clarice: their relationship will continue. Campaign ends with Clarice graduated but forever changed by her exposure to monsters—and Lecter's voice in her head.

## Key Locations

1.  **Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane:** Underground maximum security, where Lecter is imprisoned. Claustrophobic, disturbing.
2.  **Lecter's Cell:** Glass walls, sketches everywhere, elegant despite imprisonment. Scene of all interviews.
3.  **FBI Academy:** Training ground, shooting ranges, normal world that Clarice is leaving behind.
4.  **Crawford's Office:** Behavioral Science Unit headquarters, case files, evidence.
5.  **Storage Facility:** Where victim's bodies are kept for autopsy—discovery of the moth cocoons.
6.  **Gumb's House:** Seemingly normal suburban home hiding nightmare basement.
7.  **The Well:** Pit where Catherine is imprisoned, desperate and terrified.
8.  **The Transformation Room:** Gumb's lair with sewing equipment, moths, victims' skin, mirrors.

## Central Conflict

The cost of hunting monsters. To catch Buffalo Bill, Clarice must understand how he thinks—which requires descending into darkness. Lecter facilitates this descent, treating it as education. The central question: Can you stare into the abyss without becoming part of it? Can you use a monster's help without becoming corrupted?

Parallel: Both Lecter and Gumb are transforming Clarice—Lecter is refining her into his image (intellectual predator), while the hunt for Gumb is hardening her into an investigator who has seen too much.

The "screaming lambs" motif: Clarice's drive to save victims stems from childhood trauma of hearing lambs being slaughtered and being unable to stop it. If she saves Catherine, can she silence the lambs? Or will they scream forever?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Interview System (Quid Pro Quo)**
*   Every session with Lecter is a tense negotiation.
*   Lecter provides case insights IF Clarice reveals personal information.
*   Mechanically: opposed social checks—Insight vs. Deception, Persuasion vs. Manipulation.
*   Each interview changes Clarice (track "Corruption Points" or "Lecter's Influence").

### 2. **Psychological Profiling**
*   Build criminal profile through evidence analysis and Lecter's teachings.
*   Profile has categories: Motive (why), Method (how), Signature (what fulfills fantasy).
*   Accurate profiling provides advantages when confronting killer.
*   Lecter teaches profiling by profiling Clarice—showing her how predators think.

### 3. **Corruption and Transformation**
*   Track Clarice's transformation from innocent to hardened investigator.
*   Lecter's influence grants mechanical benefits (better profiling, intimidation) but moral cost.
*   By campaign end, Clarice is more effective but less innocent—permanent character change.

### 4. **The Ticking Clock**
*   Buffalo Bill kills victims exactly 3 days after kidnapping.
*   Catherine Martin has X days remaining—countdown creates pressure.
*   Every failed lead or wasted day brings her closer to death.

### 5. **Evidence Analysis**
*   Autopsy reports, crime scene photos, pattern analysis.
*   Investigation checks reveal: death's-head moth cocoons, skin removal patterns, geographic profiles.
*   Forensics are detailed and disturbing—mature content.

### 6. **Lecter's Escape Sequence**
*   Not a combat encounter—a horror sequence.
*   Players investigate aftermath: guards killed brutally and creatively, Lecter's cell staged as artwork.
*   Escape is inevitable but shocking—demonstrates Lecter's true danger.

### 7. **The Darkness Encounter**
*   Climactic scene: Gumb cuts the lights in his basement.
*   He has night vision goggles; Clarice is blind.
*   Mechanics: disadvantage on attacks, must use hearing (Perception checks) to locate him.
*   Incredibly tense combat where PC is at severe disadvantage until turning tables.

## The Psychological Dance (Lecter's Goals)

Lecter isn't helping catch Buffalo Bill out of goodness. His goals:
1.  **Amusement:** The investigation entertains him from his cell
2.  **Transformation:** He sees potential in Clarice and wants to sculpt her
3.  **Quid Pro Quo:** He genuinely enjoys fair exchanges of information
4.  **Escape:** The entire cooperation builds to his escape opportunity
5.  **Legacy:** He wants to leave his mark on Clarice—she'll carry his teachings forever

Lecter's questions probe Clarice's psychology:
- "Why do you think I let you interview me, Clarice?"
- "What became of your lamb, Clarice?"
- "Tell me, what did you see when you first walked into the basement?"
- "You're so ambitious, aren't you? You know what you look like to me? A well-scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste."

Each answer reveals her to him—and changes her.

## Buffalo Bill's Psychology

Jame Gumb's profile:
*   **Motive:** Believes he's transgender but was denied gender confirmation surgery due to psychosis
*   **Delusion:** Thinks creating woman suit from skin will complete his transformation
*   **Method:** Kidnaps large women (needs size for the suit), starves them to loosen skin, kills after 3 days, harvests skin
*   **Signature:** Places death's-head moth cocoons in victims' throats—symbol of transformation
*   **Lair:** Basement with industrial sewing equipment, moth breeding, well for keeping victims
*   **Behavior:** Refers to himself as "we," keeps pet poodle Precious, dance ritual in front of mirrors

The horror is his twisted logic—he wants to transform, genuinely believes this will work, cannot be reasoned with.

---

## Campaign Themes

*   **Transformation:** Everyone transforms—Gumb seeks it literally, Lecter transforms Clarice, Clarice transforms through experience
*   **The Cost of Justice:** What you sacrifice to catch monsters
*   **Predator and Prey:** Who is hunting whom? Clarice hunts Bill, Lecter hunts Clarice's innocence
*   **Gender and Identity:** Both as horror (Gumb's twisted version) and depth (Clarice in male-dominated FBI)
*   **Memory and Trauma:** The screaming lambs, the past that drives us
*   **Genius and Madness:** The thin line between brilliant and monstrous

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign succeeds when:
*   Catherine Martin is rescued alive (time limit met)
*   Buffalo Bill is stopped (killed or captured)
*   Clarice graduates from the academy
*   The party survives Lecter's psychological manipulation (changed but functional)

Lecter escaping is not a failure—it's inevitable and sets up ongoing horror.

---

## Failure States

*   Catherine Martin dies (time runs out)
*   Clarice is completely corrupted by Lecter (becomes monster)
*   Party is killed by Buffalo Bill in the basement
*   Party refuses to engage with Lecter (never solves case)

---

## Content Warnings & Safety

---

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Study psychological profiling—read real FBI materials
*   Watch/read source material for tone (disturbing but not gratuitous)
*   Practice Lecter's voice: intelligent, cultured, slightly amused, dangerous
*   Pre-script key Lecter lines—they need to be perfect
*   Design each interview as escalating psychological warfare
*   Lecter should know things he shouldn't—it's unnerving
*   Buffalo Bill's lair should be detailed horror environment
*   The darkness combat must be terrifyingly tense
*   Track Clarice's transformation—note when she starts thinking like Lecter
*   Lecter's escape is a horror setpiece, not a combat encounter—describe aftermath
*   Balance: horrifying but empowering for Clarice (she succeeds despite everything)
*   Remember: Lecter respects Clarice—he wants to transform, not destroy her
