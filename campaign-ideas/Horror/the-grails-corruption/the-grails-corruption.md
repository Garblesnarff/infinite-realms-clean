**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Seven mages (Masters) are chosen to fight in the Holy Grail War—each summons a legendary hero from history (Servant) to battle the others. The last Master standing wins the Grail, which supposedly grants any wish. The party are either Masters with Servants, or a Servant-Master pair, competing against six other teams while discovering the Grail is corrupted—it doesn't grant wishes, it corrupts them into nightmares. The campaign explores ambition versus morality, the cost of dreams, and whether ideals can survive contact with reality.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Battle Royale:** Six other teams want the same thing and will kill for it. Alliances are temporary.
*   **Servant Power:** Legendary heroes are vastly more powerful than normal beings. Direct combat is deadly.
*   **The Corruption:** The Grail is evil—winning means your wish becomes a nightmare. Must discover this and decide what to do.
*   **Master-Servant Bonds:** Deep roleplay between Masters and Servants with different ideologies. Betrayal possible.
*   **Moral Complexity:** Every Master has understandable motivation. Killing them feels like murdering protagonists of other stories.
*   **Sacrificial Choices:** Victory may require sacrificing Servant, allies, ideals, or humanity itself.

## Story Arc (Medium-Long Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — The War Begins (Sessions 1–5):** Party is chosen as Master(s), summons Servant(s), learns rules of Grail War. Meet the seven competing teams, each with their own wish and ideology. First battles establish danger and power levels. Discover hidden eighth participant or conspiracy.
*   **Act II — Ideals and Betrayals (Sessions 6–10):** Alliances form and break. Servants and Masters clash over methodology. Party discovers the Grail is corrupted by an ancient evil, granting wishes in twisted ways. Must decide: continue fighting for corrupted prize, try to purify Grail, or destroy it entirely.
*   **Act III — The Final Wish (Sessions 11–15):** Final battles between last surviving teams. Revelation of Grail's true nature (may be demon, cursed artifact, or remnant of fallen god). Multiple endings based on whether party wins, what they wish for, if they can purify/destroy the Grail, and the cost they paid.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **ideals versus reality** and **the cost of wishes**. Every Master fights for something they believe is worth any sacrifice—world peace, love, knowledge, recognition. Their Servants embody different philosophies of heroism and kingship. As they battle, their ideals are tested: the pacifist must kill, the honest must deceive, the noble must commit atrocities. The Grail promises to make dreams real but corrupts them—world peace through extinction, love through possession, knowledge through madness. The campaign questions: are there wishes worth any cost? Do the ends justify the means? Can ideals survive reality's brutality? And if you sacrifice everything to achieve your dream, is the victory meaningless?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Master-Servant Pairing**
*   Each player is either a Master (command seals, strategy, support magic) or Servant (legendary hero, combat powerhouse).
*   Can play as pairs (Master + Servant per player) or split (one player each).
*   Deep roleplay between Master and Servant with potentially conflicting goals.

### 2. **Command Seals**
*   Masters have 3 absolute command seals—can force Servant to obey any order.
*   Using them strengthens bond or creates resentment.
*   Can transfer seals, use them for power boosts, or save for critical moments.

### 3. **Noble Phantasms**
*   Servants have legendary ultimate abilities (Excalibur, Gate of Babylon, etc.).
*   Revealing Noble Phantasm exposes Servant's identity (strategic cost).
*   Once per day or with severe mana cost.

### 4. **Class System**
*   Seven Servant classes, each with strengths/weaknesses.
*   Saber: balanced, Archer: range, Lancer: agility, Rider: mounts/armies, Caster: magic, Berserker: rage power, Assassin: stealth.

### 5. **The Corruption Tracker**
*   Track how much the Grail's evil influences the party.
*   Using dark methods, making brutal choices, desperation increases it.
*   High corruption means wish will be twisted if they win.

### 6. **Ideals vs. Pragmatism**
*   Track whether party maintains their ideals or compromises for victory.
*   Affects relationship with Servant, available endings, and wish outcome.

### 7. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Corrupted Victory:** Win but wish is twisted into nightmare; Angra Mainyu is born.
*   **Noble Sacrifice:** Destroy the Grail before winning; save future but lose your wish.
*   **Purification:** Cleanse Grail through massive sacrifice; wish granted purely but at terrible cost.
*   **Ideological:** Master and Servant's relationship determines philosophical conclusion.
*   **Total Loss:** Defeated; other Master wins; their wish shapes world (for better or worse).
