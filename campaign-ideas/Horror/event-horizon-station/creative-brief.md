# Creative Brief: Event Horizon Station

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Sci-Fi meets Hellraiser

Combining the gothic cathedral-like architecture of a dark future spaceship with the visceral body horror and hell imagery of Hellraiser, this style creates a unique fusion of sci-fi and demonic terror. The ship itself is beautiful and terrible—vaulted halls that belong in a church, not space.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Gothic Space Architecture:** Vaulted ceilings, archways, religious imagery mixed with advanced technology.
*   **Hell Imagery:** Fire, suffering, impossible geometry, faces in walls, flesh merged with metal.
*   **Body Horror:** Grotesque deaths, self-mutilation, bodies torn apart by forces beyond physics.
*   **Reality Distortion:** Non-Euclidean space, gravity shifts, perspectives that hurt to perceive.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gothic sci-fi, hell dimension, madness, gravity horror, body horror, religious terror, personalized nightmares, reality breakdown.
*   **Feeling:** A cathedral built to worship at the altar of scientific hubris, now revealed as a gateway to hell.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Architecture:** Clean gothic lines corrupted—archways warping, crosses inverted, beauty degraded into horror.
*   **The Drive:** Spherical perfection surrounded by impossible geometry and eldritch energy.
*   **Bodies:** Realistic humans destroyed in unrealistic ways—torn by forces, self-mutilated, fused with ship.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gothic spaceship corridor with vaulted ceilings and archways. Advanced technology integrated with medieval cathedral aesthetics. The walls show signs of corruption—metal fused with organic matter, faces pushing through surfaces, blood stains forming occult symbols."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Ship:** Cold metallic grays, dark blues, harsh white lights.
*   **Hell Corruption:** Hot reds, sickly greens of decay, the orange of fire, pustulent yellows.
*   **The Drive:** Electric blues and purples, crackling with unnatural energy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Color palette of cold gray metal and dark blue shadows contrasted with hot red corruption spreading like infection. Fire-orange glows from impossible sources. The Gravity Drive pulses with electric blue-purple energy."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Living:** Humans in practical spacefarer gear, increasingly disheveled and injured as madness sets in.
*   **Dead Crew:** Bodies showing impossible deaths—torn apart from inside, skin flayed in geometric patterns, faces frozen in agony.
*   **Dr. Weir:** Mutilated, eyes gouged out, self-inflicted wounds, speaks with disturbing calm.
*   **Manifestations:** Vary by character—dead loved ones rotting, childhood fears giant and real, guilt personified as accusers.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Dr. Weir, a man in tattered ship officer uniform, his eyes gouged out and replaced with metal implants. Ritual scars cover his skin. He smiles beatifically while blood runs down his face. Behind him, the walls pulse with tortured faces trying to push through."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Ship:** Gothic cathedral mixed with spaceship—vaulted metal corridors, stained glass showing cosmic imagery, archways, altars to technology.
*   **Corrupted Areas:** Walls bleeding, organic matter growing, gravity reversing, corridors looping impossibly.
*   **The Drive Chamber:** Massive spherical room with the Drive floating at center, walls covered in occult mathematics, perspective-warping geometry.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Gravity Drive chamber: a massive spherical room. At the center floats the Drive—a perfect sphere crackling with energy. The walls are covered in incomprehensible mathematics that seem to shift. Gravity has no single direction—debris floats at all angles. Through the Drive, glimpses of a hell dimension—fire, screaming faces, impossible architecture."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Ship:** Harsh overhead lights creating stark shadows, emergency lighting, darkness in corners.
*   **Hell Corruption:** Fire-light from impossible sources, pulsating bioluminescence from organic corruption, the Drive's crackling energy.
*   **Manifestations:** Lit from below or behind, making them unnatural and threatening.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Lit by flickering emergency lights and the pulsating glow of organic corruption growing on walls. Shadows move independently. A figure stands in a doorway backlit by impossible fire from a dimension beyond."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Gothic Framing:** Use archways, vaulted ceilings, religious compositional elements.
*   **Disorientation:** Rotate perspectives, show multiple gravity directions, use Escher-like impossible angles.
*   **The Drive:** When shown, it should dominate—massive, central, drawing the eye and pulling the viewer in.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A corridor shot from a tilted angle suggesting gravity has shifted. The vaulted ceiling is now a wall. At the far end, the Gravity Drive is visible through an archway, its blue-purple energy pulling everything toward it. Debris and a body float at wrong angles."

## Voice

A deep, tormented male voice with a British accent, speaking with the exhausted authority of someone who's seen hell and knows what awaits. The tone shifts between clinical ship's log professionalism and barely-suppressed horror. Occasional Latin phrases (like "Libera te tutemet ex inferis—save yourself from hell"). Pacing includes long pauses where the speaker seems to be fighting madness or reliving visions. Audio includes ship sounds (groaning metal, alarms), the Drive's electrical hum growing louder, screaming from dimensions beyond, and wet organic sounds. Role: The final log of someone who failed to escape, documenting the ship's nature so others might destroy it, knowing their own soul is already damned.
