# The Endless Loop

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Dark Fantasy / Mystery / Psychological Horror / Time Loop
- **Estimated Length**: 7-8 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-8
- **Tone**: Dark, Psychological, Mysterious, Tragic, Ultimately Hopeful

### Core Premise
The players are suddenly transported to a fantasy kingdom where magic, knights, and monsters are real. But they've been granted a terrible gift: when they die, time resets to a specific checkpoint, and only they remember what happened. Each death teaches them something new, but also inflicts psychological trauma. They must use their knowledge from countless failed timelines to navigate political intrigue, prevent catastrophes, and protect those they care about - all while slowly unraveling the mystery of why they were brought here and who gave them this curse.

### Difficulty Context: **Hard**
This campaign requires careful note-taking, pattern recognition, and emotional resilience. Players will experience repeated failures and must learn from each death. The psychological toll of the time loop mechanic creates tension even outside combat.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The First Loop (Sessions 1-3)**
- Players arrive in the capital city of Lugnica and immediately experience their first deaths. They discover the checkpoint mechanic and begin investigating the mysterious assassination plot targeting a royal candidate. Each loop reveals new information, but also shows them how fragile life is in this world. They must save their first important NPC while learning the rules of their new reality.

**Act 2: The Deeper Mystery (Sessions 4-6)**
- Having survived the initial crisis, players are drawn into the royal selection - a competition to choose the next ruler. They discover their checkpoint has moved forward, meaning they can't undo what's already happened. New threats emerge, including the Witch Cult, mysterious assassins, and their own growing trauma from repeated deaths. They must protect multiple candidates while uncovering the connection between the royal selection and their transportation to this world.

**Act 3: Breaking the Loop (Sessions 7-8)**
- The final conflict reveals the true nature of the players' power and why they were brought to this world. A catastrophic threat emerges that requires everything they've learned from countless loops. They must make impossible choices, face their deepest fears, and decide whether to break free from the loop or accept it as their fate. The campaign culminates in either preventing a world-ending catastrophe or finding peace with their cursed existence.

### Key Locations

- **The Checkpoint Fruit Stall**: Where time always resets to. A simple merchant's stall in Lugnica's capital. The vendor never remembers the players, creating a constant sense of alienation.

- **Roswaal's Mansion**: Sprawling estate on the border. Contains forbidden library, guest rooms, servant quarters, and dark secrets. Site of multiple early loops and deaths.

- **The Capital City of Lugnica**: Medieval fantasy metropolis with castle, markets, slums, and noble districts. Where the royal selection takes place. Rich and poor exist side-by-side.

- **The Forbidden Library**: Pocket dimension containing all knowledge. Guarded by Beatrice. Time flows differently here. Can provide crucial information but the librarian is difficult.

- **The Flügel Tree**: Massive world tree in the forest. Sacred ground where the Witch Cult operates. Site of major confrontations and tragic deaths.

- **The Witches' Dream Castle**: Metaphysical realm where players meet echoes of the dead Witches. Reveals truth about their power but inflicts psychological damage.

### Central Conflict
The struggle against fate itself. Players have the power to rewind time, but each death takes a psychological toll. They can save everyone if they're willing to die enough times, but at what cost to their sanity? The campaign explores themes of persistence, trauma, the weight of knowledge that can't be shared, and whether you can truly save everyone or if some sacrifices are inevitable. It asks: if you could retry every failure, would you? And what would it cost you?

### Unique Mechanics

- **Return by Death**: When any player dies, the entire party resets to the last checkpoint. All physical changes revert, but players retain their memories and mental trauma. The DM secretly decides when checkpoints advance (usually after major plot achievements). Players cannot tell NPCs about this power - attempting to do so causes psychic damage and temporal distortion that resets the loop early.

- **Trauma Points**: Each death inflicts a Trauma Point on the dying player. Accumulate 3 Trauma Points: disadvantage on Wisdom saves. Accumulate 5: disadvantage on all mental ability checks. Accumulate 7: risk of mental breakdown (Wisdom save or gain a temporary madness). Trauma Points can be reduced through therapy-like roleplay scenes with trusted NPCs or by achieving major victories.

- **Loop Knowledge**: After each death, players can make Investigation checks to piece together new information from their experience. The DM provides one additional clue per successful check. This encourages players to treat deaths as learning experiences rather than failures, though the psychological cost remains.

- **Checkpoint Advancement**: When players achieve a significant victory or permanent change in the world, the checkpoint advances forward. This means they can't retry those events, raising the stakes. The DM should announce when checkpoints advance, creating moments of triumph mixed with anxiety about permanent consequences.
