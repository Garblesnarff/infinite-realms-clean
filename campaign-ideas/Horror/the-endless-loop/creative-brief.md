# Creative Brief: The Endless Loop

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy with Emotional Depth

Inspired by *Re:Zero*, combining beautiful fantasy aesthetics with moments of genuine horror and psychological darkness. This style should convey both the wonder of a fantasy world and the crushing weight of repeated failure and trauma. Beauty and horror coexist.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Duality of Light and Shadow:** Every beautiful scene can become horrific. Show both the wonder and the nightmare.
*   **Emotional Expressiveness:** Character faces must convey deep emotion - fear, determination, grief, hope. This is a character-driven story.
*   **The Weight of Repetition:** Subtle visual cues that suggest things have happened before - familiar angles, repeated imagery.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tragic, beautiful, psychological, mysterious, dark, hopeful, melancholic, intense, emotionally raw.
*   **Feeling:** The world is beautiful but dangerous. Safety is an illusion. Every moment of peace could shatter. But determination persists through suffering. Even in darkness, there is hope.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed anime style with emphasis on character expressions. Clean lines for normal scenes, more chaotic and sketchy for traumatic moments.
*   **Textures:** Mix of soft (clothing, skin) and sharp (weapons, ice, shadows). Contrast between organic and threatening elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Detailed anime-style illustration with expressive character work. Clean linework for the fantasy setting contrasts with rougher, more chaotic elements suggesting psychological distress..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Shifts based on emotional context. Peaceful scenes use warm, saturated colors. Dangerous moments use cold blues and harsh contrasts. Death scenes drain color toward monochrome.
*   **Accent Colors:** Purple and black for Witch-related elements, warm oranges for hope and determination, cold blues for despair and death, silver-white for magic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette that shifts from warm, saturated tones in peaceful moments to cold, desaturated blues in times of danger. Witch Cult elements feature deep purples and blacks."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Anime-influenced with highly expressive faces capable of showing deep emotion. Characters should look vulnerable and human even in fantasy settings.
*   **Clothing:** Fantasy medieval with distinctive color coding - Emilia in white and purple, maids in matching outfits, cultists in dark robes.
*   **Expression:** Priority on showing internal emotional states. Fear, trauma, determination, and hope must be readable in faces and body language.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An anime-style character portrait showing a young person in fantasy clothing. Their expression conveys both exhaustion and fierce determination, with subtle details suggesting they've seen things that haunt them."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Beautiful European-inspired fantasy architecture that can shift to threatening based on context. Same location can look inviting or horrifying.
*   **Atmosphere:** Use lighting and weather to convey emotional state. Sunny scenes can turn stormy. Safe rooms can feel claustrophobic.
*   **Details:** Include subtle horror elements - shadows that seem wrong, repeated patterns suggesting loops, visual metaphors for psychological state.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A beautiful mansion bedroom rendered in detailed anime style. Warm afternoon light streams through windows, but shadows in the corners seem too deep, and there's a subtle wrongness to the repeated patterns in the wallpaper."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and emotionally expressive. Lighting tells story - warm for hope, cold for danger, harsh contrasts for psychological breaks.
*   **Light Sources:** Natural light for peaceful moments, harsh magical light for combat, dim and uncertain light for horror scenes.
*   **Shadows:** Used expressively - can be soft and comforting or sharp and threatening based on context.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatic lighting that shifts from warm, soft afternoon sun to cold, harsh moonlight. Shadows grow longer and more menacing as danger approaches."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Varies by emotional beat. Wide shots for wonder, close-ups for emotion, Dutch angles for disorientation, repeated framings to suggest loops.
*   **Techniques:** Use visual repetition intentionally to suggest time loops. Frame characters alone to show isolation. Use perspective to create vulnerability or threat.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medium shot of a character standing in a marketplace, framed from slightly above to emphasize their vulnerability. The composition deliberately echoes an earlier scene, with subtle differences that suggest this is another loop."

## Voice

A young person's voice marked by determination despite evident exhaustion. The delivery suggests someone who has suffered greatly but refuses to give up - there's a crack of emotion always threatening to break through the brave front. Pacing varies with mental state: measured and calm when in control, rapid and panicked when things go wrong, slow and hollow after traumatic events. Emotion is raw and genuine - fear, grief, desperate hope, fierce determination. Audio quality is clear but sometimes seems to strain, as if the speaker is barely holding themselves together. Role: A protagonist who chooses to be a hero despite having every reason to break.

## Music Direction

Orchestral fantasy with emphasis on strings and piano for emotional moments. Main theme should be melancholic but hopeful - a tragic melody that builds to determination. Death scenes feature discordant, horror-tinged music. Reset moments use a distinctive sound motif. Character themes reflect their nature - gentle for Emilia, protective for Rem, mysterious for Roswaal, insane for Petelgeuse. The overall sound should support the emotional journey from wonder to horror to hard-won hope.
