# Domain of Nightmares
**"Welcome to Nightmara.net. You've been expecting us."**

## Campaign Overview

The party receives invitations to beta test a new immersive horror website: Nightmara.net. The site promises "personalized terror"—an AI-driven horror experience that adapts to each user. But within hours of signing up, strange things happen. The website knows things it shouldn't: childhood fears, secret traumas, names of dead relatives. Items from the site appear in real life. And users start disappearing, last seen logged into Nightmara.net.

The investigation reveals Nightmara.net isn't hosted on any physical server. Its domain registration doesn't exist. It operates in the Dark Web's deepest layers—or somewhere beyond. The site is a threshold: a digital portal to a realm where nightmares are real and the party's fears have become hunting grounds. To escape requires navigating the site's pages, each a different horror genre made manifest, while pursued by personalized demons drawn from their psyches.

Deeper still, they discover the website's creator: A woman named Cassandra Mora who died three years ago, her final project a VR horror game that somehow transcended digital bounds. Now she exists as the site itself, harvesting fears to build her nightmare kingdom. The party must journey through game levels, creepypasta archives, and glitched realities to reach the site's source code and delete it—or risk becoming permanent residents of a hell designed specifically for them.

## Unique Mechanics

**Sanity vs. Digital Corruption**
- Sanity tracks mental state in nightmare realm
- Digital corruption tracks becoming part of site
- Low sanity: Hallucinations, poor decisions
- High corruption: Gaining site powers but losing humanity
- Balance required: Too much either way = bad end

**Fear Manifestation System**
- Each party member creates character fear profile
- Site generates personalized monsters and scenarios
- Confronting fears: Reduces monster power, increases sanity
- Avoiding fears: Monsters grow stronger, sanity decreases
- Meta: Players' real discomfort affects character fear levels

**Admin Privilege Collection**
- Complete level challenges to earn privileges
- Each privilege grants site-manipulation power
- Examples: Ctrl+Z (undo recent event), Ctrl+F (find anything), Alt+F4 (force-close entity)
- Required amount to reach Source Code

**Page Navigation**
- Site structured as interconnected pages
- Can use in-site search function (sometimes)
- URLs provide clues to shortcuts
- Broken links are dangerous but useful
- Breadcrumb trail prevents getting lost (unless deleted)

**Reality Bleeding**
- The longer party stays, more site bleeds to real world
- Initially: Digital aesthetics in peripheral vision
- Escalating: Objects from site appear in reality
- Late stage: Can't tell which realm is which
- Endgame: Realities merging, urgent deadline

**Code Interaction**
- Party can interact with site's HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Requires knowledge checks or NPC help
- Examples: Delete objects, spawn items, edit NPCs
- Risk: Broken code causes corruption/glitches
- Advanced: Rewrite reality within site
