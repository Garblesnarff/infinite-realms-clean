# Domain of Nightmares: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone
**Aesthetic: Web 1.0 Horror + Modern UI Terror**
Mix of early internet aesthetics with contemporary web design, all corrupted.

**Color Palette:**
- **Hyperlink Blue** (#0000EE): Links, portals, connections
- **Visited Purple** (#551A8B): Corruption, accessed fears
- **Error Red** (#FF0000): Warnings, damage, danger
- **Loading Gray** (#CCCCCC): Liminal digital space
- **404 White** (#FFFFFF): Void, missing data
- **Console Black** (#000000): Source code, deep web

**Lighting:** Monitor glow, loading bar pulses, cursor spotlight, screen glare, digital phosphorescence

## Music and Sound Design
**Themes:**
- **Main Theme**: Dial-up modem sounds evolving into orchestral horror
- **Cassandra's Theme**: Lullaby played through corrupted speakers
- **Fear Manifestation Theme**: Personalized to each character's phobia
- **Source Code Theme**: Binary translated to musical notation

**Sound Design:** Click, typing, notification pings, loading sounds, error beeps, hard drive death throes, screaming compressed to 8-bit

**Voice Direction:**
- **Cassandra**: Warm developer voice degrading to text-to-speech
- **Marcus**: Tech support calm, too practiced to be real
- **404 Kid**: Child voice with audio artifacts, glitching
- **Moderators**: Speak in monotone, corporate email language
- **User_Not_Found**: Familiar voices corrupted beyond recognition

## Cinematic Moments
**Login Screen**: Username/password entry, loading bar, "Welcome" message with character's real name they never gave
**First Manifestation**: Party member's childhood fear rendering in real-time
**Forum Discovery**: Scrolling through posts from trapped users, some dated years ago
**Source Code Vision**: Reality becoming visible code, ability to see the Matrix
**Cassandra's Palace**: Gothic horror rendered in web framework
**Final Choice**: Three browser tabs open, each showing an ending, choose which to click

**Marketing Tagline**: "Welcome to Nightmara.net. You've been expecting us."
