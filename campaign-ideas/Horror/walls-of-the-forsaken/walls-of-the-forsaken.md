**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Humanity survives behind three massive concentric walls, the last refuge from the Titans—monstrous humanoid giants that devour humans for sport. The players are members of the military—the Survey Corps who venture beyond the walls, the Garrison who defend them, or the Military Police who maintain order within. When the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria, unleashing horror and revealing that some humans can transform into Titans, players must uncover the truth: the walls hold terrible secrets, the Titans were once human, and everything they've been told is a lie.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25–35 sessions)

A four-arc story of survival, conspiracy, and the horrifying truth about humanity's cage.

*   **Arc I — The Fall (Sessions 1–8):** A century of peace ends when the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Maria. Players witness the horror as Titans flood into the outer district, devouring thousands. They join the military, choosing between the Survey Corps (elite scouts), the Garrison (wall defense), or the Military Police (internal security). They learn to fight Titans using Vertical Maneuvering Equipment and begin to suspect something is wrong—Titans seem to target specific people.
*   **Arc II — The Conspiracy (Sessions 9–17):** Players discover that some humans can transform into Titans. One of their own may be a Titan shifter. They uncover evidence of a conspiracy: the true royal family, memories erased, and walls that are themselves made of dormant Titans. The Military Police attempt to silence them. The Survey Corps launches an expedition beyond the walls to find the truth.
*   **Arc III — The Truth (Sessions 18–26):** Players reach the basement of a destroyed home and find forbidden knowledge: humanity exists beyond the walls. The people inside are Eldians, a persecuted race who can become Titans. The walls were built to cage them, not protect them. The Titan threat was engineered to control the population. Everything they fought for was a lie.
*   **Arc IV — The Rumbling (Sessions 27–35):** Armed with the truth, players must choose: ally with the outside world against their own people, support the Rumbling (releasing wall Titans to destroy the world), or find a third path. The final battle determines whether humanity—inside and outside the walls—survives or perishes.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores freedom, the cycle of hatred, and whether genocide can ever be justified. The central question: "Is there a difference between the oppressed becoming oppressors and fighting for survival?" Players must navigate impossible moral choices—their people have been caged and lied to, but the outside world has its own reasons for fear. The campaign examines how trauma creates monsters, how systems of oppression perpetuate themselves, and whether breaking the cycle is possible or if it requires becoming the very thing you hate.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Vertical Maneuvering Equipment** (3D Movement)
*   Players use gas-powered grappling equipment to achieve three-dimensional movement.
*   This allows dynamic combat around Titans but requires resource management (gas and blade durability).
*   Skilled users can perform devastating attacks by building momentum.

### 2. **Titan Anatomy** (Weak Point System)
*   Titans can only be killed by destroying the nape of the neck (a 1-meter by 10-centimeter target).
*   Titans regenerate all other damage rapidly.
*   Different Titan types have different abilities: Colossal (massive, steam), Armored (hardened skin), Female (martial arts), Beast (throwing, control), etc.

### 3. **Titan Shifters** (Transformation)
*   Some players or NPCs can transform into Titans, granting immense power but limited duration (stamina-based).
*   Each Titan form has unique abilities and weaknesses.
*   Using the power repeatedly causes physical and mental strain.

### 4. **Military Branches** (Factional Reputation)
*   Players gain reputation with their chosen branch and must navigate inter-branch politics.
*   Survey Corps: Earn glory but high casualty rates.
*   Garrison: Defend but face shame for not venturing beyond walls.
*   Military Police: Comfort but complicity in corruption.

### 5. **The Horror of Titans**
*   Combat against Titans is horrifying—they're unkillable except for one spot, they regenerate, and they eat humans alive.
*   Failed saves can result in being grabbed, bitten, or devoured (instant death or severe injury).
*   The campaign emphasizes the horror and desperation of fighting impossible odds.

### 6. **Inherited Memories** (Plot Device)
*   Titan shifters can access memories from previous holders of their Titan.
*   This reveals historical truths, conspiracy, and even future events.
*   Players may experience visions that guide or horrify them.
