# Creative Brief: Walls of the Forsaken

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Medieval Horror (Attack on Titan-inspired)

Inspired by the stark, horrifying visual design of Attack on Titan, combining medieval Germanic aesthetics with body horror and militaristic precision. This style captures humanity's desperate last stand and the nightmare of the Titans.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Scale and Horror:** Emphasize the massive size difference between humans and Titans. Titans are uncanny valley—humanoid but wrong.
*   **Military Precision:** Show the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, formations, and desperate tactics humans use to fight impossible odds.
*   **Walls as Prison and Protection:** The walls dominate every vista, both safety and cage.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Titans, walls, horror, military, conspiracy, desperate survival, body horror, impossible odds, truth hidden.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense of humanity backed against the wall (literally). Terror of being devoured. The atmosphere shifts from desperate hope to horrifying revelation.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, precise linework for humans and architecture. Disturbing, grotesque forms for Titans.
*   **Forms:** Titans are anatomically wrong—skinless muscle, blank stares, uncanny movements. Humans are small, fragile, detailed.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dramatic illustration showing a 15-meter Titan in the foreground, its skinless muscle exposed, blank eyes staring. In the background, tiny human soldiers use grappling cables to attack. The scale difference is horrifying. Clean, precise linework."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated earth tones for the walled city. Blood red for Titans and violence. Gray stone for the walls. Blue sky that represents unreachable freedom.
*   **Titans:** Pink-red skinless muscle, blank eyes, steam from regeneration.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of earth tones and gray stone walls. The massive Titan is rendered in disturbing pink-red muscle tissue. Blood splatters provide the only vivid color. The blue sky above seems impossibly far away."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Humans in military uniforms (Germanic-inspired), Vertical Maneuvering Equipment strapped to their bodies, dual blades at the waist.
*   **Titans:** Ranging from 3 to 15 meters, skinless with exposed muscle, grotesque proportions, blank staring eyes, disturbing smiles.
*   **Shifters:** Humans who can transform, showing the horrific process of flesh forming and steam rising.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young soldier in Survey Corps uniform—green cape with wings of freedom emblem, brown leather straps for the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, dual blade handles at the waist. Their face shows determination mixed with terror. Behind them, the massive wall stretches into the sky."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Inside the walls: Germanic medieval towns, canals, stone architecture. Beyond the walls: destroyed ruins, Titan footprints, desolate grasslands.
*   **The Walls:** 50-meter tall stone barriers dominating every landscape, representing both protection and imprisonment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval Germanic town inside the walls. Stone buildings with steep roofs, cobblestone streets, people going about their lives. But dominating the background, the massive Wall Rose stretches into the sky, its immensity making the town feel like a cage. The wall fills half the sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, dramatic lighting that emphasizes scale and horror. Bright daylight makes the Titans more horrifying by revealing every detail.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting shows vulnerability—humans are exposed, Titans are unstoppable. Steam and blood are backlit for dramatic effect.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...harshly lit by bright daylight that reveals every horrifying detail of the Titan's anatomy. Steam from its regenerating wounds backlit by the sun. The human soldier, tiny in comparison, is silhouetted against the Titan's massive form."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Heavy use of scale—Titans dominating compositions, humans as small figures. Dynamic action showing 3D maneuvering. Wide shots emphasizing the walls.
*   **Techniques:** Low angle shots making Titans more imposing, POV shots from humans using equipment, cross-sections showing the secrets inside walls.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vertical composition showing the three walls: Wall Maria (breached, Titans inside), Wall Rose (intact), Wall Sina (pristine). The cross-section reveals the terrible secret—the walls are made of dormant Colossal Titans, their faces visible in the stone. The composition reveals the horrifying truth."

## Voice

A haunted, militaristic voice that speaks with the weight of witness to horrors. The tone is that of a Survey Corps veteran recounting their comrades' deaths and the truth they discovered. There's a sense of desperate hope crushed by terrible revelations. The voice is young adult aged prematurely by trauma, with a clipped military precision that occasionally breaks with emotion when describing losses. When describing Titans, it becomes clinical, detached—a coping mechanism. When describing the conspiracy, it becomes angry, betrayed. When discussing freedom, it becomes almost wistful, aching for something humanity inside the walls has never known. Role: A survivor telling the story so others will understand why they did what they did.
