### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Walls of the Forsaken**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Humanity survives behind three massive walls, the last refuge from man-eating Titans. When the walls are breached, players join the military to fight back using Vertical Maneuvering Equipment. They discover that some humans can transform into Titans, that the walls themselves are made of dormant Titans, and that everything they've been told is a lie. Humanity exists beyond the walls—and their people are prisoners in a massive cage, controlled through fear and erased memories.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Eldian Empire's history—a race that could become Titans, conquering the world for nearly 2000 years.
    *   Explain the Great Titan War and how King Fritz fled to the island with some Eldians, erasing their memories and creating the walls.
    *   Describe the walls' construction: Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina are made of thousands of dormant Colossal Titans held in place by the Founding Titan's power.
    *   Write the history of Marley, the nation beyond the walls that inherited Titan powers and now oppresses Eldians, sending warriors to destroy the walls.
    *   Detail the Nine Titans—unique Titan powers including the Founding Titan (controls all Titans), the Attack Titan (fights for freedom), the Colossal Titan (massive destruction), the Armored Titan (defense), etc.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Survey Corps** (Major, Elite)
        *   **Goals:** Venture beyond the walls; reclaim lost territory; discover the truth about Titans.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Commander Erwin Smith, Captain Levi, squad leaders, scouts.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Humanity's spear—explore beyond the walls and defeat Titans.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Erwin knows there's a conspiracy and is willing to sacrifice anything to uncover the truth.
        *   **Assets:** Elite soldiers, Vertical Maneuvering Equipment, Titan shifters (Eren, Armin), tactical brilliance.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed by the government; high casualties; seen as both heroes and reckless by the public.
    *   **The Military Police** (Major, Corrupt)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain order within the walls; protect the (false) royal family; suppress dissent.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Commander, officers, rank-and-file (some corrupt, some genuinely trying to help).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maintain law and order.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The true leadership works for the real royal family, suppressing any truth that could destabilize control.
        *   **Assets:** Legal authority, control of the interior, political power, Anti-Personnel Maneuvering Equipment.
        *   **Relationships:** Oppose the Survey Corps' investigation; some officers are corrupt; serve the conspiracy.
    *   **The True Royal Family (Reiss)** (Major, Hidden)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain the walls; keep humanity docile; prevent the truth from emerging; control the Founding Titan.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Rod Reiss (current head), Historia Reiss (true heir), memories passed through Founding Titan holders.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they're hidden.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They possess the Founding Titan and use it to control memories and maintain the walls. King Fritz's will prevents them from fighting.
        *   **Assets:** The Founding Titan's power, control over memories, secret police, vast resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Control the government from the shadows; will murder anyone who threatens the status quo.
    *   **Marley** (Major, Outside Threat)
        *   **Goals:** Reclaim the Founding Titan; eliminate the "Eldian devils" on the island; secure Titan powers for their military.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Marleyan government, military, Eldian warriors (Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie), ghettoized Eldians.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Defend the world from Eldian threats.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Marley oppresses Eldians and uses them as weapons. They sent the warriors to destroy the walls and steal the Founding Titan.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced technology, seven of the Nine Titans, large military, control over ghettoized Eldians.
        *   **Relationships:** The true enemy; see island Eldians as devils; use their own Eldians as disposable warriors.

        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** None—overrun by Titans. Later reclaimed by the Survey Corps.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None—this is a horror zone and later a battlefield.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Titan attack, discovery of a survivor, finding remains of loved ones, Reiner/Bertholdt revealing themselves, reaching the basement's truth.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Eren's father's basement contains the truth about the world." "The Colossal and Armored Titans were intelligent—they had a plan." "Reclaiming Shiganshina is the key to everything."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Destroyed buildings, massive hole in the wall, Titan footprints, dried blood), Sound (Eerie silence, distant Titan footsteps, wind through ruins), Smell (Decay, dust, blood).
    *   **The Wall (Any Section):** The massive 50-meter barriers that define humanity's world.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The top of the wall (patrolled by Garrison), cannons mounted on the wall, gates between districts, hidden chapel revealing the wall's secret.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Garrison soldiers, engineers, refugees during emergencies.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Defense, travel between districts (controlled), vantage point for spotting Titans.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Titan attempting to climb the wall, breach alarm, discovering a Titan face within the wall, political discussion about who gets to live inside, witnessing the horror beyond.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The walls are 50 meters tall and have never been breached—until now." "Some say the walls are made of hardened Titan material." "There's something inside the walls—something alive."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Massive stone stretching into the sky, the world beyond visible from the top, the interior city below), Sound (Wind at great height, marching patrols, distant bells), Smell (Stone, fear when Titans approach).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Wall Maria is breached.
    *   **THEN:** Humanity loses a third of its territory. Refugees flood the inner walls. Food shortages begin. The military launches a suicide mission to reclaim land, resulting in massive casualties.
    *   **IF:** A player or Eren transforms into a Titan for the first time.
    *   **THEN:** Panic, accusations of treason, military tribunal. The Survey Corps argues to weaponize them; others want execution. This reveals that humans can become Titans.
    *   **IF:** Players discover the truth in the basement.
    *   **THEN:** The entire worldview shatters. Humanity exists beyond the walls. The Eldians are prisoners. The outside world hates them. Everything must be re-evaluated.
    *   **IF:** The truth about the walls (they're made of Colossal Titans) is revealed.
    *   **THEN:** Mass panic. The walls can be destroyed from within. The royal family's deception is exposed. The Survey Corps launches a coup against the false government.
    *   **IF:** Players make contact with Marley or the outside world.
    *   **THEN:** They learn how hated Eldians are. The outside world wants them dead. The cycle of hatred is ancient and seemingly unbreakable.
    *   **IF:** The Founding Titan's power is activated without royal blood restrictions.
    *   **THEN:** Eren can use the Rumbling—releasing all wall Titans to destroy the world. This is the ultimate weapon and moral question.
    *   **IF:** The campaign concludes.
    *   **THEN:** Multiple endings: The Rumbling destroys the outside world (dark), negotiated peace (hopeful), sacrifice of Titan powers (bittersweet), or eternal conflict (realistic). Players' choices determine which world survives.
