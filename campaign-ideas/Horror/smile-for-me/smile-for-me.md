# Smile For Me
**"Go to sleep. You're beautiful. They're just jealous. He's watching."**

## Campaign Overview

A series of brutal murders terrorizes the region. Victims are found with Chelsea smiles carved into their faces, eyes burned out, or mutilated beyond recognition. The killer leaves messages written in blood: "GO TO SLEEP," "I JUST WANT TO BE BEAUTIFUL," "YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT." Local police are baffled—the murders match patterns from internet urban legends. Jeff the Killer. The Rake. Ben Drowned. Creepypasta monsters that shouldn't be real.

The party, drawn into the investigation as detectives, survivors, or vengeful relatives, discovers the truth is more horrifying than fiction. These killers are real—created through collective belief and viral spread of their stories. They exist in the space between urban legend and reality, sustained by every retelling, every YouTube video, every piece of fan art. And someone is summoning them deliberately: The Collective, a death cult that worships creepypasta entities as dark gods.

To stop the killing spree, the party must hunt each killer while avoiding becoming victims themselves. But how do you fight something that gets stronger the more people know about it? Investigating empowers the killers. Fighting them spreads their legend. The party must navigate this memetic minefield while uncovering the Collective's ultimate goal: summon all creepypasta entities to trigger an "Internet Apocalypse" where nightmares walk the earth.
