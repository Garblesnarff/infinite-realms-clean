## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Emerald Abyss
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Rainforest Survival / Mental Health / Indigenous Mystery / Survival Realism
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **9**
**Tone (keywords):** oppressive, realistic, psychological, mysterious, naturalistic, indigenous culture
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party's expedition into the uncharted Emerald Abyss—a vast, hostile rainforest—goes disastrously wrong when their guide is killed by a jaguar and half the team vanishes in a storm. Stranded deep in the jungle with minimal supplies, they must master realistic survival techniques (water purification, wound treatment, nutrition management) while their mental health deteriorates from isolation, parasites, and the constant threat of predators. An indigenous tribe watches from the shadows, and the party must decide whether to seek their help or fear them. The only way out is to reach a research station deep in the jungle, but the Abyss itself seems to resist their escape, and visions begin to plague the weak-minded.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A descent into the green hell, testing both body and mind.

*   **Act I — Lost in the Green (Levels 3–5):** The expedition disaster scatters the party. They must regroup, treat their injuries, and establish a basic survival routine (clean water, shelter, food). The jungle is unforgiving: infections, parasites, venomous creatures, and dehydration are constant threats. They encounter signs of the indigenous tribe (totems, distant drums) but no direct contact. They must also manage their deteriorating mental health—hallucinations, paranoia, and depression begin to set in.
*   **Act II — The Tribe's Test (Levels 6–7):** The party makes contact with the Yawanawa, an indigenous tribe who have survived in the Abyss for centuries. The tribe is wary but curious. To earn their trust and gain a guide to the research station, the party must complete trials (hunting a great beast, surviving a sacred hallucinogenic ritual, proving they respect the jungle). They learn of the Lost City, an ancient ruin deeper in the jungle that the tribe avoids, fearing its curse.
*   **Act III — The Abyss Revealed (Levels 8–9):** On the journey to the research station, the party discovers the Lost City. Inside, they find evidence of a previous expedition that went mad, and a strange, crystalline growth that induces hallucinations and paranoia. The research station is in ruins, overrun by the jungle. The final challenge is to repair a radio and call for rescue while defending against both the jungle's predators and their own fractured minds. The campaign ends with either a successful rescue or a descent into madness, becoming part of the Abyss forever.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "The Storm"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Disaster / Immediate Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party's expedition is caught in a sudden, violent storm. Their guide is killed, and the group is scattered.
    *   They must regroup in the chaos, treating injuries (broken bones, lacerations, sprains) and finding shelter from the torrential rain.
    *   The jungle is disorienting. Without a guide, navigation is a constant challenge (Survival checks, mapping).
**Escalation:** One party member is bitten by a venomous snake. They must quickly identify the species and administer treatment or the venom will incapacitate them.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Survival Basics"
*   **Focus:** Realistic Survival Mechanics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must master basic survival: building a lean-to shelter, purifying water (boiling, charcoal filters), and foraging for safe food (checking for poison, testing small amounts).
    *   They must treat wounds and illnesses: leeches, parasitic worms, infected cuts, dysentery. Medicine checks are crucial.
    *   They craft tools from jungle materials (bamboo spears, stone knives, rope from vines).
    *   Mental health begins to decline. Isolation, stress, and poor nutrition cause Sanity loss.
**Escalation:** A jaguar stalks the party. They hear its roar at night and find its tracks near their shelter. They must decide: hunt it, scare it off, or relocate.

### Sessions 5-6 — "First Contact"
*   **Focus:** Indigenous Encounter / Cultural Challenge
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party discovers a Yawanawa totem and realizes they are being watched.
    *   A lone Yawanawa hunter approaches cautiously. Communication is difficult (language barrier, gestures).
    *   The hunter offers to take them to the tribe's village, but only if they prove they are not a threat.
    *   The party must navigate a cultural test: respecting the jungle, accepting a peace offering, or demonstrating strength without aggression.
**Escalation:** A rival tribe, the hostile Bloodwood Warriors, attacks. The party must fight alongside the Yawanawa or flee.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Aiyanna** — *The Shaman*
    *   **Role:** The Yawanawa tribe's spiritual leader, a wise woman who can read the jungle and the souls of outsiders.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, inscrutable, and deeply connected to the jungle. She speaks in riddles and visions, testing the party's intentions.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Aiyanna knows the truth of the Lost City—it was built by an ancient civilization that tried to control the jungle and was consumed by it. She fears the party will repeat their mistake.

2.  **Kael — The Survivor** — *The Madman*
    *   **Role:** A member of a previous expedition, found living alone in the jungle, half-mad from isolation and the Lost City's influence.
    *   **Personality:** Paranoid, erratic, and obsessed with the Lost City. He believes it holds a treasure that justifies the suffering.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Kael is infected by a parasitic fungus from the Lost City that induces hallucinations and aggression. He is both a guide and a threat.

3.  **The Jaguar Spirit** — *The Apex*
    *   **Role:** A legendary jaguar revered by the Yawanawa as a guardian spirit of the jungle. It is a real, massive predator but also a symbol.
    *   **Personality:** Silent, patient, and deadly. It hunts the party as both a test and a threat.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Jaguar Spirit is the final trial. To leave the Abyss, one must either kill it (proving dominance) or gain its respect (proving wisdom).

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about survival in the most hostile, realistic environment possible. It captures the brutal realism of *Green Hell*: every cut can become infected, every meal must be carefully checked, and mental health is as fragile as physical health. The central conflict is the party's struggle against the jungle itself, an environment that is beautiful, alive, and utterly indifferent to their suffering. The indigenous tribe represents a path to survival through respect and adaptation, while the Lost City represents the hubris of trying to conquer nature.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Realistic Survival: The Four Pillars**
*   **Hydration:** Characters must drink clean water regularly or suffer exhaustion. Dirty water causes disease.
*   **Nutrition:** A balanced diet (proteins, carbs, fats) is required. Poor nutrition causes weakness and Sanity loss.
*   **Sanity:** Isolation, poor nutrition, illness, and supernatural events drain Sanity. Low Sanity causes hallucinations, paranoia, and poor decision-making.
*   **Health:** Injuries and diseases must be treated. Infections can turn deadly. Medicine checks are essential.

### 2. **Wound & Disease Management**
*   Wounds progress: Cut → Infected Cut → Sepsis (deadly).
*   Common diseases: Dysentery (from dirty water), Parasitic Worms (from undercooked meat), Fungal Infections (from moisture).
*   Treatment requires: Clean water, bandages, herbal remedies, Medicine checks.

### 3. **Mental Health System**
*   Sanity is tracked separately. It decreases from: isolation, witnessing death, eating poorly, illness, supernatural events.
*   Sanity is restored by: companionship, good food, restful sleep, achieving goals, spiritual rituals.
*   At low Sanity, characters hallucinate (see threats that aren't there), become paranoid (distrust allies), or catatonic (refuse to act).

### 4. **Indigenous Knowledge**
*   The Yawanawa can teach the party: which plants are safe to eat, how to craft better tools, how to navigate the jungle, and how to avoid predators.
*   Learning from them requires respect, cultural sensitivity, and passing their trials.

### 5. **The Jungle as an Enemy**
*   The jungle is not a static dungeon. It is alive and hostile:
    *   **Weather:** Sudden storms, oppressive heat, and humidity.
    *   **Predators:** Jaguars, venomous snakes, caimans, piranhas.
    *   **Hazards:** Poisonous plants, quicksand, unstable ground, parasites.
    *   **Disorientation:** The dense canopy makes navigation nearly impossible without landmarks or the tribe's help.
