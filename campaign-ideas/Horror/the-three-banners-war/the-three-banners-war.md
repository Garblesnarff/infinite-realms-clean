## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A tale of political manipulation, daedric schemes, and the cost of endless war.

*   **Act I — The Soulless (Sessions 1–5):** The party awakens in Coldharbour with no memory of how they died. They escape with the help of a mysterious Prophet and return to Tamriel to discover they are Soulless—undying but incomplete. They must choose which alliance to support while investigating who stole their souls and why.
*   **Act II — The Three Banners (Sessions 6–11):** The players navigate the complex politics of the three alliances while fighting Molag Bal's minions. They discover Mannimarco the necromancer is working with the Daedric Prince, sacrificing souls to power the Planemeld. The party must unite heroes from all three factions for an assault on Coldharbour.
*   **Act III — The Planemeld (Sessions 12–15+):** The party leads a coalition into Coldharbour itself, navigating the nightmarish realm of torture and enslavement. They must defeat Molag Bal's generals, free enslaved souls, and ultimately challenge the Daedric Prince himself. Victory restores their souls and weakens the Planemeld, giving Tamriel a chance for peace.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity without a soul, the futility of endless war, and redemption through sacrifice. The central conflict is both external (stopping Molag Bal) and internal (what does it mean to be heroic when you've lost your very essence?).

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Soulless Condition**
*   Players cannot truly die. When killed, they respawn at the nearest wayshrine.
*   However, they are incomplete: -2 to Charisma, disadvantage on death saving throws.
*   Certain holy sites and magic don't recognize them as fully alive.
*   This condition is only cured by defeating Molag Bal or making a terrible bargain.

### 2. **Alliance Reputation**
*   Track reputation with all three alliances separately (-10 to +10).
*   High rep grants access to alliance-specific quests, equipment, and NPCs.
*   Players can maintain neutral standing or commit to one alliance.
*   Certain story choices permanently lock alliance reputations.

### 3. **Dark Anchor Events**
*   Random encounters where Daedric portals drop from the sky.
*   If not stopped within a time limit, the area becomes corrupted and spawns continuous demons.
*   Successfully closing anchors grants powerful loot and weakens the Planemeld.
*   Multiple Dark Anchors active make the final battle harder.

### 4. **Cyrodiil Warfare**
*   A large-scale PvP/PvE hybrid zone where players fight for control.
*   Capture keeps, resources, and scrolls for your alliance.
*   Success grants Alliance Points usable for powerful gear and abilities.
*   The alliance controlling the most territory gets bonuses in the final assault.

### 5. **Skill Lines**
*   Players can invest in different skill lines based on their choices:
    *   Alliance War: Tactical abilities for mass combat.
    *   Vampire/Werewolf: Cursed transformations with pros and cons.
    *   Soul Magic: Powers drawn from understanding the Soulless condition.
    *   Crafting: Create powerful gear from Tamriel's diverse resources.
