### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Curse of Lea Monde**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Elite agent Ashley Riot pursues a cult into the cursed dark city of Lea Monde. The abandoned Gothic metropolis warps reality and memory. What seems a rescue mission reveals a conspiracy - Ashley was sent to be corrupted or killed. As he descends into nightmare catacombs, he must question his memories, identity, and purpose while surviving alone through weapon crafting and tactical combat.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Lea Monde's destruction centuries ago - a catastrophe sealed the Dark beneath the city.
    *   Write the history of Riskbreakers - agents conditioned to suppress emotion, perfect vessels for possession.
    *   Describe the Dark - divine power that corrupts, sought by cults and churches alike.
    *   Explain the political conspiracy between Duke Bardorba, the Church, and rival factions.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **Ashley (Alone)** (Major): One-man survival against city, cult, conspiracy, and corruption.
    *   **Müllenkamp Cult** (Major - Antagonist): Sydney's followers seeking transcendence through the Dark.
    *   **Valendia Church** (Complex): Employs Ashley but knowingly sent him into corruption.
    *   **Political Factions** (Background): Manipulate events from outside, seeking the Dark's power.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Locations:** Lea Monde districts (workshops, temples, catacombs, noble quarters), The Undercity (ancient ruins), Grand Cathedral (Sydney's lair).

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Ashley resists the Dark's corruption throughout.
*   **THEN:** Ending shows him escaping Lea Monde but questioning if any of his identity was real.
*   **IF:** Ashley accepts the Dark's power.
*   **THEN:** He becomes something inhuman, either escaping as a monster or sealing himself in Lea Monde.
*   **IF:** Ashley finds balance - accepting some corruption while maintaining core self.
*   **THEN:** Ambiguous ending - he survives changed but not destroyed, carrying the Dark within but not consumed.
