### Core Premise
A single player (or small focused party) plays as Ashley Riot, an elite Riskbreaker (special agent) of the Valendia Knights of Peace, sent to investigate a cult kidnapping in the abandoned dark city of Lea Monde. What begins as a rescue mission becomes a nightmarish descent into conspiracy, religious manipulation, body horror, and questions of identity. The cursed city warps reality and memory. Ancient powers lurk in the depths. The cult leader Sydney Losstarot seeks to become a god using the city's dark power. As Ashley explores deeper, he must confront the possibility that his memories are lies, his mission a manipulation, and his very identity uncertain. The campaign emphasizes atmosphere, weapon crafting customization, solo survival, and gradual unraveling of sanity.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Descent (Sessions 1-5)**
- Ashley pursues cult leader Sydney into Lea Monde after a kidnapping. The city is cursed - abandoned centuries ago after a catastrophe, now a labyrinth of baroque architecture and nightmarish creatures. Ashley must navigate trap-filled halls, craft weapons from enemy parts, and survive alone. He rescues the kidnap victim but discovers she's Sydney's willing pawn. Flashbacks reveal Ashley's past - or do they? Reality becomes uncertain in Lea Monde.

**Act 2: The Conspiracy (Sessions 6-10)**
- Ashley learns the kidnapping was a setup to lure him specifically to Lea Monde. Sydney needs Ashley as a vessel - Riskbreakers are conditioned to suppress emotions, making them perfect hosts for ancient powers. The Valendia Church, Ashley's employer, knew this and sent him anyway. Political factions manipulate events from outside the city. Meanwhile, Ashley crafts stronger weapons from bizarre materials and delves deeper into cursed catacombs where reality fails.

**Act 3: The Truth (Sessions 11-15)**
- In Lea Monde's deepest chambers, Ashley confronts Sydney and the truth: the city contains the Dark - a divine power that corrupts. Sydney has been manipulated by forces beyond mortality. Ashley's memories of his wife and son may be false implants. The Church, the cult, rival nobles - all seek to control the Dark. Ashley must choose: resist the Dark and die, accept it and lose himself, or find a third path that destroys the cycle. The final battle occurs in body and soul simultaneously.

### Key Locations

- **Lea Monde - The Dark City**: Abandoned Gothic metropolis, cursed and reality-warped. Districts include workshops, temples, catacombs, noble quarters - all decayed and monstrous.
- **The Undercity**: Beneath Lea Monde, ancient civilization's ruins where the Dark sleeps.
- **The Grand Cathedral**: Sydney's base, warped religious architecture mixed with body horror.
- **Wine Cellars & Workshops**: Where Ashley crafts weapons from enemy components and found materials.

### Central Conflict
Ashley must survive Lea Monde while questioning his identity, resisting corruption, and navigating conspiracies. The conflict is physical (survival against monsters), mental (maintaining sanity), and philosophical (what is identity if memories are false?). Themes include religious manipulation, body horror, the price of power, and whether we are defined by memories or choices.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Weapon Crafting System**: Ashley can craft and customize weapons using materials from defeated enemies, found treasures, and environmental components. Different blade types have affinities against different enemy types (human, undead, beast, phantom, dragon, evil). Players can min-max weapons for specific encounters. Weapon naming is important - give personal identity to custom tools.
- **Chain Attacks & Weakpoints**: Combat focuses on targeting specific body parts. Successful chains against weak points (head, torso, limbs) increase damage multipliers. This tactical system rewards player skill and observation over pure stats.
- **Risk Points**: Instead of traditional HP, track Risk. Taking damage raises Risk, which increases damage taken (death spiral) but also increases damage dealt (high risk, high reward). Managing Risk through healing and defensive play is crucial.
- **The Dark**: Track corruption from Lea Monde's influence. Making dark choices, spending too long in cursed areas, or using certain powers increases it. High corruption changes Ashley's appearance and dialogue but also grants power. The ending varies based on final corruption level.
- **Memory Fragments**: Scattered throughout Lea Monde are memory crystals showing Ashley's past. However, they contradict each other. Players must piece together which memories are real, which are implanted, and what that means for Ashley's identity.
