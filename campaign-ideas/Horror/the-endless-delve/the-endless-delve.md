**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Undermaze is a legendary mega-dungeon descending into the earth—twenty-three known levels, each larger and stranger than the last, with rumors of levels beyond counting. What began as a dwarven mine millennia ago has been built upon by countless civilizations—each level a different era, ecosystem, and danger. The party begins as novice adventurers seeking fortune in the upper levels and progresses into legendary heroes delving where no one has survived. Each level holds mysteries: Who built it? How deep does it go? What lies at the bottom? And most importantly—what if something at the bottom is trying to climb up?

## Story Arc

This is a progressive mega-dungeon where the story emerges from exploration rather than predetermined plot:

* **Levels 1-5 (Sessions 1-10):** The Upper Delve—relatively normal dungeon, goblins, traps, establishing the mystery.
* **Levels 6-10 (Sessions 11-20):** The Middle Depths—stranger creatures, rival adventuring parties, hints of greater mysteries.
* **Levels 11-15 (Sessions 21-30):** The Deep Delve—alien civilizations, reality becoming strange, major revelations.
* **Levels 16-20 (Sessions 31-40):** The Abyssal Strata—near-impossible challenges, cosmic horror, legendary threats.
* **Levels 21-23+ (Sessions 41+):** The Bottom (?)—what lies at the deepest levels is unknown; party discovers it.
