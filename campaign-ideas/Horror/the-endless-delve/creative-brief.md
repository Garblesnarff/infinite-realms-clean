# Creative Brief: The Endless Delve

## Art Style: Classic Dungeon meets Progressive Strangeness

Inspired by D&D's Undermountain, Dark Souls, The Abyss Made Flesh concept, and classic mega-dungeons. Each level has its own visual theme while maintaining the sense of descending into greater strangeness.

### Visual Principles:
* **Progressive Strangeness**: Upper levels look normal; deep levels break reality.
* **Architectural Variety**: Each level has distinct style—dwarven, elven, alien, impossible.
* **Scale Increase**: Levels get larger, more impressive, more dangerous as party descends.
* **Depth Indication**: Visual cues showing how far down you've gone.

### Color Palette Per Section:
* **Upper Delve (1-5)**: Earth tones, torch-light, classic dungeon aesthetics.
* **Middle Depths (6-10)**: Introduction of stranger colors, magic-infused areas.
* **Deep Delve (11-15)**: Reality-bending colors, impossible hues, alien aesthetics.
* **Abyssal Strata (16-20)**: Cosmic horror palette, colors that hurt to perceive.
* **The Bottom (21+)**: Beyond description; visual representation breaks down.

### Character Design:
Progressive power growth visible. Start: Novice adventurers with basic gear. Middle: Competent heroes with magic equipment. End: Legendary warriors in artifacts, barely recognizable as the characters who started.

## Music Direction:
Each level has distinct musical theme. Upper levels—classic adventure music. Middle levels—increasingly strange instruments and melodies. Deep levels—music becomes uncomfortable, alien. Bottom levels—barely music at all, cosmic sounds.

## Voice Acting:
The Delve Master speaks with ageless knowledge. Rival adventurers range from cocky to terrified based on how deep they've gone. Inhabitants of deep levels speak in increasingly alien ways. The Thing Below doesn't speak—its presence is felt.
