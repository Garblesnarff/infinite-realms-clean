# The Never-Ending Morning - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Groundhog Day meets Waking Life meets Before I Wake. Morning sunlight that feels wrong. Domestic spaces that are subtly unsettling.

**Color Palette:**
- **Early Loops**: Warm morning golds, soft sunshine
- **Mid Loops**: Colors slightly too bright, unnatural saturation
- **Late Loops**: Washed out, dreamlike, hazy
- **Deep Loops**: Normal but you can't trust it

## Art Direction
- **Bedroom**: Same but different each loop (details shift)
- **Morning Light**: Beautiful but eventually ominous
- **Routine Objects**: Alarm clocks, toasters, showers—slowly becoming uncanny
- **The Morning King**: Too awake, too cheerful, coffee cup always full
- **Loop Indicators**: Subtle wrongness—clock in wrong place, wrong weather

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Alarm variations—peaceful chimes to violent buzzing
**Loop Reset**: Sound of rewinding, return to alarm
**Morning King Theme**: Aggressively cheerful morning show music
**Deepening Dread**: Morning sounds (birds, coffee brewing) becoming sinister through repetition

**Sound Design:**
- Alarm clock (different each loop)
- Shower running
- Coffee percolating
- Toast popping
- Footsteps on same floor
These sounds become psychological warfare through repetition

## Voice Direction
**Morning King**: Radio host cheerful, infomercial energetic, unbearably peppy
**First Sleeper**: Shifts between lucid and mad, knows truth but can't communicate clearly
**The Snooze Button**: Seductive whisper, promises comfort
**Dawn (The Truly Awake)**: Calm certainty, or is that suspicious?

## Cinematic Moments
- **First False Wake**: Relief turning to horror
- **Loop 50**: Montage of same morning different ways
- **The Realization**: Understanding how deep they are
- **Breaking Free**: Final morning that feels genuinely different
- **Ambiguous Ending**: Did they really wake? (Audience shares doubt)
