A necromantic plague has swept across the land, raising the dead as mindless walkers who devour the living.

As they build and protect communities, they must grapple with the question: what are you willing to become to survive?

## Central Conflict

Humanity versus itself. The campaign explores how civilization breaks down, what people become when laws don't exist, and whether morality is a luxury or a necessity. The dead are the environment—the real story is about what survivors do to each other and themselves.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Resource Scarcity**
*   Food, water, ammo, and medicine are constantly limited. Tough choices about allocation.

### 2. **Walker Encounters**
*   Walkers aren't the main challenge but ever-present environmental threat. Noise attracts hordes.

### 3. **Community Morale**
*   Track the settlement's hope versus despair. Low morale leads to defections, conflict, and mistakes.

### 4. **Humanity Tracker**
*   Character choices affect their moral state. Become too ruthless and they lose themselves. Too idealistic and they endanger others.

### 5. **Permadeath Weight**
*   Character death is possible and permanent, making every risk meaningful.
