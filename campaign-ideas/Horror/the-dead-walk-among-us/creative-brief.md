# Creative Brief: The Dead Walk Among Us

## Art Style: Gritty Survival Realism

Inspired by The Walking Dead's unflinching portrayal of zombie apocalypse, emphasizing human drama over horror, with muted colors and focus on character expressions showing the psychological toll of survival.

### Core Principles:

*   **Weathered Realism:** Everything shows wear, dirt, and decay.
*   **Human Focus:** Faces tell the story—exhaustion, grief, determination, moral conflict.
*   **Environmental Decay:** Civilization slowly reclaimed by nature and death.

### Style Guide:

**Character Design:** Practical survival clothing, increasingly ragged. Dirty faces, injured bodies, tired eyes.

**Color Palette:** Muted greens and browns, faded colors, dust and grime over everything. Blood is the only vibrant color.

**Environments:** Rural South aesthetic, abandoned buildings, makeshift fortifications, nature reclaiming cities.

**Walkers:** Decayed but realistic—showing stages of decomposition, practical gore.

## Voice

Southern American accents, weary tones, voices that have seen too much. Range from hardened survivors to those clinging to hope.

## Music

*   Minimalist acoustic—guitar, harmonica.
*   Silence used effectively.
*   Occasional mournful strings for emotional weight.
