### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Dead Walk Among Us**

**1. Core Concept**
*   A necromantic plague raises the dead as mindless walkers. The party navigates collapsed civilization where human conflict is more dangerous than the undead, building communities while grappling with moral erosion in desperate times.

**2. Lore & History**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the plague's onset—rapid collapse of civilization, how quickly society fell apart.
    *   Explain walker behavior—attracted to noise and movement, bite spreads infection, only destroying the brain stops them.
    *   Describe the timeline—weeks to months to years as survivors adapt.
    *   Chronicle the emergence of different survivor philosophies—brutal pragmatism, hopeful idealism, nihilistic surrender.

**3. Factions**
*   **The Party's Settlement** (Major): Attempting to maintain morality while surviving.
*   **Woodbury** (Major): Governor's authoritarian "safety" built on cruelty.
*   **The Saviors** (Major - Later): Negan's protection racket empire.
*   **Various Small Groups** (Minor): Each with different survival strategies and moral codes.

**4. NPCs**
*   **Tier 1:** Rick-figure, The Governor, Michonne-figure, Negan, key settlement members.
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** Survivors with different skills, personalities, and breaking points.

**5. Locations**
*   **The Camp/Prison/Fort:** Evolving home base showing improvement or decline.
*   **Woodbury:** False utopia hiding darkness.
*   **Scavenging Sites:** Stores, homes, hospitals picked clean over time.
*   **The Wilderness:** Roads between settlements where danger lurks.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party maintains moral code.
*   **THEN:** Community has higher morale but faces more challenges; attracts idealistic survivors.
*   **IF:** Party becomes ruthless.
*   **THEN:** More effective survival but community fractures; becomes what they fought against.
*   **IF:** Party defeats the Governor.
*   **THEN:** Woodbury survivors join or scatter; new threats emerge in power vacuum.
*   **IF:** Resources run critically low.
*   **THEN:** Desperate choices required; trust breaks down; violence between survivors increases.
