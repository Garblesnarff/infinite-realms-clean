# Creative Brief: Treasure Hunt of the Damned

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Spaghetti Western with Dark Fantasy Elements

Inspired by the stark, sun-bleached cinematography of Sergio Leone's westerns, particularly *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*. This style captures the moral ambiguity of the frontier, the harsh beauty of desert landscapes, the intimacy of extreme close-ups contrasted with sweeping vistas, and the supernatural horror lurking beneath scorched earth.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Harsh Contrasts:** Extreme close-ups of weathered faces versus vast empty landscapes, bright sun against deep shadows
*   **War-Torn Desolation:** Burned towns, shattered battlefields, hanging corpses, destroyed infrastructure
*   **Iconic Western Imagery:** Ponchos, wide-brimmed hats, gun belts, spurs, dusters covered in trail dust
*   **Cursed Gold Atmosphere:** Supernatural elements bleed into realistic western—undead soldiers, cursed artifacts, ghostly apparitions

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, morally ambiguous, sun-scorched, operatic violence, Mexican standoff, war-scarred, cursed treasure
*   **Feeling:** The epic loneliness of the frontier mixed with constant threat of sudden violence. Beautiful desolation hiding terrible secrets. Every choice matters; trust is foolish but sometimes necessary.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant:** Sun-bleached desert tans, dusty browns, parched yellows, faded ochre
*   **Accents:** Deep shadow blacks, dried blood rust-red, tarnished gold, gunmetal gray
*   **Sky:** Intense blue or burnt orange sunsets, never gentle
*   **Supernatural:** Sickly green phantom light, corpse-pale blue, tarnished gold glow
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by sun-bleached desert tans and dusty browns under an intense cloudless blue sky. Deep black shadows fall across weathered wooden structures. Accents of dried blood rust-red on wanted posters and tarnished gold glinting from partially buried coins. Faded ponchos in muted earth tones."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Good:** Clean poncho over trail-worn clothes, wide-brimmed hat shading eyes, cigarillo, twin revolvers, weathered but noble face
*   **The Bad:** All black duster and hat, silver pistol, cold eyes, immaculate despite desert, aura of death
*   **The Ugly:** Ragged poncho, battered hat, stubble, scarred face, mismatched weapons scavenged from kills
*   **War Survivors:** Tattered uniforms (Imperial blue-gray or Rebel butternut), missing limbs, haunted eyes, desperate
*   **Prompt Example:** "A weathered gunslinger in a sun-faded poncho draped over trail-worn leather vest. Wide-brimmed hat casts shadow over sharp eyes and stubbled jaw. Cigarillo smoke curls upward. Twin revolvers in worn holsters. Face is deeply lined from desert sun, combination of nobility and ruthlessness. Dust covers boots and spurs."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Desert Wastes:** Endless sand, scattered rock formations, sun-bleached bones, abandoned wagons, no water
*   **War-Torn Towns:** Burned buildings, hanging bodies, bullet-riddled walls, shattered windows, empty streets
*   **Battlefields:** Crater-marked earth, rusted cannons, skeletal remains in uniforms, broken weapons, crows circling
*   **Sad Hill Cemetery:** Thousands of simple wooden crosses on barren hillside, some graves fresh, massive and desolate
*   **Prompt Example:** "A destroyed frontier town with burned-out buildings and bullet-riddled walls. Wooden structures collapsed inward from fire. A hanged man swings from a crooked gallows in the town square. Sun-bleached wanted posters peel from walls. Empty street covered in dust and spent shell casings. Mountains visible in harsh distance under merciless sun."

**5. Action & Combat:**
*   **Mexican Standoffs:** Three-way gun confrontation, extreme close-ups of eyes and gun hands, wide shots showing positions
*   **Quick-Draw Duels:** Split-second gunfights, focus on hand reaching for pistol, dust kicked up
*   **Environmental Violence:** Explosions destroying cover, bullets ricocheting, bodies falling from heights
*   **Prompt Example:** "Mexican standoff in a circular formation—three gunslingers with revolvers drawn, each aiming at another creating a triangle of death. Extreme close-up shows sweat on temple, eye twitching, finger on trigger. Wide shot reveals their positions in dusty town square, tumbleweeds blowing between them. Sun directly overhead creates minimal shadows."

**6. Supernatural Elements:**
*   **Cursed Gold:** Tarnished gold coins that glow with sickly light, surrounded by phantom mist
*   **Undead Soldiers:** Confederate and Imperial corpses rising from graves, tattered uniforms, skeletal faces, spectral weapons
*   **Phantom Warnings:** Ghostly soldiers appearing in mirror, water, or heat shimmer
*   **Prompt Example:** "A skeletal hand in tattered Confederate uniform emerging from freshly disturbed grave dirt. Bones wrapped in rotted gray cloth. Empty eye sockets glow with pale blue phantom light. Rusted rifle bayonet gripped in bony fingers. Background shows rows of similar graves beginning to stir under full moon. Mist rises from disturbed earth."

**7. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Harsh Sunlight:** Extreme highlights and deep shadows, squinting against brightness
*   **Golden Hour:** Long shadows, warm orange light, silhouettes against setting sun
*   **Moonlight:** Cold blue light on cemetery, sharp shadows, things moving in darkness
*   **Firelight:** Warm but threatening, dancing shadows, faces half-lit
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh desert sun at high noon creating extreme contrast. Deep black shadows under hat brim obscure eyes. Bright highlights on metal gun parts and belt buckle. Background landscape washed out in intense light. Heat shimmer visible rising from sand. No middle tones, only brightest highlights and darkest shadows."

**8. Cinematic Composition:**
*   **Extreme Close-Ups:** Eyes, gun hands, sweating faces, trigger fingers
*   **Extreme Wide Shots:** Tiny figures in vast desert, emphasizing isolation
*   **Low Angles:** Looking up at gunfighters against sky, making them mythic
*   **Over-Shoulder:** Looking down gun barrel at target
*   **Prompt Example:** "Extreme close-up of weathered eyes beneath hat brim, pupils contracting in bright sun. Reflection of enemy in iris visible. Stubble and sun-damaged skin fill frame. Sweat bead rolls down temple. Cut to: Extreme wide shot of same figure as tiny silhouette in vast empty desert, dust devil swirling in distance."

## Music & Sound

*   **Musical Style:** Ennio Morricone-inspired—haunting whistles, Spanish guitar, lonely harmonica, building tension, sudden bursts
*   **Key Instruments:** Solo trumpet (lonely and heroic), whistling (haunting), acoustic guitar (Spanish style), bells (death toll), whip crack percussion
*   **Tempo & Pacing:** Slow builds with sudden explosive releases, long silent pauses filled with ambient wind
*   **Vocal Elements:** Wordless male choir for epic moments, lone whistle for travel, coyote howls for danger
*   **Combat Music:** Building tension with ticking clock sounds, heartbeat bass, sudden gunshot percussion
*   **Supernatural:** Dissonant strings, ghostly whispers, music box playing distorted version of main theme

## Voice

A gravelly, laconic voice that speaks few words but makes each one count. Long pauses between phrases. The pacing is deliberate, like someone who has seen too much and says only what's necessary. Tone shifts between dry humor ("There are two kinds of people in this world..."), cold threat ("When you have to shoot, shoot—don't talk"), and rare moments of tragic introspection. Slightly raspy from dust and cigars. Accent is indeterminate frontier—could be anywhere. Role: The voice of the morally ambiguous survivor.
