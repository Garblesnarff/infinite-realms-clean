## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act tale of pursuit, betrayal, and the brutal reality of treasure hunting in a lawless land.

*   **Act I — The Hunt Begins (Sessions 1-6):** Three rival groups learn of the legendary Confederate gold hidden during the war's final days. Each has part of the puzzle—one knows the cemetery, one knows the grave name, one has the map. Through violence, manipulation, and reluctant cooperation, they must navigate the war-torn frontier while staying ahead of Imperial forces and bandits. The gold becomes an obsession.
*   **Act II — Through the Valley of Death (Sessions 7-13):** The journey forces temporary alliances as they cross hostile territories—scorched battlefields still littered with dead, prison camps, desert wastes, and towns destroyed by war. Each group betrays and saves the others in turn. They encounter the war's human cost and question if gold is worth the price. Tension builds toward inevitable confrontation.
*   **Act III — The Cemetery & The Standoff (Sessions 14-20):** All roads lead to Sad Hill Cemetery, a vast graveyard holding thousands of war dead. As they race to dig up the gold before armies arrive, they discover the treasure is cursed—those who claim it without honoring the dead will join them. The campaign climaxes in a three-way Mexican standoff where only cooperation or perfect treachery will determine who walks away alive.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores moral ambiguity in desperate times, the cost of greed versus honor, and whether redemption is possible after terrible choices. It asks: Is there such a thing as "good" in war? Can treasure justify the means to obtain it? When does survival become evil? The central conflict pits three different moral philosophies against each other in a race where only the most adaptable will survive, and where the real treasure might be keeping your humanity intact.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Three-Way Rivalry System**
*   Campaign designed for three competing parties or factions within one party
*   Each group has different victory conditions and information
*   Temporary alliances can form and break based on circumstances
*   Trust is a resource that can be spent and betrayed
*   Final confrontation requires players to pre-commit to cooperation or treachery

### 2. **Mexican Standoff Encounters**
*   Special combat encounters where initiative doesn't matter—all shoot simultaneously
*   Players declare targets and actions in secret
*   All resolve at once, creating high-stakes gambling on who shoots whom
*   Running or cooperation are valid tactical choices
*   Used at crucial decision points throughout campaign

### 3. **Information Economy**
*   Each piece of information (cemetery, grave name, map) is valuable currency
*   Information can be traded, stolen, tortured out, or shared
*   Partial information is dangerous—leads to wrong locations or traps
*   Some NPCs have false information deliberately
*   Final treasure requires combining all three pieces correctly

### 4. **War-Torn Frontier**
*   Random encounters include battles still being fought between remnants
*   Both sides will conscript, rob, or execute the party
*   Civilian casualties and atrocities force moral choices
*   Helping refugees costs time but may provide information or aid later
*   The war's trauma affects every location and NPC

### 5. **The Curse of Confederate Gold**
*   Gold radiates dark energy that attracts undead and causes nightmares
*   Those who touch it become obsessed with claiming it
*   Curse can only be lifted by properly honoring the fallen who owned it
*   Taking gold without lifting curse results in slow supernatural death
*   Final choice: greed or redemption

### 6. **Reputation & Recognition**
*   Actions in each region affect how NPCs react later
*   Helping townsfolk may mean they hide you from authorities
*   War crimes or betrayals make you hunted by survivors
*   Different factions remember differently (one's hero is another's villain)
*   Final standoff affected by who owes you and who wants you dead

### 7. **Survival Resources**
*   Ammunition is limited and valuable—every shot matters
*   Water in desert sections becomes critical resource
*   Medicine and supplies scarce in war-devastated regions
*   Horses can die, leaving party stranded
*   Resource management creates tough choices (supplies or speed?)
