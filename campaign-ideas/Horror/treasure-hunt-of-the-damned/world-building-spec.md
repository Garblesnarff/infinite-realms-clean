### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Treasure Hunt of the Damned**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the aftermath of a devastating civil war, three rival factions race across a war-torn frontier to claim legendary Confederate gold hidden in a nameless cemetery. Each has part of the puzzle—cemetery location, grave name, or map. Through double-crosses and fragile alliances, they'll discover the gold carries a terrible curse and that survival means knowing when to shoot and when to trust.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Civil War between the Empire (industrialized north) and the Confederacy (agrarian south)—causes, major battles, and devastating conclusion.
    *   Write the history of the legendary 200,000 gold pieces—who gathered it, why it was hidden, and how it became cursed.
    *   Describe the Battle of Sad Hill where thousands died and the cemetery was created.
    *   Explain the curse mechanics—the gold belonged to soldiers who died unavenged and dishonored.
    *   Detail the legend of the Priest of Sad Hill who tried to properly bury the gold but died in the attempt.
    *   Chronicle the post-war frontier—lawlessness, remnant forces, bandit kingdoms, Imperial reconstruction efforts.

*   **Medical:** Civil War era—amputation common, morphine addiction, field surgery.
*   **Infrastructure:** Roads destroyed, bridges blown, towns burned, everything in ruins.

**10. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party helps refugees → **THEN:** Townsfolk hide them from authorities, provide information.
*   **IF:** Party commits war crimes → **THEN:** Survivors hunt them, wanted posters spread, curse intensifies.
*   **IF:** One faction betrays alliance → **THEN:** Power balance shifts, new alliances form, trust becomes impossible.
*   **IF:** Gold is touched without ritual → **THEN:** Obsession sets in, nightmares begin, slow necrotic death.
*   **IF:** Imperial army reaches cemetery first → **THEN:** Military lockdown, artillery bombardment begins.
*   **IF:** Undead are fought without honoring them → **THEN:** More rise, curse spreads, cemetery becomes impassable.
*   **IF:** Party cooperates in final standoff → **THEN:** Treasure split, curse lifted, redemption possible.
*   **IF:** Party chooses treachery in final standoff → **THEN:** Mexican standoff resolves violently, survivors haunted.

**11. Rival Progress & Competition**
*   **Tracking System:** Other factions make independent progress toward gold.
*   **NPC Intelligence:** Rivals learn from party's mistakes and successes.
*   **Race Dynamics:** If party delays, rivals get closer; if party rushes, they miss crucial information.
*   **Alliance Offers:** Rivals may propose temporary truces based on circumstances.
*   **Betrayal Triggers:** NPCs betray when they have sufficient advantage or become desperate.

*   **Reliability:** All information suspect—deliberate lies, torture-induced false confessions, genuine confusion.
*   **Verification:** Cross-reference multiple sources, test information with small risks.
*   **Counter-Intelligence:** Rivals plant false information, turn informants, intercept messages.

**14. Moral Complexity Mechanics**

*   **Survival Ethics:** War makes monsters of everyone; judge others by wartime standards.
*   **Redemption Paths:** Honorable actions can offset past crimes, but never erase them.
