# The Condemned Isles - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Survival Horror meets Prison Brutality

**Aesthetic:** Grimy realism, oppressive atmosphere, tropical hellscape, constant decay.

**Color Palette:**
- Jungle: Sickly green (#4A5D23), rotting brown (#3E2723), mud (#4E342E)
- Ocean: Murky blue (#1A237E), storm gray (#546E7A)
- Blood: Dark red (#8B0000), dried brown (#4E342E)
- Collars: Industrial gray (#616161), red warning LED (#FF0000)
- Sky: Overcast, oppressive, rarely sunny

**Environmental Design:** Overgrown ruins, makeshift shelters, scattered corpses, desperate fortifications, hostile jungle, hidden cameras disguised as natural features.

## Music and Sound Design

**Ambient:** Jungle sounds, waves, distant screams, thunder
**Tension:** Low strings, heartbeat, silence before violence
**Combat:** Brutal, visceral, no glory
**Psychological:** Discordant tones, whispers, madness
**Collar Warning:** Urgent beeping escalating to panic
**Observer Themes:** Baroque classical (contrast to suffering)

**Voice Direction:**
- Prisoners: Desperate, violent, broken

- Announcements: Clinical, impersonal
