# Creative Brief: The Planar Gathering

## Art Style
MTG card aesthetic—each Plane has distinct visual identity. White: angelic Gothic architecture. Blue: crystalline floating arcologies. Black: decaying swamps and crypts. Red: volcanic wastelands and tribal ruins. Green: primordial forests and living landscapes. Planeswalkers appear as larger-than-life figures with glowing Spark energy. Creatures materialize from magical summon circles. Spells are dramatic reality-warping effects.

## Color Palette
- **White Mana**: #F8F8FF (ivory), #FFD700 (holy gold), sunlight and order
- **Blue Mana**: #4169E1 (royal blue), #00CED1 (arcane teal), water and sky
- **Black Mana**: #000000 (void), #8B008B (death purple), shadow and decay
- **Red Mana**: #FF4500 (flame), #B22222 (lava), fire and passion
- **Green Mana**: #228B22 (forest), #8B4513 (earth), nature and life
- **Colorless**: #C0C0C0 (void silver), distortion effects
- **Five-Color**: Prismatic rainbow, all colors spiraling together

## Music
Each color has distinct musical theme. White: Cathedral choir, brass fanfares. Blue: Electronic ambient, glass harmonica. Black: Organ dirges, throat singing. Red: Heavy percussion, electric guitar. Green: Primal drums, woodwinds. Five-color theme combines all into complex orchestration. Planeswalking sound: dimensional whoosh with crystalline shimmer.

## Voice Direction

**Primarch (White)**: Authoritative, paternalistic, speaks in absolutes about order and morality

**Chronarch (Blue)**: Clinical intellecte, emotionally detached, explains everything in logical frameworks

**Lich-Walker (Black)**: Seductive whisper, promises power, speaks of ambition and self-interest

**Pyroclast (Red)**: Passionate shouting, laughs maniacally, speaks of freedom and destruction

**World-Tree (Green)**: Deep, ancient, slow speech pattern, speaks of natural law and cycles

**Five-Color Arbiter**: Shifts between all five vocal styles, representing balanced perspectives

## Cinematic Moments

**Spark Ignition**: Traumatic event—character near death. Suddenly, explosion of light from within. Their eyes glow with five-color energy. Reality tears open. They planeswalk for first time—falling through Blind Eternities (colorless void), emerging on alien Plane.

**First Summoning**: Character draws Mana from Land. Magical circle appears. Creature materializes from across Multiverse—dragon, angel, demon—fighting for the summoner.

**Planeswalker Duel**: Two walkers face off. They each summon armies of creatures. Spells fly—lightning bolts, counterspells, fireballs. Creatures clash. Life totals decrease. Final blow—defeated walker's Spark dims, body dissolves.

**Plane Collapse**: Two Planes merge. White cathedral-cities crash into Black graveyards. Reality glitches—white angels fighting black zombies in merged nightmare landscape.

**Five-Color Convergence**: All five colors of Mana spiral together. The party achieves perfect prismatic balance. They cast the ultimate spell—reality itself reshaped in harmony.
