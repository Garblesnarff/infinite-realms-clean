# World-Building Specification: The Planar Gathering

## The Five Color Philosophies (Detailed)

### White: Peace Through Structure
**Core Belief**: Morality is objective. Order, law, and community create peace. Individual sacrifice for the greater good is noble.
**Methods**: Laws, religion, military structure, collective action
**Creatures**: Angels, soldiers, clerics, knights
**Weakness**: Authoritarianism, inability to adapt, moral absolutism
**At Its Best**: Justice, protection, community
**At Its Worst**: Tyranny, oppression, conformity enforcement

### Blue: Perfection Through Knowledge

**Weakness**: Analysis paralysis, emotional detachment, amorality
**At Its Best**: Innovation, wisdom, mastery
**At Its Worst**: Unethical experimentation, cold calculation, playing god

### Black: Power Through Ambition

## Faction Details

### The Chromatic Council (Five-Color Alliance)
Planeswalkers who believe balance of all five colors is essential. Work to prevent any mono-color dominance. Party's potential allies.

### The Purification Pact (Mono-Color Alliance)
Five mono-colored tyrants secretly working together to purge "impure" multi-color magic before turning on each other.

### The Eldrazi Broods
Colorless entities: Ulamog (consumption), Kozilek (distortion), Emrakul (corruption). Want to reduce all colored reality to void.

### The Ravnica Guilds
Ten two-color factions representing all combinations. Offers diverse multi-color philosophies and magic.

### The Phyrexian Completers
Corrupted beings attempting to "complete" all Planes by infecting them with oil that twists all five colors into horrible unity.

## The Revelation

The Five Colors are not natural divisions—they were imposed by ancient Planeswalkers to prevent earlier, more chaotic magic. Before colors, magic was purely colorless (like Eldrazi). The color system is both prison (limiting magic) and protection (making it comprehensible). True power means transcending colors—but doing so risks becoming incomprehensible void-entity.

Party must choose:
1. Preserve five-color system (maintain order and diversity)
2. Return to pre-color void (chaos and ultimate power)
3. Create new color system (six colors? different divisions?)
4. Destroy magic entirely (mundane reality)

Each choice has cosmic consequences for the nature of reality and consciousness itself.
