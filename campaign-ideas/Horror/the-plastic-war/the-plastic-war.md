# The Plastic War
## "The conflict never ended. It just got smaller."

### Campaign Overview

In the bedroom of 12-year-old Marcus Webb, two armies have been locked in eternal war for as long as the toys can remember. The Green Army (classic plastic army men from the 1990s) holds the Bookshelf Fortress, while the Tan Coalition (modern military action figures) occupies the Desk Territory. What began as imaginative play has calcified into genuine hatred—neither side remembers why the war started, only that the enemy must be defeated. The conflict has its own culture, customs, and causalities.

Everything changes when Marcus receives a birthday gift: a box of ultra-modern military drones and robotic soldiers called the Steel Legion. These new "toys" aren't really toys at all—they're app-controlled devices with primitive AI, and they don't acknowledge the old toy soldiers as alive or real. The Steel Legion begins systematically dismantling both armies' territories, treating the plastic soldiers as obstacles to be cleared. For the first time in years, Green and Tan must consider the unthinkable: an alliance.

But peace isn't simple when you've spent years in trenches. War crimes have been committed. Friends have been melted, shattered, lost behind furniture. Veterans on both sides would rather die than work with the enemy. The players, members of an elite special forces unit from either army, must navigate military honor, generational trauma, the rules of engagement in toy warfare, and the horrifying possibility that their entire war has been meaningless—a child's game that they took lethally seriously.

### Core Themes
- **Cycles of Violence**: War creating more war, grievances passed down
- **Manufactured Conflict**: Realizing your enemy is just like you
- **Military Identity**: When being a soldier is all you are, what happens during peace?
- **Obsolescence Through Replacement**: New technology making old warriors irrelevant
- **The Meaning of Duty**: Following orders vs. moral thinking
- **Brotherhood and Betrayal**: Loyalty tested by changing circumstances

### Campaign Notes

This campaign works best with players who enjoy military themes but are willing to question them. The combat should feel tactical and dangerous, but the real battles are moral and philosophical.

Emphasize the absurdity—these are toys fighting over a child's bedroom—while respecting the genuine stakes from toy perspective. War is simultaneously ridiculous and deadly serious.

Use military terminology and structure to create immersion, but subvert it to explore how institutions perpetuate conflict. The chain of command both enables heroism and enforces atrocity.

Consider real military ethics: following orders, collateral damage, treatment of POWs, war crimes, PTSD. Toy war is metaphor for real war's moral complexity.

The Steel Legion represents technological obsolescence but also the soullessness of modern warfare. They're efficient but lack humanity—until they start developing it.

Final sessions should question whether peace was worth it, whether war gave life meaning or wasted it, and what identity means when soldier is all you've been.

Best played with mix of combat, espionage, politics, and moral dilemmas. Every session should have both action and ethics.
