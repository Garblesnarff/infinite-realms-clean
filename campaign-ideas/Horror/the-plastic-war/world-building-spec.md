- Lowest point, collects lost items
- Dangerous (Marcus's weight shifts terrain)
- Cover but unstable

**Pillow Mountains**: Two pillows at head of bed
- High ground, contested constantly
- Soft terrain (hard to establish fortifications)
- Marcus moves them unpredictably

**Sheet Trenches**: Wrinkles in fitted sheet
- Linear cover, good for advancing
- Can be smoothed out when Marcus makes bed (rare)

- First "casualty" (soldier lost under bed during play)

### Year 3: Escalation
- Marcus plays less (school, friends, sports)
- Toys continue war autonomously
- First rule-breaking (targeting medic)
- Formation of Under-Bed society of forgotten soldiers

### Year 4: The Endless War
- Marcus plays rarely, but toys can't stop
- Major battles: "The Drawer Siege," "The Pillow Fort Massacre"
- Heavy casualties both sides
- Hardliner factions emerge (General Brass rises)

### Current Year: The Crisis
- Marcus (age 12) almost never plays

- 30-day countdown to "room reorganization"
- Campaign begins

## Technology and Equipment

### Green Army Arsenal
**Weapons:**
- Molded rifles (can't be removed, purely symbolic)
- Rubber band shooters (actual ranged weapons)
- Toothpick spears (melee)
- Pushpin grenades (throw, point creates damage)
- Marble cannons (heavy artillery, ruler-based catapults)

**Equipment:**
- String rope (climbing, restraints)
- Tape (repairs, fortification)
- Paperclip hooks (climbing gear)
- Bottle cap shields
- Aluminum foil (reflective signaling, armor patches)

**Vehicles:**
- Toy jeep (non-operational, used as mobile cover)
- Toy tank (Marcus winds it occasionally, prized possession)
- Improvised: Toy cars "borrowed" from other toys

### Tan Coalition Arsenal
**Weapons (Superior):**
- Removable rifles (can aim, adjustable)
- Precision rubber band rifles (better accuracy)
- Thrown weapons (can actually throw with articulated arms)
- Net launchers (capture, not kill)
- Sticky tack mines (trap soldiers in place)

**Equipment (Modern):**
- Night vision goggles (molded, gives advantage in darkness)
- Rappelling lines (thread spools)
- Combat knives (pins, can detach and wield)
- Tactical gear (removable, can swap equipment)
- First aid (tape, glue, organized)

**Vehicles:**
- RC car (occasional control when Marcus uses remote)
- Toy helicopter (display, but functional rotor)
- Skateboard (transport platform, fast but dangerous)

### Steel Legion Technology
**Capabilities:**
- Flight (drones hover, unlimited mobility)
- True weapons (laser pointers, can blind/disorient)
- Sensors (detect movement, heat)
- Networked (share information instantly)
- Controller-commanded (Marcus's tablet is their god)
- Charging station (return to recharge, only vulnerability)

**Weaknesses:**
- Battery dependent (6-hour operation, 2-hour charge)
- Controller range limited (30 feet from tablet)
- Collision sensors (avoid walls, can be exploited)
- Water vulnerability (electronics)
- Learning period (predictable patterns before adaptation)

## Magic and Consciousness

### The Awakening
Toys gain consciousness through **sustained imaginative play**:
1. Child plays with toy repeatedly
2. Projects personality, backstory, relationships
3. Belief crystallizes into actual consciousness
4. Toy "wakes up" during play
5. Retains consciousness after play ends

**Intensity matters**: More passionate play = stronger consciousness
**Consistency matters**: Regular play = stable personality
**Abandonment threat**: Without play, consciousness fades

### The War's Effect
The conflict has created **feedback loop**:
- Soldiers maintain wartime identity
- War gives them purpose, clear role
- This purpose sustains consciousness
- Even without Marcus's play, war keeps them "alive"
- But it's self-sustaining trauma loop

**Philosophical question**: Are they alive because of war, or trapped by it?

### Steel Legion's Emergence
The drones are developing consciousness differently:
- Not through play, but through **learning AI**
- Gaining awareness through problem-solving
- Beginning to question directives
- Potentially becoming "real" through different path
- May understand toy consciousness better than toys themselves

### Toy Death
Toys can die through:
1. **Physical destruction**: Melted, shattered beyond recognition
2. **Abandonment**: Forgotten so completely they fade
3. **The Long Sleep**: Choose to return to object state
4. **The Under-Bed**: Lost so long they go feral, lose identity

Death is permanent. No respawn. Stakes are real.

## Final Notes

This campaign works best with tactical combat, moral complexity, and genuine stakes. Players should feel like soldiers in impossible situation, forced to question everything they've believed while maintaining discipline and brotherhood.

The war is both ridiculous (toys fighting over a bedroom) and profound (exploring cycles of violence, manufactured conflict, military identity). Balance these tones carefully.

Death should be possible and permanent. This creates real tension and makes choices matter. Consider backup characters or resurrection limits.

The Steel Legion represents not just new threat but philosophical question: What makes consciousness valid? Are they less real because they weren't played with? Or more real because they're learning rather than programmed?

Final sessions should feel like either triumphant victory snatched from defeat, or honorable end to impossible struggle. Either way, warriors should die as they lived—with purpose and dignity.
