# Creative Brief: Caverns of Madness

## Art Style: Claustrophobic Cave Horror

Inspired by *The Descent*, emphasizing tight spaces, primal fear, and psychological breakdown in the dark.

### Core Principles:
*   **Darkness and Limited Light:** Most scenes are lit only by torchlight, creating harsh shadows and pools of darkness.
*   **Claustrophobia:** Show tight squeezes, narrow tunnels, low ceilings pressing down.
*   **Primal Horror:** Crawlers are pale, eyeless, humanoid predators—disturbing in their almost-human appearance.
*   **Psychological Stress:** Characters show fear, exhaustion, paranoia through body language and expressions.

### Style Guide:

**Colors:** Dark earth tones—blacks, browns, grays. Torchlight creates warm orange-red glow. Crawler flesh is sickly pale. Blood is stark red.

**Characters:** Practical caving gear—helmets, ropes, tight clothing. Faces show dirt, blood, exhaustion. Crawlers are gaunt, pale-skinned, with elongated limbs and no eyes.

**Environments:** Tight rock tunnels, dripping water, jagged formations, underground rivers. Everything feels crushing and oppressive.

**Lighting:** Torch and lantern light creates harsh contrasts. Shadows hide threats. Darkness is absolute without light.

**Composition:** Tight framing emphasizing claustrophobia. Low angles showing rock pressing down. Crawlers partially seen—a hand, a face, never fully revealed.

## Voice

A ragged, breathless female voice with suppressed panic. Whispered urgency with gasping breaths. Emotion: raw fear and determination. Role: A survivor recounting the ordeal, still processing the trauma.
