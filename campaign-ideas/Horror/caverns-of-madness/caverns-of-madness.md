The party, an experienced group of explorers, ventures into the newly-discovered Blackmaw Caverns seeking ancient treasure. When a cave-in seals them underground, they discover they are not alone—pale, eyeless humanoid creatures called Crawlers hunt in the darkness, perfectly adapted to the subterranean environment.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A descent into literal and psychological darkness.

*   **Act I — The Descent (Sessions 1–2):** The party explores the Blackmaw Caverns, marveling at ancient ruins and underground rivers. The expedition leader, Maren, pushes them deeper despite warnings. A sudden cave-in seals the main entrance, trapping them. They discover signs of the Crawlers: claw marks, gnawed bones, and clicking sounds in the dark. The first Crawler attack is brutal and fast. The party realizes they are being hunted.
*   **Act II — The Hunted (Sessions 3–4):** The party must navigate deeper into the caverns to find an alternate exit, all while conserving light sources and avoiding Crawler ambushes. Tight squeezes through cracks, underwater passages, and sheer drops test their physical and mental endurance. Paranoia sets in as party members begin turning on each other—old traumas resurface, accusations fly, and trust erodes. They discover evidence that a previous expedition met a grisly end here.
*   **Act III — The Exit (Sessions 5–6):** The party finds an ancient ceremonial chamber with murals showing the Crawlers as cursed beings who once were human. They discover a vertical shaft leading to the surface—but it's the Crawlers' primary nest. The final session is a desperate climb while Crawlers pursue from below. The party must choose who holds the rear guard (likely a death sentence) and whether to collapse the cavern behind them to seal the Crawlers in—trapping any who don't make it out.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Into the Dark"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party descends into Blackmaw Caverns, equipped with ropes, torches, and climbing gear.
    *   They explore stunning underground features: glowing fungi, crystal formations, ancient dwarven ruins.
    *   Maren, the expedition leader, finds a map suggesting treasure deeper in. She convinces the party to press on.
**Escalation:** A tremor shakes the caverns. The entrance collapses, sealing them in. Panic sets in.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The First Blood"
*   **Focus:** Horror / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party hears clicking sounds in the dark. Something is following them.
    *   They find a campsite from a previous expedition—bloodstains, torn journals, claw marks on the walls.
    *   The first Crawler attack: a pale, eyeless humanoid drops from the ceiling, dragging a party member into the darkness. Combat is brutal and fast.
    *   The party realizes the Crawlers hunt by sound and heat. Staying quiet and cold helps avoid detection.
**Escalation:** Party member Liora reveals she has claustrophobia and is beginning to panic. Another member, Seren, accuses Maren of recklessness.

### Sessions 4-5 — "Breaking Point"
*   **Focus:** Psychological Horror / Betrayal
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party navigates horrific terrain: crawling through tight, water-filled passages where they must submerge completely, crossing narrow ledges over bottomless pits.
    *   Resources are dwindling: torches burn out, rations run low, injuries accumulate.
    *   Psychological stress mounts. Seren and Maren have a heated confrontation. Liora has a breakdown in a tight squeeze, nearly getting everyone killed.
    *   They discover the ceremonial chamber with murals showing the Crawlers were once a dwarven expedition cursed for disturbing a sacred site. The same could happen to them.
**Escalation:** A Crawler ambush kills an NPC ally. The party is down to their last light source.

### Session 6 — "The Climb"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Sacrifice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party finds a vertical shaft leading to the surface—a 200-foot climb with Crawlers swarming below.
    *   The climb is a series of Athletics/Acrobatics checks. Failure means falling into the mass of Crawlers.
    *   Someone must hold the rear guard to buy time. This is likely a death sentence. The party must decide who stays—volunteer, draw lots, or force someone.
    *   If they use explosives to collapse the cavern, anyone still inside is trapped forever.
**Resolution:** The survivors emerge into daylight, traumatized and changed. They may have lost friends, sanity, or their trust in each other.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of claustrophobia, trauma, and the fragility of trust under extreme stress. The central conflict is not just escaping the Crawlers, but maintaining sanity and cooperation as the group fractures. Every decision tests the party: who leads? Who is sacrificed? Can they trust each other when survival is on the line?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Light Management**
*   Light sources (torches, lanterns, spells) are precious and finite.
*   Without light, the party has disadvantage on all actions except listening.
*   Crawlers avoid bright light but attack immediately in darkness.
*   Track torch duration: each torch lasts 1 hour. The party has limited torches.

### 2. **Claustrophobia Checks**
*   In tight spaces (the Squeeze, underwater passages), PCs must make **Wisdom saves (DC 12)** or suffer disadvantage on all checks for 10 minutes due to panic.
*   Liora and any PCs with claustrophobic backgrounds have disadvantage on these saves.

### 3. **Psychological Breakdown**
*   Each traumatic event (Crawler attack, NPC death, resource depletion) increases the party's **Stress Level**.
*   At Stress 5, party members begin having hallucinations (Wisdom saves or perceive false threats).
*   At Stress 10, a party member may turn on the group or flee into the dark.
*   Stress is reduced by long rests (impossible in the caverns) or by meaningful emotional support (roleplaying).

### 4. **Crawler Tactics**
*   Crawlers hunt by sound and heat. Silent, slow-moving PCs can avoid detection (Stealth DC 14).
*   Crawlers attack from above, behind, and below—never direct frontal assaults.
*   In darkness, Crawlers have advantage and are nearly impossible to hit without light or blindsight.
