# Creative Brief: The Starfall Outcasts

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Documentary Realism with Body Horror (District 9-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty, documentary-style aesthetic of *District 9*, this style blends realistic urban decay with disturbing body horror and sci-fi elements. It aims to capture the harsh reality of xenophobia, corporate exploitation, and the visceral horror of unwilling transformation.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Grit and Reality:** This should feel like a documentary photograph of a real crisis—handheld camera angles, natural lighting, urban decay.
*   **Detail the Contrast:** Show the stark difference between corporate luxury and refugee squalor, between human privilege and Vrynn suffering.
*   **Don't Shy from Horror:** The transformation should be visceral, unsettling, and tragic—not glamorized.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, documentary, xenophobic, exploitative, transformative, visceral, realistic, industrial, uncomfortable.
*   **Feeling:** The uncomfortable tension of a society built on oppression. The horror of losing one's humanity against one's will. The tragedy of prejudice and the brutal efficiency of corporate evil.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, almost photographic. Harsh, unflattering angles. Focus on texture and decay.
*   **Textures:** Rusted metal, cracked concrete, insectoid chitin, corporate glass and steel, dirt, grime, fluid.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A documentary-style photograph showing a refugee camp. Emphasis on realistic textures—corrugated metal, mud, torn fabric. The image is gritty and unflinching."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated, industrial colors. Grays, browns, rust oranges, sickly greens. Corporate spaces have sterile whites and cold blues.
*   **Accent Colors:** The alien bio-essence glows a toxic green or orange. Blood (human and Vrynn) provides rare pops of color.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Harsh sunlight creating stark shadows, industrial sodium lighting at night, fluorescent corporate lighting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...with a desaturated color palette of industrial grays and browns, accented by toxic green bio-essence. Harsh sunlight creates stark shadows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, unglamorous. People look tired, dirty, desperate, or coldly professional.
*   **Vrynn:** Insectoid bipeds with chitinous exoskeletons, multiple eyes, mandibles, antenna. Clearly non-human but expressive enough to evoke sympathy.
*   **The Hybrid:** Progressive transformation shown through prosthetic-like chitinous growths, skin discoloration, changing facial structure. Disturbing but tragic.
*   **Corporate Forces:** Clean uniforms, body armor, dehumanizing helmets and masks.
*   **Expression:** Fear, anger, desperation for refugees. Cold efficiency for corporate forces. Growing horror for the transforming character.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A person mid-transformation, with chitinous plates growing from their arm and face. The transformation is visceral and disturbing. Their expression shows horror and despair."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Urban decay and industrial sprawl. Realistic refugee camps with corrugated metal shacks, dirt roads, and overcrowding.
*   **District Twelve:** Looks like a third-world refugee camp—cramped, dirty, desperate, surrounded by concrete walls and checkpoints.
*   **Ironhaven City:** Industrial factories, working-class neighborhoods, corporate towers in the distance.
*   **Meridian Tower:** Sleek, modern, sterile—a stark contrast to the suffering it causes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of a refugee camp—cramped metal shacks, dirt paths, crowds of alien refugees, surrounded by concrete walls topped with razor wire and security cameras."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, realistic lighting. Strong contrast between light and shadow. No glamorization.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and black, suggesting surveillance, oppression, and hidden truths.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the grim reality, creates documentary authenticity, and highlights the horror of transformation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh overhead industrial lighting creating stark shadows. The lighting is unflattering and documentary-style, emphasizing the grim reality."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Documentary camera angles—handheld feel, off-center framing, voyeuristic perspectives, security camera views.
*   **Techniques:** Show scale of suffering (wide shots of camps), intimate horror (close-ups of transformation), power dynamics (low angles for corporate, high angles for refugees).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A handheld documentary-style shot from a low angle, looking up at corporate security forces confronting refugees. The composition emphasizes the power imbalance."

## Voice

A South African-accented male voice, gruff and working-class, with the cadence of someone who's seen too much injustice and is barely containing their anger. The pacing is deliberate, pausing for emphasis on the worst revelations. The emotion blends outrage with weary resignation—someone documenting atrocities they can't quite stop. Audio quality is raw, like field recording equipment, with occasional ambient sounds of the camp or city. Role: A documentary filmmaker narrating footage of the camps, or a refugee advocate giving testimony about corporate crimes.
