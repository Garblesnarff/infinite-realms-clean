**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the Nikara Empire (fantasy China), war orphan players gain admission to Sinegard Academy, the empire's most prestigious military school, where they study strategy, martial arts, and the forbidden shamanic art of calling upon the Pantheon—gods of terrible power who grant strength at the cost of sanity and humanity. When the Federation of Mugen invades with horrific brutality, the players are thrust into genocidal warfare where survival means becoming monsters, calling upon gods like the Phoenix (fire and destruction) to match the enemy's atrocities. As they descend into vengeance, drug-fueled shamanic trances, and war crimes, they must confront the cost of power: to defeat monsters, they've become worse monsters, and the gods they call upon are mad, hungry, and care nothing for mortal morality.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — The Academy (Sessions 1–5):** War orphan players compete for placement at Sinegard, empire's elite military academy. They endure brutal training, class prejudice (dark-skinned southern provinces vs northern elites), academic competition, and discover their aptitude for shamanism—calling upon gods through meditation and drugs. Master Jiang teaches forbidden lore: the Pantheon are mad gods sealed by the Empress who ended the last divine war, but shamans can still contact them for power. Players learn martial arts, strategy, and basic shamanic calling. They form bonds with classmates and rivals. The Federation launches surprise invasion—graduation becomes deployment.

*   **Act II — The Poppy War (Sessions 6–11):** The Federation's invasion is genocidal—mass rape, human experimentation, cities burned. Players witness atrocities that break their humanity. To survive and fight back, they must call upon the Pantheon deeply: the Phoenix grants fire and destruction, the Tortoise grants earth and endurance, the Dragon grants water. But each calling costs sanity and requires opium to achieve the trance state. They participate in desperate battles, witness the Mugen's Federation's biological experiments and systematic extermination. The Empress deploys the Trifecta (three shamans bonded to the most powerful gods) who commit war crimes to stop the invasion. Players face choice: use forbidden power (potentially killing civilians), or fight honorably (and lose). They discover opium addiction, madness, and the gods' hunger for violence.

*   **Act III — The Burning God (Sessions 12–15+):** The players have become powerful shamans, but the Phoenix (or another god) is consuming them. They've committed atrocities in the name of vengeance—burned cities, killed innocents, lost their humanity. The true enemy is revealed: the gods themselves, who were sealed because they crave destruction. The Empress who ended the divine wars did so by making a terrible pact. Now players must choose: continue serving the gods and become avatars of destruction (powerful but inhuman), attempt to seal the gods again (losing their power but saving their souls), or attempt to kill their god (nearly impossible, but freeing them and the world). The campaign ends with players confronting what they've become—heroes who committed genocide, victims who became perpetrators, students who learned power's true cost is becoming what you hate.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Shamanic Calling**
*   Players can call upon gods from the Pantheon (Phoenix-fire, Dragon-water, Tortoise-earth, Monkey-trickery, etc.).
*   Requires meditation or opium-induced trance. Each use risks sanity and addiction.
*   Power scales with how much of yourself you give to the god: minor calling (small benefits, small cost), full possession (immense power, loss of control and memory).
*   Gods are mad and hungry—they want destruction, not morality.

### 2. **Atrocity and Degradation**
*   Track Humanity score. Decreases when committing war crimes or calling gods deeply.
*   Low Humanity grants power but changes alignment and personality—NPC reactions shift, certain choices become unavailable.
*   The game doesn't flinch from depicting war atrocities—both by enemies and potentially by players. This creates moral horror and forces uncomfortable choices.

### 3. **Opium and Addiction**
*   Shamanic trances are easier with opium. Using it risks addiction (escalating mechanical effects).
*   Addicted characters need regular doses or suffer withdrawal (penalties).
*   Addiction makes shamanic calling more powerful but less controlled.

### 4. **The Academy**
*   First act includes academic competition: test scores in strategy, martial arts, languages, history.
*   Relationships formed here matter throughout campaign—classmates become allies, rivals, or casualties.

### 5. **Genocidal Warfare**
*   Combat encounters include moral choices: save civilians or complete mission, spare enemies or eliminate threats, use atrocity-level power or risk losing.
*   The game asks: is genocide ever justified if it's the only way to stop genocide?

## Central Conflict

Can you fight monsters without becoming one? Is vengeance justice or just more violence? The gods offer power to defend your people—but the gods are mad and care nothing for morality. The campaign is unflinching in depicting war's horrors and forcing players to confront whether their actions are defensible or just rationalized atrocities. It's inspired by real historical atrocities and asks uncomfortable questions about power, vengeance, colonialism, and what we're willing to become to survive.
