# The Inquisitor's Flame

*A Religious Persecution Campaign — Medium Campaign (8-10 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Inquisitor's Flame
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Religious Horror / Investigation / Persecution
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 8-10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **7**
**Tone (keywords):** oppressive, secretive, paranoid, theological, horrifying
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are subjects of the Spanish Inquisition—some as inquisitors enforcing religious orthodoxy through investigation and torture, others as conversos (converted Jews) hiding their heritage, and all navigating a system where theological purity is enforced through terror and any deviation means torture and auto-da-fé. As investigators, converts, priests, and those caught in between, they must survive in a world where the Church has total power, where accusation requires proof through torture, and where the choice is between genuine faith, false confession, or burning. The campaign explores religious persecution justified by faith, the horror of institutional torture, and whether anyone can maintain integrity when the Inquisition investigates. This is Spain under the Inquisition—where heroes must hide, conform, or burn.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Holy Office Arrives"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / System Established
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Inquisition establishes a tribunal in the city to root out crypto-Jews, heretics, and religious deviation.
    *   The Edict of Grace is proclaimed: confess within 30 days with reduced punishment, or face full investigation.
    *   Players witness public accusations and understand the system's power and reach.
**Escalation:** Some confess to minor heresies. The Inquisition learns the value of torture in producing confessions.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Question Ordinary and Extraordinary"
*   **Focus:** Torture System / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players witness or experience the Inquisition's "questioning"—ordinary (psychological) and extraordinary (physical torture).
    *   The rack, strappado, and water torture extract confessions from innocent and guilty alike.
    *   They learn that torture continues until you confess what the inquisitors want to hear.
**Escalation:** Conversos realize their secret practices are known. Someone is informing to the Inquisition.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Secret Jews"
*   **Focus:** Hidden Faith / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players discover a network of conversos practicing Judaism in secret despite conversion.
    *   They must decide: inform the Inquisition, protect the conversos, or maintain dangerous neutrality.
    *   The Inquisition has infiltrators in every community—anyone could be reporting anyone.
**Escalation:** The Inquisition accuses prominent conversos using evidence only insiders could provide.

### Sessions 6-7 — "The Accused"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Impossible Defense
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players or their allies are formally accused of heresy based on testimony, old grudges, or denunciation.
    *   The Inquisition's process is designed to convict: torture produces confessions, property is seized, accusers remain anonymous.
    *   There's almost no defense—denial prolongs torture, confession confirms guilt.
**Escalation:** The accused are sentenced to the auto-da-fé—the public ritual of faith where judgment is enacted.

### Sessions 8-9 — "The Auto-da-Fé"
*   **Focus:** Public Ritual / Spectacle of Faith
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The auto-da-fé is spectacular public theater: the condemned wear sanbenitos, march in procession, hear sentences.
    *   Those who confess are reconciled (often strangled before burning). Those who deny burn alive.
    *   Players witness the system's ultimate purpose: public demonstration of religious authority through ritual execution.
**Escalation:** Survivors must choose: flee Spain, live in constant fear, or completely abandon any deviation from orthodoxy.

### Session 10 — "The Long Shadow"
*   **Focus:** Resolution / Legacy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The campaign concludes years later, showing the Inquisition's long-term impact on Spanish society.
    *   Fear has created conformity. Secret practices continue but hidden deeper. Many fled to other countries.
    *   The question remains: Was this defense of faith or institutional terror? Both? Neither?
**Escalation:** The epilogue shows the Inquisition continued for centuries, its legacy shaping Spanish religious culture.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores institutional religious persecution, torture justified by theology, and survival under total ideological control. The central conflict is navigating the Spanish Inquisition's power to investigate anyone, torture to extract confessions, and execute in spectacular public rituals. Players must balance genuine faith against institutional terror, protect others while protecting themselves, and decide whether conformity or resistance is possible when the Church has absolute power. The campaign asks: Can torture ever serve truth? What happens when religious orthodoxy is enforced through fear? How do people maintain hidden identities under constant surveillance? And what's the cost of survival through betrayal? The answer: the Inquisition teaches that mixing faith with torture creates a system serving power not truth, where fear produces confessions but not conviction.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Orthodoxy Tracker**
*   Measures how closely players conform to required Catholic orthodoxy in speech and behavior.
*   Low orthodoxy increases Inquisition attention and investigation risk.
*   Players must constantly police their own words and actions.

### 2. **The Torture System**
*   If accused, players face torture designed to extract specific confessions.
*   Torture continues until you confess what inquisitors want—truth is irrelevant.
*   This mechanic shows the horror of the Inquisition's "justice."

### 3. **Secret Practice**
*   Converso players must secretly maintain Jewish practices while appearing Catholic.
*   Any slip or observation can lead to denunciation.
*   This creates constant tension between identity and survival.

### 4. **The Informant Network**
*   The Inquisition has informants everywhere—familiars, penitents, forced collaborators.
*   Any NPC might be reporting to the tribunal.
*   This reinforces paranoia and isolation.

### 5. **The Auto-da-Fé Ritual**
*   The public ceremony of faith combines religious ritual with execution spectacle.
*   Players see how the Inquisition uses theater to demonstrate power and enforce conformity.
*   The ritual's horror is its combination of religious devotion and human sacrifice.
