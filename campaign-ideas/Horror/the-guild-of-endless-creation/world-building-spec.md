### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Guild of Endless Creation**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be realistic, inspiring, and honest about creative industry struggles, in the style of Shirobako. Balance the difficulties with genuine passion and camaraderie.
*   **Content:** The players are working adults at a creative production studio completing a major project. They face impossible deadlines, budget constraints, creative conflicts, and burnout while trying to maintain their passion and create something meaningful. The campaign follows a full production cycle.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize industry realism, creative passion, and the complex relationship between art and commerce.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the Guild of Endless Creation by a group of idealistic creators who wanted to make meaningful work, and how commercial realities have shaped it.
    *   Write about the legendary "Golden Age Project" that established the guild's reputation but nearly destroyed the team that made it.
    *   Describe the creative industry's ecosystem – the relationship between studios, sponsors, publishers, and audiences, with all its pressures and politics.
    *   Explain the unwritten rules of creative production – the sacrifices expected, the pride in craft despite struggles, the bonds formed through shared challenges.
    *   Detail the story of a creator who burned out and left the industry, and another who pushed through and found renewed purpose – both paths are valid.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Production Team (The Players)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To complete the project on time with acceptable quality while maintaining sanity and relationships.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Producer leads, director has creative authority, players are key staff in various specialties (artists, writers, technical, etc.).
        *   **Public Agenda:** To create quality work that honors their craft and satisfies sponsors/audience.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each person is fighting to keep their passion alive while dealing with burnout, proving themselves, or searching for meaning in creative work; all question at times whether the cost is worth it.
        *   **Assets:** Diverse creative skills, growing experience, mutual support, passion for craft (when not exhausted), problem-solving developed through crisis.
        *   **Relationships:** Complicated relationships forged through stress – genuine bonds mixed with tension; they're family by proximity and necessity.
    *   **The Sponsors & Publishers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To ensure profitable product that meets market demands and protects their investment.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Corporate structure with executives making decisions often disconnected from creative realities.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To support quality creative work and successful releases.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Profit margins matter more than creative vision; they see creators as replaceable; they demand changes based on market testing, not artistic merit.
        *   **Assets:** Money and distribution power, market research, industry connections, contractual leverage.
        *   **Relationships:** Necessary evil from creators' perspective; source of resources but also interference; mutual lack of understanding across creative-business divide.
    *   **The Creative Industry Community** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To share knowledge, support each other, maintain craft standards, and survive the industry together.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Informal respect based on experience and skill; veterans mentor newcomers; studios are rivals but also allies.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To advance their respective projects and careers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Everyone is tired and questioning their choices; they look out for each other because they understand the struggles outsiders don't.
        *   **Assets:** Collective knowledge, emergency freelancers, shared resources, emotional support, war stories and warnings.
        *   **Relationships:** Competitors who respect each other; they'll hire rivals in a pinch; schadenfreude mixed with genuine concern when others struggle.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Director Mizuki Visionary:** Brilliant perfectionist pushing for redemption after past failure.

*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Studio Workspace:** The open office where creation happens and lives are lived.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Individual workstations with personal touches, the main project board with schedule/progress, kitchen area with coffee machine (vital), the "war room" corner for crisis management, windows showing outside world (rarely noticed).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The production team essentially living there, occasional visitors from other departments, late-night janitorial staff.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Workstations with equipment, collaboration space, emotional support from coworkers, coffee (infinite), rarely-used rest area.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Technical crisis requires all-hands problem solving, morale-breaking news from management, spontaneous teamwork breakthrough, someone reaches breaking point, celebratory moment of completion milestone.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "A developer once lived in the studio for two weeks straight during crunch and swears they saw a ghost." "The coffee machine is the real heart of the studio – when it breaks, productivity dies." "The most successful projects were made by teams that genuinely cared for each other, not just the work."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Glowing monitors, project materials everywhere, gradually increasing clutter during crunch, evidence of long hours), Sound (Typing, mouse clicks, quiet intense conversations, occasional stress venting, late-night collaborative problem-solving), Smell (Coffee constantly, occasionally food delivery, exhaustion has a smell).
    *   **The Meeting Room:** Where decisions are made and conflicts occur.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The conference table, presentation screen, whiteboards filled with notes and schedules, the chair where the director sits, water cooler that nobody has time to use.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Team during meetings, sponsors during presentations, management during difficult conversations.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Decision-making space, presentations to stakeholders, conflict resolution (or escalation), schedule updates.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Sponsor demands major changes, team debates creative direction passionately, schedule revealed to be impossible, breakthrough idea emerges from discussion, producer shields team from unreasonable demand.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The whiteboard has a ghost schedule from a previous project that failed – a warning." "Decisions made after midnight in this room are always regretted." "The director and producer had a legendary argument here that led to the studio's best work."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Conference table with papers and devices, presentation screen, whiteboards with plans, coffee rings), Sound (Passionate discussions, presentations, occasional heated arguments, exhausted silence), Smell (Stale coffee, dry erase markers, stress).
    *   **The Late-Night Convenience Store:** Refuge during crunch time.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The energy drink cooler, instant food section, the kind night-shift clerk who knows the studio workers, magazine rack no one reads, the fluorescent parking lot where exhausted conversations happen.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Night-shift worker, exhausted creators from various studios, late-night workers from other industries.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Emergency caffeine and food, brief respite from studio, commiseration with other tired workers, perspective from outside the bubble.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Encounter rival studio worker, also exhausted, and share industry trauma, clerk offers unexpected wisdom, team member confesses they're struggling, chance to choose between another energy drink or actual rest, moment of exhausted clarity about life priorities.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The night clerk is a retired famous creator who left the industry and found peace." "More important creative decisions happen in this parking lot than in official meetings." "The store's fluorescent lights at 3 AM tell you the truth about your life choices."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Harsh fluorescent lighting, stocked shelves of quick energy, night-shift worker's tired but kind face, parking lot sodium lights), Sound (Store music, cooler hum, automatic door chime, exhausted conversations), Smell (Coffee machines, packaged food, night air, exhaustion).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and realistic consequences for the "THEN" outcome, balancing project needs against human costs.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Project Completion advances significantly.
    *   **THEN:** Team feels satisfaction and progress. Morale boost. Generate a scene of accomplishment. But also increase fatigue slightly. Moving forward always costs something.
    *   **IF:** A major crisis occurs (technical failure, sponsor demands, staff problem).
    *   **THEN:** Project Completion stalls or regresses. Team Morale drops. Players must solve the crisis through skills and collaboration. Success provides Production Points and team bonding. Failure has compounding consequences.
    *   **IF:** Player prioritizes team Morale over pushing completion (suggesting breaks, supporting stressed colleagues, choosing sustainable pace).
    *   **THEN:** Temporarily slow completion but prevent catastrophic burnout. Strengthen team relationships. In the long run, sustained morale makes crises more manageable. Prove that caring matters.
    *   **IF:** Player or NPC's Morale drops to critical levels.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a crisis – mistakes, breakdown, potential quitting. Other players must provide support. This creates meaningful choice between pushing through and protecting people. The correct choice is not always obvious.
    *   **IF:** Players spend Production Points to protect creative vision.
    *   **THEN:** Successfully resist sponsor interference or maintain quality despite pressure. Generate a satisfying "standing up for the work" moment. But sponsor relationship may strain. Good choices have costs.
    *   **IF:** The project reaches completion.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an exhausted but proud completion scene. Then the premiere/release. The quality reflects the choices made – technical decisions, creative compromises, team morale. The ending is bittersweet – pride in work mixed with exhaustion, relationships strained but possibly stronger. Players must decide whether to do it again.
    *   **IF:** The premiere/reception occurs.
    *   **THEN:** Generate realistic reception – perhaps successful, perhaps mixed, perhaps disappointing. But emphasize that what matters is: did they create something they're proud of? Did the relationships survive? Did they maintain their passion? Success isn't just commercial.
