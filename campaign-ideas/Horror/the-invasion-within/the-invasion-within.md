*A Body Horror / Survival / Identity Crisis campaign — Medium Campaign (11–14 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Invasion Within
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Body Horror / Alien Invasion / Symbiosis / Identity Philosophy / Urban Survival
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 11–14 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** Body-snatching aliens, symbiotic relationship, what defines humanity, parasitic invasion, survival horror, protecting humanity, chosen host
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Parasitic shapeshifters from beyond the stars begin infiltrating the city, taking over human bodies by consuming and replacing their brains. The party members are infected—but something went wrong, and the parasites only partially took over (an arm, eye, or organ instead of the brain), creating symbiotic relationships where human and alien coexist. Now they must hunt other parasites to protect humanity while hiding their own infections, questioning what makes someone human when part of them is an alien predator, and confronting whether humanity deserves to survive.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Body Horror:** Graphic transformations, consumption, alien anatomy bursting from human forms.
*   **Constant Threat:** Parasites are vastly stronger and faster than humans. Direct combat is often suicide.
*   **Identity Crisis:** Party members are part alien. Are they still human? Can they be trusted?
*   **Secrecy Required:** If discovered to be infected, society will kill them alongside full parasites.
*   **Moral Questions:** Parasites must eat humans to survive. The party's symbiotes hunger. What compromises will they make?
*   **No Clear Enemy:** Some parasites want peace; some humans are worse than aliens. Who's the real threat?

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 11–14 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Invasion Begins (Sessions 1–4):** Party members are infected with parasites but retain consciousness. They discover other parasites are taking over humans completely, planning an invasion. They must survive initial encounters while learning to coexist with their symbiotes.
*   **Act II — The Hidden War (Sessions 5–9):** The party hunts parasites while hiding their own infections. They discover parasites have different factions—some want to coexist, others to exterminate humanity. The party must decide: are all parasites enemies, or can there be peace? Human extremists also emerge, killing anyone suspected of infection.
*   **Act III — What Defines Humanity (Sessions 10–14):** The invasion reaches critical mass. The party must choose sides: help humans exterminate all parasites (including themselves?), broker peace between species, or side with parasites who view humanity as the real plague. Multiple endings based on philosophical stance and relationships with symbiotes.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **humanity versus evolution** and **self versus other**. The parasites are objectively superior predators—faster, stronger, adaptive. They argue humanity is the real plague on Earth, consuming resources and destroying ecosystems, while they would restore balance. The party is caught between: they're part human (identity, morality, love) and part parasite (survival instinct, strength, alien logic). The campaign questions: what defines humanity—biology or consciousness? If you're part alien, are you still human, or something new? Do humans deserve to survive given their destructiveness? And can two species sharing one body find harmony, or will one always dominate?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Symbiotic Bonding**
*   Party members have parasites bonded to body parts (arm, eye, leg, etc.).
*   Grants abilities: shape-shifting that limb into blades/shields, enhanced senses, rapid healing of that area.
*   Parasite has own personality; player and DM roleplay internal dialogue.

### 2. **The Hunger**
*   Parasites need to consume human brain matter to survive.
*   Players can resist but symbiote weakens; alternatively, feed it criminals/enemies.
*   Moral weight: feeding parasite means killing humans.

### 3. **Detection**
*   Other parasites can sense each other. So can the party.
*   Must hide from humans while hunting parasites.
*   If exposed as infected, humans will kill party.

### 4. **Transformation Combat**
*   In battle, symbiotic limb transforms into weapons.
*   Tactical combat where positioning and creativity matter.
*   Full parasites are much stronger—party must use strategy.

### 5. **Humanity Tracker**
*   Track whether party acts human (protecting innocents, showing mercy) or alien (pragmatic killing, detachment).
*   Affects symbiote relationship and ending.

### 6. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Human Victory:** Help exterminate all parasites; must sacrifice symbiotes; bittersweet.
*   **Coexistence:** Broker peace between species; hardest path requiring both sides to change.
*   **New Species:** Embrace being hybrid; lead evolution of symbiotic humans; transcend both species.
*   **Parasite Victory:** Side with parasites; humanity is culled; Earth "saved" from humans.
*   **Extinction:** Both species destroy each other; tragic ending.
