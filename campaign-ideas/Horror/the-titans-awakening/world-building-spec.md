# World-Building Specification Brief: The Titans Awakening

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Titans Awakening**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Decades ago, the great arcane nations waged war using forbidden magic that tore holes in the Elemental Planes. Now, colossal creatures known as Titans—living embodiments of primal elements—have begun emerging from deep beneath the earth and ocean, destroying everything in their path. The party is part of a desperate coalition of mages, soldiers, and monster hunters who must find a way to stop these unkillable monsters before civilization is reduced to rubble. The greatest challenge: the Titans cannot be killed, only redirected or forced back into slumber, and humanity's weapons may only make them angrier.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the "Century War" between the three arcane nations and the forbidden ritual that ended it by tearing holes in the Elemental Planes.
    *   Write the history of the "Age of Colossi," a prehistoric era when Titans ruled the world before going dormant.
    *   Describe the Titan Callers, an ancient druid order that could communicate with Titans and prevented their awakening through ritual sacrifice.
    *   Explain the nature of the World's Wound, the massive crater left by the Century War's final battle, and why it is the most magically unstable place on the planet.
    *   Detail the development of the Oblivion Lance, humanity's doomsday weapon, and the moral debates surrounding its use.
    *   Write about the theories of why the Titans are awakening now, and what they might be attempting to accomplish.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Titan Response Coalition** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Protect civilization from the Titans by any means necessary.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by a council of military generals, archmages, and civilian leaders. General Korvan Steele is the de facto military commander.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are humanity's shield. We will find a way to stop the Titans.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Hardliners within the Coalition plan to use the Oblivion Lance regardless of civilian casualties or the party's objections.
        *   **Assets:** The combined military forces of five nations, the Oblivion Lance, the Archives of the Ancients, advanced magical artillery.
        *   **Relationships:** Desperate allies with anyone who can help; increasingly authoritarian as panic spreads.
    *   **The Titan Callers (Remnant)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Restore balance between civilization and nature by communicating with the Titans and ending the magical pollution from the Century War.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Eldara Thornwhisper, the last true Titan Caller. A handful of young druids are attempting to learn the old ways.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The Titans are not our enemies; they are nature's immune response. We can coexist if we listen.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Eldara believes civilization must collapse for the world to heal, and she may be subtly sabotaging efforts to stop the Titans.
        *   **Assets:** Deep knowledge of ancient rituals, the Resonance Crown, hidden druid groves, the ability to survive in radiation zones.
        *   **Relationships:** Viewed as delusional eco-terrorists by most; hunted by Coalition hardliners; the party's uneasy allies.
    *   **The Cult of the World-Breaker** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Worship Thermagox as a god and ensure its full awakening to cleanse the world of humanity's sins.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A decentralized network of fanatics led by charismatic preachers who claim to hear Thermagox's voice.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The end times are upon us. Embrace the Titans and be reborn.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Actively sabotaging Coalition defenses and attempting to wake Thermagox prematurely.
        *   **Assets:** Sleeper cells in major cities, stolen military intelligence, suicide bombers, magical amplifiers to draw Titans toward population centers.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by all other factions; fanatically devoted to causing maximum chaos.
    *   **The Survivor Enclaves** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive the Titan crisis by abandoning the cities and creating self-sufficient, hidden communities far from Titan paths.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Each enclave is independent, led by whoever can keep people alive (often ex-military or powerful mages).
        *   **Public Agenda:** The cities are death traps. Come with us if you want to live.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Hoarding resources and information; willing to betray others to protect their own people.
        *   **Assets:** Hidden locations, stockpiles of food and supplies, knowledge of safe routes through radiation zones.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral to the party; may trade information for supplies; generally distrustful of the Coalition.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.

    *   **High Inquisitor Maris Vael:** Coalition's chief archmage, responsible for the Oblivion Lance project, believes any sacrifice is justified.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully sabotage the Oblivion Lance.
    *   **THEN:** General Steele brands them as traitors. Coalition forces hunt the party. Morale plummets. Generate a manhunt scenario where the party must evade Coalition agents while continuing their mission.
    *   **IF:** The players allow the Oblivion Lance to be used on a Titan.
    *   **THEN:** The Titan is wounded but not killed, triggering a magical explosion that destroys a major city and awakens Thermagox prematurely. Eldara refuses to help the party further. The Doom Clock advances by 25%.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully lure two Titans into fighting each other.
    *   **THEN:** One Titan is driven back into dormancy, but the battle causes catastrophic collateral damage. A third Titan is awakened by the seismic activity. The survivors' enclaves gain influence as people flee the cities.
    *   **IF:** The players complete Eldara's counter-ritual with a willing sacrifice.
    *   **THEN:** All Titans are forced back into slumber, but the sacrifice resonates across the world, causing all magic to weaken for a generation. The party becomes legends, but civilization's magical infrastructure collapses.
    *   **IF:** The party sides with the Cult of the World-Breaker (unlikely).
    *   **THEN:** Thermagox awakens fully and begins the apocalypse. The campaign shifts to a dark ending scenario where the party must survive in a post-apocalyptic world.
    *   **IF:** The Doom Clock reaches 100%.
    *   **THEN:** Thermagox fully awakens, and all other Titans converge on the World's Wound. The final session becomes a desperate evacuation where the party must save as many people as possible before the continent is destroyed.
