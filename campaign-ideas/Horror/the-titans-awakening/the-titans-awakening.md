**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Decades ago, the great arcane nations waged war using forbidden magic that tore holes in the Elemental Planes. Now, colossal creatures known as Titans—living embodiments of primal elements—have begun emerging from deep beneath the earth and ocean, destroying everything in their path. The party is part of a desperate coalition of mages, soldiers, and monster hunters who must find a way to stop these unkillable monsters before civilization is reduced to rubble. The greatest challenge: the Titans cannot be killed, only redirected or forced back into slumber, and humanity's weapons may only make them angrier.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8-12 sessions)

A campaign about facing impossible odds and humanity's consequences.

*   **Act I — The First Titan (Sessions 1–3):** The campaign begins as the party witnesses the emergence of the first Titan, Scorathyx the Flame-Born, from a volcanic region destabilized by old war-magic. They must evacuate civilians, survive the initial onslaught, and learn that conventional weapons are useless. They are recruited by the Titan Response Coalition.
*   **Act II — The Chain Reaction (Sessions 4–8):** As Scorathyx rampages toward the capital, its presence awakens more Titans across the realm. The party must split their efforts between tracking a pattern in the Titan awakenings, uncovering ancient texts about how previous civilizations dealt with these creatures, and executing desperate plans to slow the Titans' advance (leading evacuations, sabotaging dangerous weapons, and seeking the wisdom of druids who worship the Titans).
*   **Act III — The Monster King Rises (Sessions 9–12):** The party discovers that all the Titans are being drawn to a single location: the site of the original forbidden ritual. There, the greatest Titan of all—Thermagox, the World-Breaker—is awakening. The party must choose: attempt to destroy the ritual site (risking making Thermagox unstoppable), help the druids perform a counter-ritual to send all Titans back to sleep, or broker an impossible peace between the Titans and civilization by offering a monumental sacrifice.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Fire Rises"
*   **Focus:** Disaster / Introduction
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is in the mining town of Ashford when the ground begins to shake. Scorathyx emerges from the nearby volcano, a 300-foot tall creature of living magma and stone.
    *   The party must help evacuate civilians while avoiding falling buildings, lava flows, and the Titan's devastating atomic breath (a cone of superheated plasma).
    *   They witness soldiers' weapons bouncing harmlessly off Scorathyx's hide. The Titan moves toward the regional capital.
**Escalation:** A desperate general offers the party a fortune to join the newly-formed Titan Response Coalition.

### Sessions 2-3 — "We Need A Bigger Plan"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Military Fantasy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Coalition reveals that three more Titans have been detected stirring in different regions. The party is sent to the Archives of the Ancients to research how past civilizations survived "the Age of Colossi."
    *   They discover fragmented texts mentioning a Titan Caller—a druid order that could communicate with the Titans—and a mysterious artifact called the "Resonance Crown" that could influence the creatures.
    *   The party must choose which lead to follow first: find the last surviving Titan Caller, or locate the Crown in a monster-infested ruin.
**Escalation:** News arrives that Scorathyx has destroyed two cities. Public panic turns to rage, and hardliners demand the use of a doomsday weapon.

### Sessions 4-6 — "The Weapon"
*   **Focus:** Moral Dilemma / Sabotage
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party learns that the military has developed the "Oblivion Lance," a massive magical artillery weapon that could theoretically kill a Titan—but it requires sacrificing the life force of an entire city's population to fire.
    *   Simultaneously, the party meets the reclusive Titan Caller, Eldara, who reveals that killing a Titan will cause a catastrophic magical explosion that could crack the continent in half. The Titans are nature's immune response to the planar wounds from the old wars.
    *   The party must decide: sabotage the Oblivion Lance and become fugitives, or let it be used and risk an even greater disaster.
**Escalation:** A second Titan, Leviathax the Drowned, emerges from the ocean and begins marching inland toward the capital.

### Sessions 7-9 — "Titan vs. Titan"
*   **Focus:** Epic Set-Piece / Desperation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Eldara proposes a dangerous plan: use the Resonance Crown to lure Scorathyx and Leviathax into fighting each other, buying time to evacuate the capital and prepare the final ritual.
    *   The party must infiltrate the active war zone between two rampaging Titans, plant resonance pylons, and survive the collateral devastation as the two creatures battle.
    *   They witness the awe and terror of the Titan battle—city blocks vaporized, tidal waves summoned, the earth itself cracking.
**Escalation:** The battle causes seismic ripples that awaken Thermagox, the oldest and most powerful Titan, deep beneath the earth.

### Sessions 10-12 — "The World-Breaker"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Impossible Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Thermagox begins to rise from the World's Wound, the site of the original forbidden ritual. Its awakening will trigger a magical chain reaction that will awaken dozens more Titans.
    *   The party learns of three possible solutions:
        1. Destroy the ritual site entirely (may kill Thermagox but risks destabilizing the entire region).
        2. Complete Eldara's counter-ritual (requires the willing sacrifice of one party member's life).
        3. Allow the hardliners to use the Oblivion Lance on Thermagox (will definitely kill millions and might kill the Titan).
    *   The final session is a race against time as Thermagox breaches the surface, and the party must execute their chosen plan while fending off cultists, desperate soldiers, and Thermagox's devastating presence.
**Resolution:** The campaign ends with the choice's consequences—a world saved but changed, and the knowledge that more Titans slumber beneath.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Scorathyx the Flame-Born** — *The First Titan*
    *   **Role:** The 300-foot tall creature of molten stone and fire that first emerges. It is the catalyst for the entire crisis.
    *   **Personality:** Not malevolent—simply a force of nature. It moves with purpose, not rage, as if following an ancient instinct.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Scorathyx is drawn to magical radiation. It can sense the planar wounds left by the old wars and is attempting to seal them by consuming the corrupted magic.

2.  **General Korvan Steele** — *The Hardliner*
    *   **Role:** Commander of the Titan Response Coalition's military forces. A pragmatic, ruthless leader who believes overwhelming force is the only answer.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, calculating, and willing to make horrific sacrifices for "the greater good." He views the Titans as an enemy to be destroyed, not understood.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Korvan's family was killed in Scorathyx's first rampage. His judgment is clouded by vengeance, making him dangerously unpredictable.

3.  **Eldara Thornwhisper** — *The Titan Caller*
    *   **Role:** The last surviving member of an ancient druid order that communicated with the Titans. She is the party's guide to understanding the creatures.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, ancient (over 300 years old), and deeply connected to nature. She speaks in riddles and parables, infuriating those who want quick answers.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Eldara believes that humanity's time as the dominant species is over, and the Titans' return is natural evolution. She may be willing to sacrifice civilization to restore balance.

4.  **Thermagox the World-Breaker** — *The Monster King*
    *   **Role:** The oldest, largest, and most powerful Titan—an ancient god-beast slumbering beneath the World's Wound. Its awakening is the campaign's climax.
    *   **Personality:** If Scorathyx is a force of nature, Thermagox is a force of apocalypse. It radiates an aura of primal dominance that makes even other Titans bow.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Thermagox is the living embodiment of the planet's will. If it fully awakens, it will "reboot" the world by purging all civilization and magic, returning the land to a primordial state.

## Key Locations

1.  **Ashford:** A mining town built on a dormant volcano, the site of Scorathyx's emergence. Now a lava-scarred ruin.
2.  **The Capital - Highcrest:** A gleaming metropolis of a million souls, directly in the path of multiple Titans. The site of political intrigue and desperate last stands.
3.  **The World's Wound:** A massive, miles-wide crater left by the ancient war's forbidden ritual. The air shimmers with unstable magic, and reality itself bends. Thermagox sleeps at its center.
4.  **The Archives of the Ancients:** A fortress-library built into a mountain, housing the world's collected knowledge. Home to the clues about the Resonance Crown and Titan Callers.
5.  **The Oblivion Lance Platform:** A massive, arcane artillery installation built on a floating city. A monument to humanity's hubris and desperation.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of humanity's hubris, environmental consequences, and the impossibility of "winning" against nature. The central conflict is not just defeating the Titans, but deciding what price the players are willing to pay—and whether humanity deserves to survive its own mistakes. Every solution requires sacrifice, and the party must weigh pragmatism against morality while the world burns around them.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Titan Scale Combat**
*   Titans cannot be fought traditionally. Instead, encounters focus on **environmental survival** and **indirect tactics**.
*   When a Titan is present, the battlefield is divided into zones of increasing danger. Players must use skill checks (Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception) to avoid devastation.
*   Players can harm Titans only through set-piece objectives: **"Collapse the bridge to slow it," "Activate the ancient harpoon cannon," "Lure it into the canyon."**
*   Damage to Titans is tracked as **Progress Points** toward the encounter goal (delay, redirect, or wound), not HP.

### 2. **The Doom Clock**
*   The campaign uses a persistent **Doom Clock** representing the spread of Titan awakenings and civilian casualties.
*   The clock advances based on failed missions, time spent resting, or choosing not to respond to distress calls.
*   When the clock reaches certain thresholds:
    *   **25%:** A new Titan awakens.
    *   **50%:** A major city falls.
    *   **75%:** The military deploys the Oblivion Lance (with or without the party's approval).
    *   **100%:** Thermagox fully awakens, triggering the apocalypse.

### 3. **Radiation Zones**
*   Areas affected by Titan presence or ancient war magic emit magical radiation.
*   Prolonged exposure causes **Titan Sickness:** Constitution saves or gain exhaustion. Casters in radiation zones have a chance for spells to surge wildly.
*   Special gear (lead-lined armor, anti-magic charms) can mitigate this, but such gear is rare and expensive.
