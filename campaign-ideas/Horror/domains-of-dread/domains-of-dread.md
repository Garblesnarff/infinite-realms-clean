## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Domains of Dread
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Gothic Horror / Dark Fantasy / Psychological Terror
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 22-28 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **15-17**
**Tone (keywords):** gothic horror, cursed domains, darklords, redemption impossible, mist-trapped, corruption, despair
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party is pulled through reality-tearing mists into the Domains of Dread—pocket dimensions ruled by darklords cursed by the Dark Powers for their evil deeds. Each domain reflects its darklord's sins: Count Strahd von Zarovich's vampire realm of eternal longing, Azalin the lich's time-looped kingdom, or Ivana Boritsi's poison garden of false beauty. To escape the mists, the party must either redeem or destroy these darklords while resisting the corruption that transforms heroes into monsters—the same corruption that created the darklords themselves.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 22-28 sessions)

A four-act descent into gothic horror across multiple cursed domains.

*   **Act I — Into the Mists (Sessions 1-7):** The party is drawn through unnatural mists into Barovia, realm of Count Strahd von Zarovich. They find a land of eternal twilight where hope dies, villagers cower in fear, and the vampire lord treats mortals as playthings. They learn the rules: darklords cannot leave their domains, the mists kill those who try to escape, and the Dark Powers feed on despair. Strahd becomes obsessed with one party member who resembles his lost love Tatyana. The party must survive long enough to understand what the Dark Powers want.
*   **Act II — The Curse Revealed (Sessions 8-14):** Escaping Strahd temporarily, the party discovers the Mists connect multiple domains, each with its own darklord and unique horror. They travel through Lamordia (Frankenstein science horror), Valachan (hunted by a beast lord), and Har'Akir (cursed mummy's desert tomb). Each domain teaches a lesson about sin, punishment, and the impossibility of redemption. They learn darklords are prisoners of their own evil—cursed to desire what they can never have while their domains reflect their sins eternally.
*   **Act III — Corruption's Temptation (Sessions 15-21):** The Dark Powers begin offering the party bargains: power in exchange for dark deeds, escape in exchange for souls, knowledge for corruption. Party members receive "dark gifts" that grant power but carry terrible prices. They realize they're being groomed to become new darklords. Meanwhile, they discover a potential escape: if they can break a darklord's curse by making them truly repent, the domain might collapse. But darklords are evil beyond redemption—or are they?
*   **Act IV — Masters of Their Domain (Sessions 22-28):** The party returns to confront Strahd, now understanding the true nature of the Domains of Dread. They must choose: kill Strahd and risk becoming the new darklord of Barovia themselves, genuinely redeem him (nearly impossible), or find another way. The Dark Powers watch eagerly, hoping the party's corruption will create new domains. The final confrontation tests not just martial prowess but moral conviction—will they escape with souls intact, or join the ranks of the damned?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the corrupting nature of power, whether true redemption is possible for the truly evil, the fine line between hero and monster, and the cost of survival at any price. It asks: Would you sacrifice your morals to save yourself? Can evil be redeemed or only destroyed? At what point does the monster hunter become the monster? The central conflict pits the party's desire to escape against the Dark Powers' desire to corrupt them into new darklords.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Powers Checks (Corruption)**
*   When characters commit evil acts in the domains, roll Powers Checks
*   Failed checks grant corruption points and possible physical/mental changes
*   High corruption: alignment shifts, physical mutations, haunted by guilty visions
*   If corruption reaches maximum, Dark Powers may offer to make character a darklord
*   Redemption possible but difficult—requires genuine atonement and sacrifice

### 2. **Dark Gifts**
*   The Dark Powers offer gifts that grant significant power
*   Each gift has a terrible, often hidden cost
*   Examples: resurrection at cost of another's life, immunity to fear but also to love
*   Accepting gifts increases corruption but may be necessary for survival
*   NPCs who accepted dark gifts serve as warnings

### 3. **The Mists**
*   Attempting to leave domains without permission triggers mist encounters
*   Mists disorient, drain vitality, potentially kill
*   Party needs darklord's permission, special items, or Dark Powers' favor to pass safely
*   Mists also transport party between domains at dramatically appropriate times

### 4. **Horror Saves**
*   Characters make Wisdom saves when confronting true horror
*   Failures cause fear, paralysis, temporary madness, or lasting phobias
*   Repeated exposure builds tolerance but also emotional numbness
*   Track party's mental deterioration over campaign

### 5. **Strahd's Obsession**
*   One PC is marked as Tatyana's reincarnation
*   Strahd appears periodically to "court" them—dinner invitations, gifts, threats to others
*   He won't kill them but will torment companions
*   This PC faces unique social challenges and temptations
*   Final confrontation heavily involves this relationship

### 6. **Curse Investigation**
*   Each darklord's curse must be investigated like a mystery
*   Discovering their original sin, their heart's desire, and why they can't attain it
*   Knowledge grants advantages in confrontations
*   Possibility of breaking curse through achieving impossible redemption
*   But darklords resist redemption—they've embraced their evil
