# Creative Brief: Domains of Dread

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Victorian Horror (Ravenloft-inspired)

Inspired by the haunting aesthetics of *Dracula*, *Frankenstein*, classic Hammer Horror films, and gothic literature. This style captures the oppressive atmosphere of cursed lands, the decadent decay of vampire castles, and the creeping corruption that transforms heroes into monsters.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Gothic Architecture:** Towering castles, gargoyles, wrought iron, crumbling estates, foggy graveyards
*   **Perpetual Twilight:** Never fully day or night, muted colors, oppressive atmosphere
*   **Corruption Made Visible:** Physical manifestations of moral decay, subtle wrongness
*   **Period Horror:** Victorian/medieval fusion, classic monster archetypes, period-appropriate fear

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gothic, oppressive, melancholic, cursed, decaying beauty, inescapable doom, corruption
*   **Feeling:** The weight of hopelessness pressing down. Beauty twisted into something wrong. Elegance concealing horror. The sense of being watched by malevolent forces.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant Tones:** Deep blacks, grays, muted browns, sickly greens
*   **Accent Colors:** Blood red, corpse pale, tarnished silver, dying purple
*   **Lighting:** No bright sunlight—only pale moonlight, dying firelight, storm-gray clouds
*   **Seasonal:** Eternal autumn dying into winter, dead leaves, frost but no snow
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of deep blacks and grays with blood red accents. Sickly green moonlight filters through storm clouds. No bright colors—everything muted and dying. The landscape shows eternal autumn: bare trees, dead leaves, frost-covered ground. Tarnished silver and corpse-pale skin tones dominate."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Corrupted Heroes:** Starting normal but showing gradual physical changes—pale skin, dark veins, haunted eyes
*   **Strahd:** Elegant vampire lord in noble attire (high collar, cape, aristocratic), handsome but predatory
*   **Darklords:** Each reflects their domain's horror—beast features, corpse aspects, unnatural beauty
*   **Peasants:** Downtrodden, malnourished, hollow-eyed, medieval clothing worn and patched
*   **Monsters:** Classic gothic—vampires, werewolves, flesh golems, mummies, spectres
*   **Prompt Example:** "Count Strahd von Zarovich in aristocratic Victorian finery: high-collared black coat with red silk lining, cape, ruffled white shirt. Pale, handsome face with cruel elegance. Eyes glow faintly red. Sharp fangs barely visible. Stands in castle doorway backlit by dying firelight. Welcoming smile that promises danger."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Castle Ravenloft:** Massive gothic architecture with towers, gargoyles, grand halls decaying, crypts beneath
*   **Barovia Village:** Medieval hamlet with wooden buildings, mud streets, fearful peasants, fortified church
*   **The Mists:** Thick, unnatural fog with faces or hands barely visible, gray-white and impenetrable
*   **Domains:** Each reflects sin—lush poison gardens, frozen wastelands, jungle hunting grounds, endless deserts
*   **Prompt Example:** "Castle Ravenloft perched on a mountain cliff. Gothic architecture with sharp spires, flying buttresses, grotesque gargoyles. Windows glow with cold light. Storm clouds perpetually gather overhead. Lightning illuminates the scene. Below, thick mists obscure the valleys. A single winding path leads up through dead forests. Atmosphere of elegant menace."

**5. Horror and Corruption:**
*   **Visual Corruption:** Dark veins spreading under skin, eyes dulling or glowing, hair graying, features sharpening
*   **Environmental Wrong:** Plants that move unnaturally, shadows that don't match, geometry that feels off
*   **Monster Reveals:** Classic horror framing—shadows first, partial reveals, then full monster
*   **Gothic Violence:** Bloodstains on elegant surfaces, violence contrasted with beauty
*   **Prompt Example:** "A party member showing corruption: dark veins spreading up their neck like cracks in porcelain. Eyes have faint glow. Skin paler than natural. Expression haunted. Behind them, their shadow moves slightly out of sync. In their hand, a cursed artifact glows with sickly green light. They stand in elegant but decaying room—beauty and rot together."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Chiaroscuro:** Extreme contrast between light and shadow
*   **Cold Lighting:** Moonlight, storm light, no warm tones
*   **Firelight:** Orange-red but flickering, dying, providing little comfort
*   **Mist Diffusion:** Soft edges on distant objects, everything hazy
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by cold moonlight streaming through broken windows, creating dramatic shadows. A dying fire provides faint orange-red warmth that barely pushes back the darkness. Mist diffuses all light sources, creating halos and obscuring distances. Deep black shadows hide details, suggesting unseen horrors. Chiaroscuro lighting emphasizes faces and important details."

## Voice

A somber, Victorian narrator's voice with cultured elegance hiding dread. The pacing is measured and deliberate, building tension through restraint. The tone shifts between melancholic observation and mounting horror. Occasional quotes from gothic literature. Underlying theme of inescapable doom and corruption. The voice carries aristocratic refinement concealing monstrosity—like Strahd himself. Pauses meaningfully. Role: The voice of gothic horror and tragic damnation.
