### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Domains of Dread**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party is pulled through reality-tearing mists into pocket dimensions ruled by darklords—villains cursed by the Dark Powers for their evil. Each domain reflects its darklord's sins. To escape, the party must either redeem or destroy these darklords while resisting the corruption that could transform them into darklords themselves.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Dark Powers and their unknowable nature as cosmic judges of evil.
    *   Write Strahd von Zarovich's history: good man to conqueror to fratricidal vampire.
    *   Describe Tatyana's curse—eternal reincarnation and Strahd's doomed pursuit.
    *   Explain how domains form around great evils as personalized prisons.
    *   Detail the nature of the Mists and how they trap both darklords and visitors.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A character commits evil acts → **THEN:** Powers Check rolled; failure grants corruption and physical changes.
*   **IF:** Character accepts dark gift → **THEN:** Gains power but suffers hidden cost and corruption.
*   **IF:** Party tries to escape through mists → **THEN:** Disorientation, vitality drain, potentially death.
*   **IF:** Strahd's Tatyana obsession target is harmed → **THEN:** His fury escalates; entire domains mobilize.
*   **IF:** Darklord is truly redeemed → **THEN:** Domain collapses; all inhabitants freed or die.
*   **IF:** Party's corruption reaches maximum → **THEN:** Dark Powers offer to make them a new darklord.
