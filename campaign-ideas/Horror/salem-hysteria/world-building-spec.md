### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Salem Hysteria**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The players are residents of Salem Village in 1692 when a few young girls' accusations of witchcraft spiral into mass hysteria that tears the community apart through paranoid accusations, spectral evidence, and judicial murder. The campaign explores how rational people succumb to mass hysteria, the horror of legal systems run by paranoia, and whether there's escape from accusation once the witch hunt begins.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Puritan theology and why they believed in witchcraft as satanic conspiracy.
    *   Write about Salem Village's social tensions before trials: property disputes, ministerial conflicts, class divisions.
    *   Describe spectral evidence and other "witch tests" the court accepted.
    *   Explain the confession system: confess and name others to live, deny and hang.
    *   Detail the afflicted girls' symptoms and various theories for their behavior.
    *   Write about the aftermath: recantations, apologies, lives destroyed.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Court** (Major): Goals—Purge witchcraft from Salem. Accept spectral evidence and demand confessions.
    *   **The Afflicted** (Major): Goals—Continue accusations to maintain attention and power.
    *   **The Accused** (Major—Victims): Goals—Survive through confession or maintain innocence unto death.
    *   **The Skeptics** (Minor—Dangerous): Goals—Question trials and preserve reason. Most get accused.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Salem Meeting House:** Community center becoming accusation site.
*   **The Court:** Where impossible defenses fail against spectral evidence.
*   **Salem Jail:** Brutal conditions where accused await certain conviction.
*   **Gallows Hill:** Execution site for those maintaining innocence.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Triggers:** IF players defend accused THEN Suspicion increases dramatically. IF players confess THEN they must name others. IF hysteria reaches peak THEN even authority figures are accused. IF governor's family threatened THEN trials suddenly end.
