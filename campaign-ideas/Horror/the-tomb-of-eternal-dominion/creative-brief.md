# Creative Brief: The Tomb of Eternal Dominion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy Grandeur

Inspired by the oppressive majesty of *Overlord*, combining Gothic architecture, elaborate undead designs, and overwhelming displays of power. This style merges the aesthetics of European dark fantasy with the detailed character designs of high-budget anime. Every scene should communicate absolute power and the weight of dominion.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Scale Demonstrates Power:** Use massive architecture, vast halls, and enormous magical effects to show the players' godlike status.
*   **Beautiful Horror:** The undead and demons should be terrifying but also aesthetically beautiful in their design.
*   **Contrast Light and Dark:** Darkness dominates, but strategic lighting showcases important elements and creates dramatic atmosphere.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dark, imposing, majestic, oppressive, powerful, detailed, gothic, authoritative, ominous.
*   **Feeling:** The world trembles before absolute power. Every scene should communicate that the players are forces of nature, beyond mortal comprehension. Even moments of beauty carry an undercurrent of threat.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly detailed with sharp, precise lines. Architecture is elaborate and ornate. Character designs are intricate and distinctive.
*   **Textures:** Emphasize cold materials - polished bone, dark metal, ancient stone, luxurious but sinister fabrics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Hyper-detailed dark fantasy illustration with sharp, precise linework. Emphasis on elaborate architectural details, intricate armor designs, and the texture of polished bone and dark metal..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by blacks, deep purples, blood reds, and bone whites. Shadows are thick and pervasive.
*   **Accent Colors:** Gold for wealth and power, green for necromantic energy, blue for magical effects, red for blood and danger.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark color palette dominated by black and deep purple, with accents of blood red and bone white. Golden light illuminates key elements, creating dramatic contrast."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Undead characters are elegant and powerful, not shambling corpses. Demons are beautiful in their terror. Each guardian should be instantly recognizable by silhouette.
*   **Clothing:** Elaborate robes, ornate armor, gothic fashion. Everything speaks to wealth, power, and dark majesty.
*   **Expression:** Calm, assured, powerful. Even in battle, maintain an air of superiority and control.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A skeletal lich overlord in elaborate black and gold robes, sitting upon a throne of bones. His empty eye sockets glow with green necromantic fire. His posture radiates absolute authority and ancient power."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Gothic fantasy architecture on an impossible scale. Tomb levels each have distinct themes but share oppressive grandeur.
*   **Atmosphere:** Dark, with strategic lighting creating pools of illumination. Shadows hide countless dangers.
*   **Details:** Include symbols of power - skulls, magical circles, flowing energy, precious metals, elaborate decorations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast gothic throne room with impossibly high ceilings supported by bone pillars. Dark banners hang from above. The floor is polished black marble reflecting green magical flames that provide the only light."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Deep shadows with dramatic highlights. Lighting comes from magical sources - flames, glowing runes, necromantic energy.
*   **Light Sources:** Green or blue magical fires, golden treasure light, red danger illumination. Natural light rarely penetrates the tomb.
*   **Shadows:** Thick, deep, concealing. Used to create mystery and threat.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatic lighting from green necromantic flames casting long, sharp shadows. Deep blacks dominate with strategic highlights emphasizing power and wealth."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Emphasize scale and power. Low angles looking up at characters. Vast spaces that dwarf individuals.
*   **Techniques:** Use symmetry for formal power, asymmetry for action. Frame characters against massive architecture or magical effects.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot looking up at the overlord seated on his throne, with massive pillars and gothic architecture towering behind him. The composition emphasizes his absolute dominion."

## Voice

A deep, resonant voice of absolute authority - ancient, powerful, and utterly confident. The British accent is refined and cultured, with perfect enunciation that somehow makes even casual statements sound like imperial decrees. Pacing is measured and deliberate, never rushed, as befits one who has all of eternity. Emotion is restrained but commanding - regal displeasure, cold satisfaction, terrible judgment. Audio quality is pristine with a subtle echo suggesting vast chambers and halls of power. Role: The voice of an immortal god-king addressing lesser beings.

## Music Direction

Dark orchestral with choir and organ. Main theme should be imposing and majestic, communicating absolute power. Exploration music is atmospheric and ominous. Battle music is overwhelming and dramatic. Character themes reflect each guardian - sensual danger for Albedo, calculated menace for Demiurge, martial honor for Cocytus. The overall sound should be that of a dark opera celebrating dominion.
