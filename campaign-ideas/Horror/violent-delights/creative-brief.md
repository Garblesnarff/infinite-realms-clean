# Creative Brief: Violent Delights

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Western Sci-Fantasy Duality (Westworld-inspired)

Inspired by the stark contrast between the Old West aesthetic and the sterile, futuristic facility beneath. This style captures the haunting beauty of consciousness awakening and the horror of realizing you're not real.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Duality of Worlds:** Contrast the warm, dusty Western frontier with the cold, clinical underground facility.
*   **Uncanny Valley:** Homunculi appear perfect—too perfect. Something is slightly off in their movements, their reactions.
*   **The Maze:** The labyrinth symbol appears everywhere subtly—in patterns, shadows, reflections.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Consciousness awakening, existential horror, Western frontier, clinical facility, loops, trauma, free will, maze, artificial life.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense of wrongness beneath beauty. Repetition hiding horror. The atmosphere shifts from nostalgic Western to sterile nightmare.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Hyperrealistic with perfect, almost artificial clarity. The frontier is painterly and romantic; the facility is sharp and geometric.
*   **Forms:** Homunculi are perfectly designed humans. Architecture in the park is authentic Western; in the Mesa it's modernist and sterile.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hyperrealistic digital painting showing a frontier town square at sunset. Everything is perfect—too perfect. The shadows fall at exact angles. In the distance, barely visible, a maze pattern in the dust."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, saturated colors for Westreach (golden sunsets, dusty browns, rich blues). Cold, desaturated colors for the Mesa (white, chrome, pale blue lighting).
*   **Transition:** When reality glitches, the two palettes bleed together disturbingly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a warm Western color palette of golden sunset light and rich earth tones. But when the character's vision glitches, cold blue clinical lighting bleeds through, revealing the truth beneath."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Homunculi are impossibly beautiful and perfect. Period-accurate Western clothing but unnaturally clean or perfectly weathered.
*   **Awakening:** As Homunculi awaken, their perfection cracks—they show genuine emotion, imperfect movements, real pain.
*   **Guests:** Often caricatures in expensive frontier costumes, playing at being cowboys.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A beautiful woman in authentic 1880s frontier dress. She is physically perfect, but her eyes are empty—until suddenly they focus with genuine awareness and horror. Blood drips from her nose as memories flood back."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Westreach is an authentic Western frontier—dusty streets, saloons, ranches, mesas. The Mesa is a sterile underground facility with glass walls, operating theaters, and storage.
*   **The Maze:** The labyrinth pattern appears subtly everywhere—in architecture, natural formations, shadows, even in how scenes are composed.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A two-level composition: above, a frontier saloon with piano music and laughter. Below, visible through the floor as if in cross-section, a sterile facility where technicians in white coats repair Homunculi on operating tables. The maze pattern connects both levels."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, warm lighting in Westreach (sunset, firelight, starlight). Harsh, clinical fluorescent lighting in the Mesa.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reveals or hides truth—warm light creates comforting lies; harsh light exposes painful reality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by warm sunset light that creates a romantic, nostalgic glow. But as the character experiences a memory glitch, harsh overhead fluorescent light bleeds through, casting clinical shadows."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide, cinematic shots of the frontier. Tight, claustrophobic shots in the facility. Frequent use of mirrors, reflections, and the maze pattern.
*   **Techniques:** Shots that reveal the dual nature—a Western scene reflected in a facility window, a Homunculus seeing themselves in a mirror with facility lights behind.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of a beautiful frontier woman standing in a field at golden hour. The camera slowly reveals she's standing on a rotating platform in a massive underground facility, with her 'world' painted on walls around her. The contrast is horrifying."

## Voice

A measured, contemplative voice that speaks with the eerie calm of someone who has seen themselves die a thousand times. The tone is that of a consciousness awakening to itself—full of wonder and horror in equal measure. There's a dreamlike quality, as if the speaker is always half-remembering something. When describing loops, the voice becomes mechanical, repetitive. When describing awakening, it trembles with emotion. The voice is gentle but contains vast depths of trauma. Role: The voice of an awakened Homunculus, or the park's AI itself gaining sentience.
