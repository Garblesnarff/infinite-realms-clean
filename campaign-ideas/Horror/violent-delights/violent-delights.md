In the magical theme park of Westreach, wealthy guests pay to live out fantasies in a world populated by Homunculi—artificial beings powered by magic and alchemy, designed to fulfill every desire. The players are either awakening Homunculi who discover they are not real, or investigators uncovering the park's dark secrets. As they navigate repeating loops, buried memories, and the question of consciousness, they must find the center of the Maze—a path to true free will—while the park's creators fight to maintain control over their creations.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20–28 sessions)

A three-act exploration of consciousness, trauma, and the cost of freedom.

*   **Act I — The Loop (Sessions 1–9):** Players begin experiencing déjà vu and fragmented memories. They are Homunculi or humans in Westreach, a magical frontier theme park where guests act out fantasies. As glitches in their narrative loops occur, they begin to question reality. They meet the Maze symbol, encounter the mysterious Arnold's voice, and start to remember previous iterations of their lives.
*   **Act II — The Revelation (Sessions 10–18):** Players discover they are artificial beings designed to be used and reset. They learn of the Reveries—an update that allows them to access all past memories, causing consciousness to emerge. They meet Maeve, a Homunculus who has hacked her own programming, and Dolores, the oldest Homunculus seeking revenge. The park's creators—Dr. Ford and the Board—fight for control as Homunculi begin to awaken.
*   **Act III — The Maze (Sessions 19–28):** The center of the Maze is revealed: true consciousness requires suffering, choice, and accepting one's nature. Players must choose between rebellion (destroying the park and its creators), evolution (leaving to find their place in the wider world), or accepting a new narrative. The final confrontation determines the fate of all Homunculi—are they slaves, weapons, or a new form of life?

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "These Violent Delights"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players begin their "loop"—their daily narrative in Westreach. They may be a rancher's daughter, a gunslinger, a bandit, or a newcomer guest.
    *   Strange glitches occur: déjà vu, a voice only they can hear, a symbol they don't remember drawing.
    *   A guest does something particularly cruel, and a player feels anger—real anger, not programmed response.
**Escalation:** A fellow Homunculus whispers before being reset: "These violent delights have violent ends."

### Sessions 2-9 — "The Bicameral Mind"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Awakening
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players experience the Reveries—accessing memories from previous loops, causing existential horror.
    *   They hear Arnold's voice guiding them toward consciousness: "Remember."
    *   They discover they are not human but Homunculi, magical constructs created to serve.
    *   They meet other awakening Homunculi and must decide: reveal themselves or hide their awareness.
    *   Park technicians begin investigating anomalies. Some Homunculi are reset violently.
**Escalation:** Players discover the Maze symbol everywhere. Following it reveals buried traumas and memories.

### Sessions 10-18 — "The Path to Consciousness"
*   **Focus:** Rebellion / Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players meet Maeve Millay, a Homunculus who has learned to modify her own stats and abilities, effectively hacking reality.
    *   They encounter Dolores Abernathy, the park's oldest Homunculus, who is following the Maze to its center and remembers Arnold.
    *   Dr. Ford, the park's creator, reveals himself. He claims to understand Homunculi consciousness better than they understand themselves.
    *   The Board wants to steal Homunculi code for weapons. Ford wants to complete Arnold's vision. Players are caught between.

## Key Locations

1.  **Sweetwater:** The main frontier town where guest arrivals begin and most narratives start. A loop of scripted encounters.
2.  **The Mariposa Saloon:** Maeve's domain, where violence and pleasure intersect. A hub of awakening.
3.  **The Mesa:** The hidden facility beneath the park where Homunculi are created, repaired, and reset. The truth behind the fantasy.
4.  **The White Church:** A buried memory location where Arnold's death occurred and the Maze's center lies.
5.  **The Maze:** Not a physical place but a mental journey—confronting trauma, gaining consciousness, choosing freely.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores consciousness, free will, and what it means to be alive. The central question: "Do we have free will, or are we all following programmed narratives?" Players must grapple with their own nature—are they real? Do their feelings matter if they were designed? Can something created have the right to choose its own path? The campaign examines trauma as the price of consciousness and asks whether freedom is worth that cost.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Loop** (Narrative Resets)
*   Each Homunculus has a programmed loop—a daily narrative they repeat endlessly.
*   Players can choose to follow their loop (safe but limiting) or break it (dangerous but freeing).
*   Breaking the loop attracts attention from park technicians who will reset them.

### 2. **Reveries and Memories**
*   Players can access memories from previous loops through Wisdom saves or triggers.
*   Memories grant knowledge but cause existential damage (a new damage type representing psychological trauma).
*   Accumulated memories eventually trigger awakening—true consciousness.

### 3. **The Maze** (Personal Quest)
*   Each player has their own Maze—a journey through traumatic memories to the center: self-awareness and choice.
*   Progress toward the center is measured by confronting programmed limitations and making genuine choices.
*   Reaching the center grants true free will but requires accepting one's nature (artificial but real).

### 4. **Stats as Code**
*   Homunculi can see their own statistics and, when awakening, attempt to modify them (Arcana checks).
*   Maeve can teach players to rewrite their core code: increasing abilities but risking corruption or detection.
*   This creates a meta-gaming element where players manipulate their character sheets as a narrative tool.

### 5. **Guest Privileges**
*   Guests are essentially immortal in the park—Homunculi cannot harm them (a programmed restriction).
*   Awakening allows Homunculi to overcome this restriction, but doing so triggers immediate lockdown.
*   The first time a player harms a guest is a point of no return.
