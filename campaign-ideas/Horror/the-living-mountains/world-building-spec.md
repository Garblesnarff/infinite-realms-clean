# The Living Mountains - World Building Specification

## World History
**The Titan Age** (50,000+ years ago): Titans created by Architects as living landmasses. Purpose: terraform world, provide stable platforms for life. Successful—ecosystems flourish on their backs.

**The Architect Collapse** (12,000 years ago): Architect civilization fell (war, plague, unknown). Titans left autonomous. Continue migration patterns programmed millennia ago.

**Human Settlement** (10,000 years ago - present): Humans evolved/arrived, settled on Titans without knowing. Built civilizations on stable regions. Occasional disasters when Titans move dramatically, but rare enough to be considered "natural" events.

**The Forgetting** (8,000 years ago): Knowledge that Titans are alive lost. Became myth, then forgotten entirely. Mountains considered geological until rediscovered.

**Campaign Era**: First major awakening in centuries. Multiple factors converging—human impact, Architect return, natural cycles.

## Cosmology
**The World**: Planet is 70% ocean. Land exists only on Titans' backs. No natural continents.

**The Titans**: Approximately 50 worldwide. Range from 10-mile "small" Titans to 500-mile mega-Titans. Party's focus: Kelsara (50-mile length, moderate size).

**Titan Biology**:
- Lifespan: Unknown, possibly immortal
- Diet: Filter-feed ocean nutrients, photosynthesize, geothermal absorption
- Reproduction: Unknown (possibly don't reproduce—engineered beings)
- Awareness: Semi-sentient, dream-like intelligence
- Movement: Slow (miles per decade normal), can move fast in distress

**The Architects**: Ancient race, humanoid but taller, crystalline biology, magic-technology fusion. Built underwater cities using Titan-tech. Population: ~10,000 survivors globally.

## Geography
**Kelsara** (Primary Titan): Turtle-like body, mountains are shell plates, valleys are gaps between, rivers follow natural grooves. "Head" region is dense jungle (moist, warm). "Tail" region is tundra (less blood flow, colder). Population on back: ~2 million humans across multiple nations.

**Other Titans**: Vary in shape—some whale-like, others insectoid, one resembles coiled dragon. Each supports different civilizations. Trade between Titans requires ships.

**The Deep Ocean**: Between Titans. Dangerous. Home to Architect cities, massive sea creatures, crushing pressures.

## Magic System
**Titan Magic**: Unique school of magic for interfacing with Titans. Requires attunement (dangerous). Allows: perception at Titan scale, communication, minor healing, navigation.

**Architect Technology**: Crystalline devices that harmonize with Titan biology. Can control, enhance, or harm Titans. Party may gain access.

**Blight**: Magical disease specific to Titans. Symptoms: fever (geothermal activity), delirium (erratic movement), necrosis (land dying). Fatal if untreated.

## Inhabitants
**The Walkers**: Secret society (500 members globally) monitoring Titans. Scholars, druids, monks. Preserve knowledge, prevent disasters covertly. Headquarters in Kelsara's Heart Chamber.

**Surface Civilizations**: Ignorant of living world. Range from medieval kingdoms to early-industrial nations. Religions often worship "divine earth" (accidentally correct).

**Architects**: View themselves as rightful Titan shepherds. Humanity is invasive species. Technologically superior but numerically inferior.

**Titan Fauna**: Creatures living symbiotically on/in Titans. Massive scale: "small" parasites are bull-sized. Immune system entities (antibodies) are building-sized. Create unique bestiaryfor campaign.

## Cultural Details
**Walker Rituals**: Meditation allowing Titan-scale perception. Dangerous—can lose self in vastness. Requires training. Enables communication.

**Surface Ignorance**: Most people reject evidence of living Titans. Cognitive dissonance, religious objections, simple disbelief.

**Architect Culture**: Reverence for Titans borders on religious. View controlling them as sacred duty. Humanity's presence is sacrilege.

**Titan "Personality"**: Each Titan has temperament. Kelsara: calm, patient, ancient. Others: aggressive, playful, dormant. Affects life on their backs.

## Key Secrets
- Titans were engineered, not evolved (artificial life)
- Architects deliberately abandoned surface world (reason unknown—perhaps plague they're fleeing)
- Some Titans are nearing end of programmed lifespan (world is temporary)
- Human pollution/magic is slowly poisoning Titans (cancer-like)
- One Titan has achieved full sentience (Godlike intelligence) and observes campaign
- Titan reproduction is possible but requires Architect intervention (they've prevented it)
- Ancient war weaponized Titans against each other (horrific)
- Deep ocean contains failed Titan prototypes (broken, hostile)
- Party's choices determine if Titans evolve into true gods or die out
- Titans dream—and dreams shape reality subtly (reality is less stable than assumed)

## Appendix
**Titan Roster**:
- Kelsara (Party's home, 50 miles)
- Morath (Aggressive, 200 miles)
- Sephis (Gentle, 30 miles)
- The Great Unnamed (Largest, 500 miles, fully sentient)

**Campaign Timeline**:
- Act I: Discovery of truth
- Act II: Addressing Kelsara's illness
- Act III: Global crisis and Architect return
- Act IV: Choosing coexistence model or exodus

This world asks: **What if the ground beneath you had feelings?** Every choice has weight—literally.
