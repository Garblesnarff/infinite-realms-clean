# The Living Mountains - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Biopunk meets epic fantasy. Landscapes that are clearly biological upon close inspection—mountains with skin texture, rivers following vein patterns, forests as fur/scales. Think Shadow of the Colossus scale meets Avatar's living world connection.

**Color Palette**: Earth tones (browns, greens, grays) that reveal biological undertones (pink flesh beneath stone crust, blue-green ichor in "water," bioluminescent organs).

**Scale**: Constantly emphasize impossibility—"The valley you're crossing is actually a scar. That mountain range ahead? It's the Titan's spine, visible through eroded skin."

## Music and Sound Design
**Ambient**: Slow heartbeats (subsonic), breathing (wind patterns), digestion (underground rumbles). Living world sounds.

**Titan Communication**: Bass resonance felt rather than heard, psychic impressions, environmental language (earthquakes as words).

**Exploration**: Wonder mixed with unease—beautiful landscapes hiding grotesque biological reality.

## Voice Acting
**Elder Mora**: Calm, patient, scholarly warmth, accepts death gracefully.

**Director Vasik**: Corporate smooth, rationalizes cruelty, believes own justifications.

**High Architect Oren**: Ancient, alien cadence, genuine love for Titans, fanatical but understandable.

**Titan Impressions**: Non-verbal—communicate through sensations, emotions, environmental changes described dramatically.

## Atmosphere
This campaign should feel like **environmental horror meets wonder**—beauty in the grotesque, terror in scale, and constant underlying question: "Is the ground about to move beneath us?"
