**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Ravenna completes identity theft THEN Snow White is erased and usurpation becomes permanent
*   IF the Magic Mirror is freed THEN evidence of illegitimacy becomes public
*   IF the seven guards' curse is broken THEN powerful allies are restored
*   IF Snow White wakes improperly THEN she might have Ravenna's memories mixed with her own
*   IF Ravenna is killed normally THEN consumed victims die with her
*   IF poison apple is removed THEN identity transfer halts but damage may be permanent
*   IF court witnesses Ravenna's true face THEN political support collapses or increases fear
*   IF consumed heirs are extracted from Ravenna THEN queen's beauty and power diminish
*   IF Prince Charming is genuine ally THEN powerful foreign support is gained
*   IF the Huntsman's network is exposed THEN resistance members are executed
*   IF poison garden is destroyed THEN queen's transformation magic weakens
*   IF Mirror shows full truth publicly THEN civil war or revolution likely results
*   IF another heir is discovered among victims THEN succession becomes complicated
*   IF Ravenna's original face is revealed THEN her mundane appearance undermines mystique
*   IF true love's kiss is attempted THEN identity recovery begins but may be incomplete
