**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Magic Mirror doesn't show who's fairest—it shows who has the strongest claim to the throne, and Queen Ravenna's "beauty" is actually stolen life force from murdered heirs that she wears like a mask. The party, investigating the disappearance of Princess Snow White, discovers the seven "dwarfs" are actually former royal guards protecting the last legitimate heir while the queen uses blood magic to maintain her stolen youth and power. They must navigate a court of lies where everyone wears false faces, mirrors show twisted truths, and the poisoned apple isn't meant to kill but to allow the queen to steal Snow White's very identity and rule unchallenged.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act political thriller wrapped in fairy tale horror.

*   **Act I — The Fairest Court (Sessions 1–4):** The party arrives at court as Queen Ravenna celebrates another year of rule, her beauty miraculous and unaging. They're hired to find Princess Snow White who vanished years ago. Investigation reveals courtiers who question the queen's legitimacy tend to disappear, replaced by loyal servants who look subtly different. The Magic Mirror is actually an imprisoned archfey forced to identify legitimate bloodline heirs. Early clues suggest "dwarfs" are code name for resistance.

*   **Act II — Into the Dark Woods (Sessions 5–8):** Following leads to the forest refuge, they meet the seven former royal guards—called "dwarfs" because they've been magically diminished by the queen's curse. Snow White is alive but poisoned, trapped in glass coffin showing visions of all previous heirs the queen consumed. They learn Ravenna isn't the rightful queen but a sorceress who murdered her way to the throne, literally stealing victims' faces and years. The huntsman who "spared" Snow White was actually the first guard who got her to safety.

*   **Act III — Mirror, Mirror (Sessions 9–12):** The Magic Mirror reveals that Ravenna's beauty is composite—she wears the stolen appearances of dozens of murdered heirs like layers. Snow White is the last legitimate bloodline holder, and consuming her will complete the usurpation permanently. The poisoned apple in Snow White's throat isn't killing her but slowly transferring her identity to Ravenna. Previous "Snow Whites" exist imprisoned within the queen's appearance, aware but helpless. The party must gather evidence of Ravenna's crimes while resisting her attempts to poison, bribe, or replace them.

*   **Act IV — The True Heir (Sessions 13–16):** They infiltrate the palace during Ravenna's coronation ceremony where she plans to complete the identity theft by publicly kissing the "dead" Snow White while magically stealing her face before assembled nobles. The party must expose Ravenna's true nature (risking that she kills all witnesses), break the mirror curse (freeing the archfey but losing evidence), wake Snow White (who may be too damaged to rule), or find another heir in Ravenna's consumed victims. The seven guards must choose between revenge and justice, and the mirror must decide whether to serve truth or survival.

## Central Conflict

Truth versus beauty and the price of both. Ravenna represents vanity corrupted into existential theft—she doesn't just want to be beautiful but to erase all competition by literally consuming their identities. Snow White's "fairness" isn't physical beauty but legitimate claim to throne and genuine character. The Magic Mirror shows how truth can be weapon and prison simultaneously. The party must decide whether exposing evil justifies methods used, if stolen beauty can ever become real, and whether victims imprisoned in Ravenna's appearance can be saved without killing the queen who contains them.
