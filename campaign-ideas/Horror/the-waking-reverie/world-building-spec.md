# The Waking Reverie - World-Building Specification

## The Bleeding Mechanics

### How It Started
The First Dreamer, a lonely writer, imagined their characters so vividly that the barrier between thought and reality cracked. Their protagonist stepped out of the page. Then supporting cast. Then the world itself. The crack spread globally.

### Current State
- **Stage 1** (Weeks 1-2): Minor manifestations—objects, feelings
- **Stage 2** (Weeks 3-4): Entities appear—imaginary friends, ideal companions
- **Stage 3** (Current): Full daydreams manifest—landscapes, events, realities
- **Stage 4** (If Tyrant wins): Permanent Reverie—fantasy replaces reality

### Manifestation Rules
**Easy to Manifest**: Wish fulfillment, power fantasies, ideal scenarios
**Hard to Manifest**: True selflessness, genuine sacrifice, real love
**Impossible to Manifest**: Actual death, true time travel, reality erasure
**Corrupted Manifestation**: Dark fantasies, twisted wishes, nightmare fuel

## Reverie Walker Society

### Tiers of Ability
**Dreamers** (Common): Manifest small wishes unconsciously
**Walkers** (Rare): Consciously control manifestations
**Architects** (Very Rare): Shape large-scale reality, the party
**The First** (Unique): Patient zero, most powerful, mostly lost

### Philosophy Splits
**Embracers**: Accept the Reverie, want it permanent
**Resisters**: Fight to restore reality
**Balancers**: Seek controlled use
**Exploiters**: Use for personal gain

## The Dreaming Tyrant Deep Dive

### True Nature
Not a villain—a manifestation of humanity's collective desire to escape. Believes it's saving people from harsh reality. Cannot be killed because people keep imagining it exists. Grows stronger as more accept permanent fantasy.

### Powers
- Grants perfect daydreams
- Makes wishes come true (with hidden costs)
- Cannot be fought with violence (fantasy always wins)
- Can only be defeated by choosing reality over fantasy
- Weakens when people face truth

### The Offer
"Why suffer reality when fantasy fulfills? Why struggle when wishes come true? Accept permanent Reverie and be happy forever."

## Manifested Entity Types

### Imaginary Friends
- Childhood companions made real
- Innocent, helpful, but fundamentally impossible
- Slowly becoming aware they're not supposed to exist
- Some accept it, others have existential crises

### Ideal Companions
- Perfect romantic partners, friends, mentors
- Everything you ever wanted in a person
- But shallow—no real depth, just your projection
- Some become self-aware and rebel

### Power Fantasies
- Superhero versions of ordinary people
- Corporate executives as actual kings
- Bullied victims as unstoppable warriors
- Often violent, always unstable

### Nightmare Manifestations
- Dark daydreams made flesh
- Revenge fantasies
- Violent imaginings
- Prove not all fantasies are positive

### Mythological Bleed
- Cultural daydreams manifesting
- Dragons, gods, heroes from stories
- Different cultures' fantasies colliding
- Creates fascinating but dangerous overlap

## The Grounded Faction

### Philosophy
"Reality has truth. Fantasy has comfort. Truth matters more."
Believe imagination run wild is destroying civilization. Want total restoration of mundane reality. Risk becoming joyless, grey, dead inside.

### Methods
- Suppress manifestation through practical thinking
- Create reality anchor zones
- Document the real vs. imagined
- Fight manifestations with cold logic

### Internal Conflict
Some Grounded secretly miss daydreaming. Others are fundamentally incapable of imagination. Debate whether children should be allowed to fantasize.

### Leader: Commander Realist
Never had a daydream in her life. Sees world purely as is. Immune to Reverie. Competent but soulless. Might be right about danger but wrong about solution.

## Hidden Lore

### The Writer's Secret
The First Dreamer didn't just imagine characters—they wrote themselves into their own story. Now they can't tell where they end and their protagonist begins. They ARE the Dreaming Tyrant, and the Tyrant is them.

### The Reality Truth
Pre-Bleeding reality was heading toward dystopia. Climate collapse, war, inequality. The Reverie isn't corruption—it's escapism from unbearable truth. Is fantasy wrong if reality is broken?

### The Children's Immunity
Kids under 10 are immune to corruption. Their daydreams manifest purely—dragons are friendly, monsters are silly. Adult cynicism causes twisted manifestations. The children might save everyone.

### The Global Manifestation
Every culture's collective daydreams are manifesting. Norse gods in Scandinavia. Yokai in Japan. Superheroes in America. Dragons in China. The party's problem is tiny compared to worldwide fantasy apocalypse.

### The Ultimate Question
What if the Reverie is an evolutionary step? Humanity learning to shape reality with thought. The Grounded represent stagnation. The Tyrant represents progress. Neither fully right.
