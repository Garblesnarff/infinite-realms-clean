## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Horror Investigation:** Discovering the truth about disappearances, meat pies, and the barber's identity.
*   **Moral Corruption:** The longer revenge continues, the more innocent victims suffer. No clean choices.
*   **Social Navigation:** Victorian class system affects what party can investigate and who will listen.
*   **Sympathetic Monster:** Sweeney Todd is both victim and villain. Justice versus murder.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Sweeney Todd / Benjamin Barker** — *The Demon Barber*
    *   Once a gentle husband, now consumed by vengeance. Brilliant but mad. Murders without remorse until the Judge is dead. Tragic and terrifying.

2.  **Mrs. Lovett** — *The Practical Accomplice*
    *   Runs the pie shop beneath the barber. Pragmatic, darkly humorous, in love with Sweeney though he barely notices. Disposes of bodies creatively.

3.  **Judge Turpin** — *The Corrupt Magistrate*
    *   Vile hypocrite who destroyed Barker's life to claim his wife. Lustful, cruel, protected by position. Genuinely deserves death but murdering him is still murder.

4.  **Johanna** — *The Lost Daughter*
    *   Barker's daughter, now ward of Judge Turpin who intends to marry her. Innocent, imprisoned in gilded cage. Doesn't know her real father.

5.  **Anthony Hope** — *The Idealistic Sailor*
    *   Young sailor in love with Johanna, wants to rescue her properly through law. Represents idealism versus Sweeney's vengeful pragmatism.

6.  **Beadle Bamford** — *The Judge's Enforcer*
    *   Corrupt official who does the Judge's dirty work. Vain, easy to manipulate, dangerous to cross.

## Key Locations

1.  **Fleet Street:** Grimy Victorian neighborhood—factories, gin houses, desperate poverty.
2.  **The Barber Shop:** Sweeney's domain—the chair, the razor, the trap door to horror below.
3.  **Mrs. Lovett's Pie Shop:** Below the barber, ovens always hot, meat pies sell faster than she can bake.
4.  **Judge Turpin's Manor:** Respectable exterior hiding cruelty. Johanna is kept here.
5.  **The Asylum:** Where inconvenient people disappear. Beggar Woman (Sweeney's wife) escaped from here, mad.

## Central Conflict

Revenge versus justice, ends versus means, sympathy for the devil. Sweeney Todd was genuinely wronged—the Judge is genuinely monstrous—but murder is murder, and innocents are dying for meat pies. The party must navigate Victorian corruption where legal justice is impossible but vigilante justice makes them monsters. How much evil can be tolerated in pursuit of righteous revenge?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Razor's Edge**
*   Combat with Sweeney is uniquely dangerous. His razor attacks auto-crit on surprised targets. The barber chair is a trap.

### 2. **Moral Descent Tracker**
*   As party witnesses or enables murders, track corruption. High corruption unlocks dark abilities but leads to bad endings.

### 3. **Victorian Investigation**
*   Social class matters. Lower class party members can't access high society without disguises. Upper class can't investigate slums without suspicion.

### 4. **The Pie Business**
*   Mrs. Lovett's pies have mechanical benefits—they're disturbingly good. Selling them generates income. Eating them unknowingly has consequences.

### 5. **Obsession Clock**
*   Sweeney's revenge obsession advances each session. At certain thresholds, he becomes less discriminating about victims—anyone will do.

### 6. **The Ballad**
*   A street singer appears periodically to narrate events in song—Greek chorus warning the party about the demon barber's tale.
