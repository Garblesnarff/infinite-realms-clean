# Creative Brief: The Demon Barber's Revenge

## Art Style: Gothic Victorian Horror (Industrial Gothic)

Inspired by Sweeney Todd's grimy Victorian aesthetic—soot-stained London, blood and razors, dark comedy amid horror, industrial revolution decay.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Soot-black and rust-red dominate—Victorian London's grimy browns and grays, blood splatter crimson, gaslight yellow-orange glow, pale flesh tones. Mrs. Lovett's shop has warm orange oven light contrasting with cold blue-gray streets. Everything feels dirty and desperate.

**Character Design:** Victorian working class—Sweeney in barber's vest and striped sleeves with wild hair, Mrs. Lovett in practical dress and apron spotted with flour (and worse), Judge Turpin in respectable robes hiding corruption, Johanna in innocent white locked in towers, Anthony in sailor's garb, the Beadle in vain official dress. Poverty shows in patched clothes and gaunt faces.

**Environments:** Fleet Street's cramped shops and smoking factories, the barber shop with its infamous chair and trap door, Mrs. Lovett's basement with ovens and meat grinders, Judge's respectable manor, foggy London streets where bodies disappear, the asylum as Victorian nightmare. Everything is claustrophobic and threatening.

**Action:** The razor glinting in gaslight before the throat-cutting, bodies falling through trap doors, meat grinders turning, the barber chair mechanism springing its trap, chase through foggy streets, dramatic confrontations with blood on hands.

## Voice

A voice of dark theatrical intensity—capable of mad laughter, cold revenge-fueled calm, Victorian propriety masking horror. Cockney accent for working class, refined for the Judge, musical theater dramatics throughout. Can be Sweeney's dead-eyed revenge monologues, Mrs. Lovett's cheerful explanations of terrible things, or the street singer's warning ballads. The voice of Victorian London—grimy, desperate, gallows humor in the face of horror.

## Music Style

Dark orchestral Grand Guignol with industrial percussion—think Sondheim's Sweeney score. Factory whistles and grinding machinery as rhythm. "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd" as ominous warning with male chorus. "A Little Priest" as darkly comic duet about cannibalism with patter song cleverness. "Epiphany" as descent into madness with building intensity. "Johanna" as beautiful but obsessive love song. Pipe organ for Gothic atmosphere. Music that makes you laugh and recoil simultaneously, Victorian music hall meets horror.
