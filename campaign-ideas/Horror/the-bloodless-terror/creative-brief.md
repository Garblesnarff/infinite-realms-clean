# Creative Brief: The Bloodless Terror

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Desert Sci-Fi Horror

Inspired by desert conspiracy fiction and biological horror, blending stark desert landscapes with alien-influenced creature design. This style captures the isolation of badlands, the wrongness of engineered life, and government cover-up aesthetics.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Alien Biology:** The Chupacabra should look wrong—a hybrid of earthly and alien features.
*   **Contrast Natural and Artificial:** Desert beauty hiding unnatural experimentation.
*   **Focus on Clinical Horror:** Government facilities, sterile labs, and the cold reality of bioweapons research.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Desert, drained, alien, conspiracy, livestock horror, nocturnal predator, government cover-up, biological.
*   **Feeling:** Hot, exposed desert by day. Dangerous darkness by night. The sense that someone is always watching.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm desert tones (oranges, yellows, browns) by day. Cool blues and grays by night. The Chupacabra has grayish-green, leathery skin.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a desert color palette of sandy browns and rust oranges under harsh sunlight. The creature's skin is a sickly grayish-green that looks wrong against the natural landscape."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Chupacabra:** A bipedal creature 4-5 feet tall with grayish-green leathery skin, large black eyes (alien-influenced), prominent spines along its back, elongated arms with clawed fingers, powerful hind legs, and a ridge of spines from head to tail. Clearly a hybrid of reptilian and alien genetics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A creature that is clearly not natural. It stands bipedal at about 5 feet tall with grayish-green, leathery skin. Its head is elongated with large, black, almond-shaped eyes. Prominent spines protrude from its back and spine. It has elongated arms ending in clawed hands and powerful digitigrade legs. The overall impression is of alien biology forced into terrestrial form."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Desert badlands, isolated ranches, secret underground facilities disguised as mundane buildings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A secret underground research facility accessed through an innocent-looking weather station. Clinical white corridors with holding cells containing strange specimens. The sterile environment contrasts sharply with the organic horror within."

## Voice

A nervous, hushed voice with a slight southwestern accent, speaking quickly as if afraid of being overheard. The pacing is rapid and urgent. The emotion is fear mixed with determination to expose the truth. Audio quality has slight static, as if recorded on a hidden device. Role: A whistleblower trying to reveal the truth about the project before being silenced.
