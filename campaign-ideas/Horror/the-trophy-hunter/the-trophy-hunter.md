The party, elite soldiers or mercenaries, is sent into the Deep Jungle to rescue a diplomat's expedition that went missing weeks ago. What they find is a nightmare—the entire camp slaughtered by something that hunts for sport.

To survive, they must become the hunters.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Overwhelming Enemy:** The Predator is faster, stronger, and has better technology than the party.
*   **Paranoia and Terror:** The enemy can be anywhere, strike from anywhere, and disappears before retaliation.
*   **Attrition:** The party loses NPCs and resources steadily, creating mounting pressure.
*   **Environmental Hostility:** The jungle itself is dangerous, limiting visibility and mobility.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc that shifts from mystery to horror to desperate final battle.

*   **Act I — Something in the Trees (Sessions 1–2):** The party arrives in the jungle, finds the massacre, and realizes something is hunting them. The first deaths occur. They learn fear.
*   **Act II — Hunter Becomes Hunted (Sessions 3–5):** The party adapts, sets traps, and learns about their enemy. They go from prey to worthy opponents, forcing the Predator to take them seriously.
*   **Act III — If It Bleeds (Sessions 6–8):** The party wounds the Predator and the hunt becomes mutual. The final confrontation forces them to use everything they've learned about jungle survival and their enemy's psychology.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: Elite military party is sent to extract a missing diplomat's expedition from hostile jungle territory.
    *   The Discovery: They find the camp—everyone dead in disturbing ways. Bodies are skinned and hung from trees.

### Session 3 — "The Trap"

    *   Study the Enemy: Investigation reveals the Predator's patterns—it seeks worthy prey, follows a honor code, takes trophies.

**Escalation:** The Predator responds to being wounded not with caution but with respect. The hunt escalates—now they're worth full effort.

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Aftermath
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Victory?: The Predator is defeated. The party has won but at terrible cost.
    *   The Evidence: They must decide what to report. The truth will sound insane. Physical evidence may draw more attention.
    *   The Mark: For those who survived, they're marked—not by the dead Predator but by its species. They're now on the list of worthy prey. This is a victory, not an end.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Invisible Hunter**

*   The Predator can turn invisible, requiring creative methods to detect it.
*   **Mechanics:** Mud camouflage, heat signatures, disturbed environment. Allow Investigation and Perception checks with disadvantage to spot cloaked Predator.

### 2. **Trophy System**

*   The Predator collects trophies from worthy prey. Dead NPCs have items taken.
*   **Mechanics:** Fallen NPCs' special equipment is taken by the Predator. Recovering it requires defeating or wounding the hunter.

### 3. **Honor Code**

*   The Predator follows rules: no killing the unarmed or sick, seeks worthy prey, respects those who wound it.
*   **Mechanics:** Party members who prove worthy through combat gain respect—the Predator won't use certain advantages against them.

### 4. **Jungle Survival**

*   Track heat exhaustion, disease, difficult terrain, dangerous wildlife.
*   **Mechanics:** Survival checks to navigate, find water, avoid hazards. The environment is as dangerous as the Predator.

### 5. **Fear and Morale**

*   Track party morale as NPCs die and pressure mounts.
*   **Mechanics:** Low morale causes NPCs to make poor decisions. High morale from successful defenses grants bonuses.
