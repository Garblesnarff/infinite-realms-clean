# Creative Brief: The Mothman Prophecies

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Appalachian Gothic Horror

Inspired by the dark, foreboding atmosphere of rural American horror, blending naturalistic environments with supernatural dread. This style aims to capture the eerie tension of small-town secrets, the isolation of Appalachian landscapes, and the cosmic horror of an incomprehensible entity watching from the shadows.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Isolation and Decay:** Describe abandoned structures, fog-shrouded forests, and the wear of time on both landscape and people.
*   **Contrast Natural and Unnatural:** Highlight the intrusion of the supernatural into ordinary settings. Normal scenes should feel subtly wrong.
*   **Focus on Atmosphere Over Gore:** Build dread through lighting, shadow, and the suggestion of unseen watchers rather than explicit horror.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Ominous, prophetic, dread, isolated, rural, decaying, watching, inevitable, Appalachian, supernatural.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of being watched. The atmosphere should be oppressive and melancholic, with moments of sudden terror. The world feels ordinary on the surface but deeply wrong underneath.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Semi-realistic with slightly exaggerated shadows and contrast. Lines should be clean for architecture but rough and organic for natural elements and the Mothman.
*   **Forms:** Rural architecture (wooden bridges, small-town storefronts, abandoned mines), natural Appalachian landscapes (forests, rivers, hills), and the stark, angular form of the Mothman.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A semi-realistic digital painting of a rural Appalachian bridge at dusk. The wooden structure shows signs of decay, and long shadows stretch across the empty road. The style emphasizes isolation and subtle wrongness."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated colors dominated by grays, browns, and dark greens. Occasional pops of sickly yellow (streetlights, windows) and the vivid, unnatural red of the Mothman's eyes.
*   **Atmosphere:** Cold and uninviting, with a perpetual overcast feeling even in daylight scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of grays, dark greens, and browns, punctuated by the harsh yellow glow of distant streetlights and the burning red eyes of an unseen watcher in the darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are realistic, working-class people of rural Appalachia. They wear practical clothing (flannel, jeans, work boots) and bear the wear of hard lives.
*   **The Mothman:** Described but rarely fully shown. A massive (7-10 feet tall) humanoid figure with enormous moth-like wings, gray-brown coloration, and most importantly, large, luminous red eyes that seem to burn with impossible light. Its form should be unsettling—too large, too silent, too still.
*   **Expression:** Faces show fear, exhaustion, and quiet desperation. The Mothman has no expression—it simply watches.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A witness standing on a dark road, illuminated by the headlights of their car. They stare in horror at a massive, barely-visible winged silhouette perched on a tree branch above. Two large, glowing red eyes stare back. The Mothman's form is mostly shadow, but its eyes are vivid and terrifying."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Rural Appalachian settings: small-town main streets, wooden bridges over wide rivers, dense forests, abandoned mines, and decommissioned industrial sites. Everything feels slightly rundown and forgotten.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often shrouded in fog, mist, or the dim light of dusk and dawn. Even daylight scenes should feel overcast and cold.
*   **Details:** Rust on metal, peeling paint, overgrown vegetation reclaiming human structures, broken windows, and empty streets.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An abandoned mine entrance in the Appalachian woods. The mouth of the mine is boarded up with rotting wood, and strange symbols are carved into the timbers. Fog creeps along the ground, and the surrounding trees are bare and skeletal. The scene is lit by the cold light of an overcast morning."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast with deep, oppressive shadows. Light sources are sparse and often harsh (streetlights, car headlights, flashlights) creating stark islands of illumination in the darkness.
*   **Shadows:** Long, reaching shadows that suggest unseen figures. The Mothman often appears as a silhouette backlit by moonlight or distant lights.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create unease and suggest hidden threats. Darkness is never safe, and even light feels precarious.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single flickering streetlight that casts long, distorted shadows. The surrounding darkness feels oppressive, and the light creates a small island of visibility in an ocean of black. Red eyes gleam from the shadows just beyond the light's reach."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses low angles to make the Mothman appear larger and more imposing. Frames characters as small and vulnerable against vast, empty landscapes or looming structures.
*   **Techniques:** Use negative space to create a sense of emptiness and isolation. Place the Mothman in the background or at the edge of the frame, watching. Leading lines (roads, rivers, tree lines) draw the eye toward points of dread.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of a lone figure standing on an empty bridge at night. The bridge stretches into darkness on both sides. In the distant background, perched on a distant telephone pole, is the silhouette of the Mothman, its red eyes glowing faintly. The composition emphasizes the figure's isolation and vulnerability."

## Voice

A low, gravelly male voice with a rural Appalachian accent, speaking in hushed, cautious tones as if sharing forbidden knowledge. The pacing is slow and deliberate, with long pauses that create unease. The emotion is one of quiet dread and resignation—someone who has seen the Mothman and knows what it means. Audio quality is slightly lo-fi, as if recorded on an old tape deck, with subtle static and the distant sound of wind. Role: A witness to the impossible, a survivor warning others of the doom to come.
