## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A horror investigation into prophecy, disaster, and cosmic entities beyond mortal comprehension.

*   **Act I — The Red-Eyed Watchers (Sessions 1–5):** The players arrive in Point Pleasant to investigate reports of strange winged creatures. They encounter witnesses, experience their own sightings, and discover a pattern: the Mothman appears before disasters. A bridge collapse kills dozens, and the players barely survive. The Mothman's prophecies are real.
*   **Act II — Decoding the Doom (Sessions 6–11):** The party investigates the origin of the Mothman, discovering connections to an ancient Native American curse, a failed mining expedition that breached something ancient, and a series of prophetic visions experienced by townsfolk. They must gather clues from dreams, ancient texts, and dangerous encounters with the Mothman's lesser manifestations.
*   **Act III — The Final Disaster (Sessions 12–15+):** The players decode the final prophecy: a cataclysmic earthquake and flood will destroy the entire valley unless they can stop the ritual that summoned the Mothman. They must venture into the depths beneath the town, confront the cultists who worship the entity, and face the Mothman itself in a desperate battle to prevent apocalypse.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Red Eyes in the Dark"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in Point Pleasant, hired to investigate "strange creature sightings" terrorizing the locals.
    *   They interview witnesses who describe a massive, winged humanoid with glowing red eyes.
    *   That night, during their own investigation, they encounter the Mothman for the first time—a brief, terrifying sighting that leaves them shaken.
**Escalation:** The sightings are increasing in frequency. Townsfolk are having nightmares of impending disaster.

### Sessions 2-4 — "The Silver Bridge"
*   **Focus:** Horror / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players discover a pattern: every Mothman sighting is followed by a tragedy within 48 hours.
    *   They race to warn the town council, but are dismissed as fear-mongers.
    *   The Silver Bridge, the town's main crossing, collapses during rush hour, killing dozens. The players witness or barely escape the disaster.
    *   In the rubble, they find strange symbols carved into the bridge supports—symbols that predate the bridge's construction.
**Escalation:** The Mothman is seen hovering over the town center. Panic spreads. The players realize something far worse is coming.

### Sessions 5-7 — "Visions and Voices"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Occult
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party investigates the symbols, tracing them to Native American lore about a "Sky Demon" that punishes those who dig too deep.
    *   They discover a sealed mine on the outskirts of town. The mine was abandoned 30 years ago after "strange occurrences."
    *   Inside, they find evidence of a breach into an ancient underground chamber and journals describing "voices in the dark" and "eyes that see the future."
**Escalation:** Several townsfolk, including one of the players, begin having prophetic nightmares of fire, water, and death.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Mothman** — *The Harbinger*
    *   **Role:** A cosmic entity that exists outside normal time, appearing before disasters to "witness" death and suffering.
    *   **Personality:** Alien, incomprehensible, and terrifying. It does not speak, but its presence induces overwhelming dread. It is not inherently malicious—it simply is.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Mothman is bound to the region by an ancient ritual. It cannot leave, and its appearances are desperate attempts to warn of the disasters it foresees but cannot prevent.

2.  **Indrid Cold** — *The Smiling Man*
    *   **Role:** A mysterious, unnaturally pale humanoid who appears to witnesses claiming to be a "friend." He speaks in riddles and offers cryptic warnings.
    *   **Personality:** Unsettlingly calm, with a fixed smile that never reaches his eyes. He speaks in a monotone, emotionless voice.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Indrid Cold is a psychic projection of the Mothman, a fragment of its consciousness attempting to communicate with humanity. He is trying to warn them, but his alien nature makes his messages incomprehensible.

3.  **Pastor Ezekiel Thorne** — *The Faithful*
    *   **Role:** A local preacher who believes the Mothman is an angel of judgment sent to punish the wicked.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic, fervent, and increasingly unstable. He sees the disasters as divine will.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Thorne is secretly descended from the miners who first breached the ancient chamber. His family has been cursed with prophetic visions for generations, driving them to madness.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of prophecy, inevitability, and humanity's relationship with the unknown. The central conflict is the players' race against time to prevent a prophesied disaster while grappling with the question: can fate be changed, or are they merely witnesses to an unavoidable doom? The Mothman is not a villain to be defeated—it is a symptom of a deeper cosmic wound that must be healed.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Prophecy Points**
*   Throughout the campaign, players accumulate **Prophecy Points** through visions, dreams, and encounters with the Mothman.
*   These points can be spent to gain cryptic clues about future events, gain advantage on saving throws against disasters, or temporarily see through the Mothman's eyes.
*   However, accumulating too many Prophecy Points risks **Prophetic Madness**, where the character begins to lose touch with the present, becoming obsessed with visions of the future.

### 2. **The Disaster Clock**
*   The DM tracks a hidden **Disaster Clock** that advances based on the party's actions (or inactions).
*   Every major event (a Mothman sighting, a failed investigation, a prophecy fulfilled) advances the clock.
*   When the clock reaches midnight, the final cataclysm begins. The players must work to slow or stop the clock through investigation, ritual magic, or preventing smaller disasters.

### 3. **Red-Eye Encounters**
*   Whenever the players encounter the Mothman or its manifestations, they must make a **Wisdom saving throw** or be affected by **Overwhelming Dread**.
*   Dread causes fear, disadvantage on attacks, and may force the character to flee. However, characters who embrace the dread and fail the save by 5 or more receive a prophetic vision instead.
