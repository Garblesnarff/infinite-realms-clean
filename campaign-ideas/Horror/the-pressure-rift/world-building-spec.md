# The Pressure Rift - World Building Specification

## The Rift: Complete Analysis

### Physical Properties
- Location: Challenger Deep, 35,876 feet depth
- Appearance: Spherical distortion, 500 feet diameter
- Effect: Reality within sphere operates on hybrid physical laws
- Energy Output: Massive planar energy leaking into Material
- Stability: Degrading 1% per week, critical threshold at 50%
- Current Status: 65% stable when campaign begins

### Formation History
**12,000 years ago**: Ancient Aboleth civilization attempts planar breach
**Purpose**: Harvest pure elemental water for magical experiments
**Consequence**: Accidentally trap extra-planar entity between planes
**Entity's Prison**: Becomes anchor keeping rift partially sealed
**Slow Degradation**: Entity's escape attempts weaken prison over millennia
**Modern Day**: Rift becomes detectable, begins affecting Material Plane

### Reality Distortion Zones

**Zone 1: The Approach** (10 miles from rift)
- Water slightly denser than normal
- Bioluminescent creatures acting strangely
- Compasses malfunction
- Minor: Occasional déjà vu, time feels wrong

**Zone 2: The Boundary** (1 mile from rift)
- Physics becoming unreliable
- Gravity occasionally shifts
- Water pressure inconsistent
- Temperature swings extreme
- Creatures evolving rapidly (becoming Riftborn)

**Zone 3: The Impossibility** (500 feet from rift)
- Multiple planes visible simultaneously
- Up and down meaningless
- Water breathable then solid then gaseous
- Spatial dimensions non-euclidean
- Sanity checks every hour

**Zone 4: The In-Between** (inside rift)
- Exist in both Material and Plane of Water
- Linear time doesn't apply
- Cause and effect optional
- Entity's presence overwhelming
- Cannot survive without planar adaptation

## The Plane of Water (As Seen Through Rift)

### Description
- Infinite ocean of pure elemental water
- No solid ground, eternal depths
- Crystalline structures float impossibly
- Water elementals are dominant life
- Time moves differently (slower than Material)

### Politics
**The Marid Sultanates**: Noble genies ruling water elemental kingdoms
**The Elemental Courts**: Pure water elementals, ancient and powerful
**The Coral Cities**: Communities of planar travelers and natives
**The Aboleth Depths**: Dark regions where aberrations lurk

### Stance on Rift
**Concerned**: Rift damaging their reality too
**Divided**: Some want it sealed, others see opportunity
**Aqualis's Faction**: Wants closure, fears Material contamination
**Expansionists**: Want to use rift to access Material Plane's resources
**Isolationists**: Demand complete separation

## The Prisoned One: The Entity

### Nature
- Exists in dimension between planes
- Not native to Material or Elemental
- Possibly from Far Realm or unknown outer plane
- Incomprehensible to mortals (Lovecraftian)
- Not evil, but alien to point of danger

### Perception
- Cannot be fully seen (mind cannot process)
- Appears different to each observer
- Communicates through emotion and impression
- Telepathic but non-verbal
- Presence causes reality distortion

### Imprisonment
- Trapped 12,000 years ago
- Prison is space between planes
- Neither Material nor Elemental can hold it alone
- Escape attempts weaken both planes
- Doesn't hate captors—cannot understand concept of hate

### What It Wants
- Freedom (doesn't understand it endangers reality)
- Return to origin plane (unknown which)
- End to suffering (imprisoned for eternity from its perspective)
- Cannot be negotiated with in traditional sense

### If Freed Improperly
- Reality around it warps permanently
- Both planes could collapse into fusion
- Entity doesn't intend harm, just exists wrong for this reality
- Must be freed correctly or not at all

## The Riftborn: New Life Form

### Origin
- Creatures exposed to rift energy for generations
- Evolved to exist in both planes simultaneously
- Include: Mutated fish, adapted crabs, hybrid elementals
- Population: ~10,000 individuals in Rift Zone

### Biology
- Phase between Material and Planar existence
- Breathe water or survive without water
- Immune to pressure
- See in all dimensions
- Telepathically linked to each other

### Society
- Developing culture unique to hybrid existence
- No concept of "solid" or "land"
- Communicate through dimensional harmonics
- Consider rift their home, both planes "parent realms"

### Moral Complexity
- Innocent beings born into situation
- Will die if rift sealed (cannot exist in pure plane)
- Some see them as abominations
- Others as next evolutionary step
- Party must decide their worth

### Named Riftborn
**Cascade**: Young Riftborn, curious about Material world, befriends party
**The Harmonics Choir**: Collective consciousness of elder Riftborn, offers wisdom
**Pressure-Born-to-Light**: Radical wanting rift to expand, sees future in hybrid existence

## Scientific Expedition Team

**Dr. Mira Voidwalker** (Team Lead)
- Specialty: Planar mechanics
- Background: Lost family to planar accident, driven to understand
- Secret: Contaminated early, becoming Riftborn, hiding transformation
- Arc: Must choose between humanity and evolution

**Captain Jonas Deepdive** (Pilot)
- Specialty: Extreme depth navigation
- Background: Deep sea rescue specialist, pragmatic survivor
- Grounding: Keeps party focused on practical solutions
- Comic Relief: Dry humor in face of impossible situations

**Professor Hadal** (Consultant, Antagonistic)
- Specialty: Ancient aboleth history, rift's origin
- Background: Aboleth scholar, obsessed with his ancestors' work
- Goal: Reactivate ancient aboleth experiments, use rift
- Conflict: Will sabotage party if they try to seal rift

**Engineering Team** (Supporting NPCs)
- Maintain submersible
- Create specialized equipment
- Casualties to demonstrate danger
- Personal stories to build emotional investment

## Solutions to the Rift Crisis

### Option 1: Complete Sealing
**Method**: Use ancient aboleth ritual in reverse, close rift permanently
**Requirements**: Entity remains imprisoned, Riftborn die, planar breach sealed
**Pros**: Both planes safe, no ongoing maintenance needed
**Cons**: Genocide of Riftborn, Entity suffers eternally, morally questionable
**Difficulty**: Medium (ritual is known)

### Option 2: Stable Maintenance
**Method**: Balance planar energies, keep rift at safe level
**Requirements**: Permanent guardian (party member or NPC), ongoing monitoring
**Pros**: Riftborn survive, Entity's suffering not increased, planes safe
**Cons**: Requires eternal sacrifice, could fail if guardian dies
**Difficulty**: High (requires constant vigilance)

### Option 3: Controlled Merger
**Method**: Create hybrid ecosystem, small fusion of planes
**Requirements**: Careful ritual, cooperation from both planes, precise execution
**Pros**: Riftborn thrive, new evolutionary possibilities, innovation
**Cons**: Risky, permanent change to both planes, unknown consequences
**Difficulty**: Very High (unprecedented, could fail catastrophically)

### Option 4: True Freedom
**Method**: Properly release Entity by opening path to its home plane
**Requirements**: Identify Entity's origin, create portal, trust Entity
**Pros**: Entity grateful, may repair rift as thanks, all survive
**Cons**: Requires faith, Entity's home plane unknown, might not work
**Difficulty**: Extreme (Entity cannot communicate clearly, home plane mystery)

## Pressure Zones Detailed

### The Safe Descent (0-10,000 ft)
- Standard deep diving
- Magical or technological pressure suits
- Darkness increases
- Bioluminescent life common

### The Twilight Descent (10,000-20,000 ft)
- Permanent night
- Extreme pressure, enhanced protection needed
- Life becomes sparse and strange
- First reality anomalies (minor)

### The Abyssal Descent (20,000-35,000 ft)
- Crushing pressure, requires best equipment
- Almost no natural life (except near vents)
- Reality anomalies frequent
- Time begins feeling wrong

### The Challenger Deep (35,000-36,000 ft)
- Deepest natural point
- Few beings ever reach here
- Rift's influence begins
- Reality becomes questionable

### The Rift Zone (Unnatural)
- Beyond normal depth metrics
- Exists partially in Plane of Water
- Depth readings nonsensical
- Pressure variable (can be zero or infinite)

## Campaign Endings

### Ending 1: "The Seal Holds" (Pragmatic)
- Rift sealed, both planes safe
- Riftborn die (party witnesses extinction)
- Entity imprisoned forever
- Party hailed as heroes but haunted
- Dr. Voidwalker dies or reverts (depends on contamination)

### Ending 2: "The Eternal Guardian" (Sacrificial)
- One party member stays to maintain balance
- Riftborn survive and thrive
- Becomes immortal guardian
- Rest of party visits occasionally
- Bittersweet—success with personal cost

### Ending 3: "The New World" (Innovative)
- Controlled merger creates hybrid zone
- Riftborn become bridge between planes
- Trading post between realities
- Unknown consequences emerging
- Hopeful but uncertain future

### Ending 4: "The Homecoming" (Faith)
- Entity's home plane discovered (GM creativity)
- Portal opened, Entity freed properly
- Grateful Entity stabilizes rift before leaving
- All survive, reality healed
- Perfect ending if party solves mystery

### Ending 5: "The Catastrophe" (Failure)
- Rift expands uncontrolled
- Planes begin merging chaotically
- Reality collapsing
- Party escapes (maybe) as zone consumes deep ocean
- Apocalyptic ending

## Extended Lore: The Ancient Aboleth Ritual

### Purpose
- Harvest pure elemental water for magical experiments
- Increase aboleth magical power
- Create servants from elemental plane

### Execution
- Twelve ancient aboleths performed ritual
- Pierced planar boundary at deepest point
- Successfully opened rift to Plane of Water

### The Accident
- Entity was between planes when rift opened
- Caught in breach, trapped
- Aboleths tried to use Entity as power source
- Entity's thrashing destabilized ritual
- All twelve aboleths died
- Rift partially sealed by Entity's prison
- Has been slowly degrading ever since

### Ritual Components (Party Can Find)
- Eleven aboleth skeletons around rift perimeter
- Twelfth at center (ritual leader)
- Ancient foci (magical items)
- Ritual inscriptions (can be reversed for sealing)
- Warning signs (ignored by ancient aboleths)

This campaign challenges players with impossible choices, cosmic scale problems, and the question: What is one life form worth versus another?
