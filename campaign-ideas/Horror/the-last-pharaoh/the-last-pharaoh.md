# The Last Pharaoh
*In the shadow of Rome, preserve Egypt's three-thousand-year legacy through wit, charm, and ruthless political calculation*

## Campaign Overview

Kleopatra VII Philopator—brilliant, multilingual, politically astute—is the last active Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, ruling during Egypt's final gasp of independence before Roman absorption. Not the seductress of legend but a calculating political mind, she uses every tool available—diplomacy, economics, religious authority, strategic alliances, and yes, romance—to preserve her kingdom against overwhelming Roman power. This campaign explores political intrigue, cultural preservation, impossible choices between love and duty, and the tragic inevitability of Egypt's fall to empire.

The party serves as Cleopatra's trusted council—advisors, spies, generals, diplomats, and fixers who navigate the treacherous waters of Mediterranean politics. Together, they'll manage civil war against siblings, seduce Julius Caesar and Marcus Antonius for political advantage, face the cold calculation of Octavianus, preserve ancient knowledge, and ultimately witness the end of the pharaonic age. Every decision balances survival versus honor, pragmatism versus principle, Egypt's future versus Egypt's soul.

This is campaign of political survival horror—where players wield words, gold, and intelligence rather than just swords, where failure means cultural extinction, and where even victory might be measured in how gracefully Egypt exits the stage of history.
