# The Last Pharaoh - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Hellenistic Opulence Meets Roman Pragmatism**: Rich colors, gold, marble, political intrigue visualized. Inspired by: Hollywood epics (*Cleopatra* 1963), Elizabeth Taylor's iconic look, Greco-Roman art, Egyptian temples.

## Visual Design

**Cleopatra**: Not classically beautiful but magnetic. Greek-Macedonian features with Egyptian royal regalia. Evolution: Teen queen → Caesar's partner → Antony's co-ruler → Regal death. Iconic: Gold headdress, kohl-lined eyes, royal purple, asp bracelet.

**Settings**: Alexandria's marble palaces, Library scrolls, Egyptian temples, Roman forums, naval battles, opulent barges, stark tombs.

## Color Palettes
- **Egyptian Royal**: Gold, lapis blue, white linen, black kohl
- **Alexandria**: Marble white, Mediterranean blue, scroll bronze
- **Rome**: Imperial purple, senate grey, blood red
- **Tragedy**: Fading gold, dying purple, asp green, final white

## Music
**Synthesis score**: Egyptian instruments (sistrum, oud) + Greco-Roman (lyre, aulos) + modern orchestral grandeur.

**Cleopatra's Theme**: Exotic, seductive, melancholic. Evolution: Youthful hope → Political confidence → Tragic resignation.

## Voice Direction

**Cleopatra**: Educated alto, British accent (aristocratic), multilingual. Intelligent, measured, capable of warmth and ice.

**Caesar**: Authoritative, aged but vigorous, paternal towards Cleopatra.

**Antony**: Boisterous, passionate, soldier's directness, increasingly desperate.

**Octavian**: Cold, youthful, calculating, no warmth. Future emperor's absolute control.
