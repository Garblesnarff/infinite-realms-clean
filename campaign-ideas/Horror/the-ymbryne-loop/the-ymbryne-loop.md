**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** peculiar abilities, time loops, gothic horror, hollowgast monsters, vintage photography, found family, refugee children
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party discovers they're Peculiars—people with supernatural abilities hunted by normal society and monstrous Hollowgasts (invisible creatures that devour Peculiar eyes). They find refuge in a time loop maintained by Miss Peregrine, an Ymbryne (bird-shifting woman who creates temporal sanctuaries), living the same day (September 3, 1940) repeatedly to hide from danger. When Hollowgasts breach the loop and kidnap Ymbrynes, the party must leave their safe haven, navigate dangerous loops across history, and stop the wights (Peculiars who consumed other Peculiars, becoming monsters) from using captured Ymbrynes to create an army of Hollowgasts. The campaign explores belonging, the cost of safety, and whether hiding from the world is survival or cowardice.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Peculiar Abilities**
*   Each player has a unique supernatural power (examples: invisibility, super strength, plant control, prophetic dreams, fire manipulation, reanimating dead, bee control, etc.).
*   **Mechanics:** Powers are unique to each character, balanced with drawbacks.

### 2. **Time Loops**
*   Ymbrynes create loops—repeating single days that allow Peculiars to live safely frozen in time.
*   **Mechanics:** Entering/exiting loops requires Ymbryne assistance. Staying too long outside your birth era causes rapid aging.

### 3. **Hollowgasts**
*   Invisible monsters (only certain Peculiars can see them) with tentacle tongues, hunt Peculiars to eat their eyes.
*   **Mechanics:** Most party members cannot see them initially. Must rely on Jacob or sensory cues (smell, sound, displaced objects).

### 4. **Wights**
*   Peculiars who consumed other Peculiars' souls, became powerful but lost their peculiarity, gained white eyes (no pupils).
*   **Mechanics:** Wights disguise themselves as humans, infiltrate loops, serve Barron's conspiracy.

### 5. **Vintage Photographs**
*   Old photographs reveal truth about Peculiars and loops.
*   **Mechanics:** Finding photographs provides clues, reveals hidden Peculiars, exposes wights.

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Loops Liberated:** The party rescues captive Ymbrynes, preserves the loop system, and defeats the wights.
*   **Living in the Present:** The party abandons loops, chooses to live in the modern world despite risks.
*   **New Sanctuary:** The party creates a new, mobile loop system that doesn't require eternal repetition.
*   **Tragic Loss:** Some Peculiars are consumed by Hollowgasts, but the party prevents total catastrophe.
