### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Ymbryne Loop**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players are Peculiars with supernatural abilities, living in a time loop (September 3, 1940) to hide from Hollowgasts. When the loop is breached and Ymbrynes kidnapped, they must navigate historical loops, fight invisible monsters, and stop wights from creating a Hollowgast army.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Peculiars are humans with supernatural abilities, often persecuted by normals (mundanes).
*   Ymbrynes are Peculiars who can manipulate time and shapeshift into birds, create loops (repeating single days).
*   Hollowgasts are failed experiments—Peculiars who tried to become immortal, became invisible soul-eating monsters.
*   Wights are Peculiars who consumed others' souls, gained power but lost peculiarity, serve wight conspiracy.
*   Time loops allow Peculiars to hide from aging and danger, but trap them in repetition.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** loop is breached by Hollowgasts → **THEN** Peculiars must flee or fight, loop may collapse.
*   **IF** Miss Peregrine is captured → **THEN** party must rescue her or loop collapses permanently.
*   **IF** party learns to see Hollowgasts → **THEN** they can fight back instead of fleeing blindly.
*   **IF** Ymbrynes are used in experiments → **THEN** wights create controllable Hollowgast army.
*   **IF** party destroys wight conspiracy → **THEN** loops are preserved but Peculiars remain hunted.
*   **IF** party chooses to leave loops → **THEN** they age normally and must hide in modern world.
