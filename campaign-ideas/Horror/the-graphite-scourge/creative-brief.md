# Creative Brief: The Graphite Scourge

## Art Style: Soviet Brutalist Horror (Chernobyl meets Body Horror)

Inspired by Soviet brutalist architecture, industrial decay, and radiation horror. Colors are desaturated—grays, dull greens, radioactive blues. Character designs show progression from healthy to dying—skin lesions, hair loss, visible decay. Lighting emphasizes harsh fluorescents, blue Cherenkov radiation glow, and oppressive shadows. Environments are concrete bunkers, industrial facilities, and sterile hospitals. Style emphasizes invisible death, bureaucratic coldness, and sacrificial heroism.

### Core Principles:

*   **Brutalist Architecture:** Concrete, functionalism, oppressive scale.
*   **Radiation Horror:** Blue glow, invisible death, body decay.
*   **Heroic Sacrifice:** Ordinary people doing impossible things.

## Voice

A voice with Russian or Eastern European accent—calm, measured, matter-of-fact when describing horror. The cadence is documentary-style—technical, precise, unemotional even when discussing death. References roentgens, exposure limits, and sacrifice with clinical detachment. Audio has slight static, like recorded on old Soviet equipment. Role: A scientist explaining radiation effects, an official denying reality, or a dying hero accepting their fate.
