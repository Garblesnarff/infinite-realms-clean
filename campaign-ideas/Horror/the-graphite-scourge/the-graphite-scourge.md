# The Graphite Scourge

*A Disaster Horror / Sacrifice campaign — Short Campaign (8–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Graphite Scourge
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Historical Horror / Disaster Management / Sacrifice / Body Horror
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 8–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **8–10**
**Tone (keywords):** radiation horror, bureaucratic coverup, sacrifice for the greater good, invisible death, "not great, not terrible"
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of firefighters, engineers, miners, and scientists responding to the magical reactor explosion at the Tower of Radiance—a mystical power facility that tapped into planar energy. What they're told is a small fire is actually a catastrophic breach spewing deadly, invisible radiation across the realm. They must contain the disaster while the government lies, covers up, and sacrifices them as "acceptable losses." Every hour of exposure kills slowly, and heroism means choosing to die saving thousands.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is rare. The real enemy is invisible radiation, bureaucratic obstruction, and time.
*   **Investigation:** Uncovering truth while authorities lie, understanding radiation effects, making impossible decisions.
*   **Consequences:** Radiation exposure is cumulative and permanent. Heroes will die slowly and painfully. The question is how much they save first.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–12 sessions)

A three-act arc about sacrifice and truth.

*   **Act I — The Explosion (Sessions 1–3):** The Tower explodes. Firefighters respond, not knowing they're being irradiated. The government claims it's minor. The party discovers the horrifying truth—the core is exposed.
*   **Act II — Containment (Sessions 4–7):** The party must prevent total meltdown—clearing radioactive debris, pumping water, preventing chain reactions. They know they're dying but continue anyway.
*   **Act III — The Sarcophagus (Sessions 8–12):** The party leads efforts to entomb the reactor in magical barriers and stone, preventing centuries of contamination. Many die. Survivors are silenced by the state. Truth emerges slowly.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "1:23:45"
*   The Tower of Radiance explodes during a safety test. Magical energy erupts into the sky.
*   Firefighters (the party) respond, seeing blue light—deadly but beautiful.
*   They're told it's a small fire. They go onto the roof and touch radioactive graphite cores with bare hands.
**Escalation:** Within hours, they're vomiting and dizzy. Something is very wrong.

### Session 2 — "The Lie"
*   Officials arrive, claiming everything is under control. Radiation levels are "3.6 roentgens—not great, not terrible."
*   The party's measuring device only goes to 3.6. Actual levels are 15,000+.
*   Civilians evacuate nearby town 36 hours too late. Children play in radioactive ash.
**Escalation:** The party realizes the government is lying. The disaster is catastrophic.

### Session 3 — "The Truth"
*   A scientist arrives and tells the truth: if the exposed core isn't cooled, it will melt through to underground water reserves.
*   The resulting explosion would render half the realm uninhabitable for thousands of years.
*   The party must volunteer for suicide missions—someone has to do it.
**Escalation:** The first responders from Session 1 begin dying in agony. Skin sloughs off. Organs fail.

### Session 4 — "The Divers"
*   The reactor basement is flooded. Valves must be opened manually to drain water—preventing steam explosion.
*   Three party members volunteer to dive in radioactive water in total darkness.
*   They succeed, knowing they've just killed themselves slowly.
**Escalation:** Those who dove have days or weeks to live. Radiation sickness begins.

### Session 5 — "The Roof"
*   Radioactive graphite litters the roof. It must be thrown back into the core or it'll contaminate the water supply.
*   Automated golems fail instantly—magic is disrupted. Humans must do it.
*   The party has 90 seconds per trip before lethal exposure. They make dozens of trips.
**Escalation:** Heroes collapse from radiation exposure. Younger members beg to take the load.

### Session 6 — "The Miners"
*   The core is melting downward. Miners must dig underneath and freeze the ground—preventing groundwater contamination.
*   The party leads miners digging in extreme heat, radiation, and darkness.
*   They complete the task. Most will die within the year.
**Escalation:** The government begins planning a massive sarcophagus to entomb the reactor.

### Session 7 — "The Sarcophagus Plan"
*   Mages and engineers design a massive magical-stone barrier to entomb the reactor for 10,000 years.
*   The party must coordinate hundreds of workers, all being lethally irradiated.
*   They rotate workers every few minutes to spread exposure—sacrificing many to save more.
**Escalation:** The government prepares to silence anyone who knows the truth. The party is marked for "retirement."

### Session 8 — "The Trial"
*   Officials are put on trial (show trial). The party testifies about the coverup.
*   The government blames low-level workers to avoid admitting systemic failure.
*   The party realizes the truth will be buried with them.
**Escalation:** Survivors are given medals and threatened into silence.

### Sessions 9–10 — "The Entombment"
*   Construction of the sarcophagus begins. The party oversees dangerous work.
*   Workers race against time, knowing every second shortens their lives.
*   The sarcophagus is completed. The reactor is sealed.
**Escalation:** The party's radiation sickness is terminal. They have months at best.

### Sessions 11–12 — "Aftermath"
*   The party is celebrated as heroes while being silenced about the truth.
*   They die slowly—some in hospitals, some at home, some by suicide to avoid suffering.
*   Years later, the truth emerges. They're recognized as martyrs who saved the realm.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Deputy Director Dyatlov** — *The Denier*
    *   Oversaw the deadly test, refuses to admit error, insists reactor can't explode.

2.  **Valery Legasov** — *The Truth-Teller*
    *   Scientist who investigates honestly, fights bureaucracy, ultimately silenced.

3.  **Boris Shcherbina** — *The Pragmatist*
    *   Government official who initially covers up, then realizes scope and helps.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Tower of Radiance:** Magical reactor facility, now exposed core spewing radiation.
2.  **The Control Room:** Where the disaster began, still radioactive, bodies remain.
3.  **The Roof:** Covered in graphite chunks—90-second lethal exposure.
4.  **The Flooded Basement:** Radioactive water, pitch black, valves that must be opened.
5.  **Hospital 6:** Where first responders die slowly and painfully from radiation.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **truth versus coverup**. The government prioritizes image over lives, lying about the disaster's scope. The party must choose: obey orders and die quietly, or speak truth and be silenced. It explores heroism when no one will thank you, sacrifice when the state sees you as expendable, and whether truth matters if it costs everything.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Radiation Exposure Tracker**
*   Every scene in contaminated areas adds exposure points.
*   **Thresholds:** 100 points = sick, 500 = dying, 1000 = immediate death.

### 2. **Dosimeter Readings**
*   Players receive radiation readings (roentgens/hour). They can calculate their exposure.
*   **The 3.6 Lie:** Official equipment caps at 3.6, hiding true danger.

### 3. **Bureaucratic Obstacles**
*   Every decision requires permission from officials who deny, delay, and obstruct.
*   **Persuasion/Intimidation:** Critical skills to bypass bureaucracy.

### 4. **Sacrifice Mechanics**
*   Players can volunteer for lethal missions to save others.
*   **Heroic Death:** Dying while saving many grants mechanical benefits to survivors.

### 5. **Slow Death**
*   Radiation sickness has stages: nausea, hair loss, skin sloughing, organ failure, death.
*   **Role-play:** Players experience their characters' slow, painful decline.
