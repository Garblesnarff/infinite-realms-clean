### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Web of Infinite Champions**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players discover they are "Webbound"—heroes connected across infinite realities by mystical threads of fate. A family of interdimensional predators called the Inheritors hunts Webbound heroes, consuming their essence to sustain their immortality. When the players witness the brutal murder of an alternate version of themselves, they are pulled into a desperate alliance of champions from countless realities. Together, they must evade the Inheritors, discover why they are Webbound, and find the Source Crystal—the nexus of all destiny threads—before the Inheritors consume every hero across infinite worlds.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail what the Webbound are: why certain individuals are connected across realities.
    *   Write the history of the Inheritors: who they are, how they became immortal predators, and why they hunt the Webbound.
    *   Describe the Web of Worlds: the structure of the multiverse and how realities connect.
    *   Explain the Source Crystal and its location in the Web Nexus.
    *   Detail the prophecy of the Webbound: destined to save or doom the multiverse.
    *   Write about previous Great Hunts and Webbound who resisted the Inheritors.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.

        *   **Goals:** Survive the hunt, unite alternate selves, find the Source Crystal, end the Inheritors.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose coalition led by the Guide, with heroes from countless realities.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect each other and discover the truth of their connection.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some members seek to use the Source Crystal for personal power.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to web-jump, knowledge from infinite realities, diverse powers and skills, the Hub as sanctuary.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with all Webbound; hunted by Inheritors; seeking the Prime Weaver.
    *   **The Inheritor Family** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Hunt and consume all Webbound to sustain their immortality and kill the multiverse consciousness.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Morlun, with his siblings each commanding hunting parties.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they simply hunt without explanation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know the Webbound are the multiverse's immune system and seek to destroy it.
        *   **Assets:** Immortality, ability to track Webbound, vast experience, their home dimension fortress.
        *   **Relationships:** Predators of all Webbound; fear the Prime Weaver; served by reality-hopping hounds.
    *   **The Reality Watchers** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Observe and record multiversal events without interfering.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Ancient scholars led by the Chronicler.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To maintain records of all realities and preserve multiversal history.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know the truth about the Webbound and Inheritors but fear what sharing it might cause.
        *   **Assets:** The Hub (which they maintain), multiversal archives, observation technology.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral toward most; provide limited aid to Webbound; avoid Inheritors.
    *   **The Lost Ones** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Webbound who have abandoned the fight and hide in remote realities.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No organization—scattered individuals or small groups.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To survive by staying hidden and uninvolved.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many secretly hope someone else will defeat the Inheritors.
        *   **Assets:** Knowledge of safe hiding places, survival skills.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrustful of everyone; some become allies if convinced; some have been broken by fear.
