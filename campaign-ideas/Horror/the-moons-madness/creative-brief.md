# The Moon's Madness - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
- Moonlit everything, silver and shadow, uncertain edges, dreamlike
- The Moon: Giant face watching, empty eyes, reflecting rather than illuminating
- Labyrinth: Escher-like paths, shifting architecture, perspective tricks
- Nightmares: Personal to each character, beautifully horrific
- Wolves: Spectral, truth-speaking, eyes that see through lies
- Crayfish: Rising from depths, armored trauma, primordial

## Music and Sound
- Uncertain, unsettling, beautiful but wrong
- Howling wolves as rhythm
- Whispered fears as melody
- Sanity loss: Music decoheres
- Madness wisdom: Suddenly clear tones emerge from chaos
- The Moon's voice: Echo of your own thoughts

## Voice Acting
- **Lunar Physician**: Shifts mid-sentence between lucidity and madness, "Is this real? Are you? Am I helping or... yes, helping."
- **The Wolves**: Harmonized howling that forms words, truth-speaking, haunting
- **Shadow Self**: Your own voice but darker, honest, everything you deny
- **The Moon**: Your thoughts reflected back, disturbing familiarity
