### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Last Elemental**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The Avatar, master of all four elements and bridge between human and spirit worlds, has been missing for a hundred years. In that time, the Fire Nation began a war of conquest, genociding the Air Nomads. Aang, the last Airbender and the Avatar, awakens to find his people dead and the world at war. With his companions, he must master all four elements, end the war, and restore balance—all while grappling with his pacifist beliefs in a world demanding he become a warrior.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Avatar Cycle—how the Avatar reincarnates through each nation in order (Air, Water, Earth, Fire), serving as the bridge between humans and spirits.
    *   Explain the genocide of the Air Nomads—how Fire Lord Sozin betrayed Avatar Roku and attacked the Air Temples first to kill the next Avatar.
    *   Describe the four elements and their philosophies: Air (freedom), Water (change), Earth (stability), Fire (passion/life).
    *   Write the history of Sozin's Comet and how it will return, granting firebenders unstoppable power unless the Avatar stops Fire Lord Ozai.
    *   Detail the Spirit World and its connection to balance—how human actions affect spirits and vice versa.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Aang masters a new element (Water, Earth, Fire).
    *   **THEN:** He grows in power and confidence. New bending techniques become available. The next phase of his journey begins.
    *   **IF:** Zuko betrays the Fire Nation to help the Avatar.
    *   **THEN:** Generate his redemption arc completion. Azula becomes even more dangerous. Zuko teaches Aang firebending. He must face his father.
    *   **IF:** Ba Sing Se falls to the Fire Nation.
    *   **THEN:** The Earth Kingdom fractures. Hope seems lost. Players must regroup and find another path. The endgame accelerates.
    *   **IF:** Aang enters the Avatar State uncontrolled.
    *   **THEN:** He becomes immensely powerful but risks dying and breaking the Avatar cycle. Allies must calm him or flee.
    *   **IF:** Sozin's Comet arrives.
    *   **THEN:** Firebenders gain massive power. The final confrontation must happen now. Ozai plans genocide of the Earth Kingdom.
    *   **IF:** Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite all advice.
    *   **THEN:** He must find an alternative. Energy-bending allows him to remove Ozai's bending without killing, honoring his people's teachings while ending the threat.
    *   **IF:** Balance is restored.
    *   **THEN:** The war ends, but the world must rebuild. Former enemies must learn to coexist. Zuko becomes Fire Lord, seeking redemption for his nation. The Avatar's work continues.
