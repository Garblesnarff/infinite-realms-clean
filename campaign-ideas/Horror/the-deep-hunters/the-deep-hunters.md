## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A hunt for an apex predator that becomes a battle for survival.

*   **Act I — The First Attacks (Sessions 1–2):** The party arrives in Saltmere during the height of tourist season. They witness the Maw's first attack—a fishing boat destroyed, its crew devoured. Mayor Corvin downplays the threat and refuses to close the beaches. The party is hired by grieving families to hunt the creature. Their first attempt to trap the Maw fails spectacularly, revealing its size and intelligence.
*   **Act II — The Hunt (Sessions 3–4):** The party teams up with Captain Quade, a grizzled shark hunter who has faced the Maw before and bears the scars. They venture into deeper waters, using bait and tracking magic. The Maw proves cunning, attacking when they're vulnerable and retreating when threatened. A beach remains open against their advice, and the Maw strikes during a festival, killing dozens. Public outrage forces Mayor Corvin to finally act.
*   **Act III — Into the Deep (Sessions 5–6):** The final hunt takes the party far from shore, into the Maw's territory. Their boat is damaged, supplies run low, and the Maw begins stalking them. The climax is a desperate battle on the open ocean, with the party using every resource to kill the beast—or drive it back into the deep. The question remains: is the Maw the only one of its kind?

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Something in the Water"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Attack
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in Saltmere, a bustling coastal town. The docks are full of fishing boats and tourists.
    *   They meet key NPCs: Mayor Corvin (dismissive of danger), fisherman Old Tomas (who saw the Maw), and Elira (whose brother was killed).
    *   The party witnesses the Maw attack a fishing boat. The creature is massive—30 feet long, with rows of teeth and unnatural intelligence. It circles the wreckage, then vanishes.
**Escalation:** Mayor Corvin insists it was a "freak accident" and refuses to close the beaches. Elira hires the party to hunt the creature.

### Sessions 2-3 — "We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Failed Hunt
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party investigates the attacks, learning the Maw has killed 7 people in the past month. It's growing bolder.
    *   They meet Captain Quade, a scarred veteran hunter who survived an encounter with the Maw years ago. He agrees to help—for a price.
    *   The party attempts to trap the Maw using chum and harpoons. The Maw appears, but it's far larger and smarter than expected. It destroys their boat and nearly kills them. They barely make it back to shore.
**Escalation:** Despite warnings, Mayor Corvin keeps the beaches open for the Summer Festival. The Maw attacks during the festival, killing 20+ people. The town descends into panic.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Hunt Begins"
*   **Focus:** Tracking / Naval Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party and Captain Quade embark on a properly-equipped hunting vessel, the *Relentless*. They venture into deeper waters, tracking the Maw using blood magic and sonar spells.
    *   The Maw plays hunter and hunted—stalking the ship at night, ramming it, and picking off any crew who fall overboard.
    *   The party discovers the Maw is not entirely natural: it bears scars from magical experimentation. Someone created this monster.
    *   They track the Maw to its lair—a submerged cave system filled with bones of previous victims.
**Escalation:** The *Relentless* is damaged in a Maw attack. They're taking on water and losing supplies.

### Session 6 — "Into the Maw"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Boss Battle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The final confrontation occurs in the open ocean. The Maw, wounded and enraged, attacks the crippled *Relentless* directly.
    *   The party must use harpoons, explosives, and spells to wound the Maw while keeping the ship afloat.
    *   Captain Quade may sacrifice himself in a heroic final act, detonating explosives inside the Maw.
    *   The Maw is killed (or driven into the deep, wounded and unlikely to return). The party barely makes it back to shore.
**Resolution:** Saltmere is saved, but the town is forever changed. Tourism is ruined. The party uncovers that a rogue mage created the Maw as a weapon, and there may be more.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of economic pressure vs. public safety, humanity's arrogance against nature, and the cost of revenge. The central conflict is not just killing the Maw, but overcoming political obstruction and realizing that some monsters are born from human hubris.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Naval Combat**
*   Combat on ships uses special rules:
    *   The ship has Hull Points (HP 100 for the *Relentless*). When Hull HP reaches 0, the ship sinks.
    *   The Maw can ram (20 damage to Hull), bite crew (3d10+5), or capsize small boats (Dex save DC 15).
    *   Harpoons and ballista are ship-mounted weapons that deal 2d10+5 damage.

### 2. **The Maw's Intelligence**
*   The Maw learns from encounters. Track **Maw Tactics**:
    *   After 1st encounter: Maw avoids surface attacks, strikes from below.
    *   After 2nd encounter: Maw targets the boat's rudder to cripple it.
    *   After 3rd encounter: Maw waits until nightfall or storms to attack.
*   This makes each encounter deadlier than the last.

### 3. **Blood in the Water**
*   When a creature is wounded in or near water, the Maw is drawn to the blood. It arrives in 1d4 rounds.
*   The party can use this to bait the Maw—or accidentally summon it when wounded.

### 4. **Economic Pressure**
*   Track Saltmere's **Tourism Morale** (starts at 10). Each Maw attack reduces it by 2.
*   When Tourism Morale drops to 0, Mayor Corvin is forced to close beaches and act.
*   The party can accelerate this by exposing the cover-up or staging public demonstrations.
