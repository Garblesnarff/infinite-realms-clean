*A Wilderness Survival Realism campaign — Medium Campaign (10-12 sessions) — Very High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Quiet End
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Wilderness Survival / Post-Geomagnetic Apocalypse / Psychological / No Monsters / Resource Management
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **7**
**Tone (keywords):** quiet, contemplative, realistic, unforgiving, isolated, slow apocalypse, no zombies
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A geomagnetic disaster has brought civilization to its knees. All electronics are dead, planes have fallen from the sky, and a strange aurora now dominates the northern skies. The party, survivors of a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness, must trek through the frozen, isolated landscape to reach the rumored safe haven of Perseverance Mills, a remote town that may still have survivors. There are no zombies, no mutants—only the cold, hunger, thirst, wildlife, and the slow, quiet realization that the world as they knew it is gone. Every decision matters: what to carry, when to rest, whether to trust another survivor. This is the quiet end of the world.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A slow, methodical journey across the frozen wilderness, testing survival skills and willpower.

*   **Act I — The Crash & First Steps (Levels 1–3):** The party's plane crashes in the wilderness due to the geomagnetic event. They scavenge the wreckage for supplies (food, clothing, tools) and must make immediate survival decisions: build a fire, find shelter, treat injuries. They discover a map showing their location and the distant town of Perseverance Mills. To reach it, they must trek through multiple regions, each more dangerous than the last. They encounter their first survivor—Grey Mother, an old woman in a cabin who offers shelter in exchange for help.
*   **Act II — The Long Trek (Levels 4–5):** The party journeys through interconnected wilderness regions (Mystery Lake, Coastal Highway, Pleasant Valley). Each region has abandoned structures (cabins, gas stations, farmsteads) that offer temporary shelter and scavenging opportunities, but also dangers (blizzards, wolves, bears, freezing temperatures). They meet other survivors—some helpful, others desperate and dangerous. Resources are finite, and the party must decide what to carry and what to leave behind.
*   **Act III — Perseverance Mills & The Choice (Levels 6–7):** The party reaches Perseverance Mills, only to find it barely functional. The survivors there are fractured, resources are nearly depleted, and a harsh winter is coming. The party must choose: stay and try to rebuild, or continue onward to a rumored coastal settlement. The campaign ends with a final trek through the deadliest region yet (Desolation Point or Timberwolf Mountain), testing everything they've learned. The final challenge is not a monster, but a blizzard that threatens to freeze them before they reach safety.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "The Crash"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Immediate Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The plane crashes. The party awakens scattered in the wreckage, injured and disoriented.
    *   They must scavenge the wreckage for supplies: clothing (against the cold), food (limited), tools (a hatchet, matches), and a map.
    *   They must treat injuries (sprains, lacerations, hypothermia) using limited first aid supplies.
    *   As night falls, the temperature drops dangerously. They must build a fire and find or create shelter.
**Escalation:** One party member is severely injured (broken leg). They must be carried or left behind, forcing a brutal early decision.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Grey Mother's Cabin"
*   **Focus:** Resource Management / First NPC Encounter
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party treks through the frozen forest to a marked cabin on the map. This is Grey Mother's home.
    *   Grey Mother offers shelter, warmth, and food in exchange for help: retrieve medicine from a nearby gas station and find her missing son's grave.
    *   The party must manage their condition: warmth (clothing, fires), hunger (rations are limited), thirst (melt snow), and fatigue (rest drains time).
    *   They scavenge the gas station, facing a wolf encounter, and find the medicine and clues about the geomagnetic disaster.
**Escalation:** A blizzard hits while the party is en route to the gas station. They must navigate in near-zero visibility or risk freezing.

### Sessions 4-6 — "The Journey Begins"
*   **Focus:** Wilderness Survival / Trekking Mechanics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party leaves Grey Mother's cabin and begins the long trek to Perseverance Mills, navigating through Mystery Lake.
    *   They encounter abandoned structures: a trapper's cabin (safe shelter), a frozen lake (shortcut but thin ice hazard), a hunting lodge (supplies but wolves).
    *   They must hunt or fish for food (rabbits, deer, fish) and craft better gear (wolfskin coat, bearskin bedroll).
    *   They meet another survivor, Hobbs, a hunter who offers guidance in exchange for sharing supplies.
**Escalation:** A bear defends its kill (a deer carcass). The party must scare it off, kill it, or flee. Killing it provides massive resources but is extremely dangerous.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Grey Mother** — *The Matriarch*
    *   **Role:** An elderly woman living alone in a cabin. She offers the party their first real shelter and quest.
    *   **Personality:** Kind but weary. She has accepted the quiet end and seeks only to find peace regarding her son's fate.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She knows more about the geomagnetic disaster than she lets on—her son was a scientist studying it before he died. She has his journals hidden away.

2.  **Jeremiah Hobbs** — *The Trapper*
    *   **Role:** A grizzled wilderness expert who has been living off the land for years.
    *   **Personality:** Pragmatic, self-reliant, and slightly paranoid. He values actions over words.

3.  **The Warden (Optional Late-Game)** — *The Hermit*
    *   **Role:** A mysterious figure who lives in the most dangerous regions, surviving impossible conditions.
    *   **Personality:** Silent, stoic, and skilled. They communicate through actions and gestures, not words.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Warden was the pilot of the party's plane, wracked with guilt but unable to express it.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about the quiet, slow death of the world. It captures the contemplative, realistic survival of *The Long Dark*: no zombies, no monsters, only the cold, hunger, and the choices the party makes. The central conflict is internal and environmental—can they maintain their humanity while making brutal survival decisions? Can they trust others, or is everyone a potential threat to their limited resources? The geomagnetic disaster is not supernatural; it is simply the backdrop for a story about people trying to endure when everything else has fallen apart.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Condition System**
*   Characters have multiple condition meters that must be constantly managed:
    *   **Warmth:** Freezing causes damage over time. Requires warm clothing and fires.
    *   **Hunger:** Starvation leads to weakness and death. Food is scarce.
    *   **Thirst:** Dehydration is deadly. Snow must be melted or water purified.
    *   **Fatigue:** Exhaustion imposes penalties. Rest is necessary but risky (time passes, warmth needed).
    *   **Afflictions:** Sprains, frostbite, infections, food poisoning, parasites.

### 2. **Weight & Inventory Management**
*   Every item has weight. Carrying too much causes encumbrance (slower movement, more fatigue).
*   The party must constantly decide: what to carry (food, water, tools, weapons) and what to leave behind.

### 3. **Wildlife Encounters**
*   Animals are not zombies; they behave realistically:
    *   **Wolves:** Travel in packs. Aggressive if the party is weak or carrying raw meat. Can be scared off with flares or torches.
    *   **Bears:** Extremely dangerous. Defend food sources or territories. Fighting one is nearly suicidal.
    *   **Deer & Rabbits:** Prey animals, sources of food and crafting materials.

### 4. **Weather & Time**
*   Weather is a constant threat. Blizzards reduce visibility, increase cold damage, and can be deadly.
*   Time passes realistically. Resting, traveling, and scavenging all take hours. The party must plan carefully.

### 5. **No Combat XP, Only Survival Milestones**
*   The party gains levels by surviving major milestones (reaching a new region, enduring a blizzard, killing a bear, helping a survivor).
*   Combat is avoided when possible. Every fight risks injury, and resources to heal are limited.

### 6. **Crafting & Repair**
*   Clothing and tools degrade over time and must be repaired (sewing kits, whetstones, leather).
*   Crafting is essential: wolfskin coats, bearskin bedrolls, rabbit-skin mitts, improvised tools.
*   Fires require fuel (sticks, coal, wood) and are the difference between life and death.

### 7. **The Quiet Apocalypse**
*   There are no enemies beyond nature and desperate survivors. The world is silent, empty, and dying.
*   The geomagnetic disaster has made all electronics useless. Firearms work, but ammunition is scarce.
*   The campaign's tone is contemplative, focusing on the party's choices, relationships, and will to survive.
