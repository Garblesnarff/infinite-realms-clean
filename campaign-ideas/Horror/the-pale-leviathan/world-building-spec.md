### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Pale Leviathan**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party joins the crew of the whaling vessel *Pequod*, commanded by the obsessed Captain Ahab, on a hunt for the legendary Pale Leviathan—the white whale that took Ahab's leg. As the hunt consumes all reason, they must survive at sea while deciding whether to follow Ahab into his fatal obsession or mutiny to save themselves.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of whaling in this world. Why is whale oil valuable? What magical properties might it have beyond illumination?
    *   Write the legend of the Pale Leviathan as told in sailor's taverns. How many ships has it destroyed? How long has it lived?
    *   Describe Captain Ahab's first encounter with the whale. What exactly happened that cost him his leg and sparked his obsession?
    *   Explain the maritime culture and traditions. What are "gams"? What are the superstitions sailors hold about whales, the sea, and omens?
    *   Detail the crew composition of a whaling vessel—the roles, the hierarchy, and the economic system of "shares."
    *   Write about the Cursed Doldrums—why do ships disappear there? Is it natural or supernatural?
    *   Describe theories about what the Pale Leviathan actually is: ancient spirit? Last of an elder species? Physical manifestation of the sea's wrath? Or simply an exceptionally large and cunning whale?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The *Pequod*'s Crew** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Initially, to hunt whales profitably and return home wealthy. Later, divided between following Ahab and survival.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Captain Ahab commands, followed by three mates (Starbuck, Stubb, Flask), then harpooners (Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo), then skilled sailors, then greenhorns.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To hunt whales and fill the hold with oil.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Increasingly divided. Some follow Ahab's obsession. Others (led by Starbuck) want to abandon the hunt and go home. Some just want to survive.
        *   **Assets:** The *Pequod* itself, whaling expertise, small boats for hunting, harpoons and cutting tools, several years of supplies.
        *   **Relationships:** United at first, gradually fracturing as Ahab's obsession becomes clear. The party's choices influence whether crew remains loyal or mutinies.
    *   **Captain Ahab** (Major - Tragic Protagonist/Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** To kill the Pale Leviathan at any cost. This trumps profit, safety, and survival.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Absolute authority as captain. His word is law at sea.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To hunt whales, including specifically the white whale.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** He may have made pacts with dark powers to find the whale. He knows he'll likely die but accepts this as destiny.
        *   **Assets:** Brilliant seamanship, charismatic leadership, tactical genius, the special harpoon forged in blood, possible supernatural guidance to find the whale.
        *   **Relationships:** Commands the crew but increasingly alienates them. Starbuck openly questions him. The harpooners remain loyal. The party's stance determines much.
    *   **Other Whaling Ships** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Profitable whaling, mutual aid at sea, sharing news.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Each ship has its own captain and crew.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maritime cooperation and trade.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Most captains who've encountered the Leviathan warn against the hunt. They believe Ahab is mad and the *Pequod* is doomed.
        *   **Assets:** Ships, crews, knowledge of whale grounds and ocean conditions.
        *   **Relationships:** Try to warn Ahab. Can provide news, supplies, and potential rescue if the party seeks help.
    *   **The Sea Itself** (Major - Environmental Force)
        *   **Goals:** N/A—the sea is indifferent to human concerns.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Natural hierarchy of predators, with the Pale Leviathan as apex.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The sea may be conscious or may contain spirits/gods who take interest in the hunt. The deeper they go, the stranger things become.
        *   **Assets:** Storms, calms, currents, natural hazards, and all the creatures of the deep.
        *   **Relationships:** Neither helps nor hinders—it simply is. Humans survive or drown by their own skill and luck.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Captain Ahab:** Obsessed captain with ivory peg leg, brilliant but monomani acal, possibly made dark pacts, fated for tragic end.
    *   **Starbuck:** First Mate, devout Quaker, voice of reason, contemplates mutiny but lacks resolve to act.
    *   **Queequeg:** Polynesian harpooner, mystical and spiritual, noble friend to the party, accepts his fated death with dignity.
    *   **Stubb:** Second Mate, cheerfully fatalistic, provides dark humor, believes they're doomed but continues anyway.
    *   **Flask:** Third Mate, aggressive and simple, sees whales as personal enemies, blindly loyal to Ahab.
    *   **Tashtego:** Native American harpooner, proud warrior, excellent at reading ocean and weather signs.
    *   **Daggoo:** African harpooner, massive and powerful, quiet but formidable.
    *   **Fedallah:** Ahab's mysterious personal harpooner, appears midway through voyage, possibly a devil or dark sorcerer.
    *   **The Pale Leviathan:** The white whale itself—impossibly large, intelligent, scarred from countless encounters, may be supernatural.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Experienced Sailor - Superstitious but Skilled"
    *   "Greenhorn Sailor - Learning the Ropes"

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party supports Starbuck's mutiny plan in Session 7 and acts on it.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an alternate path where Ahab is deposed. The ship turns for home, but they encounter the Leviathan anyway—it seems to find them, forcing a confrontation they're unprepared for.
    *   **IF:** The party remains loyal to Ahab throughout.
    *   **THEN:** Generate deeper personal connections. Ahab trusts them with command of a whale boat in the final chase, giving them agency in the climactic confrontation.
    *   **IF:** Queequeg dies during the hunt (Session 9 or 10).
    *   **THEN:** Crew morale plummets. He was beloved. Several crew members actively begin planning mutiny. The party loses their closest NPC ally.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to sabotage the hunt (destroying the special harpoon, damaging whale boats, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** Ahab discovers the betrayal. Generate a confrontation where he must decide: punish them (possibly execution) or forgive them because he needs every hand for the final hunt.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully warns multiple crew members and organizes a mutiny before the final chase.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a "Mutiny Ending" where they seize control and attempt to flee, but the Leviathan pursues them, forcing them to fight defensively rather than as hunters.
    *   **IF:** During the final battle, the party chooses to abandon ship early when it's clear the *Pequod* will sink.
    *   **THEN:** More crew survives, but they witness Ahab's final moments from a distance. The epilogue shows more survivors' guilt and questioning about whether they could have saved him.
    *   **IF:** The party manages to kill the Pale Leviathan.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a pyrrhic victory ending. The whale is dead, but at terrible cost (most crew dead, ship sinking). The survivors return as heroes but are haunted—they've killed something ancient and perhaps sacred. Strange ocean phenomena suggest balance has been disrupted.
    *   **IF:** The Pale Leviathan is driven off but not killed.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an ambiguous ending where Ahab dies, the ship sinks, but the Leviathan vanishes into the deep, enduring. The survivors debate whether it was an animal defending itself or something more.
