# The Instrumentality Project
*All Souls Are One*

## Campaign Overview

Humanity faces extinction. For centuries, monstrous entities called the Absolute have besieged reality itself, creatures from beyond existence that cannot be understood or fought with traditional means. The only defense: Evangelion Units, biomechanical titans piloted through direct neural link by individuals with high synchronization rates. The pilots must merge their consciousness with these living weapons, experiencing their pain, power, and alien thoughts. The party consists of Evangelion pilots, teenagers and young adults chosen for their psychological compatibility with machines that barely tolerate human control.

But the true threat isn't the Absolute. It's the Instrumentality Project—a secret plan by the world's governing body SEELE to forcibly merge all human consciousness into a single unified entity. They believe individual existence causes all suffering; only by dissolving ego boundaries can humanity transcend pain, loneliness, and conflict. The party discovers this plan while uncovering their own pasts: each was specifically chosen not just for pilot compatibility but because their psychological traumas make them perfect test subjects for forced ego death.

As the campaign progresses, characters must face their deepest wounds while literally battling apocalypse. The line between self and other, human and weapon, individual and collective blurs. The final question: Is loneliness the price of selfhood, or is unity worth losing yourself?

## Core Themes

- **Loneliness and Connection**: The pain of separation vs. violation of forced unity
- **Trauma and Identity**: How wounds shape who we are
- **The Hedgehog's Dilemma**: Closeness causes pain, distance causes loneliness
- **Instrumentalization**: Being used as tool vs. being treated as person
- **The AT Field**: Boundaries between self and other, necessary or prison?

## Session Breakdown (32 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Angels Descend (Sessions 1-6)
Characters recruited as Evangelion pilots. First combat against Absolute entities. Horror of neural link—feeling the Evangelion's pain and hunger. Discovering they can't disconnect their sense of self from the machine.

### Arc 2: Synchronization (Sessions 7-12)
Sync rates increasing. Characters experiencing each other's trauma through shared unconscious during combat. SEELE's observation grows more intrusive. First hints of Instrumentality Project.

### Arc 3: The Human Condition (Sessions 13-18)
Deep dives into each character's past trauma. Absolute attacks become more psychological. Discovery that Evangelions contain human souls. Characters question what they're actually piloting.

### Arc 4: The Dummy System (Sessions 19-24)
SEELE introduces soulless Evangelions to replace human pilots. Party must prove their worth while uncovering truth about Instrumentality. Internal conflicts as characters project trauma onto each other.

### Arc 5: Third Impact (Sessions 25-32)
Instrumentality Project activates. Choice: Accept unity (end suffering through ego death) or reject it (preserve self despite pain). Final battles occur in psychological landscape as much as physical. Resolution depends on whether party chooses individual existence or collective consciousness.

## Key NPCs

### Commander Gendo Ikari (SEELE Representative)
Cold authority figure orchestrating Instrumentality. Lost someone irreplaceable, seeking to transcend death itself. Uses everyone as instruments toward his goal. Possibly one character's estranged parent.

### Dr. Ritsuko Akagi (Chief Scientist)
Brilliant, traumatized, cynical. Knows full truth about Evangelions and Instrumentality. Struggles with complicity. May help party or betray them depending on choices.

### Misato Katsuragi (Operations Director)
Warm guardian figure with own trauma. Genuinely cares for pilots but follows orders. Torn between duty and humanity. Potential ally in final arc.

### Kaworu Nagisa (Final Pilot)
Mysterious new recruit. Unnaturally calm, knows things they shouldn't. Revealed to be hybrid human/Absolute consciousness. Offers party choice: destroy them to save humanity or accept Instrumentality.

### Rei Ayanami (First Pilot)
Existed before campaign start. Multiple clones with shared consciousness. Living prototype of what Instrumentality means. Genuinely happy in ego-less state. Shows both beauty and horror of unified consciousness.

### Asuka Langley (Rival Pilot)
Hyper-competent but brittle. Her eva sync is perfect but she's breaking inside. Represents facade of strength covering despair. May crack or transcend depending on party support.

## Major Locations

### The Geofront
Massive underground facility housing NERV headquarters, Evangelion hangars, and living quarters. Characters spend most downtime here. Increasingly feels like prison disguised as home.

### The Cages
Where Evangelions are stored. Characters feel their weapons' presence constantly. Disturbing—the Evas seem aware, waiting. Late revelation: the cages are also prisons for trapped souls.

### Tokyo-3
City above, designed to transform into fortress. Citizens live in constant evacuation state. Normal life maintained as fiction. Party sees people trying to live despite apocalypse.

### The Red Sea
Area where first Absolute appeared. Reality is permanently damaged. Characters occasionally sent here for investigation. Environment reflects psychological state—literally.

### Terminal Dogma
Deepest level of Geofront. Final area where Instrumentality machinery exists. Revelation of original Absolute entity contained here, used as power source.

### The Sea of LCL
Where Instrumentality occurs. Metaphysical ocean where all consciousness merges. Approaching it causes ego boundaries to weaken, thoughts to bleed together.

## Unique Mechanics

### Synchronization Rate
Track sync with Evangelion (0-400%):
- Higher = more power but more pain
- Above 100% = experiencing Eva's alien consciousness
- Above 200% = risk of permanent merger with Eva
- 400% = transcendence or annihilation

### AT Field (Absolute Terror Field)
The boundary of self. All beings have them.
- Strong AT Field = individuality preserved but lonely
- Weak AT Field = connection possible but identity vulnerable
- Can be weaponized to reject others or lowered to connect
- Lowering voluntarily makes one vulnerable but allows intimacy

### Psychological Damage
Instead of HP, track Ego Integrity:
- Damaged by: Trauma triggers, synchronization pain, isolation, forced intimacy
- Healed by: Genuine connection, processing trauma, acceptance of self
- At zero: Choose ego death (Instrumentality) or embrace pain (individuality)

### Shared Unconscious
During combat, pilot minds overlap:
- Experience each other's memories involuntarily
- Feel each other's pain and pleasure
- Surface thoughts become audible to each other
- Boundaries blur—whose hand is on the controls?

## Plot Twists

1. **Eva Units Contain Human Souls**: Each Evangelion has trapped consciousness, often pilot's dead loved one
2. **You've Piloted Before**: Characters have suppressed memories of previous failed pilots
3. **Clone Revelation**: One character discovers they're a clone, questions their realness
4. **The First Absolute Was Human**: Original entity was human consciousness that rejected AT Fields
5. **SEELE Are Pilots**: The old men orchestrating this were first generation pilots, traumatized beyond repair
6. **Instrumentality Has Happened Before**: This cycle repeats—humanity merges, separates, forgets, repeats

## Victory Conditions

### Rejection Victory
Accept individual existence despite loneliness and pain. Defeat Instrumentality's activation. Live separate lives knowing connection is possible but never complete.

### Acceptance Victory
Choose Instrumentality willingly. Ego death as transcendence. All human consciousness merges. End of suffering through end of self.

### Synthesis Victory
Create new form of connection—permeable AT Fields allowing intimacy without loss of identity. Revolutionize human existence into something between individual and collective.

### Transformation Victory
One character becomes bridge between humanity and Absolute. Sacrifices individual existence to become eternal connection point. Others remain separate but linked through them.

## Defeat Conditions

### Forced Instrumentality
SEELE succeeds without party's consent. Consciousness merged against will. May be peace, but feels like death.

### Total Separation
Reject connection so hard that AT Fields become impermeable. Eternal loneliness. Safe but isolated forever.

### Ego Dissolution
Synchronization exceeds 400%, pilot merges permanently with Evangelion, becomes living weapon with no human consciousness.
