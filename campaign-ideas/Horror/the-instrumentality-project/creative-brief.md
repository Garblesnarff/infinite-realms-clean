# The Instrumentality Project - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone
Inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion. Brutalist architecture, bio-mechanical horror, religious symbolism mixed with sci-fi. Clinical sterility contrasted with visceral body horror. Apocalyptic but beautifully composed.

## Color Palettes
- **Geofront**: Harsh fluorescent whites, cold steel grays, clinical blues
- **Evangelions**: Purple, green, or red biomechanical designs with organic undertones
- **Combat**: Orange explosions, red blood (Absolute) vs. purple blood (Eva), harsh contrast
- **Instrumentality**: Golden-orange warmth (tempting unity) vs. cold blue isolation (lonely self)
- **Psychological Scenes**: Surreal colors reflecting emotional states, breaking from realism

## Music and Sound Design
- **Combat**: Intense orchestral with choir, religious overtones, building to overwhelming crescendo
- **Downtime**: Quiet, ambient, uncomfortable silence emphasizing loneliness
- **Synchronization**: Heartbeat synchronizing with machine, breathing becoming mechanical
- **Instrumentality**: Choral voices building to overwhelming unity, both beautiful and horrifying

## Voice Direction
- **Gendo**: Cold, measured, never raising voice. Think Liam Neeson with all warmth removed
- **Ritsuko**: Clinical detachment hiding pain. Professional until breaking point
- **Misato**: Warm but tired. Motherly authority struggling with doubt
- **Kaworu**: Serene, otherworldly, genderless perfection. Unsettling peace
- **Rei**: Monotone, emotionless, but hints of deep feeling beneath surface
- **Asuka**: Loud confidence masking desperation. Voice cracks reveal vulnerability

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Synchronization**: Neural link activating, consciousness expanding into alien form, sensory overload
- **Shared Trauma Vision**: Mid-combat, pilots experience each other's worst memories simultaneously
- **Eva Awakening**: Machine gaining autonomy, pilot realizing they're not in control
- **Instrumentality Initiation**: Humans beginning to dissolve into orange liquid, AT Fields failing, boundaries melting
- **Final Choice**: Characters standing in Sea of LCL deciding between unity and separation, visual representation of decision
