After their airship crashes on a remote, forested peninsula, the party discovers that one of their companions—a young NPC they were escorting—has been kidnapped by pale, deformed cannibals. To survive and rescue the child, they must build shelter, craft weapons, and explore the hostile wilderness while fighting off increasingly aggressive mutant attacks. As they delve deeper into the peninsula's network of caves, they uncover the horrifying truth: a secret arcane research facility has been conducting experiments on captives, creating the cannibals and worse abominations. The rescue mission becomes a fight to escape the peninsula and expose the conspiracy before they too become test subjects.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A descent from surface survival to underground horror.

*   **Act I — Crash & Survival (Levels 4–7):** The party survives the airship crash and must establish a base camp in the hostile forest. They are attacked by primitive cannibals who steal supplies and, tragically, kidnap the young NPC, Timmy. The party must gather resources, build defenses, and explore the peninsula to find clues about where the cannibals have taken the child. They discover cave entrances and realize the cannibals have an extensive underground network.
*   **Act II — Into the Depths (Levels 8–10):** The party ventures into the cave system, facing more horrific enemies: mutated abominations created by arcane experimentation. They discover abandoned research outposts and learn of the Facility, a secret underground laboratory run by a rogue mage consortium. They find evidence that Timmy is being held there. The caves are a labyrinth of terror, filled with traps, mutants, and the ever-present threat of being lost in the dark.
*   **Act III — The Facility & Escape (Levels 11–12):** The party breaches the Facility, a high-security arcane research complex. They face the mages conducting the experiments, rescue Timmy (who may have been altered by the experiments), and uncover the full scope of the conspiracy. The climax involves choosing between destroying the Facility (and potentially collapsing the caves, trapping them) or using its ancient teleportation circle to escape. Either way, they must face the Final Mutant, a massive abomination unleashed as a last defense.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "The Crash"
*   **Focus:** Survival Introduction / Immediate Loss
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party's airship crashes in a dense forest. They awaken scattered, injured, and disoriented.
    *   They realize Timmy, a young noble's son they were escorting, is missing. Signs of struggle suggest he was dragged away.
    *   A skill challenge to find each other, gather basic supplies from the wreck, and establish a perimeter before nightfall.
**Escalation:** As night falls, strange howls echo through the forest. Pale, naked figures are spotted at the edge of the firelight, watching.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Building the Camp"
*   **Focus:** Base Building / Cannibal Encounters
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party establishes a fortified camp using salvaged materials and forest resources (wood, stone, rope from vines).
    *   They must hunt for food, purify water, and craft basic weapons and armor (spears, clubs, leather hide armor).
    *   Cannibals attack in small groups, testing the defenses. The party captures one and learns (through broken speech or telepathy) that Timmy was taken "below" to the "bright place."
    *   They discover effigies—grotesque totems made of bones and bodies—marking cannibal territory. Destroying them angers the cannibals, triggering larger attacks.
**Escalation:** A night raid. A large group of cannibals attacks the camp. If the defenses hold, the party repels them. If not, they must retreat and rebuild.

### Sessions 5-6 — "The First Cave"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Horror Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Following clues, the party locates a cave entrance. Inside, they find evidence of recent activity: Timmy's torn shirt, cannibal camps, and strange alchemical residue.
    *   The caves are dark, claustrophobic, and filled with danger: natural hazards (chasms, water, unstable ceilings) and lurking cannibals.
    *   They encounter their first mutants: multi-limbed abominations that were once human, twisted by arcane experiments.
    *   They find a journal from a previous researcher, hinting at the Facility and its true purpose.
**Escalation:** The party is ambushed by a Mutant Brute, a massive, deformed creature. They must fight or flee deeper into the caves.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Timmy** — *The Lost Child*
    *   **Role:** The NPC the party is trying to rescue. A young boy (8-10 years old) who is brave but terrified.
    *   **Personality:** (Before capture) Cheerful, curious, and trusting. (After rescue) Traumatized, possibly altered by experiments. May have strange new abilities or mutations.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Timmy's father is a powerful noble who hired the party. The mages at the Facility specifically targeted Timmy because his bloodline has latent magical potential, making him an ideal test subject.

2.  **Dr. Elara Cross** — *The Lead Researcher*
    *   **Role:** The head of the Facility, a brilliant but utterly amoral arcane scientist.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, clinical, and detached. She views her test subjects as "materials," not people. She genuinely believes her work will advance magical knowledge, justifying any atrocity.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She herself was once a captive on the peninsula, experimented on by her predecessor. She survived and took over the Facility, continuing the work that destroyed her own humanity.

3.  **Megan Cross** — *The Feral Survivor*
    *   **Role:** Elara's daughter, who was mutated in an early experiment and now lives in the caves, leading the most aggressive cannibal tribes.
    *   **Personality:** Feral, intelligent, and vengeful. She can no longer speak but understands Common. She despises the Facility but also knows no other life.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is trapped in a twisted form and sees the party as both potential saviors (if they can cure her) or enemies (if they threaten her territory).

## Key Locations

1.  **The Crash Site & Base Camp:** The party's fortified refuge on the surface, constantly under threat of cannibal raids.
2.  **The Cannibal Villages:** Primitive settlements made of bones, hides, and scavenged debris, scattered across the peninsula.
3.  **The Cave Network:** A massive underground labyrinth filled with cannibals, mutants, and ancient traps.
4.  **The Facility:** A high-tech arcane research complex deep underground, filled with holding cells, laboratories, and horrific experiments.
5.  **The Artifact Chamber:** The deepest part of the Facility, where a mysterious, ancient artifact powers the experiments and holds a teleportation circle.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about the lengths one will go to save an innocent life in the face of overwhelming horror. It captures the tension of *The Forest*: the need to survive, build, and fight while racing against time to complete a desperate rescue mission. The central conflict is the party's struggle against an environment and enemies that grow more horrific the deeper they go, forcing them to question how much of their own humanity they will sacrifice to save another. The revelation of the Facility's true purpose adds a layer of conspiracy and moral complexity.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity & Horror**
*   The constant exposure to cannibals, mutants, and the Facility's atrocities takes a toll. The party accumulates Dread.
*   Witnessing horrific events, finding mutilated bodies, or spending too long in the caves adds Dread points.
*   High Dread causes mechanical penalties (disadvantage on Wisdom saves, hallucinations, paranoia) and can lead to madness if not managed.
*   Dread is reduced by resting at the safe camp, destroying effigies, or achieving major victories (rescuing survivors, killing a major threat).

### 2. **Base Defense Encounters**
*   The cannibals will periodically attack the party's base. The strength of the attack depends on how much the party has provoked them (destroying effigies, killing their leaders).
*   The party can build defenses: walls, traps (spike pits, deadfalls, fire traps), and alarm systems.
*   If the base falls, the party loses stored resources and must rebuild, creating setbacks.

### 3. **Crafting Under Pressure**
*   Resources are scarce. The party must choose between crafting weapons, armor, or base defenses.
*   Key crafted items include: improvised weapons (spears, axes, molotov cocktails), armor (hide, bone), and survival tools (torches, rope, medicine).
*   Some recipes require horrific materials (cannibal bones, mutant glands), forcing ethical questions.

### 4. **The Caves as a Dungeon Crawl**
*   The cave network is vast and easy to get lost in. The party must map it, leave markers, or risk becoming disoriented.
*   The caves have multiple environmental hazards: flooding chambers, toxic fungi, unstable ceilings, and pitch-black areas where light sources are essential.
*   Some areas are safe havens (underground lakes with fresh water, luminescent fungus groves), providing brief respites.

### 5. **The Rescue Timer**
*   Every few sessions, the party receives clues about Timmy's condition (visions, telepathic calls, finding his belongings). This keeps the rescue mission urgent.
*   If the party delays too long, Timmy undergoes more experiments, potentially becoming mutated. This affects the final rescue and the party's relationship with his family.
