# Wheel of Fate - World-Building Specification

## The Wheel's Nature

The cosmic Wheel of Fortune is reality's randomizer and pattern-maker simultaneously. It spins continuously, determining fates while allowing freedom. Both destiny and choice exist because the Wheel incorporates pattern AND chaos.

## How Fate Works

Fates are probable outcomes, not guaranteed. The Wheel creates tendencies, not certainties. High probability of success means destiny favors you, but choice can still mess it up. Low probability means the odds are against you, but choice can overcome them.

## The Corruption

The Pattern Keeper removed chaos from the Wheel, leaving only pattern. Now everything is predetermined. Destined heroes MUST rise (no agency). Fated villains CANNOT fall (no redemption). Everyone stuck in their probable outcome. Free will eliminated for safety.

## The Carnival Economy

Currency is luck itself. You spend good fortune to buy things. The more you gamble, the more your luck fluctuates. The House collects luck from losers, should redistribute to winners, but since the fixing, it only accumulates, never pays out.

## Fortuna's Madness

She sees all possible outcomes simultaneously. Without chaos, they collapsed into single tracks. She knows everyone's fate perfectly now—and it's driving her insane because she remembers when futures were multiple and free.

## The Pattern Keeper's Motivation

Witnessed a chaos-caused catastrophe. Decided predictability prevents suffering. Fixed the Wheel to create safe, certain reality. Genuinely believes he's heroic. Can't see he's created prison of destiny.

## The Chaos Serpent's Desire

Opposite extreme. Wants pure randomness with no pattern at all. Would make life exciting but meaningless. Nothing building on anything. Pure moment-to-moment existence with no continuity.

## The Solution

Balance. The Wheel needs both pattern (so actions have consequences, growth is possible) AND chaos (so choice matters, futures are open). Not fate vs. free will but fate AND free will.

## Mysteries

- Can you ever truly know if you're choosing freely or following fate?
- Is Fortuna's madness wisdom seeing too much?
- If everything is determined, does that make morality meaningless?
- What if The Pattern Keeper is right and safety requires control?
