# Creative Brief: The River Beast

## Art Style: Urban Grit with Heart

Inspired by *The Host*, blending dysfunctional family drama with monster horror and social commentary.

### Core Principles:
*   **Urban Decay:** Polluted rivers, industrial zones, grimy sewers—show environmental damage.
*   **Tragic Monster:** The Beast is grotesque but pitiable—deformed, in pain, not evil.
*   **Family Bonds:** Show the messiness of family—arguments, desperation, love.
*   **Government Oppression:** Propaganda posters, checkpoints, armed patrols.

### Style Guide:

**Colors:** Muddy browns and grays of the city and sewers. Sickly greens from pollution and the Beast. Warm tones for family moments.

**Characters:** Working-class family in practical, worn clothing. The Beast: deformed amphibian, multiple eyes, dripping with mucus, grotesque but expressive.

**Environments:** Riverside stalls, urban quarantine zone, dark sewers with bioluminescent fungi, the Beast's lair.

**Lighting:** Gray, overcast urban light. Sewers lit by torches and bioluminescence. The Beast's lair has an eerie, underwater glow.

**Composition:** Family grouped together in stressful moments. Wide shots showing scale of sewers and Beast. Close-ups on emotional moments and the Beast's strangely expressive eyes.

## Voice

A frantic, emotional male voice with working-class cadence. Desperate urgency mixed with dark humor. Role: A family member recounting the rescue, still processing the trauma and absurdity.
