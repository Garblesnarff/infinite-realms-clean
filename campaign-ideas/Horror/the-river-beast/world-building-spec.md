# World-Building Specification Brief: The River Beast

**Core Concept:** Dysfunctional family's youngest member kidnapped by mutant river creature. Must rescue her while exposing government conspiracy that created the monster.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Harrow's Landing: industrial city of 30,000, built on polluted river.
*   Councilor Varn's factory: illegally dumping alchemical waste for 10 years.
*   The River Beast: mutated river salamander, now 20 feet long, intelligent but lonely.
*   Government cover-up: Quarantine zone established to hide the dumping scandal.
*   Previous incidents: Smaller mutants have been "disappeared" by officials before.

**Factions:**
*   **The Family** (Major): Party PCs and/or NPCs, dysfunctional but determined.
*   **The City Council** (Major Antagonist): Covering up the dumping, willing to kill witnesses.
*   **The City Guard** (Minor): Enforcing quarantine, some sympathetic, some not.

**NPCs (Tier 1):**
*   The River Beast: Tragic monster, lonely and in pain.
*   Tomas: Drunk father seeking redemption.
*   Kael: Bitter eldest son.
*   Mira: Rebellious daughter.
*   Nessa: Innocent youngest, kidnapped.
*   Councilor Varn: Corrupt official covering tracks.

**Locations:**
*   **Riverside Food Stall:** Family business, now in quarantine zone.
*   **Quarantine Zone:** Sealed district with patrols and checkpoints.
*   **The Sewers:** Dark, flooded, filled with mutants and evidence.
*   **The Beast's Lair:** Vast chamber with bioluminescence and mucus cocoons.

**Causality Chains:**
*   IF family communicates with Beast: Can peacefully rescue Nessa, Beast's fate is spared.
*   IF family kills Beast: Quick rescue but emotional cost, Nessa heartbroken.
*   IF family exposes conspiracy: Varn destroyed, family becomes targets.
*   IF family accepts bribe: Nessa saved, conscience burdened, Varn escapes justice.
*   IF family improves relationships: Gains mechanical bonuses, survives together.
*   IF family fractures: Penalties to cooperation, may lose members.
