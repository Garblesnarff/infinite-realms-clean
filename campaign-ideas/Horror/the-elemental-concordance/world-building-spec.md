*   **Content:** Every five thousand years, the Great Darkness—an entity of pure entropy—awakens to consume reality. The only force capable of stopping it is the Perfect Being, created by combining the four Elemental Keystones with the Fifth Element: Love. When the party accidentally comes into possession of the Fifth Element in humanoid form (Leeloo), they must race across vibrant worlds to gather the Keystones before the Great Darkness arrives and the universe ends.
