# Titans of Steel - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Industrial sci-fi meets kaiju cinema. Pacific Rim's aesthetic—neon-lit metal, ocean depths, massive scale. Emphasize weight and power.

**Color Palette**: Steel grays, ocean blues, neon accents (orange/blue), Kaiju Blue (toxic bioluminescence), fire and plasma weapons.

**Jaeger Design**: Humanoid but mechanical, visible joints and pistons, unique weapons, battle damage accumulates, national/cultural aesthetics (if multiple Jaegers).

**Kaiju Design**: Biological horror, bioluminescent patterns, Category determines size/complexity, each unique but clearly weapon-designed (spikes, acids, EMPs biological).

## Music and Sound Design
**Combat**: Heavy percussion, electronic elements, orchestral power, Taiko drums, building intensity.

**Drift Sequences**: Ethereal, intimate, memory-like soundscapes, heartbeat synchronization, telepathic whispers.

**Kaiju**: Deep roars, subsonic rumbles, specific signature sounds per kaiju, echo underwater.

**Jaeger**: Hydraulic hisses, metal groaning, weapon charging, footsteps shaking earth, pilot breathing in helmets.

## Voice Acting
**Marshal Ironheart**: Commanding but warm, military cadence, weight of responsibility.

**Dr. Geiszler**: Manic energy, rapid speech, enthusiasm covering fear, occasional alien influence glitches.

**Tendo Choi**: Cool operator voice, dry humor under pressure, never panics externally.

**Mako Stoneforge**: Young but intense, pain barely contained, gradually opens up.

## Atmosphere
- Emphasize weight: every movement is HEAVY
- Scale constantly reinforced: "Your Jaeger's FIST is 20 feet across"
- Drift intimacy contrasts combat brutality
- Military precision vs kaiju chaos
- Countdown timers creating urgency (kaiju approaching, ETA 10 minutes)

This campaign is **spectacle with soul**—giant robot battles grounded by human connection and sacrifice.
