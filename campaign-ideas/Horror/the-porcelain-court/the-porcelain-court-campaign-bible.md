# Campaign Bible: The Porcelain Court

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Artisan's Contempt
In the beginning, the cosmos was formless clay. A cosmic entity known as the **Artisan** grew lonely and sought to sculpt life. Its first creations were the gods, beautiful but flawed. Disgusted by their petty emotions and imperfect forms, the Artisan abandoned them, turning its attention to mortals. It saw in humanity the potential for true, static perfection. The "Porcelain Curse" is not a curse; it is the Artisan's "gift." It is a slow, meticulous process of "improving" what it sees as flawed, messy biological life into eternal, beautiful, and silent works of art. The realm of the Porcelain Court is not a cursed bloodline's estate; it is the Artisan's personal gallery, and it is still collecting.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-3000 Y (The First Firing):** The Artisan sculpts the first gods from the cosmic clay and then abandons them in disgust.
2.  **-1500 Y (The Flaw of House Alabaster):** Lord Kaelen Alabaster, a man obsessed with perfection, makes a desperate prayer to any being who could grant his family eternal, unflinching beauty. The Artisan answers.
3.  **-1499 Y (The First Cracks):** The first members of the Alabaster family begin to show signs of the "curse"—their skin taking on a glossy, ceramic sheen. They hide it as a sign of divine favor.
4.  **-900 Y (The Shattering):** The first porcelain noble, Lady Isolde, is pushed down a flight of stairs by a jealous courtier. She doesn't break a bone; she shatters into a thousand pieces. The curse is revealed.
5.  **-750 Y (The Year of Silent Screams):** A plague of magical silence falls over the Alabaster estate. It is later discovered this was the year the family's mouths were sealed in porcelain, their screams trapped eternally within.
6.  **-500 Y (The Kiln of Souls):** The Toymaker, a mortal artisan, discovers a way to "re-fire" the shattered pieces of nobles, binding them with molten gold. He becomes the most powerful man in the court.
7.  **-200 Y (The Gilded Vein Schism):** The court splits into factions: those who embrace the beautiful, static existence, and those who fight it.
8.  **-50 Y (The Collector's Arrival):** The Artisan, pleased with its work, begins to subtly expand the curse's influence beyond the estate, targeting other "flawed" bloodlines.
9.  **-1 Y (The Weeping Ballerina):** A famous ballerina from the capital city is gifted a pair of porcelain ballet slippers from the court. She dances herself into a statue mid-performance. Panic begins.
10. **Present Day:** The party is hired by a desperate outside noble whose child has begun to show the first signs of the curse—a single, perfect, porcelain tear that will not fall from her cheek.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Stagnation
The conflict is a battle between the concepts of **Life (Chaos & Change)** and **Art (Perfection & Stasis)**. The Artisan believes that life's greatest flaw is its movement, its change, its messy emotions. It seeks to "fix" this by turning all of existence into a silent, beautiful, unchanging gallery. The curse spreading is not just a magical disease; it is a philosophical plague. If the Artisan is not stopped, it will "perfect" the entire world into a single, flawless, and dead sculpture.

5.  **The Tear of Elara:** A single, perfect, diamond-hard porcelain tear from the Duchess. It can absorb a single curse, spell, or affliction of any power, but will then shatter, releasing the stored magic in a chaotic burst.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Fracture & Brittleness
*   **Gaining Cracks:** Whenever a character takes critical damage or more than half their max HP in a single blow, they must make a CON save (DC 15). On a failure, they gain a "Fracture."
*   **Fractures:** A character can have up to 3 Fractures. Each one imposes a cumulative -1 to all d20 rolls. They can only be healed by magical means, like the Toymaker's Kintsugi or the Order of Flesh's grafting.
*   **Shattering:** If a character with 3 Fractures fails another CON save for gaining one, a part of them "shatters." This could be a hand (can't hold items), a leg (speed halved), or something more esoteric, like their voice. This requires a major quest to fix.
*   **Porcelain Nobles:** All porcelain enemies have vulnerability to bludgeoning damage but resistance to piercing. When they are reduced to 0 HP, they shatter violently, dealing 2d6 piercing damage to all creatures within 5 feet.

### Subsystem: Aesthetic vs. Chaos
*   **The Artisan's Gaze:** The world itself judges actions.
*   **Gaining Aesthetic:** Performing actions with grace, beauty, and precision (e.g., disarming an opponent, succeeding on a Performance check, creating something beautiful).
*   **Gaining Chaos:** Using brute force, creating a mess, acting with raw, unbridled emotion.
*   **Effects:** The GM tracks a meter. If it's high in Aesthetic, porcelain nobles are stronger, and the palace itself may help the party (e.g., a door opens silently). If it's high in Chaos, the Shattered are stronger, and the palace works against you (e.g., stairs become slippery).
