## Causality Chains and Dream Physics

### Stability Mechanics

**What Makes Dream Zones Stable:**
- Collective belief/focus
- Alignment with dreamer's expectations
- Distance from nightmare contamination
- Presence of lucid dreamers maintaining them
- Anchoring to waking world locations

**What Causes Instability:**
- Conflicting visualizations
- Strong emotions (fear especially)
- Logic Breaker presence
- Dreamer doubt or confusion
- Reality breaches

### Dream Logic Rules

**When Dream Logic Applies:**
1. **The Narrative Rule:** Events follow story logic, not physics
   - If it would be dramatically appropriate, it happens
   - Coincidences occur constantly
   - Symbolism becomes literal

2. **The Emotional Rule:** Feelings affect reality
   - Being afraid makes scary things real
   - Confidence makes you stronger
   - Guilt manifests as obstacles

3. **The Association Rule:** Connections matter more than facts
   - Things that feel related become connected
   - Metaphors become literal
   - Symbols have power

4. **The Forgotten Rule:** What you don't notice doesn't exist
   - Details you ignore fade away
   - Background characters aren't real until observed
   - Places you're not in cease temporarily

### Reality Manipulation Limitations

**What Can Be Changed:**
- Appearance (yours and others')
- Environmental features
- Object properties
- Physical laws (locally)
- Spatial relationships

**What Cannot Be Changed:**
- Core identity (without severe consequences)
- Past events (can be reinterpreted, not rewritten)
- Other lucid dreamers' will (without their consent)
- The fundamental nature of the dream realm
- Whether someone is dreaming

**Cost of Changes:**
- Minor: Negligible, sustainable indefinitely
- Moderate: Requires focus, draining over time
- Major: Causes environmental instability
- Reality-Breaking: Attracts Logic Breakers, risks corruption

### Time Physics

**Time Dilation:**
- Dream time normally runs 4:1 (four dream hours per real hour)
- Can be manipulated up to 100:1 with skill
- Nightmare zones run faster (feels eternal)
- Edge of Sleep: time is meaningless

**Temporal Paradoxes:**
- Possible in dreams—meeting yourself is fine
- Changing past creates branches, not rewrites
- Future visions are probabilities, not certainties
- Some zones exist outside time entirely

### Death and Consequences

**Dying in Dreams:**
- Usually causes wake-up
- Lucid dreamers respawn elsewhere in dream realm
- Being killed by nightmare entity may trap you
- Dying at Edge of Sleep is permanent

**Psychological Damage:**
- Nightmare contamination affects waking mind
- Losing identity anchors causes dissociation
- Dream logic corruption makes you think impossibly
- Severe trauma carries to waking world

## Additional Lore and World History

### The First Dreamer

**Legend:**
Before humanity, there was something that dreamed. Its dream became the dream realm. When humans began dreaming, they entered a space that already existed. The dream realm isn't humanity's creation—humans are the dream realm's discovery.

**Evidence:**
- Architecture predating human civilization
- Entities that claim to remember before humans
- The Archivists (possibly First Dreamer's creations)
- Certain zones that humans can't shape

**Implications:**
- The dream realm has its own agenda
- It may be alive/conscious
- Waking world might be its dream
- The Architect may be trying to wake the First Dreamer

### The Lucidity Wars

**Historical Event (50 years ago in dream time):**
Lucid dreamers split into factions over philosophy:
- Shapers: Dreams exist to be controlled
- Guardians: Dreams exist to be protected
- Explorers: Dreams exist to be understood

War raged across dream realm. Nightmare entities fed on conflict. Dream Phantoms suffered. Eventually, Treaty of Conscious Thought established neutral zones and rules of engagement.

**Legacy:**
- The Citadel built after the war (fortress-neutral ground)
- Dreaming Shepherds formed as peacekeepers
- Some dream zones still scarred by battle
- Veterans still carry grudges
- Architect claims to offer third way beyond old conflicts

### The Waking Crisis

**Current Situation:**
Modern humanity sleeps less, dreams shallower. Medications suppress dreams. Technology disrupts sleep cycles. The dream realm is slowly starving.

**Symptoms:**
- Nightmare zones expanding (desperation)
- Logic Breakers appearing more frequently
- Stable zones requiring more maintenance
- Dream Phantoms fading faster
- Ancient entities awakening (hunger)

**The Architect's Argument:**
This proves waking world is failing. Permanent sleep is humanitarian. In dreams, no one needs to wake exhausted. Let the dream realm consume waking world before waking world accidentally destroys dream realm.

**The Resistance Counter:**
The solution is healing sleep, not eternal sleep. Fix what's wrong with waking world. Don't trap people in pretty prison. Freedom to wake is fundamental right.

### The Nature of Dream Entities

**Three Origins:**

1. **The Constructs:** Created by dreamers (usually unconsciously)
   - Dream Phantoms' supporting characters
   - Nightmare entities born from specific fears
   - Thoughtform weapons and tools
   - Most common type

2. **The Natives:** Always existed in dream realm
   - The Archivists
   - Logic Eaters
   - The Ferryman
   - Possibly sentient dream realm itself

3. **The Transformed:** Were human dreamers once
   - The Morphean Architect
   - Some Merchants of Morpheus
   - Nightmare entities that were people
   - Lucid dreamers who stayed too long

**Rights and Personhood:**
- Philosophical debate raging
- Are constructs "real" if they feel real?
- Do natives have same rights as human dreamers?
- Can transformed return to humanity?
- Is destroying nightmare entity murder?

### Prophecies and Mysteries

**The Unfinished Story (from the Library):**
```
When dreamers forget how to wake,
And wakers forget how to dream,
The sleeper will shake,
And reality will scream.
Three paths diverge in endless night:
The prison of perfection bright,
The death of dreams in morning light,
Or walking roads both day and night.
```

**Interpretations:**
- Architect believes prison path is salvation
- Resistance believes waking path is freedom
- A third option exists (third line) but unknown
- "The sleeper" might be First Dreamer
- "Reality scream" could be realm collapse or merger

**Other Mysteries:**
- What is the Coin That Never Lands really?
- Is Reverie actually the first Architect?
- Can you be born in dreams (never had waking body)?
- Where do Logic Eaters come from?
- What happens if First Dreamer wakes?

### Cultural Elements

**Dream Walker Traditions:**
- Never wake someone violently (psychological damage)
- Respect others' dream spaces (privacy sacred)
- Help Dream Phantoms when possible (karma)
- Don't abuse reality manipulation (hubris)
- Keep dream journals (maintain waking connection)

**Nightmare Taboos:**
- Never speak true name in nightmare zone (gives power)
- Don't look behind you when pursued (makes it real)
- Never accept gifts from nightmare entities (always cursed)
- Don't ask Logic Eaters questions (answers drive mad)
- Never say "this is just a dream" in nightmare (it disagrees violently)

**Merchant Etiquette:**
- Always know what you're trading before agreeing
- The price is always fair by some definition
- You can walk away before finalizing deal
- Never steal from merchants (they remember forever)
- What's traded is gone permanently

### Connection to Waking World

**How Communication Works:**
- Sleep walkers (Somnambulist Resistance)
- Shared dreaming with waking loved ones
- Dream journals that update both ways
- Symbolism that influences waking thoughts
- Extremely rare: manifesting dream objects in reality

**Reality Breaches:**
- Waking locations bleeding into dreams (common)
- Dream locations appearing in waking world (rare, dangerous)
- People seeing dreams while awake (hallucinations or visions?)
- Objects existing in both realms (artifacts)
- The Architect's goal: make breaches permanent

**The Stakes:**
If Architect succeeds: All humanity trapped in perfect dreams, bodies wither
If Resistance succeeds: Dream realm possibly destroyed, magic lost
If party finds third way: Both realms coexist, boundary maintained
If no one succeeds: Realm collision—reality becomes unstable nightmare

This world-building creates a rich, internally consistent dream realm with clear rules that can be bent, fascinating factions with compelling philosophies, and deep lore that raises meaningful questions about consciousness, reality, and the value of dreams versus waking life.
