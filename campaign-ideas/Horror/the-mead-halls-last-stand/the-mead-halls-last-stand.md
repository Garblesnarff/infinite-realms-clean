# The Mead Hall's Last Stand
**Tagline:** *In the shadow of the moors, heroes feast and monsters hunger—only glory is eternal*

## Campaign Overview

In the frozen north, King Hrothgar's magnificent mead hall Heorot stands as beacon of civilization against the darkness. But for twelve winters, the monster Grendel has terrorized the Danes, slaughtering warriors in their sleep and dragging bodies to the fens. No warrior has survived facing the beast. The party arrives as traveling heroes seeking glory, vowing to end the curse that plagues Heorot.

But Grendel is only the first horror. His vengeful mother lurks in the depths. An ancient dragon guards cursed treasure. The party must face escalating threats while navigating the rigid honor codes of Germanic warrior culture. Each victory brings greater challenges, and glory is purchased with blood. The campaign explores the cost of heroism in a world where monsters are real, fate is inescapable, and the only immortality is in song.

This is a dark fantasy campaign about legendary monster hunters in the Anglo-Saxon age, where reputation is everything, loyalty bonds are sacred, and death in battle is preferable to cowardice. The party will become the stuff of legend—if they survive.

## Unique Mechanics

**Wyrd (Fate) Points:** Characters have destiny. Fate points can be spent to survive mortal wounds, achieve impossible feats, or deliver dying declarations. When depleted, death comes.

**Glory and Reputation:** Track fame through boasts fulfilled, treasures won, monsters slain. High glory grants mechanical benefits and narrative authority.

**Oath-Bonds:** Sworn oaths create mechanical advantages when fighting alongside oath-brothers. Breaking oaths destroys reputation and may curse character.

**Ring-Giving:** Treasure distribution creates loyalty bonds. Generous lords gain faithful followers. Hoarding treasure brings doom.

**Boasting:** Before battle, public boasts grant bonuses if fulfilled, penalties if broken. The greater the boast, the greater the stakes.

**Wergild (Blood-Price):** System of compensation for killings. Party must navigate when to pay, when to demand, when to pursue vengeance.

**Battle Kennings:** Poetic descriptions of combat enhance attacks. Creative descriptions earn mechanical bonuses.

**The Scop's Song:** Deeds worthy of song grant permanent bonuses. Heroes live forever in legend.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Grendel's Humanity:** The monster understands language, feels pain and loneliness, philosophizes about his cursed existence. Killing him is still necessary but morally complex.

**Unferth's Treachery:** The challenger may be working for rival kingdom, attempting to ensure party fails. Or he's genuinely redeemed—player paranoia vs. truth.

**Wealtheow's Plot:** The queen is manipulating events to secure succession for her sons. Party are pawns in political intrigue they don't fully grasp.

**The Curse:** The dragon's treasure is cursed. Taking it dooms the bearer. Party must choose between wealth and safety.

**Beow's Legacy:** The legendary past hero's deeds were lies or exaggerations. Party realizes reputation isn't always earned truthfully.

**The Dragon's Reason:** Someone from the party's homeland hired the thief to awaken the dragon as weapon against Denmark. War between kingdoms looms.

**Grendel's Father:** Grendel's mother wasn't the only parent. His father is even worse—possibly Hrothgar himself from youthful indiscretion.

**The Final Betrayal:** In dragon battle, companions flee except one. Party must choose between pursuing cowards or dying alongside the faithful.

## Victory Conditions

**Legendary Triumph:** Defeat all three monsters, maintain honor, distribute treasure wisely, secure peace between kingdoms. Die old and full of years, songs of your deeds eternal.

**Heroic Sacrifice:** Die gloriously in final battle, securing victory through self-sacrifice. Barrow raised in your honor, name immortal.

**Peaceful Resolution:** Somehow broker peace with monsters (unlikely but possible through creative play), end blood-feuds, unite kingdoms without violence.

**Worthy Succession:** Train next generation to continue protection. Pass on glory intact. Retire having secured future.

## Defeat Conditions

**Shameful Death:** Die in cowardice, fleeing battle or breaking oaths. Name becomes curse rather than blessing.

**Broken Oaths:** Violate sacred bonds enough times. Become oath-breaker, cursed by gods, rejected by all honorable folk.

**The Curse Claims All:** Take cursed treasure and succumb to its doom. Die in madness, betraying companions, becoming monster yourself.

**Failed Protection:** Heorot falls, people slaughtered, monsters triumphant. Live in shame knowing you failed your duty.

**Forgotten:** Die without glory. No songs sung, no barrow raised, name lost to time. The ultimate defeat in this culture.
