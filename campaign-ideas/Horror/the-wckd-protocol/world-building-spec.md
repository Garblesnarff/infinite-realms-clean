### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The WCKD Protocol**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
The players wake with amnesia in the Glade—a walled area surrounded by a massive, changing maze filled with deadly Grievers. They're test subjects for WCKD, seeking a cure for the Flare (zombie plague). They must escape the maze, survive the wasteland, and choose whether WCKD's experiments are justified.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   The Solar Flares devastated Earth, triggering the Flare virus (turns humans into violent Cranks).
*   WCKD was founded to find a cure using immune children ("Munies") subjected to extreme trials.
*   The maze is the first trial—mapping it reveals an escape code.
*   Beyond lies the Scorch—a desert wasteland filled with Cranks and environmental hazards.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **WCKD (Antagonist):** Believes sacrificing immune children through deadly trials will produce a cure. Led by Ava Paige (ruthless utilitarianism).
*   **The Gladers (Player Faction):** Test subjects forming a society in the Glade. Value survival, loyalty, and eventually rebellion.
*   **The Right Arm (Resistance):** Underground movement rescuing test subjects and opposing WCKD.
*   **Cranks (Monsters):** Flare-infected humans, ranging from early-stage (still rational) to late-stage (feral zombies).

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Alby (leader), Teresa (mysterious connection), Gally (skeptic), Ava Paige (WCKD head), Jorge (wasteland guide).
*   **Tier 2/3:** Gladers (various roles: builders, cooks, runners), WCKD guards, Cranks (various infection stages).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Glade:** Fields, living quarters, the Box (elevator), surrounded by 100-foot stone walls.
*   **The Maze:** Eight sections, stone corridors, deadly Grievers at night, hidden exit code in configuration patterns.
*   **The Scorch:** Desert wasteland, ruined cities, lightning storms, Crank packs, extreme heat.
*   **WCKD Facility:** Research labs, holding cells, observation decks, cure development wing.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** party maps the maze successfully → **THEN** they find the exit code and can escape.
*   **IF** party stays in maze at night → **THEN** Grievers attack (near-certain death).
*   **IF** party trusts Teresa → **THEN** potential betrayal (she may work for WCKD unknowingly).
*   **IF** party destroys WCKD → **THEN** the cure is lost but children are freed.
*   **IF** party cooperates with WCKD → **THEN** the cure progresses but more children die in trials.
