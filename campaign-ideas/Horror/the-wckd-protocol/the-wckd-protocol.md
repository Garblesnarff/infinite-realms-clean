---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The WCKD Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Survival Mystery / Dystopian Escape / Post-Apocalyptic
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** amnesia, maze survival, conspiracy, trust issues, zombie apocalypse, escape, sacrifice, chosen one
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party wakes in the Glade—a walled enclosure surrounded by a massive, ever-changing stone maze filled with deadly biomechanical creatures called Grievers. They have no memories except their names, and mysterious supplies arrive weekly via elevator. As they map the maze and uncover clues, they discover they're test subjects for WCKD (World Catastrophe Killzone Department), an organization seeking a cure for the Flare—a zombie plague that destroyed civilization. The party must escape the maze, survive the wasteland beyond, and decide whether WCKD's experiments are salvation or atrocity.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The maze changes daily, Grievers are deadly (especially at night), resources are scarce, and trust is fragile.
*   **Investigation:** Players must piece together their purpose, map the unmappable maze, and decode WCKD's clues with fragmented memories.
*   **Consequences:** Escape requires sacrifice—someone must stay behind. The wasteland is harsh. WCKD's trials continue even after the maze.

## Story Arc

*   **Act I — The Glade (Sessions 1–4):** The party arrives with amnesia, learns the Glade's rules, explores the maze, encounters Grievers, and discovers they're test subjects.
*   **Act II — Mapping the Maze (Sessions 5–8):** The party becomes Runners, maps the maze sections, loses members to Grievers, and finds the code to escape.
*   **Act III — The Wasteland (Sessions 9–11):** The party escapes into the Scorch—a zombie-infested desert wasteland—and navigates trials toward the WCKD facility.
*   **Act IV — The Truth (Sessions 12–15):** The party infiltrates WCKD, learns they're immune to the Flare, and must choose whether to support the cure or destroy the organization.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Memory Recovery**
*   Players start with amnesia, only knowing their names.
*   **Flashbacks:** During rest or trauma, players recover memory fragments (player-created backstory revealed gradually).

### 2. **Maze Mapping**
*   The maze changes configuration daily.
*   **Mapping Mechanics:** Players must track patterns (Intelligence checks), find the code hidden in section sequences.

### 3. **Runner Endurance**
*   Exploring the maze requires stamina.
*   **Exhaustion Risk:** Staying in the maze after dark means certain death (Grievers hunt). Players must manage time/distance.

### 4. **The Flare (Zombie Infection)**
*   The Flare is a virus turning humans into aggressive Cranks.
*   **Immunity:** The party is immune (unknowingly), but NPCs are not. Bite mechanics track infection.

### 5. **WCKD Trials**
*   Even after escaping the maze, WCKD continues testing the party.
*   **Environmental Challenges:** Lightning storms, betrayals, moral tests determine who's truly viable for the cure.

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Escape and Revolution:** The party destroys WCKD and frees other test subjects, rejecting the "necessary evil" of sacrificing children.
*   **Reluctant Cooperation:** The party agrees to help develop the cure, becoming willing participants.
*   **Tragic Sacrifice:** Some party members sacrifice themselves so others can expose WCKD's atrocities.
*   **Lost in the Wasteland:** The party escapes but the world is dying—the cure may be impossible regardless.
