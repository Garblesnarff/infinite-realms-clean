# World-Building Specification Brief: See You, Space Cowboy

**Core Concept:** Players are bounty hunters on the Bebop, chasing criminals across the solar system while running from tragic pasts. Each crew member is haunted—former syndicate hitman, amnesiac woman, debt-ridden gambler, genius hacker child. They're broke, hungry, and learning that space is big but the past is inescapable. The campaign is melancholic noir—jazz soundtracks, emotional weight, and bittersweet endings.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Gate accident that destroyed Earth and forced humanity into the solar system.
*   The Red Dragon Syndicate—Mars-based crime organization controlling the underworld.
*   The ISSP (Inter Solar System Police) and bounty hunting as privatized law enforcement.
*   Hyperspace gates connecting planets and the dangers of gate travel.

**Factions:**
*   **Red Dragon Syndicate:** Crime organization, internal power struggles, Vicious stages coup.
*   **ISSP:** Solar system police, underfunded, rely on bounty hunters.
*   **Bebop Crew:** Found family of broken people, perpetually broke, excellent at their craft.

**Locations:**
*   **The Bebop:** Converted fishing vessel, cramped, always breaking, home.
*   **Mars Cities:** Neon-lit urban sprawl, jazz clubs, syndicate territory, noir aesthetics.
*   **Callisto:** Frozen Jupiter moon, isolation, where Vicious hides.
*   **Ganymede:** Ocean planet, Jet's past, betrayal location.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the main character doesn't confront Vicious, THEN the syndicate war consumes innocents and Julia dies anyway.
*   IF the crew stays together through everything, THEN they become legendary but remain poor and haunted.
*   IF Ed and Ein leave early, THEN the crew loses its heart and comedy, becoming darker.
