### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Gingerbread Grave**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When the Sugarplum Forest begins converting reality into edible nightmare where candy houses devour children and breadcrumb trails never decay, the party—investigating mass disappearances—discovers that Hansel and Gretel aren't rescued victims but immortal child-servants of Mother Sugarplum, a witch who exists as sentient hunger and transforms her victims into ingredients for an eternal feast that threatens to consume entire regions.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the witch-curse and how it transfers through consumption

    *   Write about their transformation into immortal candy children and what they lost
    *   Detail the mechanics of candy houses as living predatory architecture
    *   Explain how breadcrumb trails function as tracking and luring systems
    *   Describe the oven-baking process and why victims remain conscious
    *   Write about the Sugarplum Forest's expansion, converting normal reality into candy

**5. Location Blueprints**

*   **The First House** - Original gingerbread cottage where curse began, most dangerous candy structure
*   **The Breadcrumb Highway** - Main trail marked with imperishable breadcrumbs leading to doom
*   **The Oven Fields** - Clearing filled with iron ovens slowly baking conscious victims
*   **The Gingerbread Cathedral** - Mother Sugarplum's palace and central kitchen where all houses connect
*   **The Village of Hunger** - Border settlement losing children, parents desperate and guilt-ridden
*   **The Candy Graveyard** - Where failed ingredients are discarded, gingerbread people seeking peace
*   **The Pantry of Souls** - Storage chamber where captured essences await consumption
*   Each location represents stages of consumption and the horror of being transformed into food

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Mother Sugarplum continues feeding THEN the forest expands converting more reality to candy
*   IF Hansel and Gretel are destroyed THEN witch loses her best infiltrators but gains martyrs
*   IF cursed candy is consumed THEN addiction begins with escalating transformation effects
*   IF the breadcrumb trails are followed THEN victims are led directly to candy houses
*   IF candy houses are entered THEN escape becomes nearly impossible without magic
*   IF victims are placed in ovens THEN slow baking begins while consciousness remains
*   IF Mother Sugarplum is killed improperly THEN curse transfers to her killer
*   IF the witch-curse cycle is broken THEN all candy magic fails, potentially killing transformed victims
*   IF Hansel and Gretel are freed from service THEN they might help or seek revenge
*   IF the Oven-Born are given peace THEN sources of information and potential allies are lost
*   IF the Honey Widow's knowledge is gained THEN proper curse-breaking method is revealed
*   IF all ovens are destroyed THEN current victims die but future consumption is prevented
*   IF the Cathedral is burned THEN central nexus falls but satellite houses remain active
*   IF parents face their guilt THEN some redemption is possible and resistance strengthens
*   IF addiction spreads unchecked THEN entire communities become witch's servants
