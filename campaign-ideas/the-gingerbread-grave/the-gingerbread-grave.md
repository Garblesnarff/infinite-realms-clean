## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act descent into hunger, deception, and the horror of being consumed.

*   **Act I — The Breadcrumb Trail (Sessions 1–4):** Missing children from border villages lead the party to the Sugarplum Forest where breadcrumb trails that never decay mark paths deeper into woods. They encounter the first candy house and surviving children who seem wrong—too sweet, too helpful, eating nothing. "Hansel and Gretel" appear as helpful guides offering shelter and food. Early clues suggest the forest itself is growing, converting normal woods into edible nightmare.

*   **Act II — Houses That Hunger (Sessions 5–8):** The party discovers candy houses are alive—predatory architecture that lures victims inside before revealing true nature. Children aren't victims but collectors for the witch, immortal and unable to feel hunger or pain, desperate to remember what being human felt like. The breadcrumbs are tracking systems marking viable prey. They find the first oven-tombs where victims are slowly baked while kept conscious, their essence extracted to sustain the witch's immortality.

*   **Act III — The Sweet Mother (Sessions 9–12):** They learn the witch isn't singular but a title passed through consumption—when a witch is slain, her killer becomes the new witch inheriting hunger and knowledge. The current Mother Sugarplum has been iterating for centuries, perfecting her children-turned-servants. Hansel and Gretel tried to kill her but failed, becoming her greatest creations—immortal children who can infiltrate communities to harvest more victims. The forest grows because she's converting reality itself into her ingredient pantry.

*   **Act IV — The Final Feast (Sessions 13–16):** The party must infiltrate the Gingerbread Cathedral—Mother Sugarplum's central kitchen where all candy houses connect and all ovens lead. They discover her true plan: converting the entire region into edible reality where she can feed eternally. They face the choice of destroying her (risking becoming her replacement), freeing Hansel and Gretel (who may be too corrupted to save), burning the entire forest (killing all trapped victims), or finding a way to sever the witch-curse itself. The ovens must be shut down, the children freed or put to rest, and the hunger ended—but the cost may be becoming what they fight.

## Central Conflict

Consumption versus compassion and the corruption of survival. Mother Sugarplum represents hunger as existential force—she consumes to exist, and existence demands more consumption in endless cycle. Hansel and Gretel show how victims can become perpetrators when survival requires cooperation with horror. The party must confront whether ending hunger justifies any cost, if corrupted innocence can be redeemed, and whether breaking the cycle means perpetuating it through necessary violence. The witch-curse transfers to her killer, meaning destroying evil requires becoming evil unless another way is found.
