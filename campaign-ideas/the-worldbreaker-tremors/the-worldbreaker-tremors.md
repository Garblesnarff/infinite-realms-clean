# The Worldbreaker Tremors
*When the earth itself tears apart, where can you run?*

## Campaign Overview

The continent is dying, split from within by catastrophic seismic activity. It started six weeks ago with a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that leveled the city of Ravencrest. Since then, quakes have increased in frequency and intensity—now daily tremors shake the land, and every few days a devastating magnitude 8+ event destroys another population center. Fault lines previously unknown are opening across the continent, swallowing cities whole. Volcanoes dormant for millennia are erupting. Tsunamis devastate coastlines. The world is literally tearing itself apart.

The cause lies deep beneath the surface: an imprisoned Tarrasque-like entity called the Earthshaker is breaking free from its primordial chains. Each movement sends shockwaves through the continental plate. When it finally emerges, the entire landmass will fragment into a thousand islands—if it doesn't sink entirely beneath the waves. The party has perhaps sixty days before the final rupture.

They must navigate a world where the ground beneath your feet cannot be trusted, where yesterday's city is today's crater, where millions are displaced and social order crumbles. They must race against geological time, discover the source of the quakes, and find a way to stop the Earthshaker before it breaks the world beyond repair.

## Core Themes

- **Unstable Ground**: Nothing is permanent, safety is illusion
- **Geological Time vs. Human Time**: Racing against planet-scale disaster
- **Infrastructure Collapse**: Modern civilization depends on stability
- **Mass Displacement**: Entire populations fleeing tectonic devastation
- **Sacrifice vs. Survival**: Who gets saved when everything falls?
- **Nature's Power**: Humans are insects against planetary forces
