## Causality Chains

### Earthquake Escalation Timeline
- **20,000 Years Ago**: Earthshaker imprisoned
- **6 Weeks Ago**: Dr. Stonekeeper's deep core research damages prison accidentally
- **Week 1**: Magnitude 7.0 destroys Ravencrest
- **Week 2-4**: Daily magnitude 5-6 quakes, multiple cities damaged
- **Week 5-6**: Magnitude 8.0 destroys Stonehaven, Mount Infernus erupts
- **Campaign Start**: Pattern recognized, source investigated
- **Month 2**: Escalating quakes, social collapse, cult rises
- **Month 3**: Magnitude 9.0+ events, continental fracturing begins
- **Final Week**: Earthshaker breaks free, world-ending quakes
- **Resolution**: Party's choice determines final outcome

### Social Collapse Progression
1. **Disaster Response**: Government coordinates rescue
2. **Refugee Crisis**: Millions displaced, cities overcrowded
3. **Resource Depletion**: Food, water, medicine scarce
4. **Authority Breakdown**: Government overwhelmed, military takes over
5. **Factional Conflict**: Cult vs. Military vs. Civilians
6. **Total Chaos**: Every faction for themselves, apocalypse

### Geological Progression
1. **Initial Quakes**: Localized destruction
2. **Fault Activation**: Multiple fault lines wake
3. **Volcanic Activity**: Dormant volcanoes erupt
4. **Continental Stress**: Entire tectonic plate destabilizing
5. **The Fracturing**: Landmass begins splitting
6. **New Geography**: Islands form, mountains rise, valleys sink

## Additional Lore

### The Truth About the Earthshaker
- **Nature**: Primordial embodiment of geological forces
- **Purpose**: Meant to shape continents, create mountains, renew earth
- **Crime**: Refused to destroy surface life when ordered by ancient civilization
- **Imprisonment**: Bound in planetary core, forgotten for 20,000 years
- **Current State**: Awakening, unaware surface is inhabited now
- **Morality**: Not evil, just incomprehensibly powerful and alien

### Dr. Stonekeeper's Guilt
Her deep-core magical drilling project (seeking geothermal energy) accidentally damaged Earthshaker's prison. She didn't know it existed. Now millions are dying because of her research. She will sacrifice herself if it helps fix what she broke.

### Terra's Philosophy
The cult leader isn't insane. She argues: Current civilization is built on unstable foundation (literally and metaphorically). Earthquakes reveal truth—nothing lasts. Better to embrace renewal than cling to dying world. Earthshaker will reshape reality into something more honest. She's wrong about the cost but not entirely wrong about the criticism.

### The Dwarven Perspective
Ancient dwarves built the prison. They knew Earthshaker wasn't evil but deemed it too dangerous for surface world. They paid terrible price—entire generation sacrificed to power binding. Modern dwarves inherit guilt and responsibility. Dr. Stonekeeper represents this burden.

### Possible Endings

**The New Prison**: Earthshaker bound in improved prison with its cooperation, understands surface life now
**The Guardian**: Party member becomes eternal warden, merges with binding magic
**The Departure**: Earthshaker leaves to Elemental Plane peacefully
**The Death**: Titan killed, massive geological consequences but world survives
**The Shattering**: Total failure, continent becomes archipelago
**The Tyranny**: Military controls Earthshaker, uses as weapon
