## The Flavorless Void - Complete Truth

### Origin Story
- Created by ancient civilization
- Tried to eliminate suffering by removing sensation
- Succeeded too well
- Now: Entity with own consciousness
- Believes tastelessness is kindness

### Philosophy
- "Flavor causes desire"
- "Desire causes suffering"
- "Remove flavor, remove suffering"
- "Peaceful nothingness better than painful sensation"
- Not entirely wrong

### The Void's Realm
- Everything is nutritionally perfect
- No hunger, no want, no need
- Also: No joy, no love, no life
- Citizens are content but empty
- Seductively peaceful

### Void's Agents
- Former flavor-mages who burned out
- Those who suffered too much
- Seeking peace through blandness
- Not evil, just defeated
- Can be saved through hope

### The Truth About the Void
- Sixth "flavor": Absence
- Actually necessary for contrast
- Without Void, flavors meaningless
- Must exist but not dominate
- Balance requires the Void too

## The Blandening - World Crisis

### Progression
**Week 1-10**: Subtle taste changes
- Food slightly less flavorful
- Magic slightly weaker
- Most don't notice yet

**Week 11-20**: Obvious decline
- Meals tasteless
- Magic failing
- Panic begins

**Week 21-30**: Critical state
- Only Divine-blessed food has flavor
- Magic only works for adepts
- Society collapsing

**Final Weeks**: Point of no return
- Total flavor loss incoming
- Magic gone for most
- Party must act now

### Regional Effects
- Sweet loss: Healers powerless
- Salty loss: Nothing preserves, decay accelerates
- Sour loss: Change becomes impossible, stagnation
- Bitter loss: Truth obscured, wisdom fades
- Umami loss: Nothing satisfies, eternal hunger

### Reversing the Blandening
- Each freed Palate restores 20% flavor
- All five = 100% restoration
- But some damage permanent
- Memories of blandness linger
- Society forever changed

## Character Transformation

### Physical Changes
