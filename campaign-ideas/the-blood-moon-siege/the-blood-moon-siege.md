The party awakens in a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by the undead. Every seven days, the Blood Moon rises, and hordes of increasingly powerful zombies descend upon their location, guided by an unholy instinct to destroy the living. To survive, the party must scavenge for resources, fortify a base with traps and defenses, and prepare for each escalating siege.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-14 sessions)

A cyclical escalation of horde defenses, building to a final siege.

*   **Act I — The First Blood Moons (Levels 3–6):** The party scavenges a small town, establishing a fortified base in a defensible building (a police station, a fire house). They experience their first three Blood Moons, learning the mechanics of horde defense. Each Blood Moon, the zombies grow stronger, smarter, and more numerous. They meet other survivors and learn of Dr. Harrow at the Military Compound, who claims to have a cure. To reach him, they must survive seven Blood Moons and cross the wasteland.
*   **Act II — The Journey (Levels 7–9):** The party decides to move from their initial base toward the Military Compound. This means abandoning their established defenses and facing Blood Moons in less secure locations (forests, abandoned factories). They must scavenge resources on the move, deal with special zombie types (Ferals, Screamers, Demolishers), and defend temporary bases. They encounter hostile survivor groups who would rather raid than cooperate.
*   **Act III — The Seventh Blood Moon (Levels 10–11):** The party reaches the Military Compound. Dr. Harrow reveals the truth: the cure exists, but creating it requires a rare fungal sample from the heart of a zombie-infested research facility. The party must retrieve it and return to the Compound before the Seventh Blood Moon. The final session is the most intense siege yet: wave after wave of zombies, including a Zombie Overlord, assault the Compound. Victory means crafting the cure and beginning the long work of reclaiming the world.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "Scavenge and Fortify"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Base Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens in a ransacked convenience store. The world is eerily quiet, but signs of the undead are everywhere (corpses, blood, shambling figures in the distance).
    *   They must scavenge the town for supplies: food, water, tools, weapons, and building materials (wood, metal).
    *   They locate a defensible building (a two-story police station) and begin fortifying it: barricading windows, setting traps, and creating choke points.
    *   They craft basic weapons (spiked clubs, bows, molotov cocktails) and prepare for the first Blood Moon in 7 days.
**Escalation:** A random zombie horde (not a Blood Moon) stumbles upon the party while they're scavenging. They must fight or flee.

### Sessions 2-4 — "The First Blood Moon"
*   **Focus:** Horde Defense / Escalation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party spends the next in-game days scavenging, crafting, and fortifying. They must also manage hunger, thirst, and potential infections.
    *   On Day 7, as night falls, the sky turns blood red. The first Blood Moon horde arrives: dozens of zombies, all converging on the party's base.
    *   The zombies are relentless, clawing through barriers, triggering traps, and trying to overwhelm defenses.
    *   The party must defend using crafted weapons, traps (spike pits, barbed wire, electric fences if they have the resources), and teamwork.
**Escalation:** If the party's defenses fail, zombies breach the base. The party must fall back to a second defensive line or risk a total wipe.

### Sessions 5-7 — "The Second & Third Blood Moons"
*   **Focus:** Resource Management / Increasing Difficulty
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party scavenges further from the base, exploring a hospital, a hardware store, and a grocery warehouse. They find better gear (firearms, explosives, armor).
    *   They meet another group of survivors, the Iron Haven faction, who offer an alliance or rivalry.
    *   The second Blood Moon (Day 14) brings tougher zombies (Feral Zombies—faster, more aggressive) and more numbers.
    *   The third Blood Moon (Day 21) introduces special zombies (Screamers—call more hordes, Demolishers—destroy defenses).
**Escalation:** The Iron Haven faction is wiped out during the third Blood Moon because they refused to fortify properly. The party witnesses the aftermath.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Dr. Marcus Harrow** — *The Scientist*
    *   **Role:** A brilliant researcher at the Military Compound who claims to have developed a cure for the zombie plague.
    *   **Personality:** Obsessive, morally gray, and desperate. He has sacrificed much—including other survivors—in his quest for the cure.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The cure requires living test subjects. He has been luring survivors to the Compound under false pretenses, using them as guinea pigs. The party must decide if the ends justify the means.

2.  **Commander Sarah Kane** — *The Warlord*
    *   **Role:** The leader of the Iron Haven faction, a fortified settlement of survivors.
    *   **Personality:** Pragmatic, authoritative, and protective of her people. She distrusts outsiders but respects strength.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She knows the Military Compound's location but won't share it unless the party proves their worth. Her settlement is eventually overrun, and she may join the party as a lone survivor.

3.  **The Zombie Overlord** — *The Final Boss*
    *   **Role:** A massive, mutated zombie that leads the Seventh Blood Moon horde. It is intelligent and strategic.
    *   **Personality:** Malevolent and commanding. It directs other zombies, using tactics instead of mindless aggression.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It was once Dr. Harrow's research partner, infected and transformed by an experimental serum. It seeks to destroy the Compound and Harrow as revenge.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about preparation, escalation, and survival against overwhelming odds. It captures the core loop of *7 Days to Die*: scavenge, craft, fortify, and defend. The central conflict is the party's race against time and the escalating Blood Moons. Every seven days, the stakes get higher, the zombies get deadlier, and the party must adapt or perish. The ultimate choice is whether to trust Dr. Harrow and risk everything for a cure, or survive indefinitely in a world of endless Blood Moons.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Blood Moon Cycle**
*   Every 7 in-game days, a Blood Moon occurs at night. The sky turns blood red, and a massive zombie horde attacks the party's current location.
*   Each Blood Moon is progressively harder:
    *   **1st Moon:** Basic zombies, moderate numbers.
    *   **2nd Moon:** Feral Zombies (faster, more HP), larger numbers.
    *   **3rd Moon:** Screamers (call reinforcements), Demolishers (destroy defenses).
    *   **7th Moon:** The Zombie Overlord leads the horde (hundreds of zombies, multiple special types).

### 2. **Base Fortification**
*   The party must build and upgrade defenses between Blood Moons:
    *   **Barriers:** Wood walls (weak), stone walls (medium), reinforced metal (strong).
    *   **Traps:** Spike pits, barbed wire, landmines, electric fences, dart traps.
    *   **Choke Points:** Funnel zombies into kill zones with narrow hallways or doorways.
*   Defenses degrade during sieges and must be repaired.

### 3. **Scavenging & Crafting**
*   Resources are found by looting buildings, breaking down furniture, and mining (stone, metal).
*   Key crafted items: Weapons (clubs, bows, firearms, explosives), Armor (cloth, leather, metal), Tools (axes, picks, shovels), Traps.
*   Rare resources (explosives, advanced electronics) are found in high-risk locations (military bases, labs).

### 4. **Zombie Types**
*   **Basic Zombies:** Slow, weak, but numerous.
*   **Feral Zombies:** Fast, aggressive, higher HP. Appear from Blood Moon 2 onward.
*   **Screamers:** Emit a scream that summons more zombies. Priority targets.
*   **Demolishers:** Massive zombies with explosive weak points. They destroy walls and defenses.
*   **The Zombie Overlord:** The intelligent leader of the final horde, with massive HP and unique abilities.

### 5. **Infection & Health**
*   Zombie attacks can cause infection. Without proper medicine, infection leads to death and turning.
*   Health is managed through food, water, and medical supplies (bandages, antibiotics, painkillers).
