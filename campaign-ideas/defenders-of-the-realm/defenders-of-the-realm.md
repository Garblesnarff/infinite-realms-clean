## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Defenders of the Realm
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Alien Invasion Defense / Military Tactics / Survival Horror
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 25-30 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **15-18**
**Tone (keywords):** desperate, tactical, permadeath stakes, escalating threat, hope against overwhelming odds, sacrifice
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
When extraplanar entities known as the Void-Touched begin abducting citizens and raiding settlements across the realm, a secret coalition forms the Defenders Initiative—an elite force tasked with repelling the invasion. The party serves as a strike team conducting guerrilla operations against superior alien technology, rescuing captured civilians, researching enemy capabilities, and upgrading their base of operations. Every mission carries lethal risk, fallen comrades are permanent losses, and the invaders grow stronger with each passing month, but humanity's last hope lies in the Defenders' ability to turn captured technology against the enemy and ultimately strike at the alien command ship.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-30 sessions)

A three-act arc of survival, adaptation, and ultimately taking the fight to the enemy.

*   **Act I — First Contact (Sessions 1-10):** The Void-Touched invasion begins with abductions and terror attacks. The party joins the newly formed Defenders Initiative, conducting desperate missions with basic equipment against technologically superior foes. They establish their hidden base, the Crucible, and begin researching alien corpses and technology. Early missions focus on survival, rescue operations, and learning enemy patterns. The first soldier death reminds them of the stakes.
*   **Act II — Turning the Tide (Sessions 11-20):** With captured alien weapons and armor, the Defenders begin evening the odds. The party conducts raids on alien facilities, interrogates captured operatives, and discovers the invasion's true scope—a galactic empire harvesting worlds. They face new enemy types with terrifying abilities. Base expansion allows psionic training and advanced weaponry. A infiltrated alien facility reveals the location of the command ship. Political tensions threaten to shut down the Defenders.
*   **Act III — The Final Assault (Sessions 21-30):** The Defenders launch Operation Final Dawn—a desperate assault on the command ship in orbit. The party must fight through alien defenses, disable the ship's weapons, and confront the Ethereal Overminds controlling the invasion. Casualties mount as they face the enemy's most powerful units. The fate of the world hangs on their success. The climax involves choosing between destroying the ship or capturing its technology to defend against future threats, with consequences for both choices.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival against impossible odds, the cost of war and permadeath, adapting enemy technology to fight back, and maintaining humanity when facing inhuman foes. It asks: How far will you go to save your world? Is sacrificing individuals justified to save the many? Can you become the enemy you fight without losing yourself? The central conflict pits the party's determination to defend their world against an alien collective that views them as genetic resources or potential partners in evolution.

*   Emotional weight: maintaining connections despite inevitable losses

### 2. **The Crucible (Base Management)**
*   Party makes strategic decisions about base construction between missions
*   Build facilities: Research Lab, Workshop, Psionic Training, Medical Bay, Power Generators
