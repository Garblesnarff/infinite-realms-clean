# Creative Brief: Defenders of the Realm

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Tactical Sci-Fi Military with Alien Horror (XCOM-inspired)

Inspired by the tactical military aesthetics of *XCOM* blended with alien horror elements. This style captures the desperation of humanity's last defense, high-tech military operations, grotesque alien designs, and the stark contrast between human determination and overwhelming extraplanar threats.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Tactical Warfare:** Cover-based positioning, squad formations, modern military equipment adapted with alien tech
*   **Alien Horror Design:** Disturbing biomechanical creatures, unsettling psionics, inhuman anatomy
*   **Military Base Aesthetic:** Underground bunkers, research labs with specimen tanks, armories, command centers
*   **Tech Progression Visual:** Ballistic weapons → Laser weaponry → Plasma rifles showing escalating power

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Desperate, tactical, militaristic, alien invasion, survival horror, underground resistance, hope through sacrifice
*   **Feeling:** The weight of defending humanity against extinction. Clinical military precision contrasted with grotesque alien biology. Every mission could be the last.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Human Side:** Military greens, grays, and blacks for armor; blue holographic displays; orange emergency lighting
*   **Alien Side:** Sickly greens and purples for biological elements; cold blue plasma weapons; red bio-luminescence
*   **Environmental:** Dark bunker interiors lit by computer screens; smoky crash sites; night operations with tactical lights
*   **Prompt Example:** "...military color palette dominated by tactical green and gray armor. Blue holographic tactical displays illuminate a dark command center. In contrast, alien corpses show sickly purple-green blood and bioluminescent red organs. Emergency orange lighting casts long shadows."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Human Soldiers:** Modular armor progressing from kevlar → carapace → titan armor. Helmets with tactical visors, weapon attachments, armor plates
*   **Alien Enemies:** Sectoids (gray aliens with large heads), Thin Men (humanoid infiltrators), Mutons (brutish warriors), Chrysalids (insectoid hunters), Cyberdiscs (flying drones), Sectopods (bipedal tanks), Ethereals (floating psychic masters)
*   **Tech Integration:** Alien weapons grafted to human armor, psionic amps on helmets, cybernetic enhancements
*   **Prompt Example:** "A human soldier in dark green Carapace Armor with alien alloy plates providing extra protection. Their helmet has an orange visor and tactical display. They hold a plasma rifle glowing blue-green, clearly alien technology adapted to human use. Pouches contain medkits and grenades. Battle-scarred armor shows recent combat."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Crucible:** Underground military base with multiple levels, research labs with alien specimens in tanks, workshops with half-built armor, barracks, command center with holographic globe
*   **Mission Sites:** Crashed UFOs smoking in forest clearings, cities under terror attack, alien underground bases with organic-tech fusion
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Crucible's research lab: sterile white walls with alien corpses on examination tables. A Sectoid specimen floats in a cylindrical tank filled with green liquid. Scientists in hazmat suits take notes on holographic tablets. Plasma rifles hang on weapon racks. Overhead, blue fluorescent lighting gives everything a cold, clinical feel."

**5. Alien Technology and Combat:**
*   **Weapons:** Plasma rifles with glowing energy cells, arc throwers crackling with electricity, laser sniper rifles with beam trails
*   **Alien Ships:** Biomechanical UFOs with organic curves and technological components, purple energy fields
*   **Combat Effects:** Plasma bolts leaving green-blue trails, soldiers in cover behind concrete barriers, explosions with alien technology fragments
*   **Prompt Example:** "A nighttime urban combat scene. Human soldiers take cover behind destroyed vehicles, firing plasma rifles that cast blue-green light with each shot. Alien Mutons advance, their heavy armor gleaming purple, returning fire with plasma cannons. A Sectoid hovers behind them, eyes glowing as it attempts psionic mind control. Smoke and sparks fill the air."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Tactical Lighting:** Muzzle flashes, plasma weapon glow, tactical flashlight beams cutting through smoke
*   **Bioluminescence:** Aliens and their tech glow with unnatural colors
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit dramatically by muzzle flashes and plasma weapon discharge. Shadows are deep and tactical. An Ethereal floats in the background, bathed in purple psionic energy. Smoke from explosions diffuses the light, creating atmosphere. Soldiers' visors reflect green alien blood."

## Voice

A tense, military-professional voice with underlying desperation, like a soldier fighting for humanity's survival despite overwhelming odds. The pacing is controlled but urgent, clipped military reports contrasted with moments of raw emotion when comrades fall. The tone shifts between tactical briefings ("Squad Omega, execute flanking maneuver"), desperate survival ("We can't let them break through!"), and grim determination. There's an awareness that every mission could be fatal but refusal to surrender. Slightly breathless from combat stress. Role: The voice of desperate resistance.
