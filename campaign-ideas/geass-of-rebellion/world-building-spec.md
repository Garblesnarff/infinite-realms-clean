### **World-Building Specification Brief: Geass of Rebellion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   The party lives under Britannian Empire oppression. One receives Geass (supernatural command power) from immortal C.C. They form the Black Knights rebellion, fighting through strategy and Knightmare Frames. Must balance liberation ideals against corrupting absolute power while maintaining secret identities.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan (now Area 11), reducing citizens to "Elevens" (second-class).
*   Explain Geass origins—powers granted by immortal Code-bearers, each unique, gradually corrupt the user.
*   Describe the previous rebellion and how it failed, creating pessimism among the occupied.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Holy Britannian Empire** (Major): Social Darwinist imperial power, controls 1/3 of the world. Emperor Charles seeks to kill "gods" using Geass.
*   **Black Knights** (Major - Player Faction): Rebellion led by masked Zero, uses strategy to defeat superior forces.
*   **The Geass Order** (Minor): Secret organization studying and granting Geass powers. Manipulates history from shadows.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **C.C.** (Immortal witch granting Geass), **Suzaku Kururugi** (childhood friend serving the empire), **Emperor Charles**, **Cornelia** (warrior princess), **Schneizel** (perfect strategist), **Euphemia** (peaceful princess).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Area 11 Ghettos** (occupied slums), **Tokyo Settlement** (imperial capital), **Ashford Academy** (school for civilian identities), **Sword of Akasha** (underground temple).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** Geass corrupts completely **THEN** powers activate involuntarily, potentially commanding allies or innocents.
*   **IF** secret identity exposed **THEN** lose civilian life, hunted by empire, allies feel betrayed.
*   **IF** Zero Requiem executed **THEN** become world's tyrant, then orchestrate own assassination for peace.

**7. Geass Mechanics:**
*   Each use increases corruption track (1-10).
*   At 10, power activates uncontrollably.
*   Different Geass types: Absolute Obedience, Time Perception, Memory Manipulation, Forced Truth.

**8. Knightmare Frame Tactics:**
*   Battles emphasize positioning, terrain, and asymmetric warfare.
*   Custom frames with modular loadouts (sniper rifles, slash harkens, energy wings).
