**Campaign Type / Genre:** Roguelike Deck-Building / Strategic Card Combat / Tower Ascension
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions

**Tone (keywords):** strategic, risk-reward, deck-building, roguelike loops, mysterious tower, ascending difficulty, tactical combat
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party stands before the Spire—an impossibly tall tower that warps reality and challenges all who enter with card-based trials. Each ascent is unique: choose paths, build decks from discovered cards, face randomized encounters, and adapt strategies based on what relics and cards you find. Death sends you back to the base, but knowledge of enemy patterns and synergies persists. Through countless runs, escalating difficulty via Ascension levels, and strategic deck-building, the party must reach the top and defeat the corrupt heart that pulses at the Spire's summit.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A repeating ascension structure where each run teaches strategy until final victory.

*   **Act I — Learning the Spire (Sessions 1-7):** The party enters the Spire for the first time, discovering it runs on card-based reality. Combat is resolved through playing cards drawn from personal decks. The first act (floors 1-17) introduces basic enemies, shops, events, and elites. Early runs end in defeat, teaching enemy patterns and card synergies. The party learns that deck-building is about removal as much as addition—bloated decks are death. They unlock new cards and relics between runs. Boss fights at floor 17 teach that preparation and strategy matter more than power. Three bosses rotate randomly: Hexaghost (burning attacks), Slime Boss (splits when hit), Guardian (artifact defense).
*   **Act II — The Mid-Spire Gauntlet (Sessions 8-14):** Ascensions past floor 17 enter Act II (floors 18-34), where enemies hit harder and have complex patterns. Multi-enemy fights require AOE cards. Events offer risky rewards: curse your deck for power, sacrifice HP for relics, gamble gold. Shops become crucial for removing bad cards and finding essential upgrades. Elite enemies are devastating but drop rare relics. Boss fights rotate: Automaton (hyper beam), Champ (buff-stacking warrior), Collector (summons minions). The party discovers the Spire is sentient—testing climbers for worthiness.
*   **Act III — The Summit and Heart (Sessions 15-20):** Act III (floors 35-51) features brutal enemy combinations. Every card and relic matters. Shops offer final optimizations. The Act III bosses test complete strategies: Awakened One (punishes powers), Time Eater (punishes too many cards per turn), Donu & Deca (duo bosses requiring split focus). Defeating Act III unlocks the true challenge: The Heart—a corrupted entity at the Spire's core requiring elite-tier deck optimization and three keys collected during the run. The Heart tests whether you merely reached the top or truly mastered the Spire. Victory means understanding that the Spire is eternal—your triumph inspires others, but the challenge continues.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of strategic thinking, adaptation to randomness, mastery through repetition, risk management, and building coherent strategies from chaos. It asks: Can you adapt to whatever the Spire offers? When is perfection the enemy of progress? How do you balance greed and safety? The central conflict is mastering deck-building strategy within roguelike randomness.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Card-Based Combat**
*   All combat resolved through playing cards from hand
*   Draw cards each turn, play using energy (3 base, can increase)
*   Attack cards deal damage, Skill cards provide utility/defense, Power cards are permanent buffs
*   Enemies show intent icons: attacking, defending, buffing, debuffing
*   Strategy: Manage hand, predict enemy actions, survive while dealing damage

### 2. **Deck-Building**
*   Start with 10-card basic deck
*   After combat: choose 1 of 3 cards to add or skip
*   Key insight: Removing bad cards as important as adding good ones
*   Thin decks see best cards more often
*   Focused strategy better than "good stuff" pile
*   Deck size sweet spot: 20-30 cards typically

### 3. **Path Selection**
*   Choose path through each act via branching map
*   Node types: Combat (guaranteed card reward), Elite (hard fight, rare relic), Shop, Rest Site (heal or upgrade), Event, Boss
*   Risk vs. reward: Elites drop best relics but can end run
*   Multiple paths to top—different strategies suit different routes

### 4. **Energy and Relic System**
*   Energy is action resource (3 per turn base)
*   Relics are permanent passive effects: more energy, extra draw, HP bonuses, synergy enablers
*   Boss relics are powerful but often have downsides
*   Building around relics is key strategy

### 5. **Three Character Classes**
*   **Ironclad:** Strength scaling, exhaust mechanics, self-damage synergies
*   **Silent:** Poison, card draw, discard mechanics, 0-cost spam
*   **Defect:** Orbs (passive effects), focus scaling, powers
*   Each class has 75 unique cards—vastly different strategies

### 6. **Ascension Levels**
*   After victory, unlock Ascension 1-20 difficulty modifiers
*   Each level adds new challenge: enemies stronger, elites harder, bosses have new moves
*   Ascension 20 is brutal—for true mastery
*   Provides long-term replay value and difficulty scaling

### 7. **Permanent Unlocks**
*   Unlock new cards and relics by playing and achieving milestones
*   Each run contributes to overall progress
*   Knowledge of synergies persists—meta-progression is understanding

### 8. **Event Choices**
*   Events offer risk/reward: Take curse for power relic? Lose HP for gold? Gamble?
*   Some events can devastate run, others can save it
*   Learning event outcomes is part of mastery
*   Risk management is core skill

### 9. **Potions**
*   Find/buy limited-use powerful effects
*   Can turn tide of difficult fights
*   Limited inventory—when to use is strategic
*   Some builds generate potions (Alchemize skill)

### 10. **Synergy Building**
*   Success requires cards working together
*   Poison builds need applying and scaling poison
*   Strength builds need strength gain and multi-hit attacks
*   Defect orb builds need focus and orb slots
*   Finding synergies from random offerings is the puzzle
