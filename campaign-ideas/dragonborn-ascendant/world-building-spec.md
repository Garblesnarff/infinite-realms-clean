Ancient dragons have returned led by Alduin the World-Eater, prophesied to devour the world. Meanwhile, Skyrim is torn by civil war between Imperials and Stormcloaks. The party must master the Way of the Voice, choose sides, and ultimately travel to the afterlife to face Alduin and prevent the apocalypse.

*   **IF:** Party joins Imperials → **THEN:** Stormcloak holds become hostile, unity preserved, but Talos worship remains banned.
*   **IF:** Party kills Paarthurnax → **THEN:** Greybeards refuse further training, Blades are pleased, moral cost.
*   **IF:** Party negotiates peace → **THEN:** Temporary truce during dragon crisis, but war resumes after.
*   **IF:** Party absorbs dragon soul → **THEN:** Can unlock new Shout words, becomes more powerful.
*   **IF:** Alduin is defeated → **THEN:** Dragons scatter without leadership, world saved from prophesied end.
