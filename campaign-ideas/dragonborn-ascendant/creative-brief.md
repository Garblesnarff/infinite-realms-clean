# Creative Brief: Dragonborn Ascendant

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Nordic Epic Fantasy with Scandinavian Grandeur (Skyrim-inspired)

Inspired by the sweeping Nordic aesthetics of *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* with Viking and Scandinavian influences. This style captures the rugged beauty of northern landscapes, dragon-age mythology, ancient Nordic architecture, and the contrast between civilization and untamed wilderness.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale & Landscape:** Massive mountains, sweeping tundras, ancient ruins against vast skies
*   **Nordic Architecture:** Longhouses, stone circles, carved dragon motifs, timber and stone construction
*   **Dragon Majesty:** Dragons as apex creatures—massive, terrifying, majestic, elemental breath
*   **Weather Dominance:** Snow, blizzards, aurora borealis, dramatic skies crucial to atmosphere

Below, a Dragonborn warrior raises their hands, unleashing Unrelenting Force (Fus Ro Dah)—visible as blue-white force waves colliding with the fire breath. Snow and debris blown away by the shockwave. Epic sense of scale and power."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**

Long shadows stretch across the snow. The scene has cold, crisp lighting with high contrast between the aurora's glow and deep shadows. Stars visible in clear patches of sky."

## Voice

A determined, resonant voice that carries the weight of prophecy and Nordic warrior culture. Speaks with authority when using Thu'um—words that shake the earth. Shifts between battle-hardened warrior and someone awed by ancient dragon lore. Occasional use of Nordic phrases. The tone is heroic but grounded, epic but personal. Role: The voice of destiny calling and the hero answering.
