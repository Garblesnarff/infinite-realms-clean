# The Tomb of Eternal Dominion

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Dark Fantasy / Conquest / Villain Protagonist
- **Estimated Length**: 8 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-15
- **Tone**: Dark, Strategic, Morally Ambiguous, Epic

### Core Premise
The players awaken as powerful undead beings in the Great Tomb of Nazarick, an impossibly vast underground fortress filled with deadly traps, powerful servants, and unimaginable treasures. They were once adventurers in a different world, but now find themselves as supreme overlords served by fanatically loyal NPCs they once created. As they explore their new reality and test their godlike powers, they must decide: Will they conquer this new world, seek to understand it, or find a way home? Their loyal servants expect nothing less than absolute dominion.

### Difficulty Context: **Hard**
This campaign features complex moral choices, strategic planning, and combat against high-level opponents. Players must manage their reputation, balance ruthless efficiency with mercy, and make decisions with far-reaching consequences.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Awakening and Exploration (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players awaken in their throne room, discovering they've been transformed into powerful undead beings. They explore the vast tomb, meeting their loyal NPC servants who treat them as absolute deities. They test their new abilities, establish control over their domain, and begin scouting the new world beyond their walls.

**Act 2: Building the Empire (Sessions 4-6)**
- The players make their first forays into the outside world, a medieval fantasy realm where they are far more powerful than average inhabitants. They must decide how to interact with nearby villages, kingdoms, and adventuring parties. Do they rule openly or from the shadows? Each choice shapes their emerging empire and their servants' understanding of their will.

**Act 3: The Supreme Challenge (Sessions 7-8)**
- The players' actions have drawn the attention of powerful forces: a coalition of kingdoms, legendary heroes, or entities that might rival even their power. They must defend the tomb, make final decisions about their role in this world, and confront the question of whether godlike power comes with godlike responsibility.

### Key Locations

- **The Great Tomb of Nazarick**: Massive ten-level underground dungeon-fortress. Each level has unique theme and guardians. Contains impossible wealth, powerful artifacts, and loyal servants. The ultimate defensive position.

- **The Throne Room of Kings**: The players' seat of power, a vast hall of dark grandeur. Radiates an aura of absolute authority. Where major decisions are made and servants receive commands.

- **The Treasury**: Vault containing artifacts of world-ending power, gold beyond measure, and items from the players' former game world. Guarded by the most loyal servants.

- **The Village of Carne**: Small frontier village that becomes the players' first contact with the outside world. Its fate reflects the players' philosophy of rulership.

- **E-Rantel**: Fortress city on the border of three nations. Hub of adventurers and trade. Strategic location for establishing influence or gathering information.

- **The Katze Plains**: Vast grassland between kingdoms. Site of traditional battles. Perfect location for displaying overwhelming military might.

### Central Conflict
The fundamental tension between godlike power and the responsibility that comes with it. The players can do almost anything - but should they? Their servants expect cruelty and dominion; the world's innocents deserve mercy. Every decision shapes not just the world, but the players' own souls. The campaign explores whether absolute power corrupts absolutely, or whether even dark lords can choose to be something more.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Overlord's Authority**: Players can spend Command Points (starting with 3 per session, refreshing daily) to automatically succeed on Intimidation, Persuasion (when threatening), or commanding NPCs from Nazarick. This represents their absolute authority but encourages strategic use. Floor Guardians will fulfill commands perfectly but interpret them based on their own moral alignment.

- **World-Class Items**: The players possess 3-5 artifacts of reality-bending power. Each can be used once per campaign for effects like: automatically win any battle, reshape terrain, resurrect fallen allies, or alter memories of entire populations. Using these items draws unwanted attention from cosmic forces. Players must decide when the stakes justify risking discovery.

- **Loyalty vs. Morality**: Track two separate meters: Guardian Loyalty (how devoted servants are) and Moral Balance (whether players are becoming true monsters). High Loyalty gives bonuses to servant actions but may require cruel decisions. High Morality allows certain redemption options but may confuse servants. The two often conflict, creating difficult choices.

- **Strategic Conquest**: Between sessions, players can allocate Guardian actions to: gather intelligence (reveals plot hooks), acquire resources (gain gold/magic items), spread influence (improve reputation with factions), or research threats (learn enemy capabilities). This creates a sense of running an evil organization and provides agency between sessions.
