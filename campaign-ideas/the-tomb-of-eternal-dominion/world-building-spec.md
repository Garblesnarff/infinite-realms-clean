Finding themselves in a new world with godlike power, they must decide how to use their dominion. Will they conquer ruthlessly, rule benevolently, or seek understanding? Their servants expect absolute supremacy, but the players' moral choices will define what kind of overlords they become and shape the fate of this world.
