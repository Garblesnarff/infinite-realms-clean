# Creative Brief: The Ymbryne Loop

## Art Style: Gothic Victorian Horror Meets Vintage Photography (Miss Peregrine's meets Tim Burton)

Blends sepia-toned vintage photography aesthetics with gothic horror, peculiar abilities, and time-displaced settings.

### Core Principles:
*   **Vintage Photograph Aesthetic:** Sepia tones, slight grain, old-fashioned clothing frozen in time loops.
*   **Gothic Architecture:** Crumbling Victorian mansions, Welsh island ruins, fog and decay.
*   **Peculiar Visual Effects:** Powers manifest in slightly unnatural ways (fire that doesn't burn cloth, invisible girl's clothes floating, levitation with lead shoes).

### Color Palette:
*   **Time Loops (1940s):** Sepia tones, muted colors, vintage clothing (browns, grays, navy), aged quality.
*   **Hollowgasts:** Invisible to most, but when visible: pale white skin, massive tentacle tongues, skeletal forms.
*   **Modern World:** Full color, contemporary, clashes with loop aesthetics when transitioning.
*   **Peculiar Powers:** Each power has a signature color (fire-orange, plant-green, etc.) that glows faintly.

### Character Design:
*   **Peculiars:** Wearing 1940s clothing (suits, dresses, practical wartime attire), ages frozen in loops (many appear as children despite being decades old).
*   **Emma:** Blonde, wearing a dress and heavy lead shoes, fire flickering in her hands without burning her.
*   **Miss Peregrine:** Stern woman in Victorian dress, can shift into a peregrine falcon (mid-transformation shows partial feathers).
*   **Hollowgasts:** When visible—gaunt, pale, eyeless faces, massive extending tentacle tongues with teeth, horrifying.
*   **Wights:** Normal-looking humans but with completely white eyes (no pupils or irises), unsettling.

### Voice:
British (Welsh accent for islanders, refined British for Ymbrynes), children and teens despite decades alive. Shifts between wonder (peculiar powers) and terror (Hollowgasts). Role: Narrating life in a time loop and peculiar abilities.
