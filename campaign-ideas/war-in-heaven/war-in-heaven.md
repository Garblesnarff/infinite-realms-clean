The party plays as angels during the War in Heaven, witnessing Lucifer Morningstar's rebellion against the Throne of God. They must choose sides in a cosmic conflict where loyalty to divine authority battles against individual freedom and pride. Whether they remain loyal to Heaven, join Lucifer's rebellion, or seek a third path, they will participate in the greatest battle existence has ever known—one that reshapes the cosmos and creates Hell itself.

## What "Very High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Cosmic Scale Combat:** Battles involve legions of angels, divine weapons, and reality-warping powers.
*   **Philosophical Weight:** Every choice has theological implications. The campaign explores free will, obedience, justice, mercy, pride, and what makes a being good or evil.
*   **No Clear Right Answer:** Both sides have compelling arguments. The party must wrestle with genuine moral complexity.
*   **Mythic Power:** Players wield divine abilities but face enemies of equal might.
*   **Tragedy is Inevitable:** Regardless of choice, friends will become enemies, paradise will be lost, and innocence will end.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Throne of Light:** The center of Heaven where divine authority resides.
2.  **The Fields of Heaven:** Paradisiacal landscapes where angels dwell before war.
3.  **The Void:** The space between creation and non-being where cosmic battles occur.
4.  **Pandemonium:** The fortress Lucifer builds during rebellion, becomes the capital of Hell.
5.  **The Abyss:** Where the defeated are cast down, transforming into Hell.

## Central Conflict

Obedience versus freedom, order versus autonomy, perfection versus the right to choose imperfection. Lucifer argues that true virtue requires free choice, that blind obedience is slavery, and that hierarchy based on might rather than merit is tyranny. Heaven argues that divine order is perfect, that obedience to the good is freedom, and that pride in one's own judgment over infinite wisdom is the ultimate sin. The party must decide which philosophy they embrace—and live with the consequences.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Mythic Tier Powers**
*   Players have mythic-level abilities from the start, growing to cosmic power by campaign end.

### 2. **Philosophical Alignment**
*   Instead of traditional alignment, track characters' philosophical positions on key questions. These shift based on experiences and choices.

### 3. **Mass Combat - Cosmic Scale**
*   Command legions of angels in battles that reshape reality. Individual heroics can turn the tide of entire conflicts.

### 4. **The Choice**
*   At a crucial midpoint, each player secretly decides their allegiance. Reveal simultaneously. The party may split.

### 5. **Divine Weapons**
*   Artifacts of cosmic power—flaming swords, trumpets that shatter mountains, shields of faith.

### 6. **The Transformation**
*   If players join Lucifer and fall, they physically transform from angels to fallen angels/demons, gaining new powers but losing others.

### 7. **Inevitable Tragedy**
*   Regardless of player choices, certain events are fated (this is Milton's Paradise Lost). The question is not "can we prevent the Fall?" but "how do we conduct ourselves during it?"

## Multiple Endings Based on Choice

**Stayed Loyal to Heaven:**
*   Victory but the cost was friends lost. Promoted to higher orders. Tasked with preventing future rebellions. Question whether crushing freedom was right.

**Joined Lucifer:**
*   Defeated and cast into Hell. Transformed into fallen angels. Now must build civilization in the Abyss while clinging to Lucifer's ideals or descending into bitterness.

**Sought Third Path:**
*   Attempted to mediate or abstained from fighting. Trusted by neither side. Perhaps exiled to the mortal realm as watchers. Freedom but isolation.

Each ending is complex, bittersweet, and philosophically rich.
