# Creative Brief: War in Heaven

## Art Style: Baroque Religious Art meets Cosmic Horror (Milton's Vision)

Inspired by Gustave Doré's Paradise Lost illustrations and classical religious art—sublime grandeur, dramatic contrasts, angels as beings of terrible beauty, cosmic scale.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Heaven in brilliant golds, pure whites, celestial blues. Lucifer in dark beauty—black, deep purple, tarnished gold. The Fall features transitions from light to darkness.

**Character Design:** Angels as beings of light and wings, wearing armor and robes of pure radiance. Lucifer remains beautiful even in rebellion. Post-Fall, angels transform—wings darken, armor tarnishes, beauty becomes terrible.

**Environments:** Heaven as impossible architecture of light and crystal. The battlefield as cosmic void with stars and reality breaking. Hell as grand but ruined—Pandemonium's dark majesty.

**Scale:** Everything is monumental. Angels tower. Battles span planes of existence. Architecture defies mortal understanding.

## Voice

A resonant, angelic voice of terrible beauty—like a choir and a single voice simultaneously. Speaking with the gravity of eternity and the passion of those who have never known compromise. The voice of Lucifer recounting the rebellion—pride, defiance, regret, and unbroken will mixed together.

## Music Style

Orchestral and choral grandeur—think Handel's Messiah meets Wagner's Ring Cycle meets Howard Shore's cosmic scale. Heaven's music is perfect harmony—massed choirs, organ, transcendent beauty. Lucifer's theme is powerful brass and strings—tragic, proud, dark majesty. Battle music is apocalyptic—full orchestra, choir singing in angelic tongue, drums like the foundation of reality cracking. The overall tone is sublime—beauty so vast it borders on terror.
