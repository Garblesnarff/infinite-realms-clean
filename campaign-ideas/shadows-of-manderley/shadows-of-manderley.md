## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Psychological Horror:** More atmosphere and dread than combat or traditional threats.
*   **Social Combat:** Navigating class differences, household politics, manipulative NPCs.
*   **Mystery Investigation:** Uncovering past secrets through subtle clues and interviews.
*   **Character Growth:** PC must transform from insecure girl to confident woman.
*   **Gothic Atmosphere:** Success requires engaging with mood and tension.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The "victim" was a monster; the "murderer" is sympathetic.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Marriage (Sessions 1–2):** Working as a paid companion to wealthy widow in Monte Carlo, the PC meets Maxim de Winter—brooding, wealthy widower. Whirlwind romance. He proposes impulsively. They marry and travel to his ancestral estate, Manderley, on the English coast. Introduction to the Gothic mansion and its staff.

*   **Act II — Rebecca's Shadow (Sessions 3–5):** Arrival at Manderley. Meet Mrs. Danvers, the obsessive housekeeper who worshipped Rebecca. Every room reminds of Rebecca's perfection. The PC is compared unfavorably constantly. Rebecca's monogrammed items everywhere. Discovery that Rebecca died in a boating "accident" less than a year ago. Maxim is distant and moody. Mrs. Danvers psychologically torments the PC—suggesting she's inadequate, doesn't belong, should leave.

*   **Act III — The Costume Ball (Sessions 6–7):** Preparing for the annual Manderley ball. Mrs. Danvers suggests the PC wear a particular historical costume—which turns out to be what Rebecca wore to her last ball. Maxim reacts with horror and rage. The PC is humiliated. Maxim's cousin Jack Favell appears—sinister, claims to have been Rebecca's lover. Tensions escalate.

*   **Act IV — The Wreck Discovered (Sessions 8–9):** Rebecca's sunken boat is discovered with her body still inside. Official story was she was sailing alone and drowned. New evidence suggests murder. Investigation opens. Maxim confesses the truth to PC: Rebecca was a sociopathic monster who tormented him, took lovers openly, was pregnant with another man's child. During final argument, she fell and hit her head. Maxim put her body in the boat and sank it.

*   **Act V — The Inquest (Sessions 10–11):** Official inquiry into Rebecca's death. Favell appears claiming Maxim murdered Rebecca, has "evidence" (appointment with London doctor day of death). Investigation reveals Rebecca had terminal cancer, knew she was dying. Her appointment was cancer diagnosis. She provoked Maxim into killing her (suicide by husband) to die on her terms and destroy him posthumously. Verdict: suicide (she scuttled her own boat). Maxim is cleared.

*   **Act VI — Manderley Burns (Session 12):** Returning home, Manderley is on fire. Mrs. Danvers, unable to accept Rebecca's exposure as monster, has set the mansion ablaze and died in it. Rebecca's room burns, her possessions destroyed. The estate is lost but Maxim and PC are finally free of Rebecca's ghost. They leave to start new life elsewhere, no longer haunted.

## Central Conflict

Escaping the shadow of the perfect predecessor. The PC must overcome:
*   Her own insecurity and class anxiety (working-class girl in aristocratic world)
*   Mrs. Danvers' psychological warfare
*   The household's devotion to Rebecca's memory
*   Maxim's emotional distance and guilt
*   Rebecca's posthumous power over everyone

The twist: Rebecca wasn't perfect—she was a monster who used her charm and beauty as weapons. The revelation liberates everyone from worshipping a false idol but reveals that Maxim is technically a murderer (though Rebecca orchestrated her own death).

Central question: Can you build a relationship on the ruins of a toxic past? Can truth, even ugly truth, be more freeing than beautiful lies?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Confidence Tracker**
*   PC starts with low confidence, increases as she asserts herself and uncovers truth.
*   Low confidence: disadvantage on social checks at Manderley, easily manipulated.
*   High confidence: can stand up to Mrs. Danvers, support Maxim, navigate society.
*   Major events (costume ball humiliation, truth revelation, supporting Maxim) affect tracker.

### 2. **Rebecca's Ghost (Atmospheric, Not Literal)**
*   Rebecca haunts narratively, not supernaturally (unless DM adds actual ghost).
*   Every room has her touch, her choices, her perfection.
*   NPCs constantly compare PC to her.
*   Mechanically: Wisdom saves to resist psychological pressure and maintain sense of self.

### 3. **Mrs. Danvers' Psychological Warfare**
*   Social combat encounters with Danvers.
*   She uses Intimidation, Deception, and Persuasion to undermine PC.
*   PC must use Insight to recognize manipulation, Persuasion/Deception to resist.
*   If PC fails too many encounters, considers leaving Manderley (near-failure state).

### 4. **Class Anxiety System**
*   PC navigates aristocratic society while feeling like imposter.
*   High society events require Persuasion/Performance checks.
*   Mistakes (wrong etiquette, wrong clothing) damage reputation.
*   Success grants acceptance; failure reinforces outsider status.

### 5. **The Mystery Investigation**
*   Gradual revelation through: examining Rebecca's rooms, reading her correspondence, interviewing staff and doctor.
*   Clues about Rebecca's true nature scattered throughout mansion.
*   Medical investigation reveals cancer diagnosis and timeline.
*   Uncover that Rebecca provoked her own death.

### 6. **The Inquest**
*   Legal proceeding, social skill challenge.
*   Must present evidence, manage public opinion, support Maxim's story.
*   Outcome determines whether Maxim is charged or cleared.
*   PC's confidence and relationship with Maxim affects success.

### 7. **The Transformation Arc**
*   Track PC's development from insecure companion to confident woman.
*   Key moments: standing up to Danvers, learning truth, supporting Maxim at inquest.
*   By campaign end, PC has found her voice and identity separate from Rebecca.

## Rebecca's True Nature (The Revelation)

The perfect woman everyone remembers was actually:
*   Manipulative sociopath who enjoyed psychological cruelty
*   Took lovers openly to humiliate Maxim
*   Taunted him with infidelity and her pregnancy by another man
*   Made a deal with Maxim (lavender marriage)—she got freedom and Manderley, he got proper society wife
*   When diagnosed with terminal cancer, decided to die on her terms
*   Provoked Maxim during their final argument, goading him to violence
*   Fell and struck her head (accident or suicide-by-proxy unclear)
*   Maxim panicked, put her in boat and sank it to hide the death

The house worships a monster. Mrs. Danvers either knew and loved her anyway, or was blinded by obsession.

## Campaign Themes

*   **Living in a Predecessor's Shadow:** Impossibility of competing with idealized memory.
*   **Class Anxiety:** Working-class person in aristocratic world, imposter syndrome.
*   **Psychological Abuse:** Rebecca's cruelty, Danvers' manipulation, gaslighting.
*   **Truth vs. Illusion:** Perfect image versus ugly reality.
*   **Female Identity:** PC finding herself separate from men (Maxim) or other women (Rebecca).
*   **Gothic Romance:** Love mixed with darkness, secrets, and atmospheric dread.

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Create detailed descriptions of Manderley—every room Rebecca touched
*   Practice Mrs. Danvers' cold, cutting dialogue
*   Show don't tell Rebecca's perfection through others' memories
*   Create gradual revelation—drip-feed clues about Rebecca's true nature
*   Make PC feel legitimately inferior initially (through NPC reactions)
*   Track PC's confidence visibly—how NPCs treat her changes
*   Costume ball should be genuinely humiliating moment
*   Maxim's confession scene is climax—must feel like relief and horror simultaneously
*   Rebecca should feel present despite being dead
*   Gothic atmosphere is crucial—fog, cliffs, waves, oppressive beauty
*   The fire at the end is cathartic—emphasize liberation despite loss
*   If PC is male: adapt to widower marrying young man, Danvers still obsessed with Rebecca
*   Consider whether to make Rebecca actually supernatural or purely psychological
