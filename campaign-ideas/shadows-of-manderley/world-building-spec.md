### **World-Building Specification Brief: Shadows of Manderley**

**1. Core Concept:**
A young, insecure woman marries a wealthy widower and moves to his Gothic coastal estate where she's tormented by the shadow of his perfect dead first wife, eventually discovering the truth: Rebecca was a sociopathic monster, and Maxim murdered her—or did she orchestrate her own death?

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Manderley Estate—ancestral home for 400 years, passed down de Winter line, symbol of family legacy
*   Explain Rebecca's reign—five years as perfect mistress of Manderley, beloved by all, secretly monstrous
*   Write about Rebecca's death—"accident" while sailing alone at night, body never found (until now)
*   Describe the marriage arrangement—Maxim and Rebecca's deal: she gets freedom and social position, he gets proper wife
*   Detail Rebecca's affairs—multiple lovers including Jack Favell, used them to torment Maxim
*   Explain Mrs. Danvers' history—raised Rebecca from childhood, devoted beyond reason, possibly in love with her
*   Write about class structure—aristocratic de Winters versus working-class second wife, social anxiety
*   Describe the cancer diagnosis—Rebecca's terminal illness, her decision to die on her terms

**3. Factions:**
*   **The de Winter Family** (Major) - Maxim, his sister Beatrice, reputation and legacy
*   **The Manderley Staff** (Major) - Mrs. Danvers leads household devoted to Rebecca's memory
*   **Rebecca's Worshippers** (Major) - Everyone who knew her thinks she was perfect
*   **The Truth Seekers** (Minor) - PC, Frank Crawley, those who see through Rebecca
*   **The Blackmailers** (Minor) - Jack Favell attempting to profit from Rebecca's death
*   **Legal Authorities** (Minor) - Colonel Julyan, coroner, investigating Rebecca's death

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Maxim de Winter, Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca de Winter (deceased but omnipresent), Jack Favell
*   **Tier 2:** Frank Crawley, Beatrice Lacy, Colonel Julyan, Dr. Baker
*   **Tier 3:** "Manderley Servant," "Society Matron," "Estate Worker," "Investigator," "Rebecca's Friend"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Manderley Estate** - Gothic mansion, center of everything, beautiful prison
*   **Rebecca's Bedroom** - West wing, perfectly preserved shrine
*   **The Morning Room** - Where PC tries to establish herself as mistress
*   **The Library** - Maxim's retreat, contains evidence
*   **The Beach Cottage** - Rebecca's meeting place with lovers
*   **The Boathouse** - Scene of Rebecca's death
*   **The Cove** - Where sunken boat with body is discovered
*   **Happy Valley** - One place untainted by Rebecca
*   **London** - Dr. Baker's office, Rebecca's secret medical appointments

**6. Causality:**
*   IF PC accepts Mrs. Danvers' psychological warfare passively THEN confidence drops, considers leaving
*   IF PC investigates Rebecca's past THEN discovers inconsistencies in perfect image
*   IF PC wears costume suggested by Danvers THEN humiliated at ball (Rebecca's outfit)
*   IF PC supports Maxim after humiliation THEN their relationship deepens
*   IF Rebecca's boat discovered THEN investigation into death reopens
*   IF Maxim confesses truth to PC THEN she must decide to support or abandon him
*   IF Jack Favell produces "evidence" THEN creates crisis requiring investigation
*   IF Dr. Baker testifies THEN reveals cancer diagnosis, recontextualizes everything
*   IF Rebecca's true nature exposed THEN household's worship collapses
*   IF inquest rules suicide THEN Maxim cleared legally (though morally ambiguous)
*   IF Mrs. Danvers cannot accept truth THEN sets Manderley ablaze and dies in fire
*   IF Manderley burns THEN PC and Maxim are freed from past but lose estate
*   IF PC gains confidence throughout THEN can stand up to society and Danvers
*   IF PC's confidence remains low THEN marriage fails or she leaves
