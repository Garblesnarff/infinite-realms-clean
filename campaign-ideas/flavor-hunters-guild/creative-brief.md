### Monster Design Philosophy

**The Eight Apex Beasts**
- Each should be memorable and distinct
- Beautiful in their own way, even when terrifying
- Anatomy suggests flavor profile (marbling, color, texture)
- Scale: Massive enough to feel impossible to hunt
- Personality visible in design (wise Whale, majestic Phoenix, ancient Turtle)

**Common Prey**
- Realistic but fantastical ecology
- Showing them in natural behavior before hunt
- Design suggests taste and cooking method
- Some cute, some terrifying, all edible

**Environment Predators**
- Competitors for resources, not all are huntable
- Create danger beyond just the target
- Pack tactics, ambush predators, territory holders
- Respect for nature: Everything has its place

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Theme
