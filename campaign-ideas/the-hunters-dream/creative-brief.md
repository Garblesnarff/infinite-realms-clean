# Creative Brief: The Hunters Dream

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Victorian Gothic meets Cosmic Horror

Inspired by Bloodborne's iconic aesthetic, this style blends dark Victorian Gothic architecture with eldritch Lovecraftian horror. Yharnam is a city of towering cathedrals, gaslight streets, and baroque excess—all corrupted by cosmic wrongness and beast transformation.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Victorian Gothic:** Elaborate architecture, gaslight, cobblestones, long coats, top hats, ornate weapons.
*   **Beast Corruption:** Humans mid-transformation—fur sprouting, jaws elongating, claws emerging.
*   **Eldritch Elements:** Impossible anatomy, too many eyes/limbs, cosmic geometry, Great Ones that defy physics.
*   **Blood and Silver:** Rich reds of blood against silver moonlight, creating stark contrast.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Victorian Gothic, beast plague, eldritch truth, blood ministration, Hunters, Great Ones, cosmic horror, transformation, insight.
*   **Feeling:** A beautiful city corrupted by its own hubris. Gothic grandeur rotting from within. The hunt through dark streets. Eyes opening to terrible truths.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Architecture:** Elaborate Victorian/Gothic buildings—spires, gargoyles, archways. Ornate but decaying.
*   **Beasts:** Human bodies grotesquely transforming—elongated limbs, wolf-like features, exposed bones, antlers, too many teeth.
*   **Great Ones:** Impossible anatomy—too many limbs, eyes where they shouldn't be, proportions that hurt to perceive.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dark Victorian Gothic street under a pale moon. Elaborate buildings with spires and gargoyles line the cobblestone road. Gas lamps flicker. A figure in a long coat and tricorn hat—a Hunter—faces a beast: a man mid-transformation with elongated limbs, wolf-like jaws, and fur sprouting from torn clothing."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant:** Dark grays, blacks, deep purples of night.
*   **Accents:** Rich blood reds, cold silver moonlight, sickly greens of corruption, the warm orange of fire and gaslights.
*   **Great Ones:** Colors that shouldn't exist—iridescent purples, cosmic blues, impossible hues.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Color palette of dark grays and blacks with accents of blood red and cold silver moonlight. The scene shows a Gothic cathedral interior, candles casting warm orange light onto bloodstained floors. Through stained glass windows, a pale moon shines with sickly light."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Hunters:** Victorian-era clothing—long coats, tricorn hats, leather straps, bandages. Armed with trick weapons (swords that transform, guns).
*   **Citizens:** Normal humans in Victorian dress, gradually showing beast features—hunched posture, elongated teeth, wild eyes, claws.
*   **Fully Transformed Beasts:** Werewolf-like but more grotesque—wrong proportions, too many joints, exposed organs, antlers, tentacles.
*   **Great Ones:** Truly alien—slug-like bodies, doll-like faces with too many eyes, bodies covered in infant heads, cosmic wrongness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Hunter in elaborate Victorian attire: long black coat, tricorn hat, leather bandages on arms. They wield a saw cleaver (a sword with serrated edge that can transform). Facing them is a Great One: a massive slug-like being covered in eyes, with a vaguely humanoid face that's subtly wrong, and writhing appendages that defy anatomy."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Yharnam:** Victorian Gothic city—narrow streets, towering churches, elaborate mansions, cobblestones slick with blood and rain.
*   **The Dream:** Otherworldly workshop under massive pale trees, eternal twilight, too-clean stone paths, the Doll's house.
*   **Nightmares:** Twisted versions of reality—buildings at wrong angles, blood rivers, cosmic voids.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Hunter's Dream: an otherworldly garden under a massive pale moon. Gothic workshop building with smoking chimney. Stone paths lead through flower beds to messenger bath. Massive white trees with no leaves tower overhead. The Doll stands among flowers, porcelain-pale, in Victorian dress."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Heavy shadows from gaslight and moonlight. Strong chiaroscuro. Blood and fire provide warm highlights against cold moonlight.
*   **Moonlight:** Cold, pale, reveals truth. Under the Blood Moon, everything is visible including horrors normally hidden.
*   **Purpose:** Light reveals cosmic truth. Shadows hide beasts. Fire is safety and weapon.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Yharnam street lit by gas lamps creating pools of warm orange light against deep shadows. Cold moonlight from above casts silver highlights. In the shadows between lights, shapes move—beasts prowling. The lighting creates paranoia: what's in the darkness?"

**7. Composition:**
*   **Gothic Framing:** Use archways, windows, spires to frame action. Emphasize vertical scale with towering architecture.
*   **Beast Confrontations:** Low angles showing beasts looming. Hunters small but determined.
*   **Great Ones:** Massive scale. Tiny humans against cosmic entities. Impossible perspectives.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Low-angle shot looking up at a massive cathedral. Gothic spires reach toward a pale moon. At the base, tiny Hunter figures face a Great One emerging from the cathedral doors—a being of impossible size with too many limbs and eyes. The scale emphasizes human insignificance."

## Voice

A refined, melancholic British male voice with Victorian formality, speaking as one who has hunted too long and seen too much. The tone is that of Gehrman—weary, wise, resigned. Pacing is slow and deliberate, with pauses heavy with unspoken sorrow. Emotion shifts from gentle mentorship to deep sadness to manic insight. Audio includes environmental sounds: church bells tolling, beast howls in distance, squelching of transformation, the Doll's gentle humming, and underneath everything, a cosmic hum suggesting Great Ones' presence. Role: The First Hunter, bound to guide others into the same curse, speaking across the gulf between hunter and hunted, human and god, knowing the truth no one wants to hear: "Tonight, Gehrman joins the hunt."
