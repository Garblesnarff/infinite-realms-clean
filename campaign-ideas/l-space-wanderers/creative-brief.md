# L-Space Wanderers - Creative Brief

## Art Direction
**Aesthetic**: Terry Pratchett's Discworld meets M.C. Escher. Libraries with impossible geometry. Books that are also creatures. Warm, cluttered, magical academia.

**Color Palette**: Warm leather browns, aged paper yellows, ink blacks, candlelight gold. Occasional magical color for special texts.

**Character Design**: Party members have visible text on their skin (they ARE books). Bookish academic aesthetic. Comfortable robes, reading glasses, book-carrying equipment.

## Music Direction
**Main Theme**: Baroque harpsichord meets library ambience. Pages turning as percussion. Whispering books as choir. Cozy but epic.

**L-Space Travel**: Rushing wind through infinite shelves, pages flipping rapidly, reality shifting between library types.

**Knowledge Bomb**: Discordant information overload—all music at once, then silence.

**The Singularity**: All sound compressing into single tone, building intensity until either explosion or silence.

## Voice Acting
**The Librarian**: Only says "Ook" but with infinite nuance. Each "Ook" conveys complete thoughts through tone.

**Erasure**: Calm, reasonable, terrifyingly logical. Makes evil sound sensible.

**Sophia the Omniscient**: Speaks in overlapping voices, all knowledge simultaneously. Maddening to hear.

**Manuscript**: Voice with slight reverb, as if reading aloud always.

## Sound Design
**L-Space Ambience**: Constant soft page-turning, distant whispers of text being read, shelves creaking under knowledge weight.

**The Devourer**: Eating sounds mixed with words dissolving, memories being consumed.

**Knowledge Weapons**: Information weaponized—words becoming projectiles, text dissolving targets.

**Collapsing L-Space**: Reality compressing, shelves groaning, books screaming.
