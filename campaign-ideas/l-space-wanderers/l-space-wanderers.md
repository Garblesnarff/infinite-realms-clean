# L-Space Wanderers
## *"Knowledge equals power equals energy equals matter equals mass, and mass distorts space. All libraries are connected through L-Space."*

## Campaign Overview

Based on Terry Pratchett's concept of L-Space (Library Space), this campaign explores a dimension where all libraries throughout the multiverse are connected. Walk far enough through any library's shelves and you'll emerge in another library in another world, another time, another reality. Knowledge warps space itself.

The party are L-Space Wanderers—travelers who navigate the infinite library dimension, delivering books, hunting rare texts, and preventing knowledge catastrophes. They discover someone is weaponizing L-Space, creating "knowledge bombs" that detonate information, driving entire populations mad with instant total awareness. Reality itself is being rewritten by forbidden texts escaping containment.

As they investigate, the party learns that L-Space is collapsing. Too much knowledge has accumulated. The weight of all information is creating a singularity that will compress all libraries into a single point, destroying every book, every idea, every thought that ever existed. They must either reduce total knowledge (burning books) or find a way to expand L-Space itself—or accept that information has become so dense that it will collapse into nothing.

The twist: The party themselves are living books, animated by narrative magic. Their "quest" is literally written in their bodies. Completing the campaign means reading themselves to the end and ceasing to exist as separate entities, merging back into pure information.

## Core Themes

- **Knowledge as Reality-Warping Force**: Information literally bends space and time
- **Infinite Library Paradox**: All knowledge in one space creates impossible density
- **Books as Living Things**: Texts have consciousness, will, desire
- **Information Wants To Be Free**: The ethics of containing dangerous knowledge
- **The Weight of Knowing**: Too much information is burden and weapon

## Session Breakdown (33 Sessions)

### Act 1: The Wanderers (Sessions 1-9)
Party are established L-Space navigators. Opening sessions demonstrate normal library-hopping adventures: delivering rare texts, avoiding knowledge predators (creatures that eat information), navigating genre-specific library sections. Discovery of first "knowledge bomb"—entire town driven mad by instant total awareness of everything. Party investigates source.

### Act 2: The Weaponization (Sessions 10-20)
Hunting the knowledge terrorist. Trail leads through libraries across dimensions: The Library of Alexandria (still exists in L-Space), Unseen University (Discworld reference), The Library of Babel, The Akashic Records. Each contains clues. Discovering a faction called the Blank Minds who believe knowledge is poison and are trying to "free" humanity through enforced ignorance via destructive information overload.

### Act 3: The Collapse (Sessions 21-28)
Revelation that knowledge bombs are symptoms, not the disease. L-Space itself is collapsing from accumulated information weight. Every new book written, every new idea conceived, adds mass to L-Space. Eventually it will achieve critical density and collapse into a singularity—erasing all knowledge forever. The Blank Minds know this and are accelerating collapse intentionally.

### Act 4: The Resolution (Sessions 29-33)
Three options emerge:
1. Burn enough books to reduce L-Space's mass (genocide of information)
2. Expand L-Space by creating new dimensions for knowledge (risky reality manipulation)
3. Embrace the singularity, becoming the unified field of all information (merging into single consciousness)

Final revelation: Party members are themselves living books. Their quest is written in their bodies. Reading themselves to completion means ceasing to exist as individuals. The campaign climaxes with party choosing which ending to enact and accepting the consequence—potentially reading their own final pages.

## Key NPCs

**The Librarian** (Orangutan) - Discworld reference. Ancient guardian of L-Space. Says only "Ook." Knows everything but communicates minimally. Tragic figure who witnessed countless knowledge catastrophes.

**Erasure the Blank** - Leader of Blank Minds. Believes knowledge is suffering. Wants to free humanity through enforced ignorance. Sympathetic extremist—has points about information overload.

**The Devourer** - Creature that eats knowledge. Consumes books and memories. Becomes whatever it devours. Terrifying but necessary—natural check on knowledge accumulation.

**Sophia the Omniscient** - Person who achieved total knowledge. Went mad. Exists in pain, knowing everything simultaneously. Living warning about information limits.

**The Index** - Sentient catalogue of L-Space. Knows location of every book. Revealing that L-Space is collapsing. Neutral arbiter who will survive any ending (indexes survive their contents).

**Manuscript** - A character who is literally an illuminated manuscript. Becomes party ally. Represents living books. Their development shows that books are people, making burning books equivalent to murder.

## Major Locations

**The Central Library** - Hub connecting all libraries. Infinite shelves. Escher-like architecture. Geography changes based on what you're looking for. Navigation is thematic, not spatial.

**The Forbidden Stacks** - Books too dangerous to read. Sealed section. Contains world-ending texts, madness-inducing grimoires, information that kills. Party must sometimes retrieve these.

**The Biography Section** - Every life story ever lived. Finding your own biography allows reading your past and potential futures. Tempting and terrifying.

**The Lost Library of Alexandria** - Still exists in L-Space. Contains texts thought destroyed. Massive historical repository. Also: Possibly ground zero for L-Space collapse.

**The Blank Reading Room** - Blank Minds' headquarters. Empty shelves. Book burnings performed here. Horrifying library where nothing is written or read.

**The Singularity Point** - Where L-Space is collapsing into. Infinitely dense information. Impossible to approach without mind-breaking revelation. Final destination.

## Unique Mechanics

**L-Space Navigation** - Movement through libraries is thematic. "I need books on dragons" takes you to dragon section across all libraries. Getting lost means wandering wrong genres.

**Knowledge Weight** - Information has literal mass. Carrying too many books slows you. Reading heavy texts exhausts you. Knowledge is physically burdensome.

**Information Resistance** - Save vs forbidden knowledge. Failure means going mad, gaining information your mind can't handle.

**Living Text** - Party members are books. Can read each other for information, but reading too much risks ending their story prematurely.

**The Devourer's Hunger** - When knowledge predators attack, they eat memories and abilities. Party must defend not just life but identity.

**Thematic Teleportation** - Need to reach historical library? Think about history. L-Space takes you there. Fast travel via conceptual connection.

## Victory Conditions

**The Burning** - Reduce knowledge to sustainable levels by destroying texts. Preserve L-Space but lose irreplaceable information. Painful pragmatism.

**The Expansion** - Create new dimensions for knowledge storage. Risk breaking reality but preserve all information. Ambitious solution.

**The Unification** - Accept singularity. All knowledge merges into single consciousness. Party becomes part of it. Transcendence or death?

**The Balance** - Find middle path: Controlled knowledge curation. Some burning, some expansion, mostly preservation. Difficult compromise.

## Campaign Climax

At the Singularity Point, reality compressing into infinite density, the party holds their own books (themselves). Must decide: Read to completion and fulfill their narrative purpose (ceasing to exist), remain unfinished and resist collapse (preserve individuality), or merge with singularity (become unified information field). The ending is literally reading their own final pages aloud, with players narrating their characters' completion.
