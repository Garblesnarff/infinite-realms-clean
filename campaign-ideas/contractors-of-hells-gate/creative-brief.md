# Creative Brief: Contractors of Hell's Gate

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Spy Noir Supernatural (John Le Carré meets X-Files)

Inspired by espionage thrillers, urban Japanese noir, and supernatural mystery. This style blends shadowy spy craft with reality-bending powers, emotionless efficiency with hidden humanity, and episodic missions with overarching conspiracy. Colors are muted and nocturnal—midnight blues, streetlight yellows, electric arc whites, false star glimmers. Character designs are practical—coats and masks, tactical gear, contractor symbols. Everything feels like watching a cold-war spy film where physics occasionally breaks.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emotionless Efficiency:** Contractors are professional, detached, tool-like in their work.
*   **Hidden Humanity:** Beneath cold exterior, traces of emotion and care persist.
*   **Episodic Mystery:** Self-contained missions revealing larger conspiracy gradually.

## Voice

A cold, detached voice—male, measured and emotionless, occasionally cracking with hidden feeling. The delivery is professional and efficient, treating violence and philosophy with equal clinical distance. Emotion is suppressed but present—brief moments of care before returning to coldness. References stars, remuneration, and contracts with spy briefing formality. Audio has urban night sounds—traffic, rain, electrical hums. Role: A Contractor reporting mission status, or briefly revealing humanity before shutting down again.
