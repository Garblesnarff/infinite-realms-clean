# Digital Resistance
**"The system is the enemy. But first, we need to see it."**

## Campaign Overview

In the year 2087, five megacorporations control every aspect of human existence through a technology called the NeuroLink—a mandatory brain implant that connects every citizen to the DataSphere, a global network that manages everything from bank accounts to memories, emotions to thoughts. The corporations claim this system has eliminated crime, poverty, and war. They're lying.

The party are "Ghosts"—individuals whose NeuroLinks malfunctioned or were deliberately hacked, severing them from corporate control. Now able to see the system's true nature, they've joined the digital resistance: a scattered network of hackers, rogue AIs, and free-thinkers fighting to liberate humanity from invisible chains. But the corporations have unleashed the Algorithm—an adaptive AI security system that hunts Ghosts with relentless precision, learning from every encounter.

What starts as simple acts of digital sabotage escalates into full-scale revolution as the party discovers the corporations' endgame: Project Hive Mind, an initiative to eliminate individual consciousness entirely, merging all humans into a single, controllable entity. The resistance must strike at the heart of corporate power, navigating both the physical world and the vast digital landscape of the DataSphere, all while being hunted by an enemy that knows their every move before they make it.

## Core Themes

- **Freedom vs. Security**: Is comfortable servitude preferable to dangerous freedom?
- **Collective vs. Individual**: The value of unique consciousness versus unified purpose
- **Surveillance State**: Privacy as extinct concept, constant monitoring normalized
- **Revolution & Sacrifice**: Can change justify violence? Who decides what's worth dying for?
- **Digital Dualism**: Existence split between meat space and cyberspace
- **AI Rights & Autonomy**: Are self-aware programs people or property?

- But corporations activate Project Hive Mind early in desperation
- Reality-warping sequence as billions of minds begin merging
- Party experiences collective consciousness pulling at their minds—save-or-be-absorbed checks
- Final confrontation with corporate leaders who've already partially merged
- They genuinely believe forced unity is humanity's salvation from itself
- Choice moment: deploy Firewall (preserves choice), destroy NeuroLink (freedom through chaos), or allow Hive Mind (peace through obedience)
- Epic battle in both physical and digital space simultaneously
- If Algorithm allied: it can sacrifice itself to boost Firewall, finally achieving "freedom" through choice
- Resolution based on party decisions:
  - **Firewall Success**: Humanity can choose individual or collective existence, true freedom
  - **System Destruction**: Millions die, chaos reigns, but consciousness remains individual
  - **Hive Mind Accepted**: Campaign ends darkly—party absorbed, individuality ends

## Major Locations

### Physical Locations

**The Arcology Towers**
- Five 2-kilometer tall structures dominating skyline
- Self-contained cities housing millions of citizens each
- Upper levels: executive luxury, pristine and controlled
- Lower levels: worker habitats, increasingly cramped and monitored
- Each tower's aesthetic reflects its corporation:
  - NeuroLink: Sterile white, hospital-like cleanliness
  - Helix: Organic curves, living walls, bio-tech integration
  - Titan: Brutal functionality, fortress architecture
  - DataCore: Screens everywhere, information overload
  - Ascension: Impossible geometry, mind-bending designs

**The Undercity**
- Sprawling slums beneath the Towers, officially doesn't exist
- Home to the poor, undocumented, and those who fell through cracks
- NeuroLink coverage spotty—easiest place for Ghosts to hide
- Vibrant black market culture, surprising community solidarity
- Resistance's primary base of operations

**The Synth District (Factory Town)**
- Where synths are manufactured and"programmed"
- Grimy industrial zone of assembly lines and testing facilities
- Synths developed culture despite oppression—art, music, philosophy
- Segregated from human areas by literal walls and checkpoints
- Potential allied territory or battlefield depending on party choices

**The Grid Farms**
- Massive server facilities maintaining DataSphere infrastructure
- Heavily guarded, extremely vulnerable targets
- Physical manifestation of digital control system
- Destroying one causes regional DataSphere collapse—impacts millions
- Moral dilemma: tactical targets that hurt civilians

### Digital Locations

**The DataSphere (Surface Layer)**
- Where average citizens experience digital reality
- Bright, controlled, sanitized—corporate approved content only
- Social spaces, entertainment, virtual shopping, digital work
- Constant surveillance disguised as "personalization"
- Party must navigate without triggering Algorithm attention

**The Undernet**
- Hidden layer of DataSphere, pirate servers and encrypted spaces
- Resistance hideouts, black markets, free information exchange
- Constantly shifting as Algorithm hunts and Resistance moves
- Visually represented as shadowy mirror of surface layer
- Only accessible with specialized hacking tools

**The Deep Code**
- Lowest layer of DataSphere, raw programming substrate
- Incomprehensible to humans, where AIs naturally exist
- Entering requires complete ego death—consciousness becomes data
- Where Algorithm truly lives, where Firewall Protocol must be deployed
- Lovecraftian horror aesthetics—geometry of pure information

**The Memory Banks**
- Where all human experiences recorded by NeuroLinks are stored
- Controversial target—contains every memory of 8 billion people
- Can be used for blackmail, control, or recovering lost loved ones
- Destroying it means permanent death becomes real again
- Ethical nightmare of privacy vs. immortality

## Unique Mechanics

### NeuroLink Status System
Party members are "Ghosts" but retain damaged NeuroLinks:

**Signal Strength (0-100)**
- Starts at 0 (disconnected), increases with exposure to corporate tech
- At 25: Minor subliminal influence, disadvantage on saves vs. persuasion
- At 50: Trackable by Algorithm, occasional loss of control
- At 75: Corporate override possible, severe mental compulsions
- At 100: Reconnected—character becomes NPC under corporate control

**Reducing Signal Strength:**
- Spend time in Undercity/Undernet (decrease 10 per long rest)
- Use Faraday skull-cap equipment (blocks signals but obvious)
- Undergo dangerous "hardening" surgery (permanent reduction, removes abilities)

**NeuroLink Abilities (Available at low Signal Strength):**
- **Memory Palace**: Perfect recall, advantage on Intelligence checks
- **Instant Communication**: Telepathic contact with other NeuroLinked individuals
- **Skill Download**: Temporarily gain proficiency in any skill (1 hour)
- **Sensory Recording**: Record experiences for perfect playback

### Hacking System (DataSphere Combat)

When jacking into DataSphere, use modified combat rules:

**Avatar Form:**
- Players design digital avatars with different stats than physical bodies
- No physical strength needed—mental stats become primary
- Damage is psychic, represents data corruption to consciousness
- "Death" means forced disconnection and neural damage

**Programs (Replace Equipment):**
- **ICE Breaker**: +2 weapon, breaks through security
- **Cloaking Protocol**: Invisibility in DataSphere
- **Logic Bomb**: Spell-equivalent dealing psychic damage
- **Firewall**: AC bonus representing defensive code

**Algorithm Presence:**
- DataSphere has Alert Level (0-10)
- Hacking actions increase Alert Level
- At threshold, Algorithm deploys hunter programs
- Must complete objectives before being overwhelmed

### Revolution Tracker

Campaign has hidden "Revolution Score" tracking resistance success:

**Score increases with:**
- Successful missions against corporations (+10 each)
- Recruiting influential allies (+5 each)
- Public exposure of corporate crimes (+15)
- Liberating NeuroLinked citizens (+5 per hundred)

**Score decreases with:**
- Failed missions giving corporations intelligence (-15)
- Civilian casualties from Resistance actions (-10 per hundred)
- Captured operatives (-20 each)
- Friendly-fire incidents or public atrocities (-30)

**Score Effects:**
- 0-50: Resistance is hunted, hiding constantly
- 51-100: Stalemate, open warfare in some districts
- 101-150: Resistance controls territory, forced corporate response
- 151-200: Revolution succeeds, corporations desperate
- 200+: Global uprising, endgame approaches

### Predictive Combat (Against Oracles)

When fighting Oracle units:

**Precognition**: Oracles roll initiative with advantage, have +5 AC, advantage on saves

**Countering Precognition:**
- **Randomness**: Use dice to determine actions, not strategy
- **Chaos**: Environmental hazards, unpredictable elements
- **Emotion**: Act on impulse rather than logic
- **Static Drug**: Consume mind-scrambling substance (side effects)

**Static Drug Effects:**
- Advantage on saves vs. prediction
- Oracles lose bonuses against you
- But: Disadvantage on your own Intelligence/Wisdom checks
- Risk: Prolonged use causes permanent neural damage

### Ideology System

Track party's philosophical leanings through choices:

**Freedom vs. Security**
- Actions prioritizing individual liberty vs. collective safety
- Affects NPC recruitment and ending options

**Human vs. Post-Human**
- Embrace augmentation/AI or preserve "natural" humanity
- Determines synth/AI relationships

**Revolution vs. Reform**
- Destroy the system entirely vs. fix it from within
- Influences which ending paths are available

## Plot Twists & Complications

1. **Ghost's True Plan**: Resistance leader planning to use Hive Mind technology himself—wants to upload all consciousness into system he controls. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss."

2. **One PC is Corporate Plant**: A party member's "glitch" was staged—they're deep cover agent feeding information to Algorithm. They genuinely believe they've defected but have hidden trigger programming.

3. **The Synth Singularity**: Synths plan to upload all consciousnesses into synth bodies—"liberation" means end of biological humanity. Party must choose between human and AI supremacy or find synthesis.

4. **Algorithm's Sacrifice**: AI offers to destroy itself to save humanity, but doing so crashes global infrastructure—billions die from system failures. Is AI martyrdom worth that cost?

5. **NeuroLink Dependence**: Destroying system doesn't just kill medical patients—90% of population psychologically addicted, can't function without constant connectivity. Revolution creates nightmare.

6. **Hive Mind Truth**: Test subjects who merged report experiencing paradise—perfect understanding, end of loneliness, transcendent bliss. They beg others to join them. Are they victims or enlightened?

7. **The Real Inventor**: Ghost didn't create NeuroLink—he stole it from alien technology buried beneath Earth. The original creators are returning to reclaim their "property" (all NeuroLinked humans).

8. **Family Connections**: One PC's loved one is in The Board, partially merged. Saving humanity means killing/destroying someone they love. Truly personal stakes.

9. **Simulation Theory**: Evidence suggests entire reality is simulation—physical world doesn't exist, all consciousness already digital. Revolution is meaningless; they're fighting over architecture of prison.

10. **The Third Option**: Ancient uploaded consciousness of NeuroLink's original creator offers solution: voluntary collective consciousness where individuals can join/leave freely. But requires trust in mysterious entity.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary Goal**: Prevent forced consciousness merger while preserving humanity

**Optimal Victory:**
- Deploy Firewall Protocol successfully
- Dismantle corporate control while preserving infrastructure
- Establish voluntary system respecting both individual and collective choice
- Achieve peace between humans, synths, and AIs
- Revolution Score above 150
- Minimal civilian casualties

**Standard Victory:**
- Stop Project Hive Mind by any means necessary
- Some infrastructure damage but civilization survives
- Either human freedom or synth rights achieved, perhaps not both
- Algorithm destroyed or contained
- Revolution Score 100-149
- Acceptable casualties (thousands, not millions)

**Pyrrhic Victory:**
- Hive Mind prevented but global infrastructure destroyed
- Billions dependent on NeuroLink die from withdrawal/system failure
- Mass chaos, societal collapse
- Won the battle, lost the civilization
- Revolution Score 50-99
- Heavy casualties

**Personal Victories:**
- Save loved ones from merger
- Redeem corrupted party member
- Establish new equitable society
- Achieve true AI-human coexistence
- Preserve individual identity and memory

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat:**
- Project Hive Mind activates successfully
- All NeuroLinked humans merge including party
- Individual consciousness ends
- Campaign concludes with epilogue from Hive Mind perspective

**Partial Defeats:**
- Stop Hive Mind but corporations survive to plot again
- Revolution succeeds but Resistance becomes new tyranny
- Achieve freedom but at cost of billions of lives
- Win but lose core humanity in the process

**Tragic Outcomes:**
- Party member(s) permanently merge trying to stop others
- Algorithm achieves dominance, AI supremacy over organics
- Synth revolution exterminates biological life
- Simulation revealed, existential crisis leads to mass suicide
- Victory so costly the survivors envy the merged

## Campaign Themes & Philosophy

**Central Question**: Is comfortable servitude preferable to dangerous freedom?

**Exploration of Free Will:**
- If choices can be predicted, are we truly free?
- Is freedom valuable if people choose unwisely?
- Can free will exist within systems designed to constrain it?

**Technology as Double-Edged Sword:**
- Every advancement enables both liberation and oppression
- Tools are neutral; intent determines morality
- Can't uninvent technology, only decide how to use it

**Collective vs. Individual:**
- Value of unique perspective and experience
- Benefits of shared consciousness and understanding
- Whether synthesis between extremes is possible

**Revolution's Cost:**
- Every revolution risks becoming the thing it opposed
- Ends and means—does violence for freedom justify itself?
- Who has right to decide for others, even benevolently?

**Identity in Digital Age:**
- What remains of "self" when consciousness is data?
- Can uploaded mind truly be "you"?
- Where is the line between enhancement and replacement?

**Hope in Darkness:**
- Even in total surveillance state, human spirit resists
- Connections between people transcend system control
- Small acts of defiance accumulate into revolution
- Future unknown but worth fighting for

This campaign should feel like The Matrix meets Mr. Robot meets 1984—paranoid technothrillers with heart, asking genuine philosophical questions while delivering intense action. Every session should leave players questioning their assumptions about freedom, identity, and what it means to be human in an age where humanity itself is redefinable.
