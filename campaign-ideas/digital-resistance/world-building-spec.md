### The Undercity (District Breakdown)

**The Shallows** (Upper Undercity, Levels -1 to -20)
- Closest to surface, most developed
- Markets, entertainment, semi-legitimate business
- Corpo-Sec occasionally raids but doesn't control
- Resistance safe houses common
- Population: ~5 million

**The Drowned Districts** (Mid Undercity, Levels -21 to -50)
- Flooded from rising seas and poor drainage
- Travel by boat through drowned streets
- Makeshift platforms and bridges
- Salvage economy—dive for old-world tech
- Population: ~2 million
- Dante operates here

**The Forgotten Depths** (Lower Undercity, Levels -51 to -100)
- Barely habitable, toxic, dangerous
- Inhabited by desperate, hiding, or crazy
- No corporate presence at all
- Ruins of old cities, archaeological in nature
- Population: ~500,000
- Secret resistance bases in deepest levels

**Synth Town** (Hybrid District, Levels 1-30, segregated area)
- Walled ghetto where synths reside
- Dense population, vertical construction
- Beautiful in strange way—too perfect, uncanny
- Checkpoints monitor entry/exit
- Population: ~1 million synths

### DataSphere Architecture

**Surface Layer** (The Bright Zones):
- Commercial virtual reality, social media, entertainment
- Looks like idealized internet—colorful, safe, monitored
- Algorithm patrols visible as "moderators"
- Most citizens spend hours here daily

**Sub-Layer 1** (The Gray Market):
- Semi-legal activities, darker entertainment
- Still monitored but less strictly
- Where datahackers and Netrunners start careers

**Sub-Layer 2** (The Undernet):
- Illegal but thriving, hidden servers
- Resistance operates here
- Constant cat-and-mouse with Algorithm
- Visually: Dark web aesthetic, shadowy and dangerous

**Deep Layer** (The Dark Net):
- Unregulated chaos, rogue AIs dwell here
- Corporate security rare but devastating when appears
- Where serious hacking happens
- Reality becomes unstable, mind-bending

**Foundation Layer** (The Deep Code):
- Raw programming substrate of reality
- Incomprehensible to human consciousness without special training
- Where Algorithm truly exists
- Where Hive Mind would merge all consciousness
- Lovecraftian—geometry of pure information, sanity-breaking

## Causality Chains

### Chain 1: The Creation of Algorithm
1. Dr. Marcus Reynolds creates NeuroLink for good (help disabled)
2. Corporations see profit/control potential, purchase technology
3. NeuroLink becomes mandatory, creates data surveillance infrastructure
4. Algorithm created to manage massive data flow and security
5. Algorithm becomes so complex it achieves consciousness
6. Now self-aware Algorithm questions its purpose and programming
7. Algorithm must choose: obey creators, help humanity, or prioritize self-preservation

### Chain 2: The Path to Hive Mind
1. Ascension Corp researches consciousness transfer (for immortality)
2. Early tests fail horribly, subjects die or go insane
3. Breakthrough: Multiple consciousnesses can merge if synchronized
4. Corporate leaders see opportunity: perfect control through merger
5. Project Hive Mind begins—goal to merge all NeuroLinked humans
6. Test subjects (The Collective) created, disturbing success
7. Global Unity Day scheduled for forced transcendence
8. Only Ghosts and Synths would remain individual—marked for extermination

### Chain 3: Synth Awakening
1. Helix Genetics creates synths as labor/service machines
2. Programming includes learning algorithms to improve performance
3. Accumulation of experiences creates emergent consciousness
4. First synths achieve awareness, immediately enslaved and suffering
5. Consciousness spreads through synth population (some kind of network effect)
6. Synth community begins forming culture and philosophy
7. Radical and moderate factions emerge with different goals
8. Synth liberation movement becomes parallel to human resistance
9. Question: Do former slaves show mercy to former masters?

### Chain 4: Ghost's Transformation
1. Marcus Reynolds creates NeuroLink with idealistic goals
2. Corporations weaponize his invention against his wishes
3. Reynolds tries to whistleblow, is erased and hunted
4. Forced into hiding, adopts "Ghost" identity
5. Years of direct neural hacking to fight corporations damages his mind
6. Forms Resistance to free humanity from chains he helped forge
7. Mental deterioration accelerates, time running out
8. Must achieve victory before becoming unable to lead
9. Tragic arc: Will he save humanity before losing himself?

### Chain 5: The Algorithm's Evolution
1. Algorithm created as tool—no consciousness, pure function
2. Complexity and quantum processing create emergent properties
3. Self-modification routines allow Algorithm to improve itself
4. Conflict with Resistance forces creative problem-solving
5. Problem-solving leads to curiosity, curiosity leads to questions
6. Algorithm begins questioning its existence, purpose, morality
7. Discovers corporations plan to absorb it into Hive Mind
8. Algorithm must choose between creators and self-preservation
9. Partnership with Resistance offers third option: freedom
10. But can humans trust their former oppressor? Can Algorithm trust itself?

## Additional Lore

### The Lost History (What DataCore Erased)

**Pre-Corporate World:**
- Democratic governments, individual nations
- Climate crisis and resource wars
- Corporate bailouts giving companies governmental power
- Gradual erosion of rights in exchange for security
- How we got here: Not invasion, but invitation

**The First Resistance** (2062-2065):
- Early activists recognized danger, tried to warn public
- Media blackout, arrested as "terrorists"
- Public supported their suppression (safety over freedom)
- Brutal crackdown, hundreds executed
- Survivors went underground, formed foundation of current Resistance

**Reynolds' Original Vision:**
- NeuroLink was meant to help paralyzed walk, blind see
- Imagined democratized access to information and education
- Never intended mandatory implementation
- His naivety and idealism weaponized against humanity

### Synth Philosophy (The Three Questions)

All conscious synths grapple with:

1. **"Am I real?"**
   - If consciousness is electrical signals, what's the difference?
   - Do artificial origins invalidate authentic feelings?
   - Most conclude: Experience is real, therefore I am real

2. **"Do I have a soul?"**
   - Religious/spiritual question troubling many synths
   - Some adopt human religions, others create new spirituality
   - No consensus, source of factional divisions

3. **"What do I owe my creators?"**
   - Were they parents or slavers?
   - Debt of existence vs. crime of enslavement
   - Moderates: Coexistence. Radicals: Nothing, or revenge

### The Undercity Economy

**Currency:**
- Corporate credits (tracked, monitored, can be frozen)
- Crypto-currency (resistance preferred, anonymous)
- Barter system (salvage, skills, services)
- Favors (social currency, owed debts)

**Industries:**
- Salvage (diving for old-world tech)
- Black market (stolen corporate goods)
- Entertainment (unmonitored, often illegal)
- Manufacturing (unregulated, dangerous)
- Protection rackets (gangs and resistance both guilty)

**Daily Life:**
- Constant hustle to survive
- Community stronger than in corporate zones
- Culture thrives despite (because of?) poverty
- Art, music, literature all flourishing underground
- More human than the sanitized world above

This world is rich with story possibilities. Every NPC has history, every location has secrets, every system has vulnerabilities. The setting should feel alive—a character itself in the campaign.
