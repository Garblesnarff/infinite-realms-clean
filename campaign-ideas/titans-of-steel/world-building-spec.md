# Titans of Steel - World Building Specification

## World History
**Year 0 KW** (Kaiju War): First kaiju emerges in San Francisco, destroys city, kills military response. Six days to kill with nuclear strike. Massive casualties.

**Years 1-5 KW**: Kaiju attacks escalate. Conventional military fails repeatedly. Nations unite to form **Pan-Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC)**. Jaeger program begins—magitech fusion of multiple nations' best technology.

**Years 6-10 KW** (Campaign Era): Twenty+ kaiju defeated by Jaegers. Program works but costs escalate. Political tensions about funding vs Wall Initiative. Campaign begins in Year 8.

**Future Possibilities**: Campaign determines if war ends, escalates, or transforms into something new.

## Geography
**The Breach**: Pacific Ocean floor, 5 miles deep, portal to alien dimension.

**Shatterdomes**: Massive military bases in Hong Kong (primary), Sydney, Lima, Tokyo, Vladivostok, California (destroyed by kaiju early campaign).

**Coastal Evacuation Zones**: Cities within kaiju striking range maintain emergency protocols, sirens, shelters.

**Oblivion Bay** (California): Where damaged Jaegers stored/scrapped.

## Magic/Technology Fusion
**The Drift**: Magical neural interface allowing multiple minds to merge. Based on ancient telepathy spells, adapted for machine control.

**Jaegers**: 250-foot humanoid machines. Enchanted steel frames, magitech power cores (fusion + mana), plasma weapons (fire + lightning magic). Require 2-5 pilots in drift.

**Kaiju Blue**: Toxic kaiju blood, magically poisonous, contaminates areas for decades. Cleanup crews necessary.

**Precursor Technology**: Biological engineering, dimensional portals, cloning. Far advanced but incompatible with human biology.

## Inhabitants
**PPDC Personnel**: Multinational military force, 50,000+ staff. Jaegers pilots (hundreds total, fewer active), scientists, engineers, support.

**Civilians**: Live in fear of kaiju, evacuate regularly, love/resent Jaegers (heroes but represent failure of normal life).

**Kaiju**: Not alive—biological robots piloted remotely by Precursors. Category I-V determined by mass, aggression, special abilities.

**Precursors**: Aliens from dying world, ammonia-breathers, tentacled, ancient civilization. Desperate colonizers.

## Cultural Details
**Pilot Culture**: Celebrity status but isolated, only drift partners truly understand, high mortality rate, fame mixed with dread.

**Kaiju Cults**: Fringe groups worshipping kaiju as divine judgment/cleansing. Saboteurs occasionally.

**Wall Supporters**: Political faction wanting physical barriers instead of Jaegers (cheaper, less glorious).

**Media**: Kaiju attacks broadcasted, pilots are celebrities, merchandising (tasteless but happens), propaganda.

## Key Secrets
- Precursors tried invading millions of years ago (dinosaur extinction)
- Atmosphere changes make Earth habitable for Precursors (terraforming in progress)
- Drifting causes permanent neurological damage (pilots have shelf-life)
- Kaiju targeting isn't random—strategic terraform-ing sites
- Precursor homeworld is dying (justified desperation)
- Human government has contingency: global evacuation plan (abandon Earth)
- One Jaeger team went rogue, sympathizes with Precursors
- Closing Breach requires sacrifice (pilot stays behind as living seal)
- Kaiju parts black market (organized crime using kaiju organs for dark magic)
- Some scientists want to communicate with Precursors (peace faction secretly exists)

## Timeline
- **Year 0 KW**: First kaiju (Trespasser) attacks
- **Year 4 KW**: First Jaeger deployed (Brawler Yukon)
- **Year 5 KW**: Jaeger program proves effective
- **Year 8 KW**: Campaign begins (present day)
- **Year 10 KW**: Breach must be closed or full invasion begins (campaign deadline)

## Appendix
**Jaeger Roster** (Some die during campaign):
- Gipsy Danger (USA)
- Striker Eureka (Australia)
- Crimson Typhoon (China)
- Cherno Alpha (Russia)
- Party's custom Jaeger

**Kaiju Database**:
- Categories I-V (increasing threat)
- 20+ unique kaiju over campaign
- Final boss: Slattern (Category V, largest)

This world emphasizes **unity against impossible odds**, **personal sacrifice**, and **questioning the cost of victory**. Every session should feel epic but grounded in human (and alien) desperation.
