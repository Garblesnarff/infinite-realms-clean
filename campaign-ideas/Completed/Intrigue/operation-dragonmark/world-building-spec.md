# Operation Dragonmark - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Dragonmarked Bureau (The Eyrie)

**Foundation and History**
Established 347 years ago during the Dragon Wars, ostensibly to protect the Five Kingdoms from draconic threats. In truth, founded by a council of metallic dragons who wanted to monitor and control humanoid magical development. Over the centuries, human directors have gradually subverted this original purpose, though dragon influence remains.

**Organizational Structure**
- **Director (M-Level)**: Ultimate authority, answers only to the Minister
- **Double-O Division**: Licensed field operatives, authorized to kill
- **Single-O Division**: Intelligence analysts and support staff
- **Q-Branch**: Artificer and magical R&D department
- **Medical Wing**: Healers, therapists, resurrection specialists
- **Archives**: Information storage, both magical and mundane
- **Training Division**: The Academy, located in the Feywild
- **Wet Works**: Assassination specialists (officially doesn't exist)
- **Counter-Intelligence**: Mole hunting and internal investigations

**Current Personnel Roster**
- Director Morgantha (M): 28 years in position
- 12 Active Double-O Agents (including player characters)
- 47 Single-O Analysts
- Q-Branch Staff: 8 artificers, 15 assistants
- Medical Team: 3 clerics, 2 druids, 1 necromancer specialist
- Support Staff: 89 personnel
- Field Assets (Non-Bureau): 200+ informants worldwide

**Resources and Capabilities**
- Annual Budget: Classified (approximately 2 million gold)
- Magical Arsenal: Extensive, cutting-edge
- Information Network: Global reach, all major cities
- Safe Houses: 40+ locations across the planes
- Transportation: Teleportation circles, airships, planar vessels
- Cover Organizations: 15+ legitimate businesses

**Internal Politics**
- Old Guard vs. New Blood: Tension between traditional and modern methods
- Q-Branch vs. Field Ops: Constant friction over broken equipment
- Double-O Rivalry: Competition for prestigious assignments
- Dragon Loyalists: Secret faction maintaining original dragon agenda
- Reformists: Want to eliminate license to kill, more accountability

**The Dragon Secret**
The Bureau's founding charter, hidden in M's vault, reveals that the organization was meant to keep humanity weak enough to never threaten dragon supremacy. Recent directors have hidden this truth while using Bureau resources to defend humanity. This revelation would destroy the organization.

### Goldclaw's Dragon Ascendancy Cult

**Origin and Ideology**
Founded by the original Goldclaw (a bronze dragon named Auraxilonis) who believed humanoids had enslaved dragonkind through domestication and exploitation. The cult believes dragons are divine beings meant to rule, and humanoids should serve or be eliminated. Each new Goldclaw inherits the legacy and continues the mission.

**Three Generations of Goldclaw**
1. **Auraxilonis (Original)**: Bronze dragon polymorphed as human, created the Apocalypse Grimoire, died 200 years ago
2. **Marcus Goldenheart (Second)**: Auraxilonis's half-dragon son, expanded the cult, killed by Bureau 50 years ago
3. **Auric Drakkenheim (Current)**: Brilliant artificer and dragon cultist, adopted the mantle 15 years ago

**Current Organization**
- **Inner Circle**: 7 true believers, each seeking draconic ascension
- **Dragon Assets**: 4 chromatic dragons allied to the cause
- **Military Wing**: 200 elite soldiers, many half-dragons
- **Research Division**: 30 mages studying draconic transformation
- **Financial Network**: Vast wealth from centuries of operation
- **Political Influence**: Agents placed in governments worldwide

**The Apocalypse Grimoire**
An artifact-level spellbook that doesn't summon dragons—it contains the ritual to permanently transform the user into an ancient dragon. The process requires:
- Dragon blood from all five chromatic types
- Sacrifice of 100 sentient beings
- Casting during a celestial convergence
- Willing surrender of one's humanity
Success rate: 40%. Failure means death or worse.

**Holdings and Resources**
- Mount Infernus Volcano Base (primary headquarters)
- Auric Island (public facade and meeting place)
- 12 Hidden laboratories worldwide
- Gold reserves worth 5 million+ gp
- Army of 500+ including dragons, half-dragons, kobolds, and fanatics
- Magical weapons development ahead of Bureau tech

### The Northern Dominion Intelligence Service (NDIS)

**Overview**
The rival spy agency of the Northern Dominion, a cold authoritarian state ruled by the Iron Council. Ideologically opposed to the Five Kingdoms but pragmatic enough to cooperate against common threats.

**Philosophy and Methods**
Brutally efficient, no moral qualms about collateral damage. Believes in collective good over individual rights. Produces highly competent but somewhat mechanical agents. Values the state above all else.

**Key Operatives**
- **Dmitri "The Ghost" Volkov**: Best field agent, assigned to Goldclaw case
- **Director Ironov**: Ruthless pragmatist, respects Bureau from distance
- **Commissar Sokolov**: Political officer, true believer in Dominion ideology
- **The Widow**: Legendary female assassin, Dmitri's former partner

**Capabilities**
Larger than the Bureau but less sophisticated. Strong in signals intelligence and human assets. Weak in magical R&D. Excellent at infiltration and patient long-term operations.

**Relationship to Bureau**
Officially hostile, pragmatically cooperative when necessary. Both agencies maintain informal communication channels for world-ending threats. Unspoken rules govern their shadow war—no assassinating each other's directors, no operations in certain neutral zones, prisoner exchanges.

### The Crystal Covenant (Neutral Brokers)

**Purpose**
Ancient organization maintaining neutral ground for spy exchanges, peace negotiations, and information brokerage. Enforced by powerful magic preventing violence in their spaces.

**The Crystal Spire**
Located in the Astral Plane, accessible only by invitation. Perfect neutral ground. The Long Bar serves as informal meeting place where agents from all nations drink together in tense civility.

**The Broker Council**
Five members representing different power blocks:
- The Oracle (divination specialist)
- The Merchant (information trader)
- The Arbiter (dispute resolution)
- The Keeper (maintains the rules)
- The Shadow (unknown identity, maintains mystery)

**Services Offered**
- Spy exchanges
- Information sales (verified and rated for accuracy)
- Neutral territory for negotiations
- Magical communication services
- Witness to treaties and agreements
- Escrow for exchanges

### Independent Operators and Wild Cards

**The Whispering Network**
Underground information brokers with no loyalty except to profit. Key asset: Kreeg the Whisper (mind flayer in disguise) who runs the Underdark black market.

**The Silver Eclipse**
Assassins' guild that takes contracts from anyone with coin. Professional, discreet, expensive. Neutral in spy wars but will kill anyone for right price.

**The Order of the Broken Chain**
Freedom fighters who want to expose all spy agencies and end the shadow wars. Idealistic terrorists. Sympathetic goals, ruthless methods.

### The Mole Network

**The Minister (Blackwood)**: Compromised through blackmail (daughter held hostage)
→ Feeds Goldclaw Bureau operations schedule
→ Ensures funding and political protection
→ Blocks investigations that get too close

**Agent 005 (Lyra)**: Actually working for Goldclaw? Or triple agent? Changes based on player investigation
→ Feeds false intelligence sometimes
→ Sabotages certain operations
→ Motivation: Thrill-seeking or true belief?

**Q-Branch Technician**: Low-level mole, plants weaknesses in equipment
→ Gadgets fail at crucial moments
→ Tracking devices in Bureau gear
→ Recruited by Doctor Wyrm (former colleague)

**Archivist**: Provides Goldclaw with Bureau historical records
→ Research on Bureau capabilities
→ Personal files on all agents
→ Discovered dragon founding, selling to highest bidder

### The Vesper Timeline Paradox

**Original Timeline**: Goldclaw succeeds, transforms into ancient dragon, world falls
↓
**100 Years Later (Original)**: Vesper finds time magic, sent back to prevent
↓
**Current Timeline**: Vesper arrives 5 years before campaign start
→ Subtle manipulations to change events
→ Appears as Bureau asset, Goldclaw agent, independent operator
→ True agenda: Prevent transformation without destroying Bureau
→ Complication: Her interference may have accelerated Goldclaw's timeline
→ Ultimate truth: Success means she never existed (temporal paradox)

### The Dmitri Defection (Secret Cooperation)

**8 Years Ago**: Joint mission with Bureau agent (now dead) opens Dmitri's eyes
↓
**5 Years Ago**: Dmitri begins feeding selective intelligence to Bureau

↓
**Revelation**: The Widow knows and is helping him (or hunting him)
↓
**Resolution**: Dmitri must choose: defect openly, return to Dominion, or die maintaining cover

### Agent 008's Hidden Agenda

**Background**: 008 (Octavia) was on mission when her partner was killed by Goldclaw agent
→ Took mission personally, began unauthorized investigation
→ Discovered deeper conspiracy involving Bureau leadership
→ Believes someone in upper administration is compromised
→ Competitive with players is cover for her own investigation
→ Apparently betrays party to get closer to conspiracy
→ Actually running deep infiltration of Goldclaw organization
→ Players must decide: trust her or treat as traitor
→ Truth revealed in dramatic moment saves everyone

## Additional Lore

### The Dragonmark Curse

Dragonmarks are fragments of an ancient dragon god who was shattered in a cosmic battle millennia ago. Each mark contains a piece of its consciousness. The dragon god slowly reforms as marks are used, possessing bearers.

**Progressive Corruption**:
- Levels 1-5: Minor physical changes (eyes, nails, teeth)
- Levels 6-10: Personality shifts (draconic pride, greed)
- Levels 11-15: Partial transformation (scales, claws, wings)
- Levels 16-20: Risk of full possession by dragon god fragment
- Level 20: Choice to resist (lose mark), embrace (become vessel), or balance (synthesis)

**The Truth**: Goldclaw knows this. His ritual would unite all marks, reforming the god with himself as dominant consciousness. Players must decide if this is better or worse than original plan.

### The Shadow War History

For 300+ years, spy agencies have fought secret wars while public believes in peace. Major incidents:
- The Silent Massacre (200 years ago): Entire Bureau class killed, NDIS blamed but never proven
- The Poison Years (150 years ago): 5-year period of assassination trading, thousands dead
- The Treaty of Shadows (100 years ago): Unspoken rules established for shadow wars
- The False Peace (50 years ago): 10 years of almost no conflict, everyone preparing for major operation
- The Current Détente: Uneasy cooperation against common threats like Goldclaw

### Magic as Technology

In this world, magic has been weaponized and industrialized:
- Sending Stones mass-produced for communication
- Teleportation circles standardized for logistics
- Scrying networks for surveillance
- Enchantment magic for interrogation and assassination
- Divination for intelligence gathering
- Illusion for disguise and deception

This creates arms race between agencies:
- Who has better anti-scrying wards?
- Who can break whose encryption (magical ciphers)?
- Who has access to rarer spell components?
- Who can recruit the most talented casters?

### The Cost of Spycraft

Long-term effects of espionage life:
- Paranoia and trust issues
- Difficulty maintaining relationships
- Addiction to adrenaline
- Moral injury from necessary evils
- Identity confusion from deep cover
- PTSD from violent operations
- Bureau provides therapy but stigma remains

Many agents don't retire—they die, disappear, or are disappeared. The few who leave usually fall apart without the structure and purpose.

### The Next Generation

If campaign continues or players become directors:
- New threats emerge (planar espionage, extraplanar agencies)
- Technology changes spycraft (magical AI, golem agents)
- Young agents with different values
- Public becoming aware of shadow wars
- Demands for accountability and transparency
- Question: Can shadow agencies exist in light?

This world-building provides deep foundation for running Operation Dragonmark as long-term campaign with political intrigue, moral complexity, and epic spy action.
