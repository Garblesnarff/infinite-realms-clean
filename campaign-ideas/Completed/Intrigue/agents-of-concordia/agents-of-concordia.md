# Agents of Concordia
## *"The Enemy of My Enemy"*

### Campaign Overview

At the height of the Cold War between rival nations, two elite spies—one from each side—are forced to work together when a third faction threatens to escalate tensions into actual warfare. The players represent the two opposing intelligence agencies, assigned to partnership neither wants. As they chase international arms dealers, stop terrorist cells, and prevent nuclear-equivalent magical escalation, they discover that working with the enemy requires trusting them more than trusting your own side.

Set in the glamorous 1960s of magical espionage, this campaign mixes high-stakes action, buddy-cop chemistry between rivals, and the growing realization that both sides have been manipulated by someone who profits from the Cold War continuing forever. Fashion is impeccable, banter is sophisticated, and nobody can decide if they want to kiss or kill their partner.

### Plot Twists and Complications

**HYDRA Exists**: Third faction profiting from Cold War by supplying both sides equally.

**Handlers Compromised**: Someone in both agencies wants war, sabotaging peace.

**Waverly's Logic**: His plan to profit from eternal cold war is almost rational.

**The Torsion Device**: Magical WMD would devastate but also end war (mutually assured destruction).

**Disavowal**: Both agents declared rogue for refusing to betray partner.

**Gaby's Past**: Her father was Nazi scientist, complicated moral legacy.

**Victoria's Ideology**: True believer in fascism, not just mercenary.

**Uncle Rudi's Game**: Information broker playing all sides, knows everything.

**Solo's Debt**: American agent is criminal pardoned into service, could be revoked.

**Kuryakin's Family**: Eastern agent's family held as leverage by government.

**The Offer**: Waverly offers them partnership working for him, tempting.

**Romance Complications**: Real feelings developing during fake relationship cover.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Stop HYDRA; prevent Torsion Device activation; expose Waverly's conspiracy.

**Partnership**: Maintain trust and teamwork despite pressures to betray.

**Personal**: Each agent resolves their personal stakes (Solo's freedom, Kuryakin's family).

**Political**: Force détente between nations, reduce Cold War tensions.

**Perfect**: Destroy HYDRA completely; achieve actual peace; partners stay together (professionally, romantically, or both); reform intelligence community; look absolutely fabulous throughout.

### Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic**: Torsion Device activates; war begins; millions die; HYDRA profits.

**Partnership**: Agents betray each other; trust destroyed; manipulated against each other.

**Personal**: Solo returned to prison; Kuryakin's family killed; personally destroyed.

**Political**: Cold War escalates; HYDRA continues operating; manipulation continues.

**Moral**: Become as cynical and manipulative as those they fight; lose faith in anything.

### Campaign Tone

This is The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) meets Cold War spy thriller—style and substance, banter and danger, enemies-to-lovers potential with high-stakes espionage. Should feel glamorous and fun while maintaining real danger. Balance lighthearted moments with serious themes.

Emphasize the chemistry between rival agents. Let them bicker, compete, gradually respect and care for each other. Make missions stylish set-pieces with practical effects vibe. Fashion matters. Banter matters. Looking cool while defeating bad guys matters.

The 1960s setting allows for both period piece fun and commentary on Cold War absurdity. Both sides are mirror images, fed propaganda about the other. The real enemies are those profiting from division. And maybe, just maybe, if these two can work together, there's hope for everyone.

Also: car chases, tuxedos, cocktails, and sexual tension you could cut with a knife.
