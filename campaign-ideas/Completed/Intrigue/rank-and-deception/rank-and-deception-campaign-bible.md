Rank and Deception [TAG: CAMPAIGN]

Logline [TAG: LOGLINE]
In a rigidly stratified military society, a group of low-ranking soldiers uncovers a high-level conspiracy and must use cunning and deception to climb the ranks and expose the traitors before they are silenced permanently.

Premise [TAG: PREMISE]
The Starborne Imperium is a society built on military hierarchy, where social status is dictated by rank. The players are members of a grunt squad, considered expendable and insignificant. During a disastrous mission, they stumble upon evidence that their commanding officers are colluding with a hostile alien empire. Branded as traitors and hunted by their own military, they must navigate the treacherous, protocol-obsessed world of the Imperium, leveraging every rule and loophole to gain promotions, access classified information, and bring the conspiracy to light.

Core Conflict [TAG: CORE_CONFLICT]
The core conflict is an uphill battle against a corrupt and deeply entrenched military leadership. The players must fight a two-front war: a covert struggle against the conspirators within their own ranks and a desperate effort to survive the very institution they serve. They need to gather evidence and expose the traitors without being court-martialed or assassinated. This involves manipulating their way into higher positions, turning ambitious rivals against each other, and staying one step ahead of the powerful figures who want them dead.

Setting [TAG: SETTING]
The campaign is set aboard the 'ISV Sovereign,' a colossal city-sized battleship that serves as a mobile capital for the Starborne Imperium. The ship is a microcosm of their society, with stark divisions between the polished, sterile officer decks and the grimy, utilitarian crew quarters. The atmosphere is one of oppressive order and constant scrutiny, where every action is monitored and protocol is paramount. The setting combines the high-tech gloss of military sci-fi with the rigid social structure of a feudal society.

Major Factions [TAG: FACTIONS]
[The Officer Conspiracy] [TAG: FACTION]
A cabal of high-ranking officers, led by the charismatic Grand Admiral Thrawn, who believe the Imperium's leadership is weak and decadent. They are secretly negotiating with the rival Xylos Collective, planning to stage a coup and install a new, more militaristic regime with themselves at the top. They control vast resources and can manipulate military protocol to isolate and eliminate threats like the players.

[The Imperial Internal Affairs (IIA)] [TAG: FACTION]
The IIA is the Imperium's internal watchdog, tasked with investigating corruption and treason. While officially dedicated to justice, the IIA is a labyrinthine bureaucracy, and its local field office on the 'Sovereign' is led by the overly cautious and politically motivated Commander Valerius. The IIA could be the players' greatest ally if they can provide irrefutable evidence, but approaching them without it could be a death sentence, as the conspirators have informants within the agency.

[The Lower Decks Alliance] [TAG: FACTION]
An informal network of enlisted personnel and low-ranking officers who are disillusioned with the rigid hierarchy and the privileges of the officer class. They operate through whispers, favors, and a shared sense of solidarity. While not a formal organization, this alliance can provide the players with crucial grassroots support, from "misplacing" incriminating records to staging "accidents" for troublesome officers, if they can earn their trust.

Key NPCs [TAG: NPCS]
[Grand Admiral Kaelen] [TAG: NPC]
The brilliant, ambitious, and ruthless leader of the conspiracy. Kaelen is a master strategist and a decorated war hero, making him virtually untouchable. He sees the players as a minor annoyance to be swatted, but his arrogance can be exploited. He is the ultimate antagonist, representing the peak of the corrupt power structure the players must dismantle.

[Drill Sergeant Anya Sharma] [TAG: NPC]
The players' former drill sergeant, a tough-as-nails career soldier who is fiercely loyal to the Imperium but deeply cynical about its leadership. She is initially suspicious of the players' claims but may become a powerful mentor and ally if they can prove their loyalty and competence. She has an extensive network of contacts in the enlisted ranks and knows every dirty trick in the book.

[Lieutenant Jax, "The Weasel"] [TAG: NPC]
An ambitious and opportunistic junior officer who is always looking for an angle to advance his career. Jax is not part of the conspiracy but is happy to overlook wrongdoing if it benefits him. He can be a frustrating obstacle or a useful, if untrustworthy, pawn. The players can manipulate him by feeding him information that he can use to "uncover" minor infractions, thus boosting his career while serving their own goals.

Potential Quests [TAG: QUESTS]
[Promotion by Proxy] [TAG: QUEST]
To gain access to a restricted data terminal, the players need the security clearance of a Captain. They identify a competent but overlooked Lieutenant and orchestrate a series of events that make him look like a hero, securing his promotion. This involves sabotaging his rival, feeding him tactical advice during a simulation, and ensuring his heroics are "witnessed" by the right people.

[The Inspection] [TAG: QUEST]
A high-profile inspection of the players' new department by a neutral but powerful Moff is announced. The players must use the rigid inspection protocols to their advantage, planting evidence of the conspiracy in places they know the inspectors are required to check, while simultaneously covering their own tracks and ensuring their department passes with flying colors.

[A Court-Martial of Lies] [TAG: QUEST]
One of the players is framed for a serious crime by the conspirators and faces a court-martial. The other players must act as their legal counsel, using their knowledge of military law and procedure to discredit the evidence, expose the setup, and turn the trial into an indictment of the accusers, all without revealing their own covert investigation.

Unique Mechanics/Elements [TAG: MECHANICS]
The campaign features a "Rank" and "Influence" system. "Rank" is the players' official position in the military hierarchy, which determines their access, authority, and resources. It can only be increased through official promotions. "Influence" is a more fluid resource, representing their network of contacts, favors owed, and reputation among the enlisted and junior officers. Players can spend Influence to bypass protocol, gain access to rumors, or call in favors, but doing so might attract unwanted attention.

Tone and Mood [TAG: TONE]
The tone is a tense, political thriller set in a military sci-fi universe. It's a story of underdogs fighting a system that is designed to crush them. The mood is one of paranoia and ambition, where every interaction is a calculated risk and trust is a rare and valuable commodity.

Themes [TAG: THEMES]
The campaign explores themes of order versus justice, the individual against the system, and the nature of power and corruption. It examines how a rigid social structure can be both a source of stability and a shield for wrongdoing. The central theme is the idea that true honor is not about following orders, but about upholding principles, even if it means defying the very institution you serve.
