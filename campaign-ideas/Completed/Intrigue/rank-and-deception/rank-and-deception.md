# Rank and Deception
*"Your rank is hidden. Your identity unknown. One wrong guess means death. Find the flag or die trying."*

## Campaign Overview

The Stratego Kingdom exists on a 10x10 grid battlefield divided into Red Territory and Blue Territory by a central lake. Every citizen is a living game piece with a hidden numerical rank (1-10, plus special pieces). Scouts (rank 2) can move any distance, Spies (rank 1) can defeat Marshals (rank 10) through assassination, Miners (rank 3) can defuse Bombs, and the Flag is the ultimate prize—immobile and defenseless but worth everything.

The core mechanic: when two pieces meet in combat, both reveal their ranks simultaneously. Higher rank wins and lower rank is eliminated—except for special rules (Spy beats Marshal, Bomb destroys all except Miner). This creates a society built on deception, bluffing about your rank, and strategic positioning. The highest ranks (Marshals, Generals) are few and precious. The lowest ranks (Scouts, Spies) are numerous but weak.

The campaign begins when the unthinkable occurs: someone has captured the Flag while their own Flag remains hidden. This should be instant victory, but instead reality breaks—both sides claim victory simultaneously. Investigation reveals a conspiracy: someone is using shapeshifting technology to appear as multiple ranks simultaneously, and more disturbingly, some pieces have no rank at all—identity-less entities that shouldn't exist in rank-based reality.

The party must navigate a world where everyone's true identity is hidden, bluffing about ranks is survival, assassination attempts are constant, and the Flags (symbols of victory) are being manipulated. They'll plant Bombs (immobile explosive pieces that kill most ranks), send Scouts on reconnaissance, protect their precious Marshal, and ultimately discover that the ranked hierarchy itself is a prison—and the rankless pieces trying to destroy it might be liberators or anarchists.

## Core Themes

- **Hidden Identity**: No one knows anyone's true rank until conflict
- **Bluffing and Deception**: Pretending to be higher/lower rank than you are
- **Rank Hierarchy**: Social structure based on numerical superiority
- **Espionage and Intel**: Scouting, reconnaissance, information gathering
- **Strategic Positioning**: Where you place yourself determines survival
- **The Flag as Symbol**: What are you really fighting for?

## Campaign Sessions (28 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Initial Deployment (Sessions 1-7)
Party receives their hidden ranks. Learning Stratego mechanics—movement, combat, special abilities. First encounters where ranks are revealed. Discovery of the dual-Flag anomaly. Introduction to Red and Blue factions. Early reconnaissance missions to identify enemy positions.

### Arc 2: The Espionage War (Sessions 8-16)
Deep infiltration missions. Scouts gathering intelligence, Spies assassinating high-ranks, Miners disarming Bomb traps. Discovery of shapeshifters who can appear as multiple ranks. The party must maintain their hidden identities while exposing enemies. Political intrigue between ranks—Marshals versus Sergeants versus Scouts.

### Arc 3: The Rankless Revelation (Sessions 17-24)
Discovery of pieces with no rank—anomalies in the numbered system. They can't be defeated in normal combat (no rank to compare). They're either existential threats or the key to freedom from the hierarchy. The party must choose whether to preserve the rank system or help the rankless destroy it.

### Arc 4: The Flag Gambit (Sessions 25-28)
Final push to capture enemy Flag while protecting your own. Massive battles involving all ranks. Discovery that the Flag is not an object but a concept—the collective agreement to value hierarchy. Destroying the Flag means destroying rank-based reality. Final choice: preserve ranked society or embrace rankless chaos.

## Key NPCs

### The Red Marshal (Supreme Commander)
Highest possible rank (10), nearly invincible except to Spies. Commands Red army. Paranoid about assassination attempts. Believes ranked hierarchy is natural law that must be preserved at all costs.

### The Blue Marshal (Strategic Mastermind)
Red's counterpart. Equally powerful. Chess-like strategic thinker. Represents order and tradition. Will eliminate anyone who threatens the rank system, regardless of faction.

### The Spy Master (Rank 1, Assassin)
Lowest numerical rank but most dangerous to high-ranks. Can defeat Marshals through surprise. Leads an underground of Spies attempting to overthrow the hierarchy by eliminating all tens and nines.

### The Scout Commander (Rank 2, Intelligence Officer)
Can move any distance in straight lines. Master of reconnaissance. Knows the positions of nearly every piece on the board. Sells information to highest bidder.

### The Miner Colonel (Rank 3, Demolitions Expert)
Only rank that can safely defuse Bombs. Leads a guild of Miners who control which areas are safe to traverse. Can plant or remove Bombs, giving them unique power.

### The Bomb Keeper (Immobile Sentinel)
A living Bomb—explosive trap that destroys any piece except Miners. Philosophically tormented by being unable to move, existing only to kill. Represents the trap of single-purpose existence.

### The Flag Guardian (The Unmovable)
Sworn to protect the Flag at all costs. Rankless (or hidden rank). Cannot move from Flag position. Knows the secret of what the Flag truly represents.

### The Shapeshifter (Identity Thief)
Can appear as any rank. The anomaly breaking reality. Either a mutation, a technology user, or evidence that ranks are arbitrary. Key to understanding the identity crisis.

### The Rankless Prophet (Zero)
A piece with literally no rank. When encountered in combat, comparison is impossible—neither wins nor loses. They exist outside the system. Leading a movement to free all pieces from numerical identity.

### The False Flag (Decoy)
A piece that appears to be the Flag but isn't. This should be impossible (only one Flag per side) but exists anyway. Reveals that multiple "truths" can coexist.

## Major Locations

### The 10x10 Battlefield
Perfect grid divided into Red and Blue territories. Central lake divides the board. Each square can hold one piece. Terrain variations: some squares are obstacles, some are traps, some are strategic positions.

### The Lake (Impassable Barrier)
Eight central squares that cannot be entered. Divides the battlefield into two fronts. Forces armies to flank around it. Rumored to contain secrets about the origin of the rank system.

### The Back Rank (Home Territory)
Each army's starting four rows. Where Flags are hidden among Bombs and defenders. Penetrating enemy back rank means you're close to victory or walking into explosive traps.

### The Front Lines (Contested Zone)
Middle rows where most combat occurs. Constantly shifting as pieces advance and retreat. High casualty zone. Where ranks are most frequently revealed and pieces eliminated.

### The Bomb Fields
Regions seeded with immobile Bombs. Navigating them requires Miners or sacrificing pieces to discover which squares are trapped. Represents areas of pure danger.

### The Scout Highways
Open corridors allowing Scouts to travel rapidly. Strategic routes for reconnaissance and flanking maneuvers. Controlled by the Scout Commander's network.

### The Spy's Shadow
Underground network beneath the battlefield. Spies use it to move unseen. Accessible only to rank 1 pieces. Where assassination plots are planned.

### The Rank Vault
Where the numerical hierarchy is literally stored—mystical location containing the concept of ranks 1-10. Destroying it would erase the rank system entirely.

### The Flag Chamber
Each army has a sacred chamber where their Flag must be placed during initial deployment. Capturing enemy Flag Chamber is alternative victory condition.

### The Shapeshifter's Mirror
A location where identities become fluid. Pieces entering can temporarily change their perceived rank. Dangerous and illegal technology.

## Unique Mechanics

### Hidden Rank System
Each character has a secret rank (1-10). Rank is only revealed during combat. Higher rank wins combat except for special rules. Managing rank secrecy is crucial.

### Combat Resolution
When pieces meet, both reveal ranks simultaneously. Higher eliminates lower. Ties eliminate both. Special exceptions: Spy (1) beats Marshal (10), Bomb kills all except Miner (3).

### Movement Rules
Most pieces move one square orthogonally. Scouts (2) can move any distance in straight lines. Bombs and Flags cannot move at all. Strategic positioning determines power.

### Reconnaissance
Scouts can perform long-range scouting. Spies can infiltrate enemy territory. Successful reconnaissance reveals enemy ranks without combat. Information is power.

### Bluffing Mechanics
Characters can pretend to be different ranks. Deception checks to convince enemies you're higher/lower than you actually are. Called bluffs result in forced combat.

### Bomb Placement
Miners can plant Bombs in strategic locations. Bombs are immobile and destroy any piece except Miners. Creating explosive perimeters protects valuable pieces.

### Flag Protection
Each side has one Flag (must be protected) and must capture enemy Flag (victory condition). Flags cannot move or fight. Their location is top secret.

### Rank Progression
Characters might be able to gain promotions (increase rank) through achievements. A Sergeant (5) becoming a General (9) changes their combat capabilities dramatically.

### Shapeshifting
Through technology or mutation, some can appear as different ranks. This breaks fundamental rules and causes reality instability.

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: Ranks Are Arbitrary
The numerical hierarchy has no natural basis—it was imposed by ancient generals to create order. High ranks aren't inherently superior, just socially constructed.

### Twist 2: Everyone Has Multiple Ranks
Each piece simultaneously exists as all ranks (quantum superposition), and combat merely collapses them into one observed rank. Identity is fluid until measured.

### Twist 3: The Flag Is A Prison
The Flag doesn't represent victory—it's a prison holding pieces in the game. Capturing enemy Flag doesn't win; it traps you deeper.

### Twist 4: Bombs Are Conscious
The immobile Bombs are actually the highest consciousness—they've transcended movement and exist in meditative stillness. Their explosions are enlightenment.

### Twist 5: There Are No Enemies
Red and Blue armies are the same army—fragmented pieces fighting themselves. The war is internal conflict made external.

## Victory Conditions

### Capture the Flag
Traditional victory—infiltrate enemy territory, find their Flag among Bombs and defenders, capture it. This preserves the rank system and hierarchy.

### Assassination Victory
Use Spies to eliminate all enemy Marshals and Generals (ranks 10-8). Leaderless army crumbles. This weakens but maintains hierarchy.

### Destroy the Rank System
Ally with the Rankless movement. Destroy the Rank Vault. Free all pieces from numerical identity. Creates chaos but also freedom.

### Peaceful Negotiation
Convince both Marshals that the war is pointless. Achieve armistice. Both Flags remain protected. Eternal stalemate but no more death.

### Become Rankless
The party transcends their numerical identities, becoming entities beyond the rank system. Neither victors nor defeated—evolved.

## Defeat Conditions

### Rank Elimination
If character's rank is revealed and defeated in combat, they're eliminated from existence. Permadeath unless special resurrection.

### Flag Capture
If party's side loses their Flag to enemies, total defeat. All pieces on losing side are absorbed by winners.

### Bomb Annihilation
Walking into Bomb traps repeatedly. Each Bomb kills one piece. Attrition defeat through careless movement.

### Identity Collapse
If shapeshifting too frequently, identity fragments. Character loses all sense of self, becoming nameless void.

### Rank Madness
Obsession with hierarchy drives characters insane. They become unable to perceive anything except numerical superiority and inferiority.
