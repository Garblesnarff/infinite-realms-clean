Project Mayhem Rising [TAG: CAMPAIGN]

Logline [TAG: LOGLINE]
A cell of disillusioned urban anarchists declares war on the soulless consumerism of their metropolis, executing escalating acts of "creative destruction" to awaken the city's populace before the authorities close in.

Premise [TAG: PREMISE]
In the neon-drenched, hyper-commercialized city of OmniCorp Prime, a charismatic and enigmatic leader known only as "The Narrator" forms a subversive organization called Project Mayhem. The players are new recruits, drawn to the group's anti-consumerist philosophy and its promise of liberation from the mundane. They begin by participating in small-scale acts of sabotage and cultural disruption, but as the project's ambitions grow, they find themselves at the heart of a city-wide conflict against a monolithic corporate security force and a society that worships the very chains they seek to break.

Core Conflict [TAG: CORE_CONFLICT]
The core conflict is a guerrilla war of ideology and action between Project Mayhem and the omnipresent OmniCorp. Players must execute increasingly daring missions to disrupt the city's consumerist infrastructure—from hacking digital billboards to sabotaging new product launches—while evading OmniCorp's technologically advanced and ruthless security forces. The conflict is also internal, as players grapple with the moral implications of their actions and the fine line between liberation and terrorism, all while navigating the volatile internal dynamics of their anarchist cell.

Setting [TAG: SETTING]
The campaign is set in OmniCorp Prime, a sprawling, futuristic metropolis where every surface is a screen and every citizen is a consumer. The city is a stark landscape of gleaming corporate towers, labyrinthine underground maintenance tunnels, and forgotten, off-grid neighborhoods. The atmosphere is a blend of cyberpunk dystopia and biting social satire, where the sterile, branded aesthetic of the corporate districts clashes with the chaotic, graffiti-covered hideouts of the city's counter-culture.

Major Factions [TAG: FACTIONS]
[Project Mayhem] [TAG: FACTION]
An underground anarchist collective dedicated to dismantling consumer culture through "creative destruction." Led by The Narrator, the group is organized into autonomous cells that carry out acts of sabotage, performance art, and psychological warfare. Their goal is not to seize power, but to force the city's populace to question the system they live in. Their methods are unpredictable, ranging from harmless pranks to large-scale property destruction.

[OmniCorp Security Solutions (OSS)] [TAG: FACTION]
The private police force of OmniCorp, granted municipal authority. The OSS is a highly organized, technologically advanced security apparatus that uses mass surveillance, riot control drones, and heavily armed corporate enforcers to maintain order and protect corporate assets. Led by the pragmatic and ruthless Director Valerius, the OSS views Project Mayhem as a terrorist threat that must be neutralized at all costs.

[The Adbusters Collective] [TAG: FACTION]
A rival group of activists who believe in non-violent resistance and culture jamming. They see Project Mayhem's destructive methods as reckless and counter-productive, believing they only serve to justify OmniCorp's oppressive security measures. They may act as rivals, saboteurs of Mayhem's plans, or potential allies who could be radicalized or, conversely, could offer a path to a less violent form of revolution.

Key NPCs [TAG: NPCS]
[The Narrator] [TAG: NPC]
The enigmatic and dangerously charismatic founder of Project Mayhem. The Narrator's true identity is a mystery; he is a master of rhetoric who can inspire intense loyalty and radical action. His motivations are a mix of genuine revolutionary zeal and a deep-seated personal vendetta against OmniCorp. He is the players' mentor and mission commander, but his increasingly extreme methods will force them to question his sanity and leadership.

[Director Valerius] [TAG: NPC]
The calculating and efficient head of OmniCorp Security Solutions. Valerius is not a cackling villain, but a corporate true believer who sees Project Mayhem as a chaotic force threatening a stable, prosperous society. He is a brilliant strategist who uses data analysis and predictive policing to hunt the players' cell, representing the cold, logical, and oppressive nature of the system they are fighting.

[Marla "Glitch" Singer] [TAG: NPC]
A cynical and resourceful information broker who operates in the city's digital underground. Glitch is not a member of Project Mayhem but is often contracted by them for her hacking and data-gathering skills. She is a free agent who plays all sides, and her loyalty is always for sale. She can be a vital asset, a dangerous liability, or a source of crucial information that challenges the narratives of both Project Mayhem and OmniCorp.

Potential Quests [TAG: QUESTS]
[Operation: Brandalism] [TAG: QUEST]
Project Mayhem's opening salvo. The players must infiltrate the city's central advertising network hub and replace all the ads on the digital billboards with subversive art and anti-consumerist messages for one hour. This requires bypassing digital security, physically accessing the broadcast tower, and holding off the initial OSS response.

[The Corporate Art Heist] [TAG: QUEST]
The players are tasked with "liberating" a famous piece of minimalist art from the OmniCorp headquarters lobby—a piece that is famously just a blank white canvas. The goal is not to steal it, but to replace it with a vibrant, chaotic mural painted by the community of an off-grid neighborhood, forcing the corporate elite to literally face the people they ignore.

[Zero Day] [TAG: QUEST]
The Narrator's ultimate plan. The players must infiltrate the OmniCorp Credit & Debt database headquarters and trigger a massive data wipe, resetting everyone's financial records to zero. This is the point of no return, a large-scale operation that will trigger a city-wide lockdown and force the players to confront the full might of the OSS and the potentially devastating consequences of their actions.

Unique Mechanics/Elements [TAG: MECHANICS]
The campaign uses a "Heat" and "Anonymity" system. "Heat" represents the level of OSS attention on Project Mayhem as a whole, increasing with each major operation and unlocking more advanced and aggressive tactics from OmniCorp. "Anonymity" is a personal stat for each player, representing how well they've protected their real identity. Certain actions, like getting caught on camera or leaving behind evidence, can decrease Anonymity. If a player's Anonymity reaches zero, the OSS discovers their true identity, putting them and their entire cell in imminent danger.

Tone and Mood [TAG: TONE]
The tone is a satirical, high-octane thriller with a strong anti-establishment bent. It's a mix of dark humor, philosophical monologues, and intense, fast-paced action. The mood is one of rebellious energy and paranoia, a feeling of being part of a secret, important fight against a monolithic, soulless system.

Themes [TAG: THEMES]
The campaign explores themes of consumerism and identity, freedom vs. control, and the morality of radical action. It delves into the allure of chaos and the fine line between being a revolutionary and a terrorist. A central theme is the question of whether a corrupt system can be changed from within, or if it must be torn down completely, and what the human cost of that destruction might be.
