# Campaign Bible: The Impossible Vault

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Anchor of Improbability
The Grand Celestial Casino is not merely a building; it is a containment vessel built atop the "probability Anchor"—a metaphysical scar in reality where the laws of cause and effect are thin. Eons ago, the Goddess of Fortune and the God of Entropy fought a duel here. Their blood mingled, creating a localized reality where luck is not an abstract concept, but a harvestable, viscous liquid known as "Chance-Matter." The Casino captures this energy to power the city, meaning the house literally *always* wins because the architecture sucks the luck out of the patrons to keep the lights on.

### Historical Timeline
1.  **The Fracture (Pre-History):** The metaphysical duel cracks reality; the region becomes a chaotic badlands where gravity rolls a d6 every hour.
2.  **The First Bet (300 years ago):** A wandering nomad bets his soul against a chaotic wind spirit and wins, solidifying the first foundation stone.
3.  **The Goldweaver Ascension (150 years ago):** The Goldweaver family discovers how to refine raw Chance-Matter into fuel.
4.  **The Glinting Plague (100 years ago):** A contagion turns citizens into solid gold statues. Lord Midas’s grandfather sells the "cure" (which was just stalling the transmutation).
5.  **The Architecture War (80 years ago):** A conflict between Euclidean Mages and Non-Euclidean Architects. The Architects won; the Casino now has rooms that are larger on the inside.
6.  **The Castellan Catastrophe (20 years ago):** Darian’s father attempts to democratize luck. He is framed for "metaphysical embezzlement" and erased from history by the Mages.
7.  **The Silence of the Slots (10 years ago):** For one hour, every machine in the city stopped. No one knows why, but 400 people vanished instantly.
8.  **The Neon Reformation (5 years ago):** Bioluminescent algae replaced all streetlamps, creating a living, breathing light system that changes color based on the city's collective mood.
9.  **The Weeping Ace (2 years ago):** A card was dealt in a high-stakes game that showed a face crying blood. The player died of grief instantly.
10. **The Tournament Decree (Present Day):** Lord Goldweaver announces the "Tournament of Eclipses," distracting the populace from the failing Probability Anchor beneath the vault.

### The "Why"
The conflict exists because Lord Midas Goldweaver is not just hoarding gold; he is hoarding *probability*. He intends to drain the Anchor dry to attain godhood, which will cause the rest of the world to suffer an apocalypse of permanent bad luck (crops failing, stars falling). The heist isn't just for money; it's to release the luck back into the ecosystem.
