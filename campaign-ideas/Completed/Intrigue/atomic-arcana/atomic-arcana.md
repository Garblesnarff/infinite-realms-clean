# Atomic Arcana
## *"I'm Not Going to Die in Berlin"*

### Campaign Overview

Berlin, the divided city, November 1989. The Wall is about to fall, the Cold War is ending, and everyone in the intelligence community is scrambling to secure leverage for the new world order. The players are deep-cover operatives tasked with retrieving a list of double agents before it falls into the wrong hands. Over the course of one brutal week, they must fight through both sides of the city, navigate shifting loyalties, and survive in a world where no one can be trusted—not their handlers, not their allies, and certainly not themselves.

This is espionage at its most visceral and unforgiving. No gadgets, no backup, no cavalry coming. Just brutal close-quarters combat, desperate improvisation, and the question of what you're willing to do to survive. Every punch lands, every betrayal hurts, and at the end, you might not remember who you were before Berlin.

### Core Themes

- **Survival**: Not heroism, just making it through alive
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No right choices, only necessary ones
- **Lone Operative**: Can't trust backup, rely on self
- **Violence Has Consequences**: Combat is brutal, injuries matter
- **The Personal Cost**: What you lose becoming this person
- **End of Era**: World changing, trying to survive transition
- **Damaged People**: Everyone is broken, question is how
- **Trust is Suicide**: Except when it's not

- Choice defines character

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Percival's Game**: Station chief is double agent selling to all sides for personal profit.

**The List's Truth**: Contains evidence of Western war crimes, not just Soviet agents.

**Handler's Orders**: Gray wants list destroyed to protect British operations, not delivered.

**Delphine's Death**: Innocent French operative killed, personalizes the cost.

**Spyglass's Courage**: Asset is just father trying to protect family, not spy material.

**The Wall Falls**: Historic moment happens during operation, chaos and opportunity.

**Both Sides Betrayed**: Neither East nor West wants truth exposed.

**Gascoigne's Loyalty**: Station chief's second is only honest person, probably dies.

**The Beatings Continue**: Physical toll is real, accumulating damage.

**The Whole Truth**: Players learn they were also being investigated, surveillance on them.

**No Clean Exit**: Survival means compromise, maybe becoming what you fought.

**The Debrief**: Final session is interrogation, questioning everything that happened.

### Victory Conditions

**Survival**: Make it through Berlin alive, physically and mentally.

**Mission**: Retrieve and deliver (or destroy) the list as ordered (or not).

**Justice**: Expose corruption and war crimes, even if costs everything.

**Personal**: Maintain humanity despite what required to survive.

**Perfect**: Complete mission, survive, save Delphine, expose conspiracy, escape Berlin with truth, don't become monster in process (nearly impossible).

### Defeat Conditions

**Death**: Don't survive Berlin, physically or mentally.

**Failure**: List falls into wrong hands, conspiracy succeeds.

**Corruption**: Become as amoral as Percival, lose self in the game.

**Broken**: Survive but destroyed, PTSD and guilt overwhelming.

**Betrayed**: Used and discarded by handlers, made scapegoat.

### Campaign Tone

This is Atomic Blonde directly—stylish brutality, gritty realism, complicated moral landscape. Every fight is exhausting and painful. There are no gadgets to save you, no backup coming, just your skills, will to survive, and increasingly questionable choices.

Combat should be visceral and consequential. Use extended scenes for fights—make them feel long, tiring, desperate. Players should feel relief when combat ends, not disappointment. Describe accumulating damage, exhaustion, desperate improvisation.

The campaign is fundamentally about survival and cost. Make players question their orders, their handlers, their methods. Put them in situations with no good choices. Let them make mistakes and live with consequences. The spy game strips away everything until all that's left is will to survive.

Also: amazing soundtrack, killer fashion despite (because of?) the violence, and at least one fight scene that takes an entire session. This is Charlize Theron's stairwell fight translated to D&D, and it should be exhausting, brutal, and unforgettable.

Welcome to Berlin. Try not to die.
