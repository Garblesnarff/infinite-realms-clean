### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Hero: The Nameless Warrior**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party, led by "Nameless," gains an audience with the King of Qin by claiming to have defeated three legendary assassins. Through color-coded narrative layers (red=deception, blue=deeper truth, white=ultimate truth), they must determine whether the King's brutal unification justifies assassination or protection.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the Warring Kingdoms and centuries of conflict before Qin's rise.
    *   Write about the three assassins' backgrounds and their original oath to kill the King.
    *   Describe the King of Qin's philosophy of unification and the cost of his methods.
    *   Explain the significance of calligraphy in martial arts philosophy.
    *   Detail the concept that "the greatest warrior chooses not to fight."

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **The Assassins** - Goal: Originally to kill the King, but Broken Sword's philosophy changes this.
    *   **The Kingdom of Qin** - Goal: Unify all kingdoms under one rule, ending war through strength.
    *   **The Warring States** - Goal: Maintain independence even at the cost of continued conflict.
    *   **The Party** - Goal: Discover the truth and make the morally correct choice (undefined what that is).

**4. NPC Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** King of Qin, Broken Sword, Flying Snow, Sky, Moon, Nameless.
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Palace guard," "Qin archer (thousands)," "Calligraphy student," "Kingdom diplomat."

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Palace Throne Room:**
        *   Landmarks: The throne, the approach distance (measured in paces), guards in formation.
        *   Encounters: Philosophical debates, the King's challenges to the story, the final choice.
    *   **Calligraphy School (Red Story):**
        *   Landmarks: Hanging scrolls, practice yard, Sky's chamber.
        *   Encounters: Combat among students and scrolls, artistic duels, deception and misdirection.
    *   **The Desert (Blue/White Stories):**
        *   Landmarks: Endless sand, isolated structures, lake of mirrors.
        *   Encounters: Philosophical duels, tragic confrontations, truth revelations.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party tells only the red story → King orders their execution for obvious lies.
*   **IF:** Party reveals the blue story too quickly → King suspects manipulation.
*   **IF:** Party chooses assassination → Kingdoms remain divided, war continues, but freedom persists.
*   **IF:** Party chooses protection → King unifies the realm through tyranny, creating peace through oppression.
*   **IF:** Party discovers a third path → Perhaps convincing the King to unify through diplomacy instead of conquest (extremely difficult, requiring perfect philosophical arguments).
