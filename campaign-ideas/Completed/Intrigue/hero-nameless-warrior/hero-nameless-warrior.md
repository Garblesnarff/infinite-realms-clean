## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Hero: The Nameless Warrior
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Political Intrigue / Philosophical Wuxia / Assassination Plot
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **11–12**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The King of Qin is uniting the warring kingdoms through brutal conquest, and three legendary assassins—Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow—have sworn to kill him. The party, led by a warrior known only as "Nameless," gains an audience with the King by claiming to have defeated all three assassins. But nothing is as it seems: each telling of the assassins' deaths reveals a different truth, and the party must navigate layers of deception to determine whether the King's vision of unity justifies his methods—and whether they will become his executioners or his protectors.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc told through nested narratives with color-coded truth levels.

*   **Act I — The Red Story (Sessions 1–5):** The party arrives at the palace claiming to have killed the three assassins. They tell an elaborate story (colored red for passion and deception) of defeating each legendary warrior. The King is impressed but suspects lies. This act establishes the assassins' abilities and the party's strategic thinking.
*   **Act II — The Blue Story (Sessions 6–10):** The King challenges the party's story, revealing inconsistencies. They tell a second version (blue for melancholy and deeper truth) revealing that the assassins were lovers torn apart by duty and vengeance. The party worked with Broken Sword, who chose not to kill the King. This act explores themes of sacrifice and love versus duty.
*   **Act III — The White Story (Sessions 11–15):** The final truth (white for purity and revelation): the entire plan was Broken Sword's philosophical gambit. He believed that only the King could end the warring kingdoms' suffering by unifying them, even through tyranny. The party must choose: complete the assassination and maintain the warring states, or protect the King and enable his brutal but potentially peaceful empire.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Audience with the King"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Frame Narrative
*   **Key Events:** The party gains audience with the paranoid King of Qin; they claim to have defeated the three legendary assassins; the King grants them proximity based on this claim
**Escalation:** The King demands proof and the full story of how they accomplished this impossible feat.

### Sessions 2-5 — "The Red Story: Passion and Deception"
*   **Focus:** First Narrative / Combat Showcases
*   **Key Events:** The party tells an exaggerated story: they defeated Sky in a massive chess house battle, seduced Flying Snow to learn Broken Sword's location, and killed Broken Sword in a desert duel
**Escalation:** The King identifies logical flaws in the story and presents evidence they're lying. (These sessions are flashbacks/narrative within narrative)

### Sessions 6-10 — "The Blue Story: Love and Sacrifice"
*   **Focus:** Second Narrative / Deeper Truth
*   **Key Events:** The party reveals a sadder truth: Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers; the King's conquest separated them; Broken Sword had the opportunity to kill the King but refused; Flying Snow, betrayed by this choice, turned her anger on the party
**Escalation:** The King understands this story better but recognizes it still contains deception. He reveals he knows Broken Sword's philosophy.

### Sessions 11-12 — "The White Story: Philosophy and Truth"
*   **Focus:** Final Truth / Philosophical Debate
*   **Key Events:** The complete truth: Broken Sword sent the party to the King not to kill him, but to understand his vision of unity. The assassins' quest was about discovering whether one tyrant's peace is worth more than freedom's chaos
**Escalation:** The King and the party engage in philosophical debate about the cost of peace.

### Sessions 13-15 — "The Choice"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Moral Decision
*   **Key Events:** The party stands within striking distance of the King, weapons in hand. They must choose: assassination or protection. Combat may erupt with royal guards, or the King may accept his fate
**Resolution:** Based on the party's choice, the kingdom is unified under tyranny or remains fractured in war. There is no perfect answer—only consequence.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores whether peace through tyranny is better than freedom through endless war, whether love survives philosophical disagreement, and whether individual heroism matters against historical forces. The central question: Is the King a villain for uniting the kingdoms through violence, or a hero for ending centuries of war?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Color-Coded Narrative Layers**
*   Different sessions use different visual and thematic palettes representing truth levels.
*   Red (Sessions 2-5): Passion, lies, exaggeration. Combat is spectacular but not fully true.
*   Blue (Sessions 6-10): Melancholy, deeper truth. Combat is emotional and tragic.
*   White (Sessions 11-15): Pure truth, simplicity. Combat is philosophical and meaningful.

### 2. **Calligraphy as Combat**
*   Characters can learn to fight using calligraphy brushes as weapons.
*   The style of writing determines the style of combat.
*   This is represented by choosing a "character" before battle that grants specific bonuses.

### 3. **Philosophy Debates**
*   Major confrontations include philosophical arguments before physical combat.
*   Winning the debate can grant advantage in the subsequent fight or even avoid combat entirely.
*   The King respects intellectual opponents.

### 4. **The Assassination Window**
*   Throughout the campaign, the party has multiple opportunities to kill the King.
*   Each opportunity has different consequences based on timing and method.
*   The final choice is whether to use the ultimate opportunity or protect him.

### 5. **Relationship Dynamics**
*   Track relationships between the three assassins and how the party's stories affect them.
*   In the blue and white stories, these relationships are playable flashbacks where the party embodies the assassins.
