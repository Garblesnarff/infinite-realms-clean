# Campaign Bible: The Revolutionaries' Anthem

## 1. Deep Lore & History
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Symphony of the Iron Quill
In the beginning, the world of *Novus Orbis* was formless static until the Prime Conductor, Emperor George the Eternal, penned the "Grand Score." Using the Aether-Ink of the Void, he wrote the immutable laws of physics and society into a massive, floating obsidian tablet known as *The Lexicon*. For centuries, the Empire has maintained order through "Harmonic Law"—a magical rigidity where citizens must move, speak, and work to the rhythm of the Metronome Guard. But now, a dissonance has risen. From the slums and the docks, immigrants and outcasts have discovered "The Improvisation"—a chaotic magic that allows them to rewrite small sections of reality through passionate, rhythmic speech (Spoken Word/Rap). The Revolution isn't just a war for land; it is a battle to edit the universe's source code.

### Timeline of the Rebellion
1.  **The First Measure (Year 0):** The Empire establishes the Colony of Yorktown; the local gravity is magically increased to force "bowing" posture.
2.  **The Silence Act (Year 150):** Public singing and non-approved poetry are punishable by tongue-excision.
3.  **The Ink Drought (Year 170):** The Crown monopolizes Aether-Ink. The cost of writing a letter exceeds the cost of a house.
4.  **The Whispering Tea Party (Year 173):** *Surreal Event.* Rebels dump crates of "Sonic Tea" into the harbor; the water screams insults at the Governor for three days.
5.  **The Massacre of Blank Pages (Year 174):** Metronomes execute a crowd of protestors for holding up blank signs (implying unauthorized thought).
6.  **The Pamphlet Storm (Year 175):** Alexander the Brilliant invents the "Auto-Scribe Press," flooding the streets with sentient flyers that latch onto faces and read themselves aloud.
7.  **The Winter of Frozen Words (Year 176):** *Surreal Event.* At Valley Crossing, the cold is so intense that spoken words freeze in mid-air; soldiers must thaw out orders over campfires to hear them.
8.  **The Duel at Dawn (Year 177):** General Stoneheart fights the Imperial Champion. Stoneheart wins not by shooting, but by rapping a verse so potent it shatters the Champion's monocle and morale.
9.  **The Great Edit (Year 178):** The first attempt to magically erase a Tax Law from the Lexicon results in the temporary disappearance of the color blue.
10. **The Current Stanza (Year 180):** The Constitutional Convention begins. The goal: Write a new Anthem powerful enough to overwrite the Emperor's Score.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The conflict is between **Prescription** (The Empire/Federalists: Reality is fixed, ordered, and safe) and **Improvisation** (The Revolutionaries/Republicans: Reality is fluid, dangerous, and free). If the Empire wins, free will is mathematically eliminated. If the Revolutionaries win, reality might dissolve into cacophony if not anchored by a strong "Constitution."
