# The Eternal Feast
## "A Restaurant at the Crossroads of All Realities"

### Campaign Overview

The Eternal Feast is a legendary restaurant that exists between dimensions, accessible from any world through hidden doorways that appear to those who truly need a good meal. The party are the newly hired staff—cooks, servers, hosts—working in a restaurant where customers might be gods, demons, dragons, or desperate refugees, sometimes all at the same table. Every dish must be perfect because dissatisfied customers can literally rewrite reality, and the restaurant's neutrality must be maintained or dimensional war erupts.

The party quickly discovers they weren't hired randomly. The previous owner mysteriously vanished, and someone must figure out how to run an interdimensional restaurant while uncovering what happened to them. Each service brings new challenges: Cooking for beings with impossible dietary requirements, mediating disputes between cosmic entities, sourcing ingredients from across the multiverse, and maintaining the delicate balance that keeps the restaurant standing. As the party grows in skill and authority, they'll learn that the Eternal Feast isn't just a restaurant—it's the neutral ground that prevents the multiverse from collapsing into war.

This campaign blends Restaurant to Another World's wonder with the high-stakes diplomacy of managing a place where the wrong meal could end universes. Every shift is an adventure, every customer a potential ally or catastrophe, and every meal a chance to touch infinity.
