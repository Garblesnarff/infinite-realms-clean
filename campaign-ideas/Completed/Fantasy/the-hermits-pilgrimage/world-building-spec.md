# The Hermit's Pilgrimage - World-Building Specification

## The Deep Cave's Nature

The cave exists physically and psychologically simultaneously. It's a real mountain with actual passages, but it's also an internal landscape of self-exploration. Each person experiences it differently because they're navigating their own psyche as much as stone corridors.

## How Separation Works

The cave physically separates visitors to enforce solitude. You cannot find your companions even if you try. The separation is metaphysical—you're in the same mountain but different psychological space. This forces genuine self-reliance and introspection.

## The Hermit's Role

For a thousand years, he has guided seekers through their inner journeys. His lantern represents the light of wisdom—not giving answers but illuminating so seekers find their own. He's dying because wisdom-keeping is exhausting. Someone must take his place or the light goes out forever.

## The Lantern's Symbolism

The lantern is literal and metaphorical. It provides physical light in darkness AND psychological insight. It runs on wisdom—the more you learn about yourself, the brighter it burns. If you lie to yourself or avoid truth, it dims.

## Solitude vs. Loneliness

The cave teaches the difference. Solitude is chosen aloneness with peace and growth. Loneliness is unwanted isolation with pain. The Lonely One chose solitude but did it wrong—isolated from others without confronting self. The Hermit chose solitude AND self-knowledge—isolated but whole.

## The Mirror Pool

Shows your true self without social masks. Not your appearance but your nature. Most people can't stand looking. The reflection shows what you hide from others and from yourself. Accepting this reflection is key to wisdom.

## Echo Chamber Connections

Party can hear each other faintly across the cave's distance. Proves they're still connected even in separation. Shows that solitude doesn't mean abandonment. You can be alone without being cut off.

## The Summit's Meaning

When you complete the inner journey, the paths reconverge at the mountain's peak. This symbolizes integration—you needed separation to grow, but completion includes return. Hermit wisdom isn't staying isolated forever; it's going alone to find yourself, then returning with what you learned.

## Individual Trials

Each character faces their specific psychological obstacle:
- One might face pride
- One might face shame
- One might face trauma
- One might face identity confusion

The cave custom-generates trials based on what each person most needs to confront.

## The Wisdom Economy

No traditional currency. The cave values insight. Understanding yourself is the treasure. Sharing that understanding enriches others. The more wisdom you gain, the more light you carry. Light is wealth here.

## The Return Journey

Ascending is different from descending. Going down was confronting darkness. Coming up is carrying light. You're changed. The cave tests if you can maintain wisdom when reuniting with others or if you'll lose yourself again in relationships.

## The Hermit's Succession

Someone must stay. The mountain needs a lantern-bearer. Either one party member volunteers (hero's sacrifice) or they rotate (shared duty) or they find another way (creative solution). But the wisdom must be maintained somehow.

## Philosophy of the Hermit

- You cannot know others until you know yourself
- Wisdom requires silence to hear
- Solitude is temporary phase, not permanent state
- The goal is integration: Whole alone AND whole together
- Teaching is the completion of learning

## Mysteries

- Can you be truly wise without solitude?
- Is the Hermit's isolation noble or selfish?
- What happens if no one takes the lantern?
- Can you maintain enlightenment in the noisy world?
- Is separation illusion or necessity?
