# Campaign Bible: Academy of Legends

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Echo of the First Story
In the beginning, there was only the **First Story**, a narrative so potent it willed itself into existence. From its echoes, the world was born, and every living being became a character, destined to play a role. The "Academy of Legends" is not a school; it is a living archive of these echoes, a place where the greatest stories are studied, re-enacted, and sometimes, rewritten. Its purpose is to train "Legend-Weavers," individuals capable of tapping into the First Story's power to shape reality itself. The conflict arises because the First Story is fading, its echoes growing weaker, causing the world to lose its narrative cohesion. Heroes forget their quests, villains lose their motivation, and reality itself begins to unravel into meaningless fragments.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Echo):** The First Story wills itself into existence, creating the world and its inhabitants.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Age of Archetypes):** The first sentient beings emerge, embodying archetypal roles: The Hero, The Villain, The Mentor, The Trickster.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Great Narrative):** The Academy of Legends is founded by the **Grand Chronicler**, who discovers that stories can be woven into the fabric of reality.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Plot Hole Plague):** The First Story begins to fade, causing "plot holes" to appear in reality. People forget their names, objects vanish, and logic breaks down.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Hero's Journey Protocol):** The Academy develops a universal "Hero's Journey" template, forcing certain individuals into archetypal roles to maintain narrative cohesion.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Unreliable Narrator Incident):** A rogue Legend-Weaver attempts to rewrite the First Story, causing history to become fluid and contradictory.
7.  **-500 Y (The Fourth Wall Breach):** A powerful Legend-Weaver, frustrated with their role, wishes to "speak to the author." They briefly glimpse the fading First Story, driving them mad.
8.  **-100 Y (The Fading Echoes):** The First Story's echoes grow weaker, causing heroes to lose their motivation, villains to lose their drive, and reality to unravel into meaningless fragments.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Chapter):** A vital chapter of the First Story, the "Chapter of Resolution," is stolen from the Academy, causing all conflicts to become endless.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new students at the Academy, each with their own unique narrative potential. They are caught in a crisis as the First Story fades, and the world threatens to unravel into meaningless fragments.

### The "Why": The Meaning of Existence
The central conflict is the struggle between **Narrative and Nihilism**. The First Story provides meaning, purpose, and direction to existence. But as it fades, the world loses its narrative cohesion, plunging into a state of meaningless chaos. The Academy fights to preserve the First Story, to remind the world of its purpose, and to prevent reality from unraveling into meaningless fragments. The party's struggle is not just to become Legend-Weavers, but to defend the very concept of meaning, to prove that their lives have purpose, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably meaningless.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Narrative Cohesion
*   **Cohesion Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the Grand Narrative. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Cohesion:** Following tropes, resolving plot points, making narratively satisfying choices.
*   **Losing Cohesion:** Breaking tropes, creating plot holes, making illogical or unexpected choices.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Cohesion:* Reality is stable, predictable. GNEA agents are less active.
    *   *Low Cohesion:* Reality is unstable, unpredictable. Plot holes appear, Narrative Golems spawn.
    *   *0 Cohesion:* The Narrative collapses, leading to a chaotic, nonsensical reality.

### Subsystem: Archetype Points
*   **Archetype Points:** Players earn Archetype Points by leaning into specific archetypes (e.g., "Hero," "Rogue," "Mentor").
*   **Spending Points:** These points can be spent to gain temporary abilities associated with that archetype (e.g., a "Hero" can spend a point to gain advantage on a saving throw against fear).
*   **Breaking Archetype:** Players can choose to defy their archetype, but doing so costs Archetype Points and may lead to a loss of Narrative Cohesion.
