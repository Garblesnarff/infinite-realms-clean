# Campaign Bible: Baba Yaga's Bargain

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Whispering Woods' Dream
In the beginning, the world was a vast, silent forest, dreaming. The **Whispering Woods** was not just a place; it was a sentient entity, a primordial consciousness that dreamed the world into existence. Its dreams were wild and untamed, filled with ancient spirits, forgotten gods, and the raw magic of creation. Baba Yaga is not just a witch; she is the **Woods' Nightmare**, a manifestation of its deepest fears and darkest desires, a force that seeks to twist its dreams into a grotesque reality. Her hut, the **Dancing Hut**, is not a dwelling; it is a fragment of the Woods' subconscious, a place where reality bends to her will. The conflict arises because the Whispering Woods is dying, its dreams growing weaker, causing its nightmares to bleed into the world, threatening to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of twisted magic.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Dream):** The Whispering Woods dreams the world into existence.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Birth of Baba Yaga):** The Woods' Nightmare manifests as Baba Yaga, a force that seeks to twist its dreams into a grotesque reality.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Dancing Hut):** Baba Yaga's hut, a fragment of the Woods' subconscious, manifests as the Dancing Hut, a place where reality bends to her will.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Sleep):** The Whispering Woods falls into a deep slumber, its dreams shaping the world's early myths.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Nightmare Plague):** A powerful echo of the Woods' Nightmare sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember their deepest fears, driving many to madness.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Woods-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Woods' dreams, weaving them into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Woods' Nightmare causes all beings to remember their deepest fears, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Woods' Whisper):** The Whispering Woods, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate power.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Dream):** A vital fragment of the Woods' dream, the **Essence of Hope**, is stolen from Baba Yaga, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at Baba Yaga's hut, each with their own unique connection to dreams. They are caught in a crisis as the Whispering Woods' dreams grow weaker, and its nightmares threaten to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of twisted magic.

### The "Why": The Price of Dreams
The central conflict is the struggle between **Dreams and Nightmares**. The Whispering Woods' dreams, though wild and untamed, represent the richness and complexity of existence. But Baba Yaga, as the Woods' Nightmare, seeks to twist these dreams into a grotesque reality, erasing all beauty and hope. The Woods-Weavers fight to preserve the Woods' dreams, to remind the world of its purpose, and to prevent reality from unraveling into meaningless fragments. The party's struggle is not just to become Woods-Weavers, but to defend the very concept of hope, to prove that life is worth dreaming, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by nightmares.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Dream Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted dreams, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to Baba Yaga's nightmares, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Dream-Weaving
*   **Dream-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the dreams of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Nightmare Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Nightmare Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Dream Injection:** Dream-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom dreams into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Dream-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
