Koschei the Deathless has stolen the Firebird and hidden his soul, plunging the Slavic lands into eternal winter where rusalka spirits drown the unwary and ancient evils wake from slumber. The party, marked by encounters with Baba Yaga who offers dark bargains in exchange for completing impossible tasks, must journey through deep forests and stranger places seeking Koschei's hidden soul while navigating the dangerous gifts and prices demanded by Slavic folklore's most terrifying figures. They'll discover that Baba Yaga, Koschei, and the Firebird are locked in cosmic balance between death and rebirth, and their interference will determine whether spring ever returns or winter reigns eternal.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Dark Fairy Tale Logic:** Slavic folklore is brutal—bargains have hidden costs, and kindness can be as dangerous as cruelty.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Baba Yaga isn't evil, Koschei has reasons, the Firebird brings both blessing and curse.
*   **Impossible Tasks:** Quests follow folkloric patterns—sort impossible seeds, find invisible paths, answer unanswerable riddles.
*   **Transformation Curses:** Characters risk permanent transformation into animals, objects, or spirits.
*   **Eternal Winter:** Environmental hazards from endless cold, starvation, and darkness.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act journey through Slavic folklore's darkest tales.

*   **Act I — The Endless Winter (Sessions 1–4):** The Firebird vanishes and eternal winter descends. The party encounters Baba Yaga who offers knowledge in exchange for completing three impossible tasks. They learn Koschei the Deathless has stolen the Firebird and must seek his hidden soul.
*   **Act II — The Deep Forest (Sessions 5–8):** They journey through enchanted forests encountering rusalka, leshy, and other spirits. Each creature offers aid at terrible prices. They gather magical items needed to challenge Koschei while learning why he sought immortality and what the Firebird truly represents.
*   **Act III — The Soul Quest (Sessions 9-12):** They seek Koschei's soul hidden in progressively smaller containers—island, oak, hare, duck, egg, needle. Each layer reveals more about the cosmic balance between death and life. Baba Yaga's true role as guardian of transitions becomes clear.
*   **Act IV — Death and Rebirth (Sessions 13–16):** They confront Koschei with his soul, but destroying it means disturbing the balance Baba Yaga maintains. They must broker new terms between Koschei, the Firebird, and Baba Yaga—determining whether the Slavic lands experience natural cycles or remain locked in single seasons based on divine whims.

## Central Conflict

Death versus immortality and the necessity of cycles. Koschei hid his soul to escape death, but immortality without death means stagnation—no rebirth, no spring, no renewal. The Firebird represents transformation through destruction—necessary but terrible. Baba Yaga maintains the boundary between life and death, testing those who would cross it. The party must decide if death is enemy or necessary teacher, if immortality is blessing or curse, and whether cosmic cycles matter more than individual survival.
