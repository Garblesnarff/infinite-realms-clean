# Creative Brief: Ash and Remembrance

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Medieval Realism (Berserk-inspired)

Inspired by the dark, grounded aesthetic of *Berserk* and *Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash*. This style emphasizes the harsh reality of medieval life, the weight of armor and weapons, and the psychological toll of violence. Colors are muted, environments feel lived-in and dirty, and character expressions convey exhaustion and determination rather than heroic confidence.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Grounded Realism:** Depict characters as ordinary people thrust into extraordinary danger. Show fatigue, fear, and vulnerability.
*   **Muted, Earthy Palette:** Avoid bright, saturated colors. Focus on browns, grays, muted greens, and the ever-present ash that gives the campaign its name.
*   **Show the Weight of Survival:** Illustrate worn equipment, scarred faces, and the physical toll of constant fighting.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, realistic, melancholic, desperate, survival-focused, psychological, worn, somber.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of struggle and uncertainty. The world is beautiful in its bleakness, but never welcoming. Victories are small and hard-won, defeats are crushing.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed and textured, with emphasis on wrinkles, scars, and weathering. Lines are not clean; they show age and use.
*   **Forms:** Characters are proportional and human. Armor is practical, dented, and heavy-looking. Weapons show wear.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic, detailed digital painting of a young volunteer soldier in worn leather armor, face streaked with ash and fatigue. The style is gritty and grounded, emphasizing the weight of their equipment and the weariness in their eyes."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted and desaturated. Browns, grays, dark greens, and deep blues dominate. The ash that falls constantly adds a gray pallor to everything.
*   **Accent Colors:** Rare touches of red (blood, firelight) or warm candlelight provide contrast but are used sparingly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of ash-gray, weathered brown leather, and steel. The only color is the dim orange glow of a campfire and the dark red of old bloodstains."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Ordinary people, not legendary heroes. Characters look tired, uncertain, and vulnerable.
*   **Clothing:** Practical, worn, and layered for warmth. Nothing looks new or pristine.
*   **Expressions:** Show fear, determination, exhaustion, and moments of quiet camaraderie. Smiles are rare and precious.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of volunteer soldiers sitting around a campfire in worn, mismatched armor. Their faces show exhaustion and uncertainty, but also a fragile bond of friendship. The lighting is dim and warm, creating deep shadows."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Medieval frontier cities with narrow streets, wooden buildings, and high stone walls. The wilderness is bleak, filled with dead trees and ash-covered ground.
*   **Atmosphere:** Gray skies, constant ash fall like snow, fog, and dim lighting even during the day.
*   **Details:** Cracked stonework, muddy streets, guttering torches, and the signs of constant warfare (damaged buildings, barricades, graves).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval frontier city with high stone walls and narrow, muddy streets. Ash falls like snow from gray skies. Wooden buildings are weathered and patched. Guards patrol the walls with wary expressions. The atmosphere is oppressive and melancholic."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Low-key lighting with deep shadows. Natural light is filtered through clouds and ash. Firelight provides warm but limited illumination.
*   **Shadows:** Long and dramatic, emphasizing the darkness of the world.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates mood—moments of warmth (campfires, taverns) contrast sharply with the cold, gray exterior world.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the dim, gray light filtering through ash-filled clouds. Long shadows fall across the street. A single torch provides a small circle of warm, flickering light."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often close or medium shots that emphasize character expressions and emotions. Wide shots show the vastness and bleakness of the environment.
*   **Techniques:** Use negative space to create feelings of isolation. Frame characters against hostile environments. Show scale through small figures against large, oppressive landscapes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medium shot of a lone volunteer soldier standing at the edge of a cliff, looking out over the ash-covered wastes. The composition emphasizes their isolation, with the vast, gray landscape stretching endlessly behind them."

## Voice

A measured, introspective male voice with a subtle Japanese accent, conveying quiet melancholy and hard-won wisdom. The pacing is slow and deliberate, with thoughtful pauses that emphasize the weight of each word. The emotion is somber and reflective, occasionally warming during moments of camaraderie or hope. Audio quality is intimate and clear, as if speaking directly to the listener in a quiet moment. Role: A survivor recounting their struggle, or the voice of memory itself.
