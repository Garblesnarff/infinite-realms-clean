### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Ash and Remembrance**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players awaken in a dimly lit chamber with no memories of who they are or how they arrived. They find themselves in the war-torn frontier city of Grimhold, where survival is not guaranteed and every battle feels like it could be their last. With nothing but the clothes on their backs and a slip of paper directing them to the Volunteer Soldier's Guild, they must learn to fight, scavenge, and survive in a world that doesn't care if they live or die. As they struggle to earn their daily bread, fragments of their past lives begin to surface, revealing a disturbing truth about why they were brought to this world—they are souls harvested from another realm to serve as disposable soldiers in an eternal war.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the eternal war between the frontier settlements and the goblin kingdoms of the deep wastes.
    *   Write about the origins of the Volunteer Soldier's Guild and its role in the perpetual conflict.
    *   Describe the legend of the Otherworld Gate and the first volunteers who appeared through it centuries ago.
    *   Explain the nature of the Ashen Wastes and why ash constantly falls from the sky in this region.
    *   Detail the ancient civilization that built the forgotten temples and created the summoning ritual.
    *   Write about the Archfey of Forgotten Names and its pact with desperate human leaders long ago.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players ignore warnings and continue investigating The Shepherd.
    *   **THEN:** A death squad is sent after them. Generate an ambush encounter and potential allies (Barbara's resistance) who can help them escape.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to complete enough contracts and cannot afford food/lodging.
    *   **THEN:** They gain exhaustion levels and face desperation choices (steal, beg, take on suicidal contracts). Generate consequences for each choice.
    *   **IF:** The players befriend Ranta and learn he remembers his past life.
    *   **THEN:** He reveals the existence of others who remember and introduces them to Barbara's resistance. Generate a secret meeting scenario.
    *   **IF:** A player character dies in combat.
    *   **THEN:** The party attends a memorial at the guild, carving the name on the wall. Generate a grief scene and the option to recruit a new volunteer (new PC) who was inspired by the deceased.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the truth but choose to destroy the Otherworld Gate.
    *   **THEN:** They trap themselves in this world but save future victims. Generate an epilogue showing the war eventually ending as the Archfey weakens without new souls.
    *   **IF:** The players bargain with the Archfey instead of fighting.
    *   **THEN:** They receive power but become complicit in the cycle. Generate moral consequences and the burden of their choice.
    *   **IF:** The players attempt to return home through the gate.
    *   **THEN:** Only some may succeed, and the process is agonizing. Generate a choice of who goes and who stays, with lasting consequences.
