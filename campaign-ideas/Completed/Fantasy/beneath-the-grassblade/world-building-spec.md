# World-Building Specification: Beneath the Grassblade

## Scale Physics

### Size
- Party: 2-5 millimeters tall
- Ants: 2-6 mm (equal or larger)
- Beetles: 5-30 mm (car to truck sized)
- Spiders: 5-15 mm (comparable)
- Bees: 15 mm (bus-sized)
- Grassblades: 100-300 mm (30-100 foot trees equivalent)

### Physics Changes

**Surface Tension**
- Water droplets support weight
- Can walk on puddles
- Getting wet = heavy water coating
- Difficult to dry

**Terminal Velocity**
- Air resistance dominates
- Falls rarely lethal
- Can survive drops from tree heights

**Climbing**
- Surface irregularities exploitable
- Can scale smooth surfaces using friction
- Specialized grips help

**Strength-to-Weight**
- Small size = proportionally stronger
- Can lift many times body weight
- Jump distances increase

## Insect Societies

### Ants (Military Collective)
- Organized colonies, clear hierarchy
- Workers, soldiers, queens
- Chemical communication (pheromones)
- Fungus farming agriculture
- Tunnel network architecture

### Bees (Merchant Empire)
- Hexagonal wax construction
- Honey production and trade
- Flower/pollen collection economy
- Queen-led bureaucracy
- Flight capability advantage

### Spiders (Independent Traders)
- Web architecture specialists
- Solitary or small groups
- Silk as construction material
- Hunting/trapping expertise
- Trade hub operators

### Crickets (Bards/Information Network)
- Musical communication
- Long-distance sound transmission
- Story-keeping culture
- Neutral information brokers

### Beetles (Varied Cultures)
- Many species, many cultures
- Some domesticated by mini-humans
- Heavy armor (chitin)
- Strong but slow

## Miniaturized Human Society

### Smallville Structure
- Built from found objects
- Bottle cap houses
- Needle weapons
- Thread rope
- Fabric clothing

### Returner vs. Adapter Philosophy
- **Returners:** Want normal size, miss families, see small-life as imprisonment
- **Adapters:** Embrace freedom, no responsibilities of giant-world, new purpose
- Conflict drives NPC drama

### Technology
- Scavenged human items repurposed
- Insect domestication
- Silk harvesting from spiders
- Honey trade from bees

## Environmental Hazards

### Weather
- **Rain:** Each drop massive impact, flooding
- **Wind:** Can blow away party
- **Cold:** Hypothermia more dangerous
- **Heat:** Dehydration faster

### Predators
- Birds: Sky-based threats
- Lizards: Ground hunters
- Centipedes: Armored dragons
- Mantises: Ambush predators

### Everyday Dangers
- Lawn mowers: Catastrophic
- Pesticides: Toxic zones
- Footsteps: Earthquakes
- Garden hose: Tsunami

## The Choice

### Returning to Normal
- **Pros:** Reunite with loved ones, familiar life, safety from micro-predators
- **Cons:** Lose micro-world access, abandon insect allies, return to mundane existence

### Staying Small
- **Pros:** Adventure continues, insect allies, unique experiences, purpose
- **Cons:** Separation from normal-sized world, constant danger, no return to previous life

### Limited Capacity
- Wizard can only restore some
- Creates moral dilemma
- Who deserves normal size?
- Children? Those with families? Longest trapped?

## DM Customization

### Difficulty
- Weather frequency and severity
- Predator encounter rates
- Insect civilization hostility
- Wizard location distance

### Tone Options
- **Wonder Focus:** Beautiful micro-world, friendly insects, exploration
- **Horror Focus:** Deadly predators, survival tension, isolation fear
- **Balanced:** Mix of both

### Expansion
- Campaign continues at small scale
- Explore beyond garden to neighborhood
- Multiple wizard-shrinking incidents
- Quest to make size-shifting controllable

### Integration
- Gateway to permanent micro-scale adventures
- Party gains size-shifting ability
- Insect allies in future normal-scale adventures
- Environmental protection theme
