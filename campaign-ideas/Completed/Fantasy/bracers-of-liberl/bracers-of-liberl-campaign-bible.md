# Bracers of Liberl: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The world of Zemuria is a living, feeling entity. Its lifeblood is not magma, but "Orbal Energy," a force generated by the emotional resonance of the planet's crust. For millennia, this energy was drawn upon in small, sustainable ways by mystics, artists, and empaths. It was the force that made songs moving, paintings beautiful, and love profound. Fifty years ago, the "Orbal Revolution," pioneered by the brilliant Professor Epstein in the Kingdom of Liberl, changed everything. Epstein discovered how to mechanize the extraction and use of Orbal Energy, creating a technological utopia of airships, firearms, and automated factories. But this industrial-scale extraction came at a terrible cost. The revolution is "strip-mining" the planet's soul. The world is literally fading; colors are becoming muted, flavors are less intense, music is becoming formulaic, and people are slowly sinking into a placid, grey apathy. The "Bracers" are a non-governmental guild of adventurers, investigators, and peacekeepers, founded to deal with the societal upheaval caused by the Orbal Revolution. They are the world's therapists and problem-solvers, tasked with helping the common people, but they are now finding themselves on the front line of a metaphysical crisis they were never meant to handle.

### Timeline
1.  **The Age of Resonance (Ancient History):** All magic is "emotional," powered directly by the user's connection to the planet's soul. Great works of art are also great works of magic.
2.  **The First Disharmony (c. -2,000 years):** A great, emotionless, dragon-like being, a "Hollow," appears and consumes the emotional energy of an entire empire, leaving it a grey, silent ruin. It is defeated by a hero who "out-feels" it.
3.  **The Dark Ages (c. -1,200 to -500 years):** A period of chaos and war. The constant negative emotions create "Distortions" in the Orbal field, spawning monsters and making life difficult.
4.  **The Founding of the Bracer Guild (c. -450 years):** The Bracer Guild is founded to protect civilians from monsters and act as a neutral peacekeeping force between nations.
5.  **The Orbal Revolution (c. -50 years):** Professor Epstein's discoveries in Liberl lead to the mass production of Orbal technology. Airships, factories, and modern conveniences spread rapidly.
6.  **(Surreal) The Great Fade (c. -25 years):** Over the course of a single year, the color blue becomes 10% less vibrant across the entire world. Only a few artists and mystics notice. This is the first sign of the planet's "emotional drain."
7.  **The Hundred Days War (c. -10 years):** The technologically advanced Erebonian Empire invades the Kingdom of Liberl, seeking to control its Orbal technology. The war is fought with airships and Orbal rifles. Liberl, with the help of the Bracer Guild, repels the invasion, but the massive expenditure of Orbal energy accelerates the "fading."
8.  **(Surreal) The Day of Silence (c. -5 years):** For 24 hours, no one on the planet is capable of laughing. All attempts at humor fail, all jokes fall flat. The silence is deafening.
9.  **The Appearance of the Hollow Zones (c. -1 year to present):** The first "Hollow Zones" appear—areas where the Orbal field has completely collapsed. Within these zones, magic fails, technology sputters and dies, and emotions are non-existent. People who wander in become placid, empty shells.
10. **(Surreal) The Color-Thief (c. -1 week):** A mysterious phenomenon begins where people's most cherished, colorful memories are turning to black and white in their minds. The planet's soul is beginning to "reclaim" its emotional energy in a desperate attempt to survive.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a battle between Utility and Beauty, Progress and Passion. The Orbal Revolution is not an evil, but a "solution" that has created a far greater problem. The world is dying not from a plague or a war, but from apathy. The players, as Bracers, are uniquely positioned to deal with this. Their job is to help people, but how can you help a world that is forgetting how to feel? The central conflict is not about defeating a dark lord, but about finding a way to re-ignite the world's soul. Can they find a "new," sustainable way to use Orbal energy? Can they convince the world to give up its modern conveniences to save its own heart? Or will they be forced to fight the ultimate enemy: a creeping, comfortable, and utterly soul-crushing ennui?

**Mechanics:** The bracers grant the wearer advantage on all checks made to "protect" a civilian from harm. Once per day, the wearer can use the "Bracer's Vow," declaring a single person or location as being under their protection. For the next 24 hours, the wearer always knows the direction and distance to that person or place, and can suffer no harm from them (or from within that location).

### 2. Epstein's Final Equation
**Type:** Artifact (Scroll)
**Description:** A single, complex, and beautiful equation, written on a scroll of strange, metallic paper. It is Professor Epstein's final, unpublished work.
**Mechanics:** A creature who can understand the equation (requiring a very high INT check) can use it to "re-tune" the Orbal network. This can be used to either shut it down completely, overload it, or, if combined with other components, shift it to a new, sustainable form of energy use. It is, in effect, the "source code" for the world's magic and technology.

### 3. The Symphony of Colors
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Musical Score)
**Description:** The Maestro's masterpiece, a symphony so complex and emotionally powerful that the notes themselves seem to glow with color.
**Mechanics:** If the symphony is performed correctly (requiring a series of high DC Performance checks), it overloads the Orbal field in a 10-mile radius. All Orbal technology ceases to function, and all creatures in the radius are flooded with pure, raw emotion, causing them to act on their deepest feelings for 1 hour. It is a weapon of mass emotional chaos.

### 4. The Gralsritter's Oathbow
**Type:** Legendary Longbow
**Description:** A beautiful, ancient longbow, passed down through the ranks of the Septian Church's holy knights. It does not fire arrows, but bolts of pure faith.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 longbow. It does not require ammunition. Its attacks deal radiant damage instead of piercing. The wielder can use their Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls. As an action, they can fire a "Hallow-Seeking Arrow." This arrow will travel any distance and through any barrier to strike the nearest "Hollow" or creature of pure negative emotion.

### 5. The Grandmaster's Gameboard
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A beautiful, ornate gameboard for a game that no one recognizes. It has pieces representing all the major players in the world: The Bracers, the Empire, the Church, Ouroboros.
**Mechanics:** This is a direct link to the Grandmaster of Ouroboros. By moving a piece on the board, the user can "suggest" a course of action to that faction. There is a chance (determined by the DM) that the faction will follow the suggestion, as the Grandmaster incorporates it into her plan. **Curse:** Every time the board is used, the user's own "piece" becomes more entangled in the Grandmaster's game, making it more likely that they will be targeted by Ouroboros in the future.

7.  **A Single, Perfect, Flavorless Apple:** An apple that is beautiful, crisp, and has the perfect texture, but has absolutely no taste.

10. **The Anti-Nostalgia Charm:** A small charm that, when held, makes you feel that things were probably better in the old days, but not by much.
11. **A Bottle of "Schrodinger's Wine":** A bottle of wine that is simultaneously a fine vintage and a cheap vinegar, until it is opened.
12. **The Bureaucrat's Dream:** A rubber stamp that, when used on a document, makes it look incredibly official, but also adds three new, unnecessary forms that need to be filled out.

14. **The Artist's Despair:** A paintbrush that can only paint in shades of grey.

17. **The Philosopher's Lunchbox:** A lunchbox that, when opened, contains a sandwich and a small, handwritten note with a deeply unsettling philosophical question.
18. **A Single, Self-Tying Shoelace:** A shoelace that will automatically tie itself into a perfect knot. It is, however, a terrible conversationalist.
19. **The "Good Enough" Medal:** A medal awarded for "competence in the face of overwhelming odds." It's made of tin.
20. **A Clock That Runs on Emotion:** A small, Orbal clock that runs faster when people around it are happy and slower when they are sad. It is, therefore, a terrible time-keeping device.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Resonance
Orbal energy is emotional energy. This has tangible effects on all magic and technology.
*   **Emotional Casting:** When casting a spell, a player can choose to tie it to a strong, personal emotion. If they can roleplay this effectively, they can add their Charisma modifier to the spell's damage or healing. However, if they do this, they also risk "emotional feedback," taking 1d6 psychic damage per level of the spell.
*   **Technological Apathy:** Orbal devices function less effectively in areas of low emotion. In a sad, apathetic town, an Orbal lamp might only produce dim light. In a Hollow Zone, it will not work at all. Conversely, in a place of high emotion (a festival, a battlefield), devices may become "overcharged," becoming more powerful but also more unstable.
*   **Art as Magic:** A truly great work of art (a song, a painting, a poem) can function as a magic spell. A Bard's song might literally be able to heal, or a painter's work might be able to create a wall of force. This is rare and difficult, requiring a very high performance or craft check.

### Subsystems: The Fading and Resonance Points
*   **The Fading:** This is a background mechanic that the DM tracks. As the campaign progresses and more Orbal energy is used, the world becomes more "faded." The DM should reflect this in their descriptions: food is less flavorful, colors are more muted, etc. This can have mechanical effects, such as imposing disadvantage on checks to perceive beauty or find inspiration.
*   **Resonance Points:** Players can gain Resonance Points (RP) by performing acts of great passion, creativity, or emotion. This can be anything from giving a rousing speech, to painting a beautiful picture, to declaring their love. These points can be spent to "boost" an action, adding a powerful emotional component to it. They can also be used to temporarily "re-ignite" a small area, pushing back the Fading and allowing Orbal tech to function at full capacity.
