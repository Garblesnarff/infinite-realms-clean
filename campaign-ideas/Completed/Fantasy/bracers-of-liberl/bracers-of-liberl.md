### Core Premise
The players are members of the Bracer Guild - an independent organization that helps citizens with problems ranging from finding lost cats to stopping monsters. They operate in the Kingdom of Liberl, a small but technologically advanced nation powered by mysterious Orbments (magical technology). What begins as a series of seemingly unconnected assignments gradually reveals a vast conspiracy: a secret society manipulates events to throw Liberl into chaos, enabling a coup. The campaign emphasizes detailed worldbuilding, slow-burn storytelling, building relationships with every named NPC, and the gradual escalation from mundane tasks to saving the nation.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Bracer's Journey (Sessions 1-12)**
- Players complete Bracer assignments across Liberl's regions, learning about each town, meeting locals, and building a network of relationships. Assignments range from mundane (escort missions, finding lost items) to moderately dangerous (monster suppression, bandit elimination). Throughout, strange incidents occur - military officials acting suspiciously, Orbment technology malfunctioning, influential figures behaving oddly. Players establish themselves as reliable Bracers while unconsciously gathering puzzle pieces of a larger mystery.

**Act 2: The Coup (Sessions 13-24)**
- During a royal birthday celebration, Intelligence Division orchestrates a coup, framing the Queen for terrorist attacks. The kingdom falls into chaos. Bracers are outlawed. The players must operate underground, reconnecting with NPCs they helped in Act 1 (who now help them in return). They uncover that the coup is orchestrated by Ouroboros - a secret society seeking ancient artifacts called Aureoles. The players gather evidence, recruit allies from across Liberl, and work to expose the truth while staying ahead of capture.

**Act 3: The Gospel Plan (Sessions 25-35)**
- The conspiracy goes deeper than national politics - Ouroboros seeks the Sept-Terrion, an ancient artifact beneath Liberl that could reshape reality. The players must navigate complex political restoration while racing against time to stop the society's plan. They infiltrate the floating city of Glorious, confront Enforcers (elite Ouroboros agents), and ultimately face the Grandmaster's local agents. The climax involves restoring the Queen, thwarting the Gospel Plan, and protecting the Aureole. Victory saves Liberl but reveals Ouroboros's influence extends far beyond one kingdom - this is only one chapter of a larger story.

### Central Conflict
A conspiracy threatens the peaceful kingdom of Liberl, and only the Bracers - independent heroes bound by duty to help others - can stop it. The conflict is political (coup vs. legitimate rule), personal (Joshua's past vs. his chosen family), and philosophical (Ouroboros's manipulative long-term planning vs. Bracer ideals of direct aid). Themes include found family, slow methodical investigation, the value of helping ordinary people, political intrigue, and whether good intentions justify terrible means.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Bracer Point System**: Track Bracer Points (BP) earned from completing assignments. Higher BP unlocks better guild equipment, increases reputation, and affects story outcomes. Players choose which assignments to take from a guild board, balancing mandatory tasks with optional requests. Helping people builds the network that saves the players during the coup.
- **Orbment Crafting**: Characters use Orbments - magical technology devices where players socket Quartz (magic gems) to gain spells and abilities. Different combinations unlock different spells. Finding, buying, and trading Quartz is a key progression system. Players can customize their spell lists through careful Orbment management.
- **Relationship Building**: Every named NPC has a relationship tracker. Helping someone, choosing kind dialogue, or completing their subplot increases relationship. During the coup, NPCs with high relationships provide sanctuary, information, or join the resistance. This mechanically rewards paying attention to side content.
- **S-Break System**: In combat, characters build a special meter. When full, they can unleash an S-Break - a powerful cinematic attack that interrupts turn order. Describe these dramatically with player input on how their character delivers their ultimate move.
- **Regional Assignments**: Each region of Liberl has unique flavor and problems. Bose deals with agriculture and tradition, Ruan with maritime trade and education, Zeiss with technological innovation and labor. Assignments reflect regional character, making each area feel distinct.
- **Slow-Burn Reveals**: Unlike typical campaigns, major revelations are stretched across many sessions. Joshua's true identity isn't revealed until Session 15+. Ouroboros isn't named until Session 20+. Use foreshadowing, background details, and NPC hints to build mystery. Reward players who take notes and connect dots.
- **Political Simulation Lite**: During the coup arc, track public opinion, military loyalties, and regional support. Player actions shift these meters - exposing evidence increases public support, securing a region's governor gains military allies. The final confrontation's difficulty scales based on how much support players built.
