# Campaign Bible: Alchemical Insurgence

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Transmutation
In the beginning, the world was a single, undifferentiated element, a primordial **Prima Materia**. Then came the **Alchemist Prime**, a cosmic entity of pure curiosity. It sought to understand the nature of existence, and in its experiments, it performed the **Great Transmutation**, splitting the Prima Materia into the four fundamental elements: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Magic is not just energy; it is the raw, untamed potential of these elements, constantly seeking to return to their original, unified state. Alchemy is not just a science; it is the art of manipulating this fundamental desire, of forcing elements to change their nature. The "Alchemical Insurgence" is not a rebellion; it is the Prima Materia itself, stirring in its slumber, seeking to re-unite its shattered fragments, threatening to undo all of creation in a single, catastrophic transmutation.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Great Transmutation):** The Alchemist Prime splits the Prima Materia into the four elements.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Philosopher's Stone):** A mortal alchemist, **Hermes Trismegistus**, discovers the secret of the Philosopher's Stone, capable of transmuting any element.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Elemental Wars):** The four elements, now sentient, battle for dominance, reshaping the world in their image.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Alchemical Age):** Mortals learn to manipulate the elements through alchemy, creating powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Prima Materia's Whisper):** The Prima Materia, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful alchemists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate power.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Great Conjunction):** A rogue alchemist attempts to re-unite the four elements, resulting in a catastrophic explosion that creates the "Elemental Blight," a region where elements are constantly shifting.
7.  **-500 Y (The Homunculus Plague):** A botched experiment creates a plague of sentient homunculi, who seek to replace all organic life with their own alchemical creations.
8.  **-100 Y (The Alchemist Prime's Dream):** The Alchemist Prime, stirring in its slumber, begins to dream of a unified world, causing elements to spontaneously transmute.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Element):** A vital element, the **Essence of Balance**, is stolen from the Alchemist's Guild, causing the elements to become increasingly unstable.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new apprentices at the Alchemist's Guild, each with their own unique alchemical talents. They are caught in a crisis as elements become unstable, and the Prima Materia threatens to undo all of creation.

### The "Why": The Balance of Existence
The central conflict is the struggle between **Unity and Diversity**. The Prima Materia seeks to return to its original, unified state, erasing all differentiation and individuality. But the four elements, in their diversity, represent the richness and complexity of existence. The Alchemist's Guild fights to maintain the balance, to prevent the elements from collapsing into a single, undifferentiated mass. The party's struggle is not just to become master alchemists, but to defend the very concept of individuality, to prove that diversity is strength, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably unified.

### Subsystem: Alchemical Crafting

*   **Formulas:** Recipes are "formulas." Players must gather specific elements and perform a series of alchemical steps.
