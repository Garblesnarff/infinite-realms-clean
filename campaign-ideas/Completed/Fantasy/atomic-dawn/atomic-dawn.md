# Atomic Dawn
**Tagline:** *When the gods of destruction awaken, humanity's hubris becomes its greatest enemy*

## Campaign Overview

Seventy years ago, the Great War ended not with treaty, but with fire. The arcane weapons deployed in those final, desperate days cracked the foundations of the world itself, releasing waves of unstable magical radiation that sank cities and poisoned the land. Humanity survived by adapting—building reinforced coastal cities, establishing radiation monitoring networks, and learning to live with the scars of their ancestors' mistakes.

But the radiation didn't just poison the land. It awakened something ancient. The Primordials—colossal beings of living elemental fury that had slumbered beneath the earth for millennia—began to stir. The first emergence occurred thirty years ago when Scoraxis, a 400-foot tall creature of magma and obsidian, rose from the Ashfall Caldera and reduced the city of Emberhold to molten slag in a single night. Since then, seven more Primordials have awakened, each appearing without warning to wreak havoc before returning to the depths.

The players are members of the Wardstone Initiative, an elite international organization dedicated to studying, tracking, and—when necessary—confronting these titans. Armed with experimental arcane-tech weaponry, ancient artifacts, and the knowledge that they are utterly insignificant compared to the forces they face, the party must navigate the political intrigue of frightened nations, the mystery of why the Primordials are awakening with increasing frequency, and the terrifying possibility that humanity's attempts to fight back might be making everything worse.

## Core Themes

- **Atomic Horror:** The consequences of weaponized magic and unchecked power
- **Humanity vs. Nature:** Are the Primordials villains or forces of natural balance?
- **Scale and Insignificance:** Confronting creatures so powerful that individual heroism seems meaningless
- **Scientific Hubris:** The danger of trying to control or weaponize what we don't understand
- **Collective Survival:** Nations must cooperate or face extinction
- **Environmental Reckoning:** The past's sins manifesting as present-day apocalypse

## Session Breakdown

### Arc 1: First Contact (Sessions 1-6)
**Sessions 1-2: Initiation**
The party joins the Wardstone Initiative after witnessing a "minor" Primordial event—a 50-foot tall amphibious creature emerging in a coastal town. They're recruited based on their unique skills and introduced to the organization's structure, technology, and grim mission. They meet key NPCs including Director Valeria Stone and lead researcher Dr. Kael Morrow.

**Sessions 3-4: The Scoraxis Protocol**
Intelligence suggests Scoraxis is beginning a new activity cycle. The party deploys to the Ashfall Perimeter, a militarized zone surrounding the Caldera, to assist with evacuations and gather data. They witness Scoraxis emerge partially—a false alarm—but experience the pure terror of seeing a god-like creature. They also encounter the Ash Zealots, cultists who worship the Primordials.

**Sessions 5-6: City Under Siege**
Typhara, the Hydro-Titan, makes landfall near the metropolis of Castellum. The party must coordinate with military forces, protect evacuation routes, and deploy experimental "Wardstone Pylons" designed to repel Primordials. The pylons work—barely—but at tremendous energy cost. Casualties are in the thousands. The party witnesses the psychological toll on survivors.

### Arc 2: The Pattern Emerges (Sessions 7-13)
**Sessions 7-8: Seismic Predictions**
Dr. Morrow believes he's found a pattern in Primordial emergences based on ley line activity and magical radiation levels. The party travels to remote monitoring stations to verify his data. They discover evidence that someone has been tampering with the stations—possibly trying to provoke emergences.

**Sessions 9-10: Industrial Sabotage**
Investigation leads to the Valorium Corporation, which manufactures weapons and defenses against Primordials. The party infiltrates their facilities and discovers they've been staging attacks to increase defense contracts. But there's something darker: classified Project Apex files referencing "controlled Primordials."

**Sessions 11-12: The Hybrid Horror**
A new creature emerges—smaller than a true Primordial at only 200 feet tall, but far more aggressive. It attacks with apparent strategy rather than instinct. The party helps drive it off, and Dr. Morrow's analysis reveals horrifying truth: it's artificially created, a hybrid of Primordial tissue and arcane bioengineering. Someone is creating weapons of mass destruction.

**Session 13: Political Fallout**
The Wardstone Initiative takes their evidence to the Council of Nations. Political intrigue ensues as different nations accuse each other. Valorium is protected by powerful allies. The party must navigate this diplomatic nightmare while knowing another emergence could happen at any moment.

### Arc 3: Into the Abyss (Sessions 14-20)
**Sessions 14-15: The Titan Tongue**
An ancient text is discovered that claims to detail communication with Primordials. The party travels to the ruins of an ancient civilization destroyed by these creatures to retrieve it. They learn that the ancients didn't fight the Primordials—they appeased them through ritual and sacrifice. The text suggests the creatures are guardians protecting something.

**Sessions 16-17: Aquatic Nightmare**
Bathysos, the deepest-dwelling Primordial, begins to rise. Naval forces from multiple nations attempt to depth-charge it. The party is deployed on a submarine to place monitoring equipment. They witness Bathysos consume an entire fleet in minutes. They barely escape but gather crucial data: the Primordials are converging on a specific location.

**Sessions 18-19: The Radiation Nexus**
Following the data, the party locates a massive underground chamber where magical radiation concentrations are off the charts. They discover it's the site of the Great War's final battle, where a doomsday weapon was detonated. At the center is a crystalline structure that's growing, pulsing with unstable energy. Dr. Morrow theorizes it's like a beacon to the Primordials.

**Session 20: King of the Primordials**
Scoraxis arrives at the Nexus while the party is still investigating. They witness multiple Primordials converging. Scoraxis isn't attacking—it's trying to contain the crystal structure. The party realizes the Primordials are trying to prevent a catastrophic release of magical radiation that would render the planet uninhabitable. Humanity has been fighting its saviors.

### Arc 4: The Apex Initiative (Sessions 21-28)
**Sessions 21-22: Valorium's Weapon**
Valorium Corporation, now aware of the Nexus, launches Project Apex: a giant mechanized war machine piloted by elite operatives, powered by captured Primordial essence. They intend to destroy all Primordials and claim the Nexus's power for themselves. The party must steal the Project Apex blueprints to understand what they're dealing with.

**Sessions 23-24: Unlikely Alliance**
Director Stone makes an unprecedented decision: the Wardstone Initiative will attempt to work *with* the Primordials, not against them. The party must use the ancient rituals from the Titan Tongue to establish communication. They succeed in a harrowing ceremony with Typhara, learning that the Primordials are slowly dying from the strain of containing the Nexus.

**Sessions 25-26: The Apex Emerges**
Valorium deploys their mecha-weapon, designated "Apex-1," and it immediately attacks Scoraxis. The battle levels a mountain range. The party must sabotage Apex-1 from within while avoiding both the mecha's security and the collateral damage from the battle. They discover the pilot is Commandant Rask, a war hero convinced that humanity must dominate or die.

**Sessions 27-28: Three-Way War**
Multiple Primordials converge to defend Scoraxis. Apex-1 continues its assault. Military forces from various nations attack indiscriminately. The party is caught in the middle, trying to reach the Nexus to disable the growing crystal before it detonates while the entire region becomes a war zone of titanic proportions.

### Arc 5: Dawn of a New Age (Sessions 29-36)
**Sessions 29-30: Inside the Crystal**
The party discovers the Nexus crystal can be entered. Inside is a dimension where magical energy exists in pure form. They encounter echoes of the mages who created the doomsday weapon—their consciousnesses trapped in eternal torment. These echoes reveal the weapon wasn't meant to win the war but to crack open the dimensional barriers and access unlimited power.

**Sessions 31-32: The Truth of the Primordials**
Deeper in the crystal dimension, the party learns the Primordials are older than history itself—they are living seals placed by ancient precursor civilizations to prevent dimensional rifts. When the doomsday weapon was detonated, it damaged all of them simultaneously, waking them from their eternal vigil. They're not destroying cities by choice; they're drawn to sites of magical radiation to consume and contain it.

**Sessions 33-34: Diplomatic Miracle**
Armed with this knowledge, the party facilitates a historic meeting between the Council of Nations and the Primordials (through ritual translation). An agreement is reached: humanity will help stabilize the Nexus, and the Primordials will avoid populated areas. But Valorium and Commandant Rask refuse to accept this, viewing it as surrender.

**Session 35: Apex Protocol: Termination**
Valorium launches their entire Apex fleet—five giant mechs—in a coordinated strike against the Primordials at the Nexus site. The party must lead a coalition force of military units and guide Primordials to destroy the Apex mechs without causing more destruction than the mechs themselves. The battle is catastrophic, with entire cities evacuated as the combat zone expands.

**Session 36: Stabilization**
With the Apex threat neutralized, the party works with Dr. Morrow, Director Stone, Primordial representatives, and international engineers to implement a massive ritual-technical hybrid solution. The Primordials contribute their essence, and human mages sacrifice years of their lives to power the stabilization. The Nexus is sealed, but not destroyed. The Primordials return to slumber but can be awakened if needed. A new age of cooperation begins.

### Optional Arc 6: The New Threat (Sessions 37-40)
**Sessions 37-38: Dimensional Echoes**
The stabilization worked, but it attracted attention from beyond. Something begins emerging from the sealed dimensional rifts—creatures not of this world, immune to the magic that controls Primordials. The party must investigate these new entities.

**Sessions 39-40: Awakening the Guardians**
A true dimensional incursion begins. The party must use the alliance with the Primordials to awaken them one final time to face an enemy they were created to fight. The campaign ends with a massive battle where players fight alongside 400-foot tall titans against otherworldly horrors, having evolved from insignificant observers to key players in a cosmic conflict.

## Key NPCs

**Director Valeria Stone** (Female Human, Age 52)
The iron-willed leader of the Wardstone Initiative. Lost her entire family to Scoraxis's first emergence. Projects absolute confidence but suffers from PTSD and survivor's guilt. Makes ruthlessly pragmatic decisions but genuinely cares about protecting humanity. Secretly dying from radiation exposure from decades of fieldwork.

**Dr. Kael Morrow** (Male Gnome, Age 127)
Chief researcher and the world's leading expert on Primordials. Brilliant but socially awkward. Views the creatures with awe and respect rather than fear. His theories are often dismissed until proven correct. Has a photographic memory and notices patterns others miss. Struggles with ethics of his work—he finds the Primordials beautiful.

**Commandant Rask** (Male Half-Orc, Age 45)
War hero, Apex-1 pilot, and militant human supremacist. Believes humanity must dominate all threats through superior firepower. Charismatic leader with thousands of followers. Not evil, but dangerously convinced that cooperation with Primordials is extinction. His backstory involves losing his unit to Typhara.

**Ambassador Yuki Shimura** (Female Human, Age 38)
Diplomatic liaison from the Eastern Concordat. Skilled negotiator who advocates for peaceful solutions. Initially skeptical of communicating with Primordials but becomes a key ally. Provides political insight and access to resources. Personal stake: her home city is in the path of the next predicted emergence.

**Ash Prophet Zerith** (Non-binary Tiefling, Age Unknown)
Leader of the Ash Zealots cult. Believes Primordials are divine judgment for humanity's sins. Initially antagonistic, but their philosophy proves partially correct when the truth is revealed. Possible redemption arc where they help translate ancient texts. Fanatical but not mindless—has genuine spiritual connection to the creatures.

**Dr. Helena Voss** (Female Human, Age 34)
Valorium Corporation's lead bioweaponeer and creator of Project Apex. Genius inventor with flexible ethics. Convinced her work will save humanity, blind to the damage she's causing. Potential to be swayed if shown evidence of Primordials' true purpose. Complex antagonist who believes she's the hero.

**Captain Marcus "Stone Wall" Thorne** (Male Dwarf, Age 156)
Military commander of the Ashfall Perimeter. Gruff, practical, and has seen more Primordial attacks than anyone alive. Initially dismissive of "scientist types" but comes to respect the party. Provides military support and tactical expertise. His nickname comes from his ability to hold defensive positions against impossible odds.

**Liora Windwhisper** (Female Elf, Age 342)
Ancient scholar who researches pre-cataclysm civilizations. Holds the key to understanding the Titan Tongue. Speaks in riddles and metaphors, frustrating in conversation but invaluable for her knowledge. Lives in a mobile library that she relocates every time a Primordial emerges nearby.

**Sergeant Kira Oxton** (Female Human, Age 28)
Wardstone Initiative field operative and the party's military liaison. Combat veteran with prosthetic leg from a Primordial incident. Provides ground-level perspective on evacuations and civilian impact. Loyal, brave, and suffers from recurring nightmares of Scoraxis.

**The Voice of Scoraxis** (Manifested Consciousness)
Once communication is established, Scoraxis's consciousness manifests as a chorus of ancient voices speaking in unison. Not truly individual but rather the collective will of a living geological force. Speaks in absolutes and geological timescales. Incomprehensible and terrifying but not malicious.

## Major Locations

**The Ashfall Perimeter**
A militarized zone surrounding the volcanic caldera where Scoraxis first emerged. Constant ash falls from the sky. Massive walls topped with arcane artillery. Thousands of soldiers stationed permanently. Underground bunker cities house civilian researchers and military personnel. Lava flows visible in the distance. The air shimmers with heat and residual magical radiation.

**Castellum**
Massive coastal metropolis built on stilts and reinforced foundations. Population: 2 million. Survived multiple Primordial attacks through advanced warning systems and rapid evacuation protocols. Features a massive sea wall designed to withstand tsunami impacts. Economic hub with significant political power. Represents humanity's resilience and architectural achievement.

**The Wardstone Initiative Headquarters**
Located on a mobile offshore platform that can relocate as needed. Houses research labs, command centers, barracks, and the Crystal Archive—a collection of preserved Primordial tissue samples and historical records. The platform can submerge in case of attack. Powered by a small, contained magical reactor that Dr. Morrow constantly worries about.

**The Radiation Nexus**
Underground chamber at the site of the Great War's final battle. Crystalline growths cover every surface, pulsing with sickly green light. Magical radiation levels are lethal without protection. The central crystal is 50 feet tall and growing. Seismic activity constant. The walls show murals from an ancient civilization. Feels simultaneously ancient and wrong.

**Valorium Tower**
Sleek, modern corporate headquarters in the neutral city of Mercantia. The upper floors house executive offices, while the basement levels contain secret labs where Project Apex was developed. Security is state-of-the-art. The building is designed to withstand Primordial attack—supposedly. Symbol of corporate power and military-industrial complex.

**The Titan Tomb**
Ancient ruins of a civilization destroyed by Primordials 3,000 years ago. Located in a desert filled with fossils of megafauna. Stone tablets detail appeasement rituals and show carvings of humans kneeling before giant silhouettes. The ruins form a perfect circle around a sealed chamber where the Titan Tongue text was preserved. Haunted by spirits who chose sacrifice to save their people.

**Deepwatch Station**
Underwater research facility anchored to the ocean floor at 15,000 feet. Studies Bathysos and deep-ocean Primordial activity. Cramped, claustrophobic, and constantly creaking under pressure. Crew rotation every 3 months due to psychological strain. Features viewing ports where, on rare occasions, Bathysos's silhouette can be seen passing in the depths.

**The Scar Lands**
Region destroyed by multiple Primordial emergences, now abandoned to nature. Twisted forests grow in unnatural patterns due to magical radiation. Strange mutated creatures roam. Ash Zealot communes hidden throughout. Valuable salvage and research data can be found in ruined cities. Beautiful in a post-apocalyptic way—nature reclaiming human achievement.

**The Council Chambers**
Neutral diplomatic ground where the Council of Nations meets. Grand architecture blending styles from every culture. Heavy security. Site of crucial political negotiations that will determine humanity's response to the Primordial threat. Every decision made here affects millions of lives.

**Mount Pyrax**
Active volcano and sleeping site of Scoraxis. The mountain itself is partially composed of Scoraxis's ossified outer carapace. Seismic sensors cover every inch. When Scoraxis begins to stir, the mountain "breathes," releasing jets of superheated steam. Pilgrims and zealots come here to worship. Scientific teams monitor constantly. The moment of emergence is simultaneously terrifying and awe-inspiring.

## Unique Mechanics

### Primordial Scale Combat
When fighting near or against Primordials, traditional combat is impossible. Instead, use this system:
- **Objective-Based Challenges:** Combat encounters focus on completing objectives (evacuate civilians, plant explosives, disable weapons) rather than dealing HP damage
- **Environmental Hazards:** Roll on Collateral Damage tables each round—buildings collapse, shockwaves knock characters prone, fires spread
- **Scale Dice:** When affecting a Primordial, roll d100s to represent the minimal impact. Success is measured in whether you accomplished your goal, not how much you hurt the creature
- **Terrain as Enemy:** The battlefield changes constantly. Maps need to be redrawn mid-combat as entire city blocks are destroyed

### Radiation and Contamination
- **Radiation Zones:** Areas are rated 1-10 for magical radiation. Each hour exposed requires Constitution saves or gain Contamination points
- **Contamination Effects:** At certain thresholds, characters suffer exhaustion, disadvantage on saves, physical mutations, or magical power fluctuations
- **Protective Gear:** Sealed suits reduce radiation exposure but impose disadvantage on Dexterity checks and reduce movement
- **Long-term Exposure:** Characters who accumulate too much contamination face permanent consequences, mirroring the real-world horror of radiation sickness

### Seismic Prediction System
Dr. Morrow provides the party with portable seismographs and radiation detectors:
- Collect readings from multiple locations to predict emergence zones
- Mini-game where players analyze maps and data to triangulate threat areas
- Success allows for proactive evacuations, saving thousands of lives
- Failure means being caught unprepared when a Primordial emerges

### Evacuation Protocols
Multiple scenarios involve coordinating evacuations:
- **Triage Decisions:** Not everyone can be saved. Players choose between saving a hospital or a school, a wealthy district or a poor one
- **Traffic Management:** Direct vehicles, clear debris, maintain order while panic spreads
- **Time Pressure:** Every round spent on one task means others suffer. Creates genuine moral tension
- **Success Tracking:** Track civilian casualty counts. Low numbers provide morale bonuses; high numbers impose psychological consequences on PCs

### Diplomatic Mechanics
Negotiating with nations and eventually Primordials:
- **Reputation System:** Track standing with different factions (military, corporate, diplomatic, zealot, scientific)
- **Coalition Building:** Must secure support from multiple nations for major operations. Each nation has demands and red lines
- **Primordial Communication:** Use ritual checks combining Arcana, Nature, Religion, and Insight. Partial successes provide partial information. Failures can provoke defensive responses

### Pilot Training (Later Campaign)
If the party gains access to experimental mechs or Primordial-control devices:
- **Synchronization:** Pilots must make Wisdom saves to maintain mental connection with their machine/creature
- **Neural Strain:** Extended operation causes psychic damage and exhaustion
- **Team Piloting:** Some systems require multiple operators working in perfect coordination (group skill challenges)

### Collateral Damage Tracking
- Maintain a log of destruction caused by Primordials, military forces, and party actions
- Civilian casualties affect NPC attitudes, political support, and even party morale
- Players must balance accomplishing objectives with minimizing destruction
- End-of-session reports detail the human cost, making the stakes visceral and personal

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Zealots Were Right**
The Ash Zealots who worship Primordials as divine judgment are partially correct—the creatures are responding to humanity's magical weapons. This forces players to question who the real villains are.

**Twist 2: Morrow's Contamination**
Dr. Morrow is revealed to be heavily contaminated and slowly dying. His increasing erratic behavior and brilliant insights are both symptoms of his exposure. He's on borrowed time, adding urgency to the research.

**Twist 3: Valorium Insider**
One of the party's allies within the Wardstone Initiative is secretly feeding information to Valorium Corporation. The betrayal is revealed at a critical moment, compromising a major operation.

**Twist 4: Primordials Are Seals**
The creatures aren't monsters—they're guardians preventing something worse. Destroying them would unleash dimensional horrors that would make the current crisis look minor.

**Twist 5: The Crystal is Alive**
The Nexus crystal contains the fragmented consciousness of the mages who created the doomsday weapon. They're not dead but trapped in eternal agony, and their suffering powers the dimensional instability.

**Twist 6: Rask's Suicide Mission**
Commandant Rask's final plan involves piloting Apex-1 directly into the Nexus crystal with weapons at full power, intending to destroy everything—Primordials, crystal, and himself—to "save" humanity through mutually assured destruction.

**Twist 7: Director Stone's Terminal Illness**
Valeria Stone is dying from radiation exposure but hasn't told anyone. She's making increasingly risky decisions because she's playing a short-term game, willing to sacrifice herself if it saves others.

**Twist 8: A Primordial Dies**
Despite all efforts, one Primordial is killed (likely by Apex forces). The death throes cause a catastrophic earthquake felt across the continent, and the dimensional seal at that location begins to fail, proving the creatures' importance.

**Twist 9: Ancient Precursor Message**
Inside the Titan Tomb, the party finds a message from the ancient civilization: "We created them to save ourselves. Now they sleep, and we are dust. Do not wake them. Do not destroy them. They are all that stands between you and the void."

**Twist 10: Player Character Contamination**
One PC begins showing signs of extreme contamination that's mutating them into something new—possibly able to communicate with Primordials naturally. This is both a curse and an opportunity.

**Moral Defeat: Becoming What You Fight**
- The party makes so many ruthless decisions that they become villains
- They sacrifice cities to save their own interests
- Align with Valorium or use Primordial weapons for personal power
- "Victory" is achieved but at the cost of their humanity
- NPC allies abandon them, and history remembers them as monsters

**Partial Defeat: Costly Peace**
- Stabilization works but requires permanent sacrifice
- Key NPCs die, including beloved allies like Dr. Morrow or Director Stone
- One or more PCs must give their lives to power the ritual
- Peace is achieved but the cost is devastating
- Bittersweet ending where victory feels hollow
