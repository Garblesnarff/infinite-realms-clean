## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Ash-Code Hypothesis
Before Yggdrasil drank from the Well of Urd, there was only the **Ginnungagap Static**—a roaring void of unmade potential. The World Tree did not merely grow; it was *sung* into existence by the first Giants, who wove reality from the Static. Odin did not create the world; he hacked it. By butchering Ymir, the Primeval Giant, Odin rewrote the source code of reality, cementing the Aesir’s rule and deleting the Giants' ability to shape the future. However, the Giants hid a backup of the original reality inside their own bodies—specifically, in their ashes. The "Highest Peak" is not just a mountain; it is the primary transmitter of the realms. To scatter the ashes there is to upload a virus into Odin’s perfect order.

### Timeline of the Nine Realms
1.  **The First Song:** Giants weave the fabric of reality; the concept of "Winter" is invented as a joke that goes too far.
2.  **The Butcher’s Feat:** Odin kills Ymir. The blood flood drowns the first reality. The "Laws of Physics" are established to limit magic.
3.  **The Vanir Schism:** Freya attempts to teach the Aesir how to grow crops without blood sacrifice; war ensues for 500 years.
4.  **The Stagnation of Alfheim:** The Light Elves discover how to bottle souls; the Dark Elves revolt to preserve the sanctity of death.
5.  **The Binding of Fenrir:** Tyr loses his hand, not to a wolf, but to a tear in space-time shaped like a jaw.
6.  **The Serpent’s Arrival:** Jörmungandr appears in the Lake of Nine, having been punched backward through time from a future that hasn't happened yet.
7.  **The Genocide of Jotunheim:** Thor kills the Giants, but finds no bodies—only empty clothes. The Giants turned themselves into trees to hide.
8.  **The Ghost’s Arrival:** A stranger with ash-white skin drags a canoe onto the shore of Midgard. The local spirits fall silent in terror.
9.  **The Death of Laufey:** The last Guardian dies. Her protection spell fades. The GPS of the Gods (Odin’s Ravens) suddenly pings her location.
10. **The Trees begin to Weep:** Sap across Midgard turns to blood (Current Day).

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The realms are rotting because the cycle of life and death has been arrested by the Aesir. Odin refuses to die, so nothing new can truly live. The "Winter" is not weather; it is entropy accumulating because the system cannot reboot.
