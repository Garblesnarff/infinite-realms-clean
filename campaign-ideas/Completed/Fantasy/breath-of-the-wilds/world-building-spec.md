*   **Content:** A century ago, the Calamity awakened and destroyed the kingdom using corrupted guardian machines.

    *   Detail the cycle of Calamity Ganon's resurrection every few millennia and the Hero's prophesied returns.

    *   Describe the Great Calamity 100 years ago—how the guardians turned against their masters.
    *   Explain the four Champions chosen from each race to pilot Divine Beasts and how they fell.
    *   Detail Princess Zelda's struggle to awaken her sealing power and her century-long battle holding Ganon.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party frees a Divine Beast → **THEN:** That region's environmental problem stops (rain ends, eruptions stop, etc.) and Ganon loses 25% of his power.
*   **IF:** Party finds memories → **THEN:** They learn their relationships with Champions and Zelda, unlocking emotional context.
*   **IF:** Party enters Hyrule Castle early → **THEN:** They face Ganon at full power without Divine Beast support (possible but much harder).
*   **IF:** Party gets the Master Sword → **THEN:** They have the only weapon that doesn't break and does extra damage to malice-corrupted enemies.
*   **IF:** Blood Moon occurs → **THEN:** All defeated enemies respawn with Ganon's power reaching out to resurrect them.
