# Creative Brief: Camp Half-Blood Chronicles

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Mythology Mashup (Percy Jackson meets Urban Fantasy)

Inspired by ancient Greek art reimagined in contemporary American settings, this style blends classical mythological aesthetics with modern environments. It aims to capture the wonder of discovering gods exist in today's world, the danger of monster encounters disguised by magic, and the heroism of young demigods facing impossible odds.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Dual Reality:** Ancient Greek elements (monsters, gods, weapons) exist alongside modern American settings (highways, cities, fast food).
*   **The Mist Effect:** Mythological elements should have a subtle shimmer or distortion, showing how they're disguised from mortal eyes.
*   **Heroic Youth:** Characters are teenagers with divine heritage—show both their youth and their growing power.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Mythological, modern, adventurous, heroic, young adult, monster-hunting, prophetic, found family, divine heritage.
*   **Feeling:** The thrill of discovering you're special. The terror of monsters hunting you. The bonds formed with fellow heroes.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Modern Elements:** Realistic modern architecture, vehicles, clothing, technology.
*   **Mythological Elements:** Stylized Ancient Greek aesthetics—Corinthian columns, bronze weapons, marble temples, classical monster designs.
*   **Textures:** Celestial Bronze (magical golden-bronze metal), worn denim and leather, ancient stone, magical shimmer.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration blending modern realism with Greek mythology. A teenage demigod in jeans and a Camp Half-Blood t-shirt wields a glowing Celestial Bronze sword against a Minotaur in a modern subway station. The Minotaur is massive, with ancient Greek armor fragments. Fluorescent lights flicker overhead."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Camp Half-Blood:** Warm summer colors—golden sunlight, green strawberry fields, bright orange camp shirts, white Greek columns.
*   **Olympus:** Divine radiance—white marble with gold accents, celestial blue sky, rainbow bridges, glowing divine energy.
*   **The Underworld:** Cold, desaturated colors—gray stone, black rivers, pale shades of the dead, occasional hellfire red.
*   **Modern Settings:** Realistic contemporary colors—highway grays, city neon, fast food primaries, natural landscapes.
*   **Monsters:** Dark, threatening colors with unnatural elements—shadowy black, blood red, sickly green, tarnished bronze.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of warm Camp Half-Blood summer—golden afternoon sunlight filtering through trees, bright orange t-shirts with camp logo, green strawberry fields, white marble columns of the Big House. The Long Island Sound is deep blue in the background. Everything feels safe and sun-drenched."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Demigods:** Ages 12-17, diverse ethnicities, casual modern clothing (jeans, t-shirts, hoodies) with Greek-inspired accessories (leather bracers, camp necklaces with clay beads). Athletic builds from training. Expressions mix teenage insecurity with growing confidence.
*   **Chiron:** Centaur (horse body, human torso) wearing a tweed jacket. Kindly face, ancient wisdom in his eyes. In mortal disguise: wheelchair-bound teacher.
*   **Gods:** Larger-than-life figures in modern dress that hints at their domain—Zeus in a sharp suit, Poseidon in beach casual, Hades in dark formal wear, Ares in motorcycle leathers. Emit subtle divine radiance.
*   **Monsters:** Classical Greek designs—Minotaur (bull-headed humanoid in tattered armor), Furies (winged hags with brass talons), Medusa (beautiful woman with serpent hair), Chimera (lion-goat-serpent hybrid).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A demigod, age 14, male, with sea-green eyes (marking him as Poseidon's son). Messy black hair, tan skin, wearing worn jeans, a bright orange Camp Half-Blood t-shirt, and a leather cord necklace with five clay beads (years at camp). Holding a bronze sword (Riptide) that glows faintly. Expression shows determination mixed with uncertainty. Standing at the edge of Camp Half-Blood's barrier."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Camp Half-Blood:** Summer camp on Long Island Sound—white Greek-style buildings, strawberry fields, training arena, cabins arranged in a U-shape around the commons, magical barrier shimmer at the edges.
*   **Modern America:** Highways, diners, cities (LA, Las Vegas, New York), tourist sites (St. Louis Arch), suburban neighborhoods—all with subtle mythological elements hidden in plain sight.
*   **The Underworld:** Vast caverns of dark stone, the River Styx (black water), Fields of Asphodel (gray eternity), Hades' palace (obsidian and shadow), distant Elysium (golden paradise).
*   **Olympus:** Floating marble city atop the Empire State Building, accessible via magical elevator. Throne room with twelve massive thrones, gardens of eternal spring, celestial architecture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of Camp Half-Blood from above. A valley on Long Island with a protective magical barrier (subtle shimmer) keeping monsters out. Twelve cabins arranged in a U-shape—Poseidon's cabin is a gray stone building with sea motifs. The Big House (white mansion) overlooks the camp. The arena, forge, and strawberry fields are visible. Long Island Sound sparkles in the background."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Camp Half-Blood:** Bright summer sunlight, warm and inviting. Long shadows in late afternoon, campfire glow at night.
*   **Olympus:** Divine radiance—everything glows softly. No harsh shadows. Celestial lighting that feels timeless.
*   **The Underworld:** Dim, cold lighting. Shadows everywhere. Occasional hellfire provides reddish illumination. The sky is a dark cavern roof.
*   **Modern Settings:** Realistic lighting—fluorescent lights in buildings, streetlights at night, natural sun during day. Mythological elements glow faintly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm golden afternoon sunlight filtering through trees. Campfire in the foreground provides orange glow on demigods' faces. The Celestial Bronze weapons reflect sunlight with magical shimmer. Shadows are long but not threatening—this is a safe place."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use wide shots to show modern world with mythological intrusions. Close-ups on characters' faces during prophecy moments. Dynamic action angles during combat. POV shots showing the world through demigod eyes (Ancient Greek overlay on street signs).
*   **Techniques:** Contrast safe camp with dangerous outside world. Show size difference between demigods and monsters/gods. Use composition to emphasize found family (group shots, characters protecting each other).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic composition showing combat from a low angle. A teenage demigod leaps off a bus, sword raised, facing a Fury (winged hag) attacking from above. The background shows a modern highway—cars passing, ignorant due to the Mist. The Fury is massive compared to the teen. Emphasis on heroic bravery despite being outmatched."

## Voice

A dual voice: (1) The Oracle—ancient, raspy, speaking in prophetic riddles with an ethereal echo. Neither male nor female, timeless and eerie. Slow cadence with meaningful pauses. (2) The Young Demigod—teenage (mid-teens), energetic, modern American accent (various regional accents possible). Shifts between scared kid and growing hero. Audio quality: Oracle is reverberant and mystical; Demigod is clear and immediate. Roles: Issuing prophecies, or narrating quest experiences from a demigod's perspective.
