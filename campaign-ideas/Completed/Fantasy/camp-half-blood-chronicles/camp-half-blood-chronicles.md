**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of demigods—children of Greek gods and mortal parents—who discover their divine heritage and are brought to Camp Half-Blood, a safe haven where they train to survive monster attacks. When a divine artifact is stolen and a prophecy is issued by the Oracle, the party must embark on a quest across modern America, battling mythological monsters, navigating godly politics, and preventing a war between Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades that could destroy the mortal world. They'll discover that being a hero means more than divine bloodlines—it's about the choices you make and the friends you protect.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Mythological monsters (Minotaurs, Furies, Hydras) scale to party level. Combat favors clever tactics over raw power.
*   **Investigation:** The party must interpret prophecies, research mythology, and navigate godly schemes.
*   **Consequences:** The quest has a time limit (Summer Solstice). Failure could trigger divine war. Choices affect relationships with gods and cabins.

---

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that follows the classic hero's journey with modern twists.

*   **Act I — Arrival at Camp (Sessions 1–4):** The party discovers they're demigods, survives monster attacks, reaches Camp Half-Blood, and is claimed by their godly parents. They undergo training, form cabin rivalries and friendships, and receive a prophecy from the Oracle.
*   **Act II — The Quest Begins (Sessions 5–8):** The party embarks on a quest to retrieve Zeus's Master Bolt (stolen and hidden in the Underworld), traveling across America while battling monsters, encountering minor gods, and following cryptic prophecy clues.
*   **Act III — The Underworld (Sessions 9–11):** The party descends into Hades' realm, navigates the Fields of Asphodel, faces judgment, and confronts Hades—only to discover he's not the thief. The real villain manipulates all three gods toward war.
*   **Act IV — Preventing War (Sessions 12–15):** The party races to Olympus (atop the Empire State Building) to expose the true thief (Ares, manipulated by Kronos), prevent divine war, and confront the rising threat of the Titan King's return.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Discovery"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / Monster Attack
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party members are mortal teenagers experiencing strange phenomena—ADHD and dyslexia (actually combat reflexes and ability to read Ancient Greek), monster encounters disguised as normal events, dreams of ancient places.
    *   The Attack: A monster (Fury disguised as a teacher or Minotaur) attacks, forcing a satyr protector (like Grover) to reveal the truth and help the party escape.
    *   The Arrival: The party is brought to Camp Half-Blood, crossing the magical barrier that keeps monsters out.

**Escalation:** The party is unclaimed by their godly parents—they're placed in the Hermes cabin (for unclaimed and undetermined demigods).

### Session 2 — "Welcome to Camp Half-Blood"

*   **Focus:** Training / World-Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Tour: Chiron (centaur activities director) and camp counselors show the party around—the cabins (one per Olympian), the arena, the forge, the archery range, the strawberry fields.
    *   Training Begins: The party learns combat (swords, spears, shields), discovers their divine abilities (children of Ares have battle rage, Athena's children have tactical insight, etc.).
    *   Capture the Flag: A massive camp-wide game where the party must cooperate with their cabin against rivals.

**Escalation:** During Capture the Flag, the party is claimed by their godly parents—symbols appear above their heads, revealing their divine heritage.

### Session 3 — "The Oracle's Prophecy"

*   **Focus:** Call to Adventure
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Claiming Aftermath: The party moves to their respective god's cabin (or remains in Hermes if their parent is minor/unclaimed). Cabin dynamics shift—some are welcoming, others hostile.
    *   The Crisis: Zeus's Master Bolt (the most powerful weapon in existence) has been stolen. Zeus blames Poseidon, Poseidon denies it—war looms unless the bolt is recovered by the Summer Solstice (two weeks away).
    *   The Oracle: The party consults the Oracle (mummified priestess of Delphi), who issues a prophecy in riddles about their quest, betrayal, and destiny.

**Escalation:** Despite being young and inexperienced, the party is chosen for the quest because of the prophecy's wording.

### Session 4 — "Departure"

*   **Focus:** Preparation / Farewells
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Quest Preparations: The party receives weapons (Celestial Bronze swords, shields, magical items), supplies, and advice from mentors (Chiron, Annabeth, cabin counselors).
    *   The Prophecy's Clues: The party deciphers parts of the prophecy—"the bolt hidden in the depths," "betrayed by one you trust," "a choice to save or doom."
    *   Leaving Camp: The party crosses the barrier into the mortal world, where monsters can hunt them freely. They take a bus toward Los Angeles (where they believe the Underworld entrance is).

**Escalation:** The first monster attack happens within hours—a Fury ambushes the bus.

### Session 5 — "The Road to the West"

*   **Focus:** Monster Encounters / Myth Integration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Medusa's Emporium: The party encounters Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium—actually Medusa's lair. They must avoid her petrifying gaze while escaping.
    *   St. Louis Arch: The party encounters Echidna (Mother of Monsters) and the Chimera at a tourist site. Combat spills into mortal sight (mortals see through the Mist—illusion magic—differently).
    *   Ares' Bargain: The party meets Ares (god of war) at a diner. He offers transportation and information in exchange for retrieving his shield from the Tunnel of Love (a trap-filled abandoned water ride).

**Escalation:** The party retrieves Ares' shield but realizes he's involved in the theft conspiracy somehow.

### Session 6 — "Lotus Casino"

*   **Focus:** Magical Trap
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Lotus Hotel: In Las Vegas, the party enters a luxury casino where time stops—guests from the 1970s still think it's their decade. The party risks losing days or weeks trapped in timeless entertainment.
    *   The Escape: The party must resist the temptation (Wisdom saves) and escape before the Summer Solstice deadline passes.
    *   The Deadline Closes: Precious time has been lost. They now have only a few days to reach the Underworld, retrieve the bolt, and return to Olympus.

**Escalation:** The prophecy's mention of time running out becomes urgent.

### Session 7 — "The Underworld Entrance"

*   **Focus:** Descent / Atmosphere

    *   DOA Recording Studios: In Los Angeles, the party finds the entrance to the Underworld disguised as a record label. Charon (ferryman) demands payment for passage across the Styx.
    *   The River Styx: The party crosses the river of the dead, seeing shades of the deceased and feeling the weight of mortality.
    *   Cerberus: The three-headed guard dog blocks the gates. The party must befriend, trick, or sneak past him.

### Session 8 — "The Fields of Judgment"

*   **Focus:** Moral Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Asphodel Meadows: The party navigates the gray, dreary fields where most souls wander in eternal boredom.
    *   Elysium (Optional): If the party has performed heroic deeds, they glimpse the paradise where heroes reside.
    *   The Judgment Pavilion: The party encounters the three judges (Minos, Rhadamanthus, Aeacus) who determine souls' fates—a reminder of their own mortality.

### Session 9 — "Audience with Hades"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Negotiation

    *   The Accusation: Hades believes the party stole his helm and holds them captive. The party must prove their innocence and negotiate release.
    *   The Discovery: The party finds the Master Bolt hidden in their own backpack (planted by the true thief) and realizes they've been framed.

### Session 10 — "Escape and Betrayal"

    *   The Escape: The party flees the Underworld with the Master Bolt, Hades' fury driving them. Souls and monsters give chase.
    *   The Confrontation: Ares ambushes the party on the beach in Los Angeles—he was the thief, manipulated by a darker force (Kronos, the Titan King, whispering from Tartarus).
    *   The Duel: The party fights Ares (scaled to be challenging but winnable). Defeating or driving him off reveals the Helm of Darkness.

**Escalation:** Ares reveals he was manipulated—Kronos is rising, and the gods' war was meant to weaken them for the Titans' return.

### Session 11 — "Return to Olympus"

*   **Focus:** Racing the Clock
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Journey North: The party rushes from Los Angeles to New York City, battling pursuing monsters and time constraints.

    *   Presenting the Bolt: The party returns Zeus's Master Bolt and Hades' Helm of Darkness, preventing the war.

    *   The Reward: The gods grant the party boons (magical items, divine favor, level-ups) and acknowledge their heroism.

**Escalation:** The prophecy's final line—"a choice to save or doom"—is still unfulfilled. A party member must make a critical decision about their future.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is divine politics versus mortal heroism—the gods play games with mortal lives, and their children must clean up the consequences. The party must navigate prophecy, prevent war, and ultimately choose whether to serve the gods or forge their own path. It explores themes of parental neglect, found family, destiny versus choice, and what it means to be a hero.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Divine Parentage Abilities**

*   Each party member has a godly parent granting unique powers.
*   **Examples:** Poseidon's children control water, Athena's children gain tactical insight, Ares' children have battle rage, Apollo's children have healing and archery bonuses.

### 2. **ADHD Combat Reflexes**

*   Demigods' ADHD is actually supernatural battle awareness.
*   **Mechanical Benefit:** Cannot be surprised in combat, bonus to initiative.

### 3. **The Mist**

*   Mortals see mythological events through magical illusion (a sword becomes a baseball bat, a monster becomes a large dog).
*   **Mechanical Use:** Demigods can manipulate the Mist (Deception checks) to hide magical activity from mortals.

### 4. **Prophecy Mechanics**

*   The Oracle issues prophecies with clues about the quest.
*   **Mechanical Effect:** Fulfilling prophecy lines grants bonuses (inspiration, advantage, divine favor). Ignoring them brings complications.

### 5. **Favor of the Gods**

*   Actions that please or anger gods affect divine relationships.
*   **Mechanical Effect:** High favor grants boons (magical items, temporary blessings). Low favor brings curses or divine obstacles.
