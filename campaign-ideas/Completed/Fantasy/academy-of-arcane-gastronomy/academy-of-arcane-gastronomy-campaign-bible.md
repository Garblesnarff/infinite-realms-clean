# Campaign Bible: Academy of Arcane Gastronomy

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The First Flavor
In the beginning, the cosmos was a bland, undifferentiated void. Then came the **First Palate**, a cosmic entity of pure sensation. It tasted the void and found it wanting. With a single, divine *slurp*, it created the **Flavor-Verse**, a reality where every element, every emotion, every concept had a distinct taste. Magic is not just energy; it is concentrated flavor, and spells are recipes. The "Academy of Arcane Gastronomy" is not a school; it is a living cookbook, a repository of the universe's most potent flavors. The conflict arises because the First Palate has grown bored, and its attention is drifting, causing flavors to become corrupted, bland, or dangerously volatile.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Slurp):** The First Palate tastes the void and creates the Flavor-Verse.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Spice Wars):** The first sentient beings, the **Flavor-Elementals**, battle for control of the most potent spices.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Great Blandness):** A powerful anti-flavor entity, the **Monotony**, attempts to erase all taste from existence, causing a century of blandness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Academy's Founding):** The Academy of Arcane Gastronomy is founded by the **Grand Chef Sazón**, who discovers that magic can be used to preserve and enhance flavors.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Recipe of Immortality):** A legendary chef, **Chef Ambrosius**, creates a recipe that grants immortality, but it requires a single, impossible ingredient.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Sour Note Plague):** A corrupted flavor causes all food to taste like pure bitterness, leading to widespread despair and starvation.
7.  **-500 Y (The Culinary Cataclysm):** A rogue student attempts to create a "universal flavor," resulting in a magical explosion that turns an entire continent into a giant, sentient soufflé.
8.  **-100 Y (The First Palate's Yawn):** The First Palate yawns, causing a wave of cosmic boredom that makes all food taste like ash for a year.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Ingredient):** The Academy's most prized ingredient, the **Essence of Pure Joy**, is stolen, causing a wave of despair to spread through the Flavor-Verse.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new students at the Academy, each with their own unique culinary talents. They are caught in a crisis as flavors become corrupted, and the Monotony threatens to consume all taste from existence.

### The "Why": The Spice of Life
The central conflict is the struggle between **Flavor and Monotony**. The Flavor-Verse thrives on diversity, on the endless combinations of tastes and sensations. But the Monotony seeks to erase all of this, to reduce existence to a single, bland, undifferentiated paste. The Academy is the last bastion of flavor, fighting to preserve the richness of existence. The party's struggle is not just to become master chefs, but to defend the very concept of taste, to prove that life is worth savoring, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably bland.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Flavor-Verse Palate
*   **Palate Score (0-10):** Represents a character's sensitivity to flavor. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Palate:** Tasting new and exotic flavors, creating delicious dishes, experiencing intense emotions.
*   **Losing Palate:** Eating bland food, succumbing to the Monotony's influence, experiencing prolonged despair.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Palate:* Grants advantage on taste-related checks, and may allow the character to perceive hidden flavors or emotions.
    *   *Low Palate:* Grants disadvantage on taste-related checks, and may make the character immune to flavor-based attacks.
    *   *0 Palate:* The character loses all sense of taste and becomes immune to flavor-based effects.

### Subsystem: Culinary Combat
*   **Flavor-Based Attacks:** Spells and abilities can be flavored as culinary attacks (e.g., a fireball becomes a "Chili Blast," a healing spell becomes a "Comfort Food Infusion").
*   **Taste-Tests:** Certain challenges or social encounters can be resolved through a "taste-test." Players must create a dish that meets specific criteria, and their success is determined by their Palate Score and culinary skills.
*   **Flavor-Auras:** Powerful beings or locations can emit Flavor-Auras that affect all creatures within a certain radius (e.g., a "Sweet Aura" that makes everyone feel happy, a "Bitter Aura" that causes despair).
