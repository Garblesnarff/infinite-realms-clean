# Blood of the Einherjar
**Tagline:** *In the frozen north, heroes carve their names in blood and ice—for Ragnarok comes, and only glory is eternal*

## Campaign Overview

The party consists of legendary Norse warriors, heroes, and adventurers in the age of Vikings. They are Einherjar-in-training—those destined to fight at Ragnarok if they die gloriously in battle. The campaign weaves multiple saga threads: raiding across seas, blood-feuds spanning generations, encounters with gods and giants, quests for legendary treasures, and ultimately choosing sides when the twilight of the gods begins.

This combines Viking Age historical flavor with Norse mythology. The party will face berserkers and draugr, navigate complex honor codes and blood-feuds, earn places in Valhalla, and witness the end of the world. Fate (wyrd) is fixed, but how you face it defines you. This is Norse mythology: violent, fatalistic, darkly humorous, and ultimately tragic.

## Core Themes

- **Wyrd (Fate):** Destiny is inescapable; courage means facing it anyway
- **Glory and Fame:** Reputation outlives death
- **Blood-Feud:** Vengeance is sacred duty across generations
- **The Doomed Gods:** Even Odin knows Ragnarok comes
- **Shield-Brothers:** Loyalty unto death
- **The End Times:** Ragnarok approaches, fight anyway

## Key NPCs

**Odin All-Father** - One-eyed wanderer-god, seeks knowledge obsessively. Knows Ragnarok comes, prepares anyway. Tests heroes, recruits einherjar. Wise, manipulative, doomed.

**Thor** - Thunder god, giant-slayer, protector of Midgard. Straightforward, powerful, honorable. Will die killing Jormungandr.

**Loki** - Trickster, shapeshifter, chaos-bringer. Bound for killing Balder, will break free at Ragnarok. Complex: helper and enemy.

**Freya** - Goddess of love and war, chooses half the slain for Folkvangr (her hall). Beautiful, dangerous, practices seidr (magic).

**Fenris Wolf** - Monstrous wolf, son of Loki, bound until Ragnarok when he'll kill Odin. Represents inevitable doom.

**Valkyries** - Odin's choosers of slain. Beautiful warrior-women who decide who dies nobly, who goes to Valhalla. Psychopomps.

**Norns** - Three fate-weavers (Urd, Verdandi, Skuld). Weave every life's thread. Even gods cannot defy them.

**Enemy Jarl** - Human antagonist leading rival clan. Blood-feud spans generations. Honorable enemy or despicable villain (DM choice).

**The Völva** - Seeress who prophesies Ragnarok. Knows all fates, speaks in riddles. Sought for wisdom.

**Thralls and Karls** - Social classes below party (thralls are slaves, karls are free farmers). Complex social dynamics.

## Major Locations

**Homestead** - Party's base: longhouse, outbuildings, fields. What they defend and build reputation from.

**The Thing** - Assembly place: stone circle where law is made, disputes settled. Social and political center.

**Valhalla** - Odin's hall where einherjar feast and fight. Golden roof, weapon-wielding warriors, boar meat and mead eternally.

**Jotunheim** - Giant-realm: frozen mountains, stone fortresses, hostile and ancient. Where impossible quests occur.

**Niflheim** - Realm of ice and mist, home to Hel (goddess of death). The dishonored dead dwell here.

**Vigrid Plain** - Where Ragnarok's final battle occurs. 100 leagues in every direction. Prophesied battlefield.

**The Nine Worlds** - Asgard (gods), Midgard (humans), Jotunheim (giants), Alfheim (light elves), Svartalfheim (dwarves), Niflheim (ice/death), Muspelheim (fire), Vanaheim (Vanir gods), Helheim (death)

## Unique Mechanics

**Wyrd Points:** Fate that cannot be avoided. Spending wyrd points allows impossible feats but brings you closer to prophesied doom.

**Glory/Fame:** Reputation tracked mechanically. High fame means skalds sing of you, people fear/respect you, Valkyries notice.

**Blood-Feud:** Tracking honor debts and revenge. Breaking feud obligations loses honor. Pursuing them gains glory but perpetuates violence.

**Berserker Rage:** Temporary invincibility and super-strength at cost of control. Attack friend and foe indiscriminately.

**Runes:** Magic system based on carving runes. Divination, protection, curses. Odin's gift.

**Seidr (Magic):** Shamanic magic, considered unmanly for men but powerful. Visions, shapeshifting, weather control.

**Einherjar Status:** If you die gloriously, you go to Valhalla. Can be played in parallel scenes—feast with heroes between mortal sessions.

**The Thing:** Social combat system for legal disputes. Reputation, allies, rhetoric matter as much as strength.

## Plot Twists

**One Party Member is Loki's Child:** Secretly half-jötunn (giant). Destiny tied to Ragnarok in complicated ways.

**Blood-Feud Was Orchestrated:** Odin or Loki started it to create conflict, test warriors for Ragnarok. You've been manipulated.

**Ragnarok Can't Be Prevented:** All attempts to avoid prophecy make it happen. Fate is inevitable. The question is how you face it.

**Some Gods Want to Prevent Ragnarok:** Others accept it. Divine civil war over whether to fight fate. Party caught between.

**Surviving Ragnarok:** Prophecy says two humans survive (Lif and Lifthrasir). Party might be them. But glory is in dying well, not surviving.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Glorious Death:** Die in battle, chosen by Valkyries, feast in Valhalla until Ragnarok. Then die again gloriously. Ultimate victory.

**Survive Ragnarok:** Live through world's end, see rebirth. Become ancestors of new age. Different kind of victory—survival over glory.

**Die at Ragnarok:** Fall in final battle beside gods. Ultimate glory—died at world's end fighting impossible odds.

**Die Shamefully:** Disease, old age, or cowardice. Go to Hel, not Valhalla. Ultimate defeat in Norse culture.

**Prevent Ragnarok:** Extremely difficult, probably impossible. Would require defeating fate itself. Might be worse than letting it happen.
