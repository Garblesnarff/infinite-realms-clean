### **World-Building Specification Brief: A Midsummer Night's Chaos**

**1. Core Concept:**
The party enters an enchanted forest on Midsummer's Eve where quarreling fairy rulers have thrown nature into chaos, becoming entangled in romantic confusion caused by love potions and mischievous sprites.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the enchanted forest—realm where fae rule, mortal laws don't apply
*   Explain Oberon and Titania's quarrel—the changeling child both want, pride won't yield
*   Describe how their war affects nature—seasons confused, harvests failing
*   Write about fae magic rules—promises bind, true names have power, iron burns
*   Detail the love potion flower—juice of love-in-idleness hit by Cupid's arrow
*   Explain the relationship between Athens and the forest—order versus chaos
*   Describe Midsummer's Eve—when the veil is thin and mortals enter fae realm

**3. Factions:**
*   **Oberon's Court** (Major) - Fairy king and his followers including Puck
*   **Titania's Court** (Major) - Fairy queen and her attendants
*   **The Confused Lovers** (Major) - Hermia, Lysander, Helena, Demetrius and their chaos
*   **The Artisans** (Minor) - Bottom and company rehearsing their terrible play
*   **Athens Court** (Minor) - Theseus, Hippolyta, mortal authority
*   **The Forest Spirits** (Minor) - Cobweb, Mustardseed, other minor fae

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Puck/Robin Goodfellow, Oberon, Titania, Hermia, Lysander, Helena, Demetrius
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Bottom the Weaver," "Theseus," "Hippolyta," "Fairy Attendant," "Confused Father," "Forest Spirit," "Wedding Guest," "Artisan Actor"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Enchanted Forest** - Fae realm where mortal rules fail and magic reigns
*   **Oberon's Court** - Fairy king's seat of power, beautiful and dangerous
*   **Titania's Bower** - Queen's sleeping place surrounded by flowers
*   **The Clearing** - Where mortals rehearse plays and paths cross
*   **Athens** - Mortal city of order, contrasts with forest chaos

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Oberon and Titania remain at war THEN seasons fail and nature suffers
*   IF Puck applies love potion to wrong person THEN romantic chaos multiplies
*   IF party helps reconcile fairy rulers THEN nature restores and blessings granted
*   IF someone receives love potion THEN falls for first person they see upon waking
*   IF party performs well for fairy court THEN gains their favor and safe passage
*   IF anyone makes promise in forest THEN bound by fae magic to fulfill it
