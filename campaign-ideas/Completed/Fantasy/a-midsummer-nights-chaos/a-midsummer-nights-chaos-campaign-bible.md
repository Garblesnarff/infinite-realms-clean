## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### The Origin Myth: The Great Rehearsal
Before the material plane solidified, the Cosmos was a script written by the **Twin Dramaturgs**: **Tragedia** (Entropy) and **Comedia** (Creation). They fought over the genre of existence. To settle the dispute, they stitched the **Veil of Twilight**, separating the **Rigid World** (Athens/Logic/Law) from the **Dreamlands** (The Forest/Emotion/Chaos). The world is not a planet; it is a **Stage**, and the stars are merely the audience peeking through holes in the curtain. The conflict arises because the Script has been lost, and the actors (Gods/Fae) are now improvising dangerously.

### The Timeline of Absurdities (20 Events)
1.  **The Age of Silence:** Before language, reality was fluid. A mountain could become a thought.
2.  **The Syntax War:** The first Mortals invented Grammar, forcing the Fae into the forest to avoid being defined by Nouns.
3.  **The Day of Blue Fire:** The moon hatched, releasing a swarm of luminous moths that ate the concept of "Tuesday" from history.
4.  **The Coronation of the Fool:** A donkey was accidentally crowned King of Athens for a year; it was the most prosperous era in history.
5.  **The Weeping of the Willows:** Trees gained sentience solely to complain about the weather.
6.  **The Schism of the Rose:** Oberon and Titania split not over a child, but over whether a sunset is "Melancholy" or "Hopeful."
7.  **The Invention of Lying:** A bard named **Cyrano the False** told a lie so beautiful it became a demi-plane.
8.  **The Rain of Frogs (Literal):** It rained frogs. The frogs were critics who rated the architecture of the houses they splattered on.
9.  **The Locking of the Gates:** Theseus declares "Logic" the state religion, banning dreams within city walls.
10. **The Day the Birds Forgot How to Fly:** Gravity applied to avians for 24 hours. The "Great Splat."
11. **The Marriage of the Mountain:** Mount Olympus tried to marry a Volcano. The reception caused an earthquake.
12. **The Invention of the Rhyme:** A bard discovered that words sounding alike have magical resonance.
13. **The Great Nap:** Titania slept for 100 years. The forest overgrew three cities.
14. **The War of the Roses (Literal):** Red roses fought White roses. The thorns were poisonous.
15. **The Year of No Summer:** Oberon stole the sun to use as a reading light.
16. **The Exile of the Poets:** Athens banned metaphors. Poets fled to the woods, becoming the first Druids.
17. **The Birth of Puck:** He simply appeared one day, laughing, from a cracked egg found in a jester’s hat.
18. **The Treaty of Twilight:** Established the border between the Mortal World and the Fae. Signed in disappearing ink.
19. **The Night of the Long Knives (Props):** A coup in the theater guild where all real weapons were replaced with rubber ones.
20. **The Current Eve:** The stars align in the formation of "The Jester’s Grin," signaling the Veil is thinnest.

### Cosmology: The Patrons of Drama
*   **The Prompter (Neutral):** A whispered voice that tells heroes what to say when they forget their lines. Worshipped by bards.
*   **The Heckler (Chaotic):** A minor deity of disruption, throwing metaphysical rotten tomatoes at pompous rulers.
*   **The Stage Manager (Lawful):** The unseen force that ensures the sun rises on cue and gravity stays on.
