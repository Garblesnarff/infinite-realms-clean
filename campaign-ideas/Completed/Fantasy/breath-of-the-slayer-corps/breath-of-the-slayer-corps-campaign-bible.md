## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Demons" that plague the land are not invaders from another realm. They are a natural, planetary function, an immune response to a metaphysical illness: humanity's own negative emotions. When despair, hatred, or terror pool and stagnate in a location, the world's life-force, a form of Gaia-consciousness, manifests a "Demon" to consume and purify the toxic emotional energy. These Demons, however, are not mindless drones. They are sentient, powerful, and tragically, they find the taste of human suffering to be intoxicatingly delicious. They have learned that the best way to get more of their favorite "food" is to cultivate it, spreading fear and despair to create a self-sustaining buffet. The "Slayer Corps" was formed not to "destroy" the Demons—an impossible task, as this would be like trying to destroy the concept of sadness itself—but to manage them. They are not soldiers in a war, but doctors fighting a chronic, incurable disease. Their "Breathing Styles" are not merely sword techniques; they are a form of intense, weaponized meditation. By controlling their own breath and emotional state, a Slayer can resonate with a Demon's "core emotion" and "purify" it, causing the Demon to peacefully dissipate, its purpose served.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Sigh (The Dawn Age):** The first collective human emotion—a shared moment of despair during a harsh winter—causes the planet to "sigh," manifesting the First Demon, a being of pure, sorrowful hunger.
2.  **The Age of Appetites (Ancient History):** For centuries, Demons are a rare, natural phenomenon, like storms or earthquakes. They appear, consume a pocket of stagnant emotion, and vanish. Early mystics learn to appease or avoid them.
3.  **The First Teacher (c. -1,500 years):** A monk named Yoriichi, who could perceive the "emotional flow" of the world, develops the first "Breathing Style," Sun Breathing. He doesn't kill Demons; he "cures" them. He teaches his techniques to a select few.
4.  **The Founding of the Corps (c. -1,450 years):** Yoriichi's students form the Slayer Corps, a secret organization dedicated to "managing" the Demon population and protecting humanity. The various Breathing Styles are developed as offshoots of Sun Breathing.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day of Black Tears (c. -1,000 years):** A great tragedy befalls the capital city. The collective grief is so immense that it rains a black, oily substance for three days. Every drop that touches the ground spawns a lesser Demon of Sorrow. This is the first "Demon Pandemic."
6.  **The Birth of the Progenitor (c. -999 years):** During the Day of Black Tears, a single, brilliant Slayer, consumed by his own despair after losing his family, makes a terrible choice. Instead of purifying the Demons, he learns to consume *them*, and their emotional energy. He becomes the First Progenitor Demon, a being who does not need the planet to create him, but can create other Demons himself by spreading his own, perfected despair. He takes the name Muzan.
7.  **The Long Night (c. -998 to -50 years):** Muzan and his "Twelve Moons," his most powerful lieutenants, wage a secret, centuries-long war against the Slayer Corps. The Slayers are pushed to the brink of extinction multiple times.
8.  **(Surreal) The Whispering Plague (c. -200 years):** A plague sweeps the land where people can only whisper. The lack of strong, voiced emotion starves the local Demon population, which withers and dies. The Slayers learn that apathy can be a weapon, a lesson that horrifies them.
9.  **The Crimson Century (c. -100 years to present):** The war intensifies. New Breathing Styles are developed, and the Slayers, led by the stoic Ubuyashiki family, begin to push back against the Twelve Moons.
10. **(Surreal) The Weeping Wisteria (c. -1 year):** The wisteria flowers, long known to be a natural Demon repellent, begin to weep a glowing, purple sap. The Slayers' botanists discover the plants are "grieving" for the planet's life-force, which Muzan is consuming at an accelerated rate. The final confrontation is imminent.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a battle for the soul of humanity itself. The Slayers represent the philosophy that negative emotions, while painful, are a natural and necessary part of the human experience, and they must be managed with discipline and empathy. Muzan and his Demons represent the opposing view: that negative emotions are a source of ultimate power, and that the path to godhood is to cultivate endless suffering. The players are not just monster hunters; they are philosopher-warriors, fighting for the very definition of what it means to be human. Can they defeat Muzan without becoming like him? Can they save a world that is, by its very nature, the cause of its own suffering?

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. Yoriichi's Nichirin Blade
**Type:** Legendary Longsword
**Description:** The first Nichirin blade ever forged. A simple, black katana that seems to absorb the light. It feels warm to the touch, like a sliver of the sun.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 katana. It deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage to Demons. The wielder can use it to cast *Sunbeam* once per day. Most importantly, a creature attuned to this blade can see the "thread of fate" or "opening" in any opponent, granting them a permanent +2 bonus to all attack rolls.

### 2. The Progenitor's Blood
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A single, vial of Muzan's own, powerful blood. It is black, viscous, and writhes with a life of its own.
**Mechanics:** A creature who drinks this blood must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success, they gain the powers of a Demon (regeneration, immense strength, and a unique Blood Demon Art), but are forever bound to Muzan's will. On a failure, they die, their body dissolving into a screaming puddle of flesh. There is a 1% chance that a success will create a Demon not under Muzan's control.

### 3. The Book of Breathing
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Tome)
**Description:** A book written by Yoriichi, detailing the principles of Sun Breathing and how all other Breathing Styles are derived from it.
**Mechanics:** A creature who spends a week studying this book can learn the basics of any Breathing Style, even if they are not a Slayer. They can gain the benefits of one "form" from any Breathing Style (e.g., the speed of Thunder Breathing's first form, the defense of Water Breathing's eleventh form). They can only know one such form at a time.

### 4. The Blue Spider Lily
**Type:** Artifact (Flower)
**Description:** A mythical, legendary flower. It is the one thing Muzan has sought for a thousand years, believing it holds the key to conquering his weakness to the sun.
**Mechanics:** The flower does not, in fact, grant immunity to the sun. It is a red herring. Its true purpose is metaphysical. If a Demon consumes the flower, it is not cured, but "perfected" in its current state. A sorrowful Demon would become a being of pure, weaponized grief. A rage-filled Demon would become a being of pure, unstoppable fury. If a human consumes it, it grants them perfect emotional control, making them immune to any Demon's emotional manipulation.

### 5. The Ubuyashiki's Foresight
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Amulet)
**Description:** A simple, wooden amulet, passed down through the Ubuyashiki family. It is the source of their limited, but potent, precognitive abilities.
**Mechanics:** The wearer can, once per week, ask the DM a single question about the future actions of Muzan or his minions. The DM must answer truthfully, but cryptically. **Curse:** The amulet is tied to the Ubuyashiki blood curse. Any non-Ubuyashiki who wears it begins to suffer from the same curse, their body slowly decaying over time.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Slightly-Used Bamboo Muzzle:** It's a bit chewed on.
2.  **A Boar's Head Mask:** It smells terrible, but grants advantage on Intimidation checks against small animals.
3.  **A Set of Hanafuda Earrings:** A pair of simple, wooden earrings with a rising sun motif. They feel... important.
4.  **A Box of Very Loud, Very Bad-Tasting "Healing" Pills:** Made by a Butterfly Estate helper. They heal 1 HP but require a CON save to not vomit.
5.  **A Nichirin Blade That Changes Color Based on Your Mood:** It's currently a murky, indecisive grey.
6.  **A Gourd That Is Impossibly Hard to Break:** A training tool used by Slayers. It's just a very, very tough gourd.
7.  **A "Love Potion" Brewed by Zenitsu:** It doesn't work, and it tastes like tears and desperation.
8.  **A Kasugai Crow's Union Membership Card:** A tiny, official-looking card that proves the crow is part of the "Kasugai Crow Collective Bargaining Unit."
9.  **A Swordsmith's Mask:** A strange, clown-like mask worn by the swordsmiths. It has a calming effect on the wearer.
10. **A Page from Rengoku's "Book of Tasty Things":** A page from a journal where the Flame Hashira reviewed the food he ate. This one is about a particularly good bento box.
11. **A Vial of Wisteria Poison:** A vial of poison that is deadly to lesser Demons, but only gives stronger ones a mild headache.
12. **A Kakushi's "Invisibility" Hood:** A black hood that doesn't actually make you invisible, but makes you feel like you should be ignored.
13. **A "Certificate of Cowardice":** A certificate awarded to Zenitsu for "surviving a battle by running away more effectively than anyone else."
14. **Inosuke's Dictionary:** A book where Inosuke has tried to write down people's names. They are all spelled wrong.
15. **A Single, Perfect, Onigiri (Rice Ball):** It is the most delicious rice ball you have ever tasted.
16. **The "Rules of the Cult of Eternal Misery":** A pamphlet that is so depressing, you take 1 psychic damage just from reading it.
17. **A Forged Bracer Guild Membership:** A poorly-made fake that wouldn't fool a child.
18. **A Demon's First "Work of Art":** A crude, slightly disturbing finger-painting made with blood.
19. **A Ticket to the Mugen Train:** The ticket is for a journey that never ends.
20. **A Single, Shed, Black and Red Scale from a Dragon:** It feels ancient and powerful.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Emotion
Emotions are a tangible, physical force in this world. They are the building blocks of Demons and the fuel for a Slayer's power.
*   **Emotional Resonance:** Powerful emotions can have physical effects. A room where a great tragedy occurred will be colder and darker. A place of great joy will be warmer and brighter. Slayers can learn to "read" this resonance to track Demons.
*   **Breathing Styles:** A Breathing Style is more than just a set of sword moves. It is a way of controlling one's own emotional state to resonate with and "purify" a Demon's core emotion. For example, Water Breathing is about adapting and remaining calm, making it effective against Rage-Demons. Thunder Breathing is about channeling a single, explosive burst of focus, making it effective against Fear-Demons.
*   **Nichirin Blades:** These blades are forged from a special ore that absorbs sunlight. When a Slayer first holds their blade, it takes on a color that reflects their personality and core emotion. A passionate Slayer might have a red blade, a calm one a blue blade. The blade's color gives it a slight advantage when "purifying" a Demon of a corresponding emotion.

### Subsystems: Emotional State and The Final Breath
*   **Emotional State:** Each player has an "Emotional State" tracker (e.g., Calm, Angry, Sad, Afraid, Joyful). Certain actions or events can change this state. Your current state can grant you advantages or disadvantages. For example, being "Angry" might grant you a bonus to damage, but a penalty to defense. A Slayer's goal is to learn to control their state, shifting to the one most effective for the situation.
*   **The Final Breath:** A Slayer who is on the verge of death can choose to use their "Final Breath." This is a single, ultimate attack where they pour all of their remaining life-force and emotion into one, final form of their Breathing Style. This attack is incredibly powerful, capable of defeating even an Upper Moon Demon. However, whether it succeeds or fails, the user dies immediately after using it. It is the ultimate act of a Slayer: sacrificing their own life to purify a greater darkness.
