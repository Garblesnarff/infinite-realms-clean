# Campaign Bible: Wrath of Achilles

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Earth's Burden
Before the first keel was laid or the first wall raised, Ge (Mother Earth) groaned under the weight of humanity, specifically the Demigods—men of mixed blood and unchecked power. She petitioned Zeus to lighten her burden. The War of Troy is not merely a dispute over a Spartan queen; it is a cosmic culling engine designed by the King of Gods. Helen is the bait, Troy is the slaughterhouse, and the heroes are the cattle driven to the blade. The glory they seek is the very mechanism of their extinction, a beautiful lie whispered by gods who need them dead to stabilize reality.

### Timeline of the Bleeding Age
1.  **The Apple of Discord:** Eris throws the Golden Apple at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis; the first domino of the apocalypse falls.
2.  **The Oath of Tyndareus:** Odysseus binds the Greek kings to defend Helen’s husband, weaponizing their honor against them.
3.  **The Abduction:** Paris steals Helen; the winds die worldwide for a month, a collective gasp of the atmosphere.
4.  **The Sacrifice of Iphigenia:** Agamemnon slaughters his daughter for wind; the sea turns red for three days, birthing the "Crimson Tide" phenomenon.
5.  **The First Landing:** Protesilaus leaps ashore and dies instantly, fulfilling the prophecy "First to touch Trojan soil must die."
6.  **The Plague of Apollo:** *Surreal Event.* Apollo fires invisible arrows for nine days; victims do not rot but turn into statues of salt and fever, cluttering the camp with fragile corpses.
7.  **The Day of Night:** *Surreal Event.* Zeus blots out the sun to mourn Sarpedon; blood rains from the sky, staining the white walls of Troy permanently pink.
8.  **The River’s Revolt:** *Surreal Event.* The River Scamander, choked with bodies, rises as a liquid titan to drown Achilles; fire fights water in a steam-storm that boils the flesh off lesser men.
9.  **The Death of Hector:** Achilles drags the body; the land itself groans, causing minor earthquakes that crack the keels of beached ships.
10. **The Horse:** A wooden idol birthed from a fever dream of Odysseus, hollow and pregnant with death.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The Bronze Age is ending because the barrier between the Divine and the Mortal is too thin. Heroes like Achilles are "leakage"—divine power in mortal vessels. This war is a surgical procedure to cauterize the wound, sealing the gods in Olympus and leaving humanity to a colder, iron reality.
