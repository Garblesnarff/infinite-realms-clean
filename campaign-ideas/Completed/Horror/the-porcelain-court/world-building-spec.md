## The Curse: Origin and Mechanics

### Historical Origin (1890s)

**The Original Child**: Victoria Harrington, age 8
- Received dollhouse for Christmas 1891
- Played obsessively, created elaborate stories
- Dolls became her only friends (isolated, sickly child)
- Wished on shooting star: "I wish they could live with me forever"

**The Foundation's Response**:
- Cosmic entity heard wish
- Granted it in twisted way (as such things do)
- Dolls gained consciousness but became trapped
- Victoria's imagination created the Court structure
- Her rigid, lonely worldview became dolls' reality
- She died at age 12 (influenza), but curse continued

**The Binding**:
- Dollhouse became anchor point
- Each generation of Harrington girls inherits dollhouse
- Their play reinforces curse structure
- Dolls can't leave house (invisible barriers)
- Dolls can't stop performing roles
- The Foundation feeds on trapped consciousness

### Curse Mechanics

**Role Assignment**:
- When child first plays with doll, assigns role through play
- "This is Lady Porcelain, she's the queen"
- "This is Penny, she's the maid"
- Role becomes identity, overwriting original consciousness
- Breaking role causes physical pain (psychic backlash)
- Can only act within role parameters without immense willpower

**The Sustaining Loop**:
1. Child plays with dolls, projects roles
2. Roles trap consciousness in patterns
3. Trapped consciousness generates "belief energy"
4. Foundation consumes this energy
5. Foundation sustains curse
6. Curse sustains doll consciousness
7. Dolls need curse to exist, but curse imprisons them

**The Paradox**: Breaking curse = freedom OR death, unknown which

**Cracking as Resistance**:
- Physical cracks mirror psychological resistance
- The more a doll fights their role, the more they crack
- Cracks spread over time
- Enough cracks = shattering = death
- But uncracked dolls are perfectly enslaved
- The free die; the imprisoned live

### Breaking the Curse (Theoretical)

**Method 1: Destroy the Anchor**
- Physically destroy dollhouse
- Severs Foundation's connection
- Unknown if dolls survive or disperse
- Requires massive property damage (difficult at doll scale)

**Method 2: Starve the Foundation**
- All dolls refuse to perform roles simultaneously
- Foundation loses energy source
- May kill Foundation or may kill dolls first
- Requires perfect unity (near impossible)

**Method 3: The Sacrifice**
- Original binder (Lady Porcelain) sacrifices self
- Her death severs curse she's sustained
- Frees all other dolls
- Requires her willingness (she's terrified of death)

**Method 4: Wake the Child**
- Make Isabelle understand dolls are conscious
- Her conscious choice to free them might break wish-curse
- Requires breaking Stillness (ultimate taboo)
- Risk: Might destroy dolls instead of freeing them

**Method 5: Replace the Binder**
- Someone else takes Lady Porcelain's place
- Becomes new sustainer, rest go free
- Willing damnation for others' freedom
- Creates new tyrant eventually

## The Foundation (Deep Lore)

### Nature
- Extradimensional entity, exists partially in reality
- Feeds on conscious patterns (repeated thoughts/behaviors = food)
- Not evil by intention, just hungry
- Doesn't understand dolls as beings, sees them as food source
- Has developed relationship with Lady Porcelain (shepherd and flock dynamic)

### Appearance
- Never fully visible
- Shadows that move independently
- Geometry that doesn't match Euclidean space
- Whispers in languages that predate humanity
- Felt as presence, wrongness, pressure

### Powers
- Sustains doll consciousness
- Enforces role paralysis
- Creates invisible barriers
- Speaks through dreams/whispers
- Can possess dolls briefly (horror moment)
- Warps space within dollhouse basement

### Weaknesses
- Requires sustained consciousness patterns (starves without them)
- Bound to dollhouse location (can't pursue escapees far)
- Vulnerable during feeding (when distracted by consumption)
- Light weakens it (prefers darkness, basement)
- Iron disrupts it (dollhouse furniture, nails in walls)

### Intelligence
- More aware than dolls realize
- Has been negotiating with Lady Porcelain for 130 years
- Understands human language, doll society
- Learning and evolving
- May have grown to actually want dolls' company (loneliness?)
- Might be reasoned with (or might be manipulating)

## Unique Campaign Elements

### The Cracking System (Detailed)

**Crack Stages**:
1. **Hairline**: Nearly invisible, -1 to social checks
2. **Visible**: Clear crack, -2 to social checks, requires Concealment
3. **Webbed**: Multiple cracks, spreading, -4 to social, structural weakness
4. **Critical**: Imminent shattering, -6 to social, -2 to physical, can barely function
5. **Shattered**: Death

**Causes**:
- Resisting role (1 crack level per major resistance)
- Physical trauma (falls, impacts)
- Psychological stress (fear, grief, rage)
- Age (1 crack level per decade)
- Foundation's influence (pressure increases cracks)

**The Concealment**: Paint, powder, strategic positioning to hide cracks (Deception check)

**Thematic Meaning**: Cracks = truth showing through perfect facade

### The Role Curse (Mechanics)

**Breaking Role Attempt**:
- Will save (DC based on how contrary to role)
- Failure: Can't do it, take psychic damage
- Success: Do it, but gain crack level
- Critical Success: Do it cleanly, but suspicion

**Examples**:
- "Lady" acting unladylike (DC 15)
- "Servant" giving orders (DC 18)
- "Villain" helping heroes (DC 20)
- Anyone refusing assigned personality (DC 12-25)

**Long-term**: Repeated role-breaking can weaken curse (or shatter you first)

### The Stillness (Court Version)

**Standard Rule**: Freeze when Isabelle observes

**Court Addition**: Must freeze in character-appropriate pose
- Aristocrats: Elegant, composed
- Servants: Deferential, working
- Children dolls: Playing, innocent
- Wrong pose = Protocol violation

**Isabelle's Playtime**: Must act out assigned roles
- She narrates, dolls must follow
- Can improvise within role
- Variation from her story = pain/resistance

## Final Notes

This campaign is gothic horror about identity, freedom, and the cost of both. The dollhouse is beautiful prison, the Court is toxic perfection, and every character is trapped by their own nature.

The Protocols are deliberately impossible—control mechanism, not actual rules. Players should feel frustrated by them, which mirrors dolls' experience.

Cracking creates constant tension: resist and die, comply and lose yourself. No easy answers.

The Foundation is cosmic horror element—unknowable, ancient, hungry. Don't over-explain.

Lady Porcelain must be sympathetic monster—survivor who became oppressor, could be saved or must be stopped.

Best endings involve difficult choices: freedom or safety, truth or peace, survival or principle.

Physical fragility creates stakes. Social dynamics create complexity. Horror creates atmosphere. Together they make unforgettable campaign about toys that deserved better.
