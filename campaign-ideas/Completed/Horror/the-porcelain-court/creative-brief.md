# The Porcelain Court - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Primary Style**: Gothic Victorian horror meets dollhouse miniaturism
- **Color Palette**: Pastels concealing darkness—pink, cream, gold, with shadow undertones
- **Lighting**: Chandelier crystal refractions, candle-like (warm but creates deep shadows)
- **Camera Perspective**: Claustrophobic interiors, emphasize tiny spaces and fragility

### Character Design

**Porcelain Dolls (Aristocracy)**
- Flawless painted features (smiling even when terrified)
- Elaborate Victorian dresses, bustles, lace
- Visible cracks shown as character development
- Painted blush, beauty marks, expressions frozen
- Stiff posture (porcelain doesn't bend much)
- Glassy eyes that still somehow convey emotion

**The Concealment** (Hiding Damage)
- Face powder covering cracks
- Strategic positioning hiding damage
- Clothing adjusted to conceal
- Desperation visible in trying to maintain perfection

**Cloth/Plastic Dolls (Servants)**
- Simpler construction, less detail
- Painted features (not sculpted)
- Flexible bodies contrast with porcelain rigidity
- Working clothes, aprons, simpler hair
- More expressive (can actually bend/move)

**The Broken Ones** (Basement)
- Glued cracks visible (gold kintsugi-style repairs or crude tape)
- Missing pieces (arms, faces, parts)
- Chipped paint revealing blank porcelain
- Asymmetrical, disturbing
- Beauty destroyed but presence more powerful

### Environment Design

**The Dollhouse (Exterior)**
- Victorian mansion style, three stories
- Perfect pink and white paint
- Gingerbread trim, false windows
- Sits on shelf like temple/prison
- Scale: 3 feet tall, massive to dolls inside

- Wallpaper: Roses and gold filigree
- Parquet floor (detailed cardboard)
- Portrait gallery (past dolls, warnings)
- Always impeccably arranged
- Shadow pools in corners

**The Parlor**
- Miniature furniture, perfect detail
- Permanent tea service (glued down)
- Lace curtains
- Everything positioned precisely
- Suffocating perfection

**The Basement**
- Dark space under dollhouse
- Broken furniture pieces
- Shattered doll parts scattered
- The Foundation's presence: Shadow that moves wrongly
- Geometry doesn't match house above
- Madness made spatial

**The Garden**
- Plastic flowers (forever blooming, never growing)
- Tiny white fence
- Pebble paths
- Only "outside" space
- Exposed to vast room beyond (terror and beauty)

### Key Visual Moments

- Wrongness that breaks visual rules

**The Rebellion**
- Dolls breaking Protocol deliberately
- Moment of choice: Bow or stand
- Physical pain of breaking role (visible aura, distortion)
- Cracks spreading but doll standing anyway
- Beauty in defiance

## Music Direction

### Main Theme
- **Instrumentation**: Music box melody over disturbing undertones
- **Mood**: Childhood innocence corrupted
- **Melody**: Beautiful but slightly wrong (notes slightly off-key)
- **Rhythm**: Waltz time (ballroom elegance), occasionally stuttering

### Character Themes

**Lady Porcelain**: Harpsichord, elegant but cold, minor key waltz
**Lord Bisque**: Cello, romantic but mournful, yearning melody
**Madam Craqueture**: Violin, frantic, revolutionary, building intensity
**Penny Dreadful**: Acoustic guitar, folk-style, warm and grounded
**The Twins**: Dual pianos, synchronized then diverging, eerie harmonies
**The Foundation**: Bass drones, impossible harmonics, sounds that shouldn't exist together

### Location Themes

**The Grand Ballroom**: Full orchestra waltz, Vienna ball elegance with dissonance
**The Parlor**: Delicate harpsichord and flute, tea party pretense
**The Basement**: Drone sounds, reversed audio, detuned strings, madness sonified
**The Garden**: Gentler, open air feel, hope and danger mixed
**The Walls**: Echo effects, hollow sounds, whispering percussion

### Emotional Cues

**Protocol Enforcement**: Metronome precision, clockwork sounds, rigid tempo
**Cracking**: Ceramic breaking sounds as percussion, incorporated into music
**Madness**: Musical structure breaking down, wrong notes, timing off
**Freedom**: Music box melody played on real instruments (liberation from mechanical)
**The Stillness**: All music stops, only breathing (doll doesn't breathe, but player does)

## Voice Acting Direction

### Accent: Victorian High Society

## Sound Design

### Porcelain Physics
- Movement: Delicate clicks, ceramic sliding
- Cracking: High-pitched snaps, spreading cracks (crackling)

### Dollhouse Acoustics
- Everything echoes slightly (tiny rooms, hard surfaces)
- Voices sound miniature (high formants)
- Footsteps: Tiny taps on wood floors
- Doors: High-pitched creaks (tiny hinges)

### The Foundation

- Silence too complete (absorbs sound)

### Isabelle's Presence
- Earthquake footsteps approaching
- Breathing (wind from god)
- Hands descending (eclipse terror)
- Voice: Distant, godlike, usually cheerful

## Marketing Taglines

## Final Creative Note

The campaign's aesthetic is "beautiful lies." Everything looks perfect—elaborately so—while being profoundly wrong. Visual beauty creates dissonance with horror content.

Use contrast constantly: Perfect faces showing fear, elegant ballrooms hosting executions, gentle music over violence, polite language delivering threats.

Porcelain fragility should be visceral. Every movement risks cracking. Every crack visible. Physical vulnerability metaphor for psychological breakdown.

The dollhouse should feel both cozy and claustrophobic, safe and prison-like. Miniature scale creates intimacy and confinement simultaneously.

Color palette stays pastel and pretty even during horror. This maintains cognitive dissonance—nothing should look as dark as it feels.

The Foundation is unknowable—use negative space, implication, wrongness rather than showing directly. What you don't see is scarier.

Final sessions should either show dollhouse destroyed (sad beauty in ruins) or transformed (same but different, hope in change). Visual language should reflect emotional arc.
