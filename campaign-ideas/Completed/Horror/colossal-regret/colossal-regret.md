# Colossal Regret
**Tagline:** *The monster is you*

## Campaign Overview

The party members share a secret: each of them unconsciously manifests a kaiju. When they experience extreme emotions—rage, grief, fear—a corresponding giant creature appears halfway across the world and mirrors their actions. A tantrum becomes a destroyed city. A breakdown becomes mass casualties. They don't know they're doing it. They can't control it. And people are dying.

The campaign begins with mysterious monster attacks worldwide. The party are seemingly unrelated individuals dealing with personal crises: addiction, abusive relationships, career failures, trauma. As sessions progress, they notice disturbing correlations: their worst moments align with attack timings. Eventually, they meet each other in a support group, compare notes, and realize the horrifying truth.

They must learn to control their manifestations before world governments find and kill them, before their personal demons destroy millions, and before the psychic connection drives them insane. The campaign explores addiction, abuse, mental health, and whether people who've hurt others (even unknowingly) deserve redemption or punishment.

## Core Themes

- **Personal Responsibility:** Your pain hurts others
- **Addiction as Monster:** Substance abuse manifesting literally
- **Abusive Relationships:** Control and manipulation made physical
- **Mental Health Crisis:** Depression, anxiety, PTSD as kaiju
- **Redemption vs. Punishment:** Do intentions matter?
- **Collateral Damage:** Innocents suffer for your issues

## Session Breakdown (24 sessions)

**Sessions 1-4:** Introduction to party members separately, establishing personal struggles, monster attacks in background news, no connection obvious yet

**Sessions 5-8:** First correlations noticed, coincidences pile up, party members meet in support group, awkward bonding over shared dysfunction

**Sessions 9-12:** Confirmation of connection, controlled testing (small emotional releases = small manifestations), horror of realization, attempting isolation to prevent attacks

**Sessions 13-16:** Government notices patterns, manhunt begins, party on run together, learning tentative control, relationships forming despite toxicity

**Sessions 17-20:** Origins revealed—psychic trauma from childhood created manifestations, each kaiju represents specific wound, confronting root causes means facing worst memories

**Sessions 21-24:** Final choice—surrender to authorities (death or imprisonment), maintain control forever (exhausting, isolating), or heal psychologically (risky, might unleash worse during therapy), resolution personal to each character

## Key NPCs

**Dr. Elena Martinez:** Therapist running support group, discovers truth, helps or reports party depending on their actions

**Agent Kowalski:** Government investigator hunting manifesters, believes they're terrorists, relentless

**Oscar:** Childhood friend of one party member, becomes abusive controller, his manipulation makes their kaiju worse

**The First Manifester:** Older individual who discovered connection years ago, isolated herself completely, cautionary tale

**Support Group Members:** Other troubled people, not manifesters, normal problems highlighting party's uniqueness

**Victims' Families:** People who lost loved ones to attacks, faces of collateral damage, rightfully angry

## Major Locations

**The City:** Where party lives, mundane setting contrasting with cosmic horror

**Manifestation Zone:** Seoul (or other distant city), where kaiju appear

**Support Group Building:** Safe space becoming dangerous when emotions run high

**Isolation Cabin:** Where party hides, cabin fever makes control harder

**Government Facility:** Where captured manifesters are studied/imprisoned

**The Playground:** Shared childhood trauma location, returns here for confrontation

## Unique Mechanics

### Emotional Triggers
- Track each PC's stress, anger, sadness, fear
- Threshold reached = manifestation occurs
- Manifestation type reflects emotion (rage=destruction, grief=stillness, fear=hiding)
- Real-time consequences in Seoul

### Manifestation Control
- Wisdom saves to prevent emergence
- Constitution saves to maintain control during
- Intelligence checks to understand pattern
- Charisma saves to suppress entirely (harmful long-term)

### Psychological Health
- Track mental health separately from HP
- Therapy helps but risky (digging into trauma can trigger)
- Medication suppresses but doesn't cure
- Support from party crucial

### Collateral Damage Tracking
- Casualty count from each member's manifestations
- Affects NPC reactions and party morale
- Guilt accumulation mechanical effect
- Redemption harder with higher numbers

### Relationship Toxicity
- Party members' personal dysfunction affects each other
- Enabling addiction, codependency, etc.
- Healthy boundaries vs. abandoning struggling allies
- Growth requires uncomfortable confrontations

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1:** Oscar can also manifest—he's using his kaiju to intimidate party member's kaiju in Seoul, abusive relationship made literal

**Twist 2:** Government already knows about manifesters, has been covering up for decades

**Twist 3:** One party member's kaiju is protective, has been fighting others, not all manifestations are destructive

**Twist 4:** Childhood trauma that created manifestations was caused by another manifester's attack, cycle of pain

**Twist 5:** Medication offered by government actually increases manifestations—wants to study them

**Twist 6:** The First Manifester didn't isolate voluntarily—government imprisoned her, fabricated her story

**Twist 7:** Party member's therapist is manifester too, kaiju support group exists secretly

**Twist 8:** Healing trauma makes manifestation stronger temporarily (confronting demons), gets worse before better

**Twist 9:** One kaiju is benevolent, has been secretly saving lives during attacks

**Twist 10:** Children of manifesters inherit ability—party member discovers they're pregnant/have child

## Victory Conditions

**Therapeutic Victory:** All party members heal, manifestations cease or become controllable, redemption earned through work

**Sacrifice Victory:** Party members separate forever, isolate to prevent attacks, lonely but safe

**Control Victory:** Learn perfect control, live normally, secret maintained, fragile stability

**Justice Victory:** Turn selves in, cooperate with containment, accept punishment for casualties, dignity in accountability

## Defeat Conditions

**Execution:** Government finds and kills party as terrorists

**Mutual Destruction:** Party members trigger each other, all manifest simultaneously, Seoul destroyed

**Loss of Control:** One member embraces their kaiju, becomes willing destroyer, others must stop them

**Spiral:** Attempted healing fails catastrophically, worse manifestations, party scatters or dies

## Character Concepts (Examples)

**The Addict:** Withdrawal manifests as rampaging monster, sobriety journey parallels control

**The Abuse Survivor:** Suppressed anger creates destroyer, learning to express safely

**The Depressive:** Manifestation barely moves, sinks into ground, city swallowed by despair

**The Anxious:** Kaiju runs wildly, unpredictable, anxiety made literal terror

**The Grieving:** Lost loved one, manifestation searches for them, melancholic and huge

## Unique Session Types

**Therapy Sessions:** Actual role-played counseling, players explore character psychology deeply

**Mundane Days:** No combat, just dealing with rent, jobs, relationships, contrast to cosmic horror

**Manifestation Sequences:** Cut between party's emotional moment and Seoul destruction in parallel

**Support Group:** Meeting other troubled people, party's unique problems highlighted

**On The Run:** Government pursuit, paranoia, trust issues, survival

## Content Warnings

This campaign deals with heavy topics:
- Addiction and substance abuse
- Domestic abuse and manipulation
- Depression and suicidal ideation
- PTSD and trauma
- Guilt and self-harm
- Mass casualties and survivor's guilt

**Session Zero Essential:** Establish boundaries, safety tools, player comfort levels

## Why This Campaign Works

**Personal Stakes:** Not saving world, saving selves

**Moral Complexity:** Party are both victims and perpetrators

**Grounded:** Most of campaign is realistic human drama

**Cathartic:** Externalizing real struggles as giant monsters

**Hopeful:** Redemption possible through genuine work and growth
