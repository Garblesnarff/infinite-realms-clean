# Creative Brief: Curse of the Skinwalker

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Southwest Supernatural Realism

Inspired by Navajo cultural aesthetics and desert supernatural horror, blending authentic indigenous culture with respectful supernatural elements. This style captures the beauty and terror of the desert and the ancient power of forbidden magic.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Cultural Respect:** Depict Navajo culture accurately and respectfully while incorporating supernatural elements.
*   **Contrast Desert Beauty and Horror:** The stark beauty of the landscape hiding terrible secrets.
*   **Focus on Transformation:** Show the shifting nature of the skinwalker's forms.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Shapeshifter, forbidden magic, desert, witch, transformation, paranoia, taboo, ancient power.
*   **Feeling:** The constant uncertainty of who to trust. The weight of ancient taboos and the terror of their violation.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm desert colors (reds, oranges, browns) by day, deep purples and blacks by night. The skinwalker in animal form has an unnatural quality to its coloring.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a desert landscape at sunset with deep oranges and purples. A coyote stands on a ridge, but something is wrong with it—its eyes are too intelligent, its movements too deliberate, and its fur has an unnatural sheen that catches the light wrong."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Skinwalker:** In human form, appears normal but may have subtle tells (wrong eye reflections, unnatural stillness, missing personal knowledge). In animal form (coyote, wolf, bear, eagle, owl), the creature is larger than normal and moves with disturbing human-like intelligence.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive coyote, larger than natural, standing on its hind legs in an almost human posture. Its eyes glow with unnatural intelligence and reflect light in colors that don't match any natural animal. Around it, the air seems to shimmer as if reality is uncertain. The transformation between forms is shown as the creature's body dissolving into dark smoke before reforming."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Desert landscapes, Navajo reservation communities, traditional hogans, sacred sites, and the vast empty spaces of the Southwest.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A traditional Navajo hogan at night, lit from within. The surrounding desert is vast and empty. In the distance, multiple animal forms (coyotes, an owl, a bear) are barely visible, all moving toward the dwelling with unnatural coordination. The scene creates a sense of being surrounded by an intelligence that can take any form."

## Voice

A low, careful voice with a southwestern accent, speaking in hushed tones out of respect and fear. The pacing is deliberate, with pauses before speaking directly about the forbidden topic. The emotion is deep respect for cultural traditions mixed with genuine fear. Audio quality is clear with desert wind sounds in the background. Role: An elder who knows the old ways and reluctantly shares forbidden knowledge to save lives.
