**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the desert borderlands near Navajo Nation territories, people are dying under mysterious circumstances—murdered by what appear to be wild animals or their own loved ones. Local elders whisper of yee naaldlooshii, the "skinwalkers"—witches who have broken the greatest taboo and gained the power to transform into any animal or person by wearing their skin. The players must navigate a culture that forbids even speaking of these creatures, identify who among the community has turned to dark magic, and stop the skinwalker before it's too late—all while knowing that discussing the creature draws its attention.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A supernatural investigation into forbidden magic and shapeshifting witches.

*   **Act I — The Forbidden Name (Sessions 1–4):** Strange deaths plague desert communities. The players investigate but find locals unwilling to speak of the true cause. They learn of the skinwalker legend and that speaking of it invites its attention. They become targets.
*   **Act II — Faces in the Dark (Sessions 5–9):** The skinwalker begins stalking the party, appearing as trusted allies, animals, or strangers. Paranoia grows as they cannot trust anyone. They must gather materials for protective rituals while identifying the witch's true identity.
*   **Act III — The Witch's Reckoning (Sessions 10–15):** The party discovers the skinwalker's true identity and motive. To destroy it permanently, they must gather sacred items, perform a dangerous purification ritual, and confront the witch in its lair—knowing it can appear as anyone or anything.

### Session 1 — "Deaths in the Desert"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players arrive to investigate deaths attributed to animal attacks—but the wounds don't match any known predator.
    *   Witnesses report seeing loved ones in impossible locations or acting strangely before attacks.
    *   Local elders refuse to speak directly about the cause, only warning "do not speak its name" and "the witch is among us."
**Escalation:** A player character sees someone they know standing in the desert at night—but that person is actually asleep elsewhere.

### Sessions 2-4 — "The Shapechanger"
*   **Focus:** Horror / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party witnesses a skinwalker transformation—an animal dissolving into smoke and reforming as a person.
    *   They're attacked by what appears to be a pack of coyotes that move with human intelligence.
    *   An elder agrees to share knowledge: skinwalkers are witches who murdered a blood relative to gain dark power. They can shapeshift but are vulnerable to specific weapons and rituals.
**Escalation:** The skinwalker appears as one of the players during a critical moment, sowing confusion and paranoia.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Speaking the Name**
*   Every time someone speaks directly about skinwalkers (using the term or describing them in detail), the witch becomes aware of their location.
*   The DM can use this to create dramatic appearances or subtle stalking.
*   Players must learn to communicate about the threat without naming it directly.

### 2. **Shapeshifter Paranoia**
*   The skinwalker can appear as any person or animal it has consumed.
*   The DM should regularly create situations where players must verify identities.
*   Successful **Insight checks** may reveal subtle wrongness (wrong mannerisms, missing personal knowledge, eyes that reflect wrong colors).

### 3. **Sacred Protections**
*   Players can create protective measures:
    *   **White Ash:** Weapons coated in white ash can harm the skinwalker in any form
    *   **Sacred Herbs:** Create barriers the witch cannot easily cross
    *   **Bone Weapons:** Weapons made from animal bones deal extra damage
    *   **Protective Chants:** Learned from elders, can force the skinwalker to reveal its true form

### 4. **The Purification Ritual**
*   To permanently destroy the skinwalker, players must:
    *   Identify its true human identity
    *   Gather sacred items (blessed water, white ash, specific herbs, a medicine bundle)
    *   Lure or force it to the Sacred Site
    *   Perform the ritual while fighting off its transformations
    *   Strike its true form with a bone weapon coated in white ash
