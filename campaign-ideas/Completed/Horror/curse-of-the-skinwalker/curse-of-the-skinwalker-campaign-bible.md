# Curse of the Skinwalker: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Skinwalker" is not a creature, but a localized "reality-glitch," a sentient "narrative parasite" that feeds on identity. It is born when a community's sense of self becomes fractured—when people pretend to be something they're not, when secrets are kept, when trust erodes. The Skinwalker manifests as a perfect mimicry of a loved one, but subtly "wrong." It doesn't steal skin; it steals the *idea* of a person, leaving behind an empty shell. The "curse" is not on the Skinwalker, but on the community itself, which is slowly losing its ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, between self and other. The original "Skinwalker" legends were not about witches turning into animals, but about the terrifying realization that the person you thought you knew was never truly there, replaced by a perfect, empty copy. It is the horror of the uncanny valley made manifest, a living lie that grows stronger with every act of deception.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Lie (Ancient History):** A small, isolated community, facing starvation, pretends to be a more prosperous tribe to gain aid. The collective deception creates the first, nascent "Skinwalker" energy.
2.  **The Age of Masks (c. 1500s):** European settlers arrive, bringing with them new forms of deception: false promises, hidden agendas, and the forced assimilation of indigenous cultures. The Skinwalker energy grows.
3.  **The First Mimicry (c. 1700s):** A colonist, desperate to escape a debt, fakes his own death and assumes a new identity. The Skinwalker energy coalesces, manifesting as a perfect, but subtly "wrong," copy of the colonist, who then takes his place.
4.  **The Legend Spreads (c. 1800s):** The "Skinwalker" legends begin to spread among both indigenous and settler communities, tales of shapeshifters and stolen identities.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Faces Shifted (c. 1900s):** For 24 hours, everyone in the affected community sees everyone else's face subtly shift and change, reflecting their hidden desires, fears, or true intentions. Many go mad.
6.  **The Great Impersonation (c. 1950s):** A major political figure in the community is replaced by a Skinwalker. The imposter is so perfect that no one notices, and the community's sense of self becomes even more fractured.
7.  **The Rise of the Face-Changers (c. 1980s):** A secret society discovers how to mimic the Skinwalker's abilities, using their powers to steal identities for profit or power.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Lie (c. 1990s):** A specific, powerful lie told by a community leader echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original lie.
9.  **The Erosion of Trust (Present Day):** The Skinwalker's influence has grown. People are becoming increasingly paranoid, unable to trust their neighbors, their family, or even themselves. The community is on the verge of collapse.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the Mirrors Lied (1 week ago):** All mirrors in the affected community begin to show not your reflection, but the reflection of the person you *pretend* to be. The horror of self-deception becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the erosion of identity and trust. The Skinwalker is not evil; it is a symptom. It forces people to confront the lies they tell themselves and each other. The players are caught in this cycle, and the horror comes from the realization that the monster they are hunting is a reflection of their own fractured community. The goal is not to "kill" the Skinwalker, which is impossible, but to heal the community's sense of self, to restore trust, or, perhaps, to find a way to accept the inherent ambiguity of identity without manifesting it into a monster. The ultimate horror is the realization that the Skinwalker is the truth you refuse to see.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Mirror of True Self
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A hand mirror with a frame of polished, ancient wood. It reflects not your image, but your true, unvarnished self, stripped of all pretense and deception.
**Mechanics:** When a creature looks into the mirror, it sees its true self reflected back at it. This causes 1d6 psychic damage per lie it is currently holding. If a creature confesses its lies to the mirror, the mirror absorbs the lies, and the creature is cleansed of its deception. The mirror can then project the absorbed lies as a powerful, psychic attack.

### 2. The Skinwalker's Mask
**Type:** Cursed Item
**Description:** A mask made of perfectly preserved human skin. It is subtly "wrong" in its features.
**Mechanics:** When a creature wears this mask, they can perfectly mimic the appearance of any humanoid they have seen. However, the mask slowly consumes the wearer's own identity. Each day the mask is worn, the wearer must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wearer's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Skinwalker.

### 3. The Archivist's Quill
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Quill)
**Description:** A quill made from a single, grey feather. It writes in a neat, implacable, and utterly final script.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this quill to write a single, binding, magical contract. Any party who signs the contract is magically bound to uphold their end of the bargain, on pain of being "erased" from existence by the Skinwalker. The quill can also be used to "serve a summons" on any being, forcing them to appear for a negotiation.

### 4. The Shifting Sands Compass
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A compass made of polished wood and brass. The needle constantly spins, never pointing North.
**Mechanics:** The compass points towards the location of the nearest "reality-glitch" or "narrative parasite." It can also be used to navigate the Shifting Fields, allowing the user to find their way through the constantly changing landscape. **Curse:** The compass slowly erodes the user's sense of direction. Each day the compass is used, the user must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose their sense of direction for 1 hour.

### 5. The Empty Shell's Locket
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A simple, silver locket. It is empty.
**Mechanics:** The locket is a powerful tool for restoring stolen identities. If a fragment of a stolen identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait) is placed inside the locket, it will begin to glow. If all the fragments of a stolen identity are placed inside the locket, the locket will glow brightly, and the Empty Shell will be restored to their original identity.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Identity
In this world, identity is a fluid, fragile, and powerful force.
*   **Identity Resonance:** Strong, consistent identities (a person who is truly themselves, a community with a strong sense of self) create a "resonance" that repels the Skinwalker. Weak, fractured identities attract it.
*   **Mimicry Magic:** Spells that involve illusion, disguise, or shapeshifting are more powerful in this setting, but also more dangerous. A failed illusion spell might cause the caster to temporarily lose their own identity.
*   **The Uncanny Valley:** The closer a mimicry gets to perfection, the more unsettling it becomes. This is a tangible force. A perfect mimicry of a loved one will cause a profound sense of unease and dread.

### Subsystems: Identity Score and Trust
*   **Identity Score:** Each player has an "Identity Score" (from 0 to 10). This score decreases when they lie, pretend to be someone they're not, or keep secrets. Low Identity makes them more susceptible to the Skinwalker's influence and its mimicry. At 0, the character becomes an Empty Shell. Restoring trust and being honest can increase their Identity Score.
*   **Trust:** The community has a "Trust" score (from 0 to 10). This score decreases with every act of deception, every stolen identity, every manifestation of the Skinwalker. Low Trust makes the community more vulnerable to the Skinwalker's influence, as people are unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Restoring trust can heal the community and weaken the Skinwalker.
