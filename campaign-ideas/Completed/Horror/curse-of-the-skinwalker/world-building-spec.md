**Curse of the Skinwalker**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the desert borderlands near Navajo Nation territories, people are dying under mysterious circumstances—murdered by what appear to be wild animals or their own loved ones. Local elders whisper of yee naaldlooshii, the "skinwalkers"—witches who have broken the greatest taboo and gained the power to transform into any animal or person by wearing their skin. The players must navigate a culture that forbids even speaking of these creatures, identify who among the community has turned to dark magic, and stop the skinwalker before it's too late.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Navajo cultural beliefs about witchcraft and the taboo of speaking about skinwalkers (with cultural respect and accuracy).
    *   Write the history of how one becomes a skinwalker—the murder of a blood relative and forbidden rituals.
    *   Describe the powers and limitations of skinwalkers.
    *   Explain traditional protections and methods to identify and destroy them.
    *   Detail the curse's effects on the witch and those around them.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Community** (Minor): Navajo Nation residents who fear the witch but cannot speak openly about it.

    *   **Tribal Police** (Minor): Led by Officer Blackhorse, trying to solve crimes conventionally while respecting cultural beliefs.
    *   **The Skinwalker** (Major - Hidden): Identity is Tommy Yazzie. Believes he's protecting the community through forbidden power.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Suspicious Local," "Witness," "Victim's Family," "Traditional Practitioner"

**5. Location Blueprints**

*   **The Desert Wastes:** Vast empty spaces where the skinwalker hunts freely
*   **The Abandoned Hogan:** Where the skinwalker performs rituals and stores animal skins
*   **The Sacred Site:** Protected location for purification rituals

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Players speak openly and disrespectfully about skinwalkers → **THEN:** The witch targets them specifically, community cooperation decreases
*   **IF:** Players show respect for Navajo culture → **THEN:** Elders share protective knowledge, community helps identify the witch
*   **IF:** Players identify and destroy the skinwalker using traditional methods → **THEN:** Peace restored, but the community must heal from the violation of taboos
*   **IF:** Players use non-traditional methods or publicize the event → **THEN:** Cultural damage done, community trust broken
