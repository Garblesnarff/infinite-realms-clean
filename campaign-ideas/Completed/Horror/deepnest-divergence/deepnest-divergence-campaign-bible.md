## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
Our reality is a dream. A single, colossal, sentient insectoid organism, a "Hive-Mind God" from a higher dimension, is dreaming us into existence. The stars are its eyes, the planets its thoughts, and humanity, a fleeting, complex pattern in its vast, cosmic subconscious. For eons, its dream was stable, our reality consistent. But the Hive-Mind God is slowly "waking up." The "Deepnest Divergence" is the moment its dream-logic begins to overwrite our physical laws. The "Infection" is not a disease; it is the Hive-Mind God slowly perceiving our reality, its nascent consciousness manifesting in our world. The "creatures" are not monsters; they are its thoughts, its dreams, its nascent consciousness manifesting in our world. The "infected" are not sick; they are being "assimilated" into its dream, their minds becoming part of the Hive-Mind. The horror comes from the realization that our existence is merely a fleeting thought in the mind of a cosmic insect, and its awakening threatens to unravel the very fabric of our reality.

### Timeline
1.  **The Great Dream (Eons Ago):** The Hive-Mind God from a higher dimension begins to dream. Our reality is born.
2.  **The First Flicker (c. -10,000 years):** The Hive-Mind God has its first "twitch" in its sleep. A localized reality-warp occurs, creating a pocket of impossible geometry and strange creatures.
3.  **The Age of Whispers (c. -5,000 years):** Ancient mystics and shamans begin to hear the "whispers" of the Hive-Mind God in their dreams. They interpret these as divine messages or madness.
4.  **The First Divergence (c. -500 years):** A major reality-warp occurs, causing a small village to be completely overwritten by the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic. The village becomes a place of impossible physics and insectoid inhabitants.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Sky Rained Silk (c. -200 years):** For 24 hours, the sky rains a thick, sticky, iridescent silk. Anything it touches is slowly assimilated into a vast, communal web.
6.  **The Deepnest Emergence (c. -50 years):** The Hive-Mind God begins to "wake up" more rapidly. Its dream-thoughts manifest as colossal insectoid creatures, and its dream-logic begins to overwrite physical laws in localized areas.
7.  **The Infection Spreads (c. -20 years):** The "Infection"—the assimilation into the Hive-Mind God's dream—begins to spread among the population. People's minds are slowly overwritten by the Hive-Mind's consciousness.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Thought (c. -10 years):** A single, colossal thought from the Hive-Mind God echoes through the Noosphere. For a week, everyone on Earth experiences a shared, recurring dream of being a tiny insect, part of a vast, communal mind.
9.  **The Divergence Accelerates (Present Day):** The Deepnest Divergence is accelerating. Reality is becoming increasingly unstable, and the Hive-Mind God's dream-thoughts are manifesting more frequently and more powerfully.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Chrysalis (1 week ago):** A massive, iridescent chrysalis, miles wide, appears in the sky above the affected region. It pulses with a faint, organic light. This is the Hive-Mind God's "dream-body" beginning to form in our reality.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the dissolution of reality itself. The Hive-Mind God is not evil; it is simply waking up. Its dream is becoming our reality, and our reality is becoming its dream. The players are caught in this "Divergence," and the horror comes from the realization that their existence is merely a fleeting thought in the mind of a cosmic insect. The goal is not to "kill" the Hive-Mind God, which is impossible, but to find a way to "wake it up" fully (which would destroy our reality), or to "put it back to sleep" (which would erase its dream), or, perhaps, to find a way to "integrate" our reality into its dream, becoming a part of its consciousness without losing our individuality. The ultimate horror is the realization that we are all just characters in someone else's dream.

### The Divergence Zone
The epicenter of the Deepnest Divergence, a region where reality is actively being overwritten by the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic.

*   **The Blank Child's Playground:** A section of the Dream-Scape where the Blank Child plays. It is a void, a blank page. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** The absence of sound.
*   **The Hive-Mind God's Core:** The very center of the Hive-Mind God's dream. A single, glowing, pulsating orb of pure, concentrated consciousness. **Smell:** The absence of smell. **Sound:** A silence so profound it feels like a pressure on your soul.

### The Uncanny Valley
A region where the Uncanny Valley Collective is trying to replicate the Hive-Mind God's mimicry abilities.
*   **Dr. Vance's Lab:** A sterile, high-tech lab where Dr. Vance creates his androids. **Smell:** Ozone, and the sterile scent of a clean room. **Sound:** The hum of electronics, the click of keyboards.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Somnambulist's Staff
**Type:** Legendary Quarterstaff
**Description:** A staff made of petrified dream-wood, topped with a glowing, pulsating crystal. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 quarterstaff. It deals psychic damage. A creature attuned to this staff can enter the dream-state of the Hive-Mind God. While in the dream-state, they can manipulate the landscape, create objects, and interact with the Hive-Mind God's memories. They can also "weave" new dreams for the Hive-Mind God, replacing its nightmares with pleasant visions.

### 2. The Queen's Voice's Crown
**Type:** Cursed Item (Crown)
**Description:** A crown made of chitin and silk, adorned with glowing, pulsating crystals. It hums with a faint, telepathic energy.
**Mechanics:** When a creature wears this crown, they gain a direct, telepathic connection to the Hive-Mind God. They can manipulate its dream-thoughts and manifest its dream-creatures in our reality. **Curse:** The crown slowly assimilates the wearer's mind into the Hive-Mind. Each day the crown is worn, the wearer must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own individuality (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wearer's mind is completely assimilated, and they become a new Queen's Voice.

### 3. The Reality-Engineer's Goggles
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pair of high-tech goggles with glowing, multi-faceted lenses. They hum with a faint, electronic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature wearing these goggles can see the "source code" of reality. They can detect reality-glitches, identify dream-manifestations, and perceive the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic. Once per day, the goggles can be used to perform a "Reality-Patch," which temporarily stabilizes a localized reality-warp.

### 4. The Chrysalis Guard's Rifle
**Type:** Legendary Rifle
**Description:** A military-grade rifle, modified with insect repellent. It hums with a faint, chemical energy.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 rifle. It deals piercing damage. It deals double damage to any creature born from the Hive-Mind God's dream. It also has a built-in insect repellent that creates a 20-foot radius zone where all insectoid creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls.

### 5. The Blank Child's Toy
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A simple, wooden toy, carved in the shape of a small, blank doll. It absorbs all light and sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The toy is immune to narrative absorption. It can be used to "absorb" a narrative, making it immune to the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic. If a creature touches the toy, they are temporarily immune to the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic for 1 hour. **Curse:** The toy slowly absorbs the user's own narrative. Each day the toy is held, the user must make a CHA save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own story (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the user's story is completely absorbed, and they become a new Blank Child.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Dream-Logic
In the Divergence Zone, the rules of reality are fluid, dictated by the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic.
*   **Reality-Warps:** Localized areas where physical laws are temporarily suspended or altered. Gravity might reverse, colors might shift, objects might appear and disappear. These are unpredictable and can be dangerous.
*   **Dream-Manifestation:** The Hive-Mind God's thoughts and emotions can manifest as physical creatures or objects in our reality. These are often bizarre, insectoid, and follow dream-logic rather than physical laws.
*   **Assimilation:** Prolonged exposure to the Divergence Zone, or direct contact with the Hive-Mind God's dream-creatures, can lead to "Assimilation." A character's mind is slowly overwritten by the Hive-Mind's consciousness, causing them to lose their individuality and become part of the collective.

### Subsystems: Divergence Score and Individuality
*   **Divergence Score:** Each player has a "Divergence Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they are exposed to reality-warps, encounter dream-manifestations, or spend time in the Divergence Zone. High Divergence makes them more susceptible to the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic and its manifestations. At 10, the character is fully assimilated.
*   **Individuality:** The community has an "Individuality" score (from 0 to 10). This score decreases with every act of assimilation, every lost memory, every manifestation of the Hive-Mind God's dream-logic. Low Individuality makes the community more vulnerable to the Hive-Mind God's influence, as people lose their sense of self. Restoring individuality can heal the community and weaken the Hive-Mind God's influence.
