**Curse of the Jersey Devil**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the desolate Pine Barrens, locals whisper of the Leeds Devil—a winged demon born from a curse nearly 300 years ago. When Mother Leeds gave birth to her cursed thirteenth child, it transformed into a monster that has haunted the region ever since. The players are drawn into the mystery when a series of brutal attacks begins, and they discover that the Leeds family curse is spreading—any descendant of the family who bears a thirteenth child risks birthing a new devil. The players must uncover the origin of the curse, find the surviving Leeds descendants before it's too late, and confront the original Jersey Devil in its lair deep within the haunted pines.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the Leeds family in the Pine Barrens during the colonial era and their initial prosperity.
    *   Write the history of the pact made by Daniel Leeds with the devil lord Astaroth in exchange for wealth and power.
    *   Describe the night Mother Leeds gave birth to the thirteenth child and its transformation into the Jersey Devil.
    *   Explain how the curse works: the mechanism of inheritance and the conditions that trigger transformation.
    *   Detail the historical sightings and attacks attributed to the Jersey Devil over 300 years.
    *   Write about the formation of the Devil Worshippers cult and their twisted theology.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Leeds Family Descendants** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To survive and protect their families from the curse they may not even know about.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure. A scattered group of blood relatives, some aware of their heritage, others ignorant.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We're just ordinary people trying to live our lives.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Those who know about the curse are desperately trying to avoid having more children or are seeking ways to break it.
        *   **Assets:** Family records, inherited knowledge of the curse (for some), scattered across the region.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by the cult; protected by the players; distrustful of outsiders.
    *   **The Devil Worshippers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To venerate the Jersey Devil as a god and create more devils to usher in an age of wilderness and chaos.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Silas Mortimer, with inner circle members who have undergone dark rituals.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown. They appear as ordinary Pine Barrens residents.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To sacrifice Leeds descendants and manipulate the curse to create new devils. To transform Silas into a devil through the curse.
        *   **Assets:** Hidden sanctuary, knowledge of dark rituals, fanatical followers, spies throughout the Barrens.
        *   **Relationships:** Actively hunting Leeds descendants; opposing the players; worshipping the Jersey Devil from afar.
    *   **The Barrens Folk** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To survive in the harsh wilderness and avoid the devil's wrath.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure. Independent families and small communities.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We mind our business and respect the old ways. Don't go into the deep woods.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some make offerings to the devil to keep it away from their homes. Others know more about the curse than they admit.
        *   **Assets:** Survival skills, knowledge of the terrain, old folklore and protective rituals.
        *   **Relationships:** Wary of outsiders (including the players); may help if trust is earned; fearful of the cult.
    *   **The Church of St. Michael** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To protect the faithful and combat evil, including the Jersey Devil.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Reverend Josiah Crane, with a small congregation of believers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We stand against the darkness with faith and holy power.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Reverend Crane possesses one of the ritual components to break the curse but refuses to use it after it destroyed his family.
        *   **Assets:** Holy artifacts, knowledge of exorcism and blessing rituals, a fortified church.
        *   **Relationships:** Willing to help the players if they prove their good intentions; opposed to the cult; protective of Leeds descendants.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully protect Emma and slow the Curse Progression.
    *   **THEN:** Emma trusts the players and cooperates fully. The cult becomes more desperate and attempts a direct assault. The devil's attacks decrease as it waits for the birth.
    *   **IF:** The Curse Progression reaches 10 and Emma's child is born as a devil.
    *   **THEN:** A second Jersey Devil now exists. The original devil may react with joy (a companion) or rage (a rival). The cult attempts to capture the newborn devil. Emma is devastated.
    *   **IF:** The players gather all three ritual components.
    *   **THEN:** They can attempt the curse-breaking ritual at the Devil's Homestead. Reverend Crane may assist or sabotage based on their relationship. The ritual requires difficult skill checks and attracts both the devil and the cult.
    *   **IF:** The players kill the original Jersey Devil before breaking the curse.
    *   **THEN:** The curse is not broken; it simply awaits the next thirteenth child. The cult elevates the devil to martyrdom and becomes more fanatical.
    *   **IF:** The players expose the cult's sanctuary and defeat Silas.
    *   **THEN:** The cult scatters, but some members escape to continue their mission. Silas may reveal critical information about the curse in his final moments.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully perform the curse-breaking ritual.
    *   **THEN:** The original Jersey Devil either dies peacefully (finally released) or transforms back into its original human form (now 300 years old). All Leeds descendants are freed from the curse. The cult loses its purpose and dissolves.
