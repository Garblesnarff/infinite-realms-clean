# Campaign Bible: Belly of the Beast

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Primordial Hunger
In the beginning, there was only the **Primordial Hunger**, a colossal, living maw that consumed all of existence. It did not create the universe; it devoured it, meticulously grinding every star, every planet, every atom into a single, perfect **Cosmic Chyme**. The world is not a planet; it is a single, intricate morsel in a vast, cosmic digestive system, constantly churning, constantly dissolving according to the Hunger's grand design. The "Belly of the Beast" is not just a metaphor; it is a literal place, a living, breathing ecosystem within the Primordial Hunger, where the remnants of devoured worlds struggle to survive, constantly being broken down and re-formed. The conflict arises because the Primordial Hunger has grown bored, and its attention is drifting, causing its digestive processes to fray, and the cosmic chyme to unravel into chaos.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Bite):** The Primordial Hunger devours the universe, creating the Cosmic Chyme.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Age of Digestion):** The first sentient beings emerge, embodying archetypal roles: The Prey, The Predator, The Parasite, The Symbiote.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Grand Digestion):** The Belly of the Beast is formed, a living ecosystem within the Primordial Hunger, where remnants of devoured worlds struggle to survive.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Indigestion Plague):** The Primordial Hunger begins to fray, causing "indigestion" to appear in reality. Worlds crumble, civilizations collapse, and logic breaks down.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Master Predator Protocol):** The Belly of the Beast develops a universal "Master Predator" template, forcing certain individuals into archetypal roles to maintain digestive integrity.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Unreliable Digestion Incident):** A rogue Predator attempts to rewrite the Cosmic Chyme, causing history to become fluid and contradictory.
7.  **-500 Y (The Fourth Wall Breach):** A powerful Predator, frustrated with their role, wishes to "speak to the devourer." They briefly glimpse the fading Cosmic Chyme, driving them mad.
8.  **-100 Y (The Fading Morsels):** The Cosmic Chyme's designs grow weaker, causing prey to lose their motivation, predators to lose their drive, and reality to unravel into meaningless fragments.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Nutrient):** A vital nutrient, the **Essence of Sustenance**, is stolen from the Belly of the Beast, causing all conflicts to become endless.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new inhabitants of the Belly of the Beast, each with their own unique connection to survival. They are caught in a crisis as the Cosmic Chyme fades, and the world threatens to unravel into meaningless fragments.

### The "Why": The Meaning of Consumption
The central conflict is the struggle between **Consumption and Preservation**. The Primordial Hunger seeks to consume all of existence, reducing it to a single, undifferentiated mass. But the Belly of the Beast, in its diversity, represents the richness and complexity of existence. The inhabitants of the Belly of the Beast fight to preserve their existence, to remind the world of its purpose, and to prevent reality from unraveling into meaningless fragments. The party's struggle is not just to become Master Survivors, but to defend the very concept of individuality, to prove that diversity is strength, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by hunger.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Digestive Cohesion
*   **Cohesion Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the Cosmic Chyme. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Cohesion:** Following digestive tropes, resolving design points, making digestively satisfying choices.
*   **Losing Cohesion:** Breaking digestive tropes, creating indigestion, making illogical or unexpected choices.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Cohesion:* Reality is stable, predictable. GNEA agents are less active.
    *   *Low Cohesion:* Reality is unstable, unpredictable. Indigestion appears, Architectural Golems spawn.
    *   *0 Cohesion:* The Cosmic Chyme collapses, leading to a chaotic, nonsensical reality.

### Subsystem: Archetype Points
*   **Archetype Points:** Players earn Archetype Points by leaning into specific archetypes (e.g., "Prey," "Predator," "Parasite").
*   **Spending Points:** These points can be spent to gain temporary abilities associated with that archetype (e.g., a "Prey" can spend a point to gain advantage on a saving throw against being consumed).
*   **Breaking Archetype:** Players can choose to defy their archetype, but doing so costs Archetype Points and may lead to a loss of Digestive Cohesion.
