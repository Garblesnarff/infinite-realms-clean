## Campaign Overview

**Campaign Type / Genre:** Cosmic Horror / 1920s Mystery / Sanity-Testing Investigation
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **8-11**
**Tone (keywords):** 1920s Lovecraftian, sanity erosion, cosmic horror, forbidden knowledge, cultists, Great Old Ones, humanity's insignificance
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In 1928 Arkham, Massachusetts, the party—investigators including academics, journalists, private detectives, and occultists—investigates a series of disappearances that lead to a global conspiracy worshiping the Great Old Ones. Each discovery erodes their sanity as they uncover forbidden tomes like the Necronomicon, confront Deep Ones in Innsmouth, explore the Antarctic wastes, and face cultists preparing to awaken sleeping gods. The true horror: they are insignificant insects investigating forces that could unmake reality itself, and knowledge of the truth may drive them mad before they can prevent the apocalypse.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act descent into cosmic horror and madness.

*   **Act I — Whispers in Arkham (Sessions 1-6):** The party investigates disappearances around Miskatonic University, uncovering a cult worshiping something called Cthulhu. They explore haunted mansions, decode ancient texts, and witness their first impossible horror—something that shouldn't exist but does. Each revelation costs them sanity. They discover the cult is global, with cells in Innsmouth (a decaying fishing town), and connections to Antarctica. Professor Armitage of Miskatonic becomes their reluctant guide to the occult, warning that some knowledge destroys the mind.
*   **Act II — The Deep and the Dark (Sessions 7-13):** Following leads to Innsmouth, the party discovers the Deep Ones—amphibious fish-people who breed with humans as part of an ancient pact. They learn of Y'ha-nthlei, the underwater city where Cthulhu's servants wait. Government raids follow their investigation. They find references to an ancient civilization that contacted the Great Old Ones and was destroyed for it. An Antarctic expedition is planned to investigate ruins under the ice. The party must decide: pursue the truth and risk madness, or ignore what they've learned and let the cult proceed.
*   **Act III — At the Mountains of Madness (Sessions 14-20):** The party joins or leads an Antarctic expedition to ruins older than humanity. They discover the Old Ones—ancient alien beings who created Earth's life—and learn the terrible cosmology: humanity is an accident, gods are sleeping aliens, and reality is thin. The cult plans to complete a ritual in these ruins to awaken Cthulhu. The party races to stop them while their sanity crumbles from impossible geometries and cosmic revelations. Final choice: stop the ritual (potentially sacrificing themselves), flee and let it happen, or gain power by embracing the madness.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the insignificance of humanity in the cosmos, the price of forbidden knowledge, whether ignorance is mercy, and if heroism matters against incomprehensible forces. It asks: Is it better to know the terrible truth or live in blissful ignorance? Can humans matter in an uncaring cosmos? Will you sacrifice your sanity to save others? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect humanity against cosmic forces that don't even notice humanity exists.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity System**
*   Each character has Sanity points based on Wisdom
*   Witnessing horrors requires Sanity saves; failures lose points
*   Low sanity causes indefinite madness: phobias, paranoia, hallucinations
*   Zero sanity: permanent insanity, character becomes NPC
*   Can recover through rest but never fully heals from major shocks
*   Reading forbidden tomes costs sanity but grants knowledge

### 2. **Cosmic Knowledge**
*   Learning about Great Old Ones provides mechanical benefits but costs sanity
*   Knowledge grants bonuses against specific horrors (you understand them better)
*   But understanding the cosmic truth erodes will to live
*   Party must balance ignorance (weak but sane) vs. knowledge (powerful but mad)

### 3. **Fragile Mortality**
*   Characters are normal humans—professors, journalists, not warriors
*   Combat is dangerous and usually avoidable
*   Running away is often the smartest option
*   Focus on investigation, research, and stealth over fighting

### 4. **1920s Technology & Society**
*   Period-appropriate equipment: revolvers, flashlights, automobiles, telegraphs
*   Social restrictions: women's limited rights, racism exists, class matters
*   Historical accuracy adds immersion and challenges
*   No modern communication—information travels slowly

### 5. **Incomprehensible Horror**
*   Some enemies can't be fought, only survived or escaped
*   Great Old Ones are beyond combat—witnessing them is the danger
*   Non-Euclidean geometry: spaces that shouldn't fit, impossible angles
*   Colors and sounds that don't exist in normal spectrum

### 6. **Investigation Focus**
*   Clues found through research, interviews, surveillance, and deduction
*   Library research sessions to decode ancient texts
*   Wrong conclusions lead to danger
*   Multiple paths to truth but all cost sanity
*   Party collaboration crucial—sharing theories and evidence
