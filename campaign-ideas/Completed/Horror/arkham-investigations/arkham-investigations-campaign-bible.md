# Campaign Bible: Arkham Investigations

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Static
Before the universe was, there was only the **Cosmic Static**, an infinite, formless chaos of raw, unfiltered information. The Elder Gods were its first thoughts, vast and terrible, but also indifferent and unknowable. They tore great gashes in the Cosmic Static, creating the stars, the planets, and the very fabric of reality. These gashes, however, never truly healed. They festered, becoming the **Void-Wounds**, from which monstrous, formless entities now leak into existence. Arkham is not just a town; it is a thin spot in reality, a place where the veil between the mundane and the cosmic is dangerously thin, allowing the whispers of the Cosmic Static to seep into the minds of mortals, driving them to madness and revealing the terrifying truth of their insignificant existence.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Primordial Static):** The Elder Gods, in their chaotic birth, tear the Cosmic Static, creating the universe.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Void-Wound):** A tear in reality above the nascent world begins to leak formless horrors.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Age of Madness):** Lesser Elder Gods, the Great Old Ones, are born from the world's fear, acting as a buffer between mortals and their colossal parents.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Sleep):** The Elder Gods, exhausted by their creation, fall into a deep slumber, their dreams shaping the world's early myths.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Cosmic Static Echo):** A localized psychic ripple from a forgotten Elder God war causes all mountains to briefly sing in unison, driving 10% of the mortal population mad.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Sky-Shattering):** A sleeping Elder God rolls over, causing a meteor shower that lasts a century, reshaping continents and creating the "Crater-Lands."
7.  **-500 Y (The Whispering Peaks):** A new Void-Wound opens in the highest mountain range. Those who climb too high hear the whispers of cosmic horror.
8.  **-100 Y (The Elder God's Sigh):** An Elder God stirs in its sleep, causing a global earthquake that lasts a week, destroying ancient civilizations and revealing forgotten dungeons.
9.  **-10 Y (The First Awakening):** A minor Elder God, **Cthulhu the Restless**, begins to stir, its dreams manifesting as localized reality distortions and monstrous births.
10. **Present Day:** Arkham is plagued by strange disappearances, unsettling dreams, and a growing sense of dread. The party, a group of investigators, is drawn to the town, seeking to uncover the truth behind the unsettling events.

### The "Why": The World as a Dream
The central conflict is the struggle between **Sanity and Cosmic Horror**. Arkham is a town where the veil between the mundane and the cosmic is dangerously thin, allowing the whispers of the Cosmic Static to seep into the minds of mortals, driving them to madness and revealing the terrifying truth of their insignificant existence. The Elder Gods are waking up, and they see the world as their dream, a vast sandbox filled with interesting toys (mortals). They are not malicious, but utterly indifferent to the lives they crush underfoot. The party's struggle is to maintain their sanity in the face of such overwhelming, indifferent power, to uncover the truth behind the unsettling events, and to prevent the Elder Gods from consuming all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of cosmic remembrance.
