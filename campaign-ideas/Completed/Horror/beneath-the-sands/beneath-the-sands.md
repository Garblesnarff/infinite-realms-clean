## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-8 sessions)

A tense survival horror about adaptation and desperation.

*   **Act I — The First Attack (Sessions 1–2):** The party arrives in Dusthaven to investigate reports of missing miners. They witness the first attack as a Sandwyrm—a 30-foot, serpentine predator with rows of teeth—bursts from the ground and kills several townsfolk. They learn the creatures hunt by vibration and that staying off the ground is the only safety. The town is cut off from help.
*   **Act II — The Siege (Sessions 3–5):** The party must organize the survivors and fortify the town's few multi-story buildings. They scavenge for resources, ration food and water, and deal with the social breakdown as fear sets in. They discover that the Sandwyrms are evolving—some develop legs and can climb, others develop ranged attacks by spitting acid. The party must adapt their tactics.
*   **Act III — The Nest (Sessions 6–8):** The party realizes the Sandwyrms are protecting something: a massive nest in the collapsed mine where the creatures first emerged. They must mount a desperate expedition into the tunnels to destroy the nest and its Alpha Wyrm before the town is completely overrun. The final battle is underground, in the dark, surrounded by dozens of the creatures.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Tremors Begin"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Attack
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in Dusthaven, hired to investigate why the mining operation has gone silent. The town is small (population ~200), dusty, and on edge.
    *   They meet key NPCs: Sheriff Kord (pragmatic and tough), Doc Mira (the town's healer), and Old Val (a prospector who swears he saw "something massive" in the desert).
    *   During their initial investigation, a tremor shakes the town. A Sandwyrm erupts from the main street, killing a horse and dragging a miner underground in seconds. The party barely survives the encounter.
**Escalation:** Old Val realizes the creatures hunt by vibration. "Stay off the ground, or you're dead!"

### Sessions 2-3 — "Off the Ground"
*   **Focus:** Survival / Base-Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party organizes survivors to barricade themselves in the town's few tall buildings: the Sheriff's Office, the General Store, and the Water Tower. They use wooden planks and ropes to create elevated walkways.
    *   They must scavenge for supplies while avoiding the Sandwyrms. This becomes a tense stealth mission—move silently, avoid vibrations, watch for telltale sand ripples.
    *   The party discovers a pattern: the Sandwyrms retreat underground at night (when the desert cools) but are most active during the day's heat.
    *   Social tension rises: a merchant, Gregor, hoards food. A panicked mother, Elara, demands the party take her child to safety (impossible with Sandwyrms everywhere).
**Escalation:** A second attack reveals that one Sandwyrm has sprouted crude legs and can now climb onto the first floor of buildings. The creatures are evolving.

### Sessions 4-5 — "They're Learning"
*   **Focus:** Adaptation / Escalation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party realizes the Sandwyrms are not mindless—they're adapting to the party's tactics. A new variant, the Spitter, launches globs of acidic bile from underground.
    *   Resources are running low. The party must choose between risky scavenging runs or rationing what they have. Tempers flare. Gregor tries to flee with supplies and is devoured.
    *   Old Val reveals he knows where the creatures came from: the Deepshaft Mine. "We dug too deep. We broke into their nest." He has a map of the tunnels.
    *   The party must decide: stay and hope for rescue (unlikely), or mount an offensive into the mine to destroy the nest.
**Escalation:** A massive tremor shakes the town. Sheriff Kord reports: "There's something bigger down there. The mother, maybe. If we don't kill it, we're all dead."

### Sessions 6-7 — "Into the Dark"
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party descends into the Deepshaft Mine, armed with explosives, silence spells, and desperation. The tunnels are narrow, dark, and unstable.
    *   They encounter juvenile Sandwyrms, swarms of burrowing grubs, and evidence of the miners' final moments—bloodstains, claw marks, half-eaten corpses.
    *   They discover the nest: a massive chamber filled with eggs and tended by the Alpha Wyrm, a colossal, 60-foot creature with armored plating and multiple rows of teeth.
    *   The party must plant explosives without alerting the Alpha, then escape during the detonation. If they fight the Alpha directly, it's a grueling battle in the dark.
**Escalation:** The explosives are triggered, but the Alpha survives and pursues the party through the collapsing tunnels.

### Session 8 — "Collapse"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Escape
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party races through the collapsing mine, pursued by the wounded Alpha Wyrm. They must make split-second decisions: save Doc Mira (who was injured), seal tunnels behind them to slow the Alpha, or press forward.
    *   The final confrontation occurs at the mine entrance, in broad daylight. The Alpha emerges, enraged and dying, for one last attack.
    *   The party can finish it with a final, desperate strike—or lure it into a pre-prepared trap (explosives, pit, collapsing tower).
**Resolution:** The Alpha falls. The nest is destroyed. The surviving Sandwyrms retreat into the deep desert. Dusthaven is saved, but at great cost. The party is hailed as heroes by the 50-100 survivors.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Sheriff Kord Ironhand** — *The Pragmatic Leader*
    *   **Role:** Dusthaven's sheriff, a grizzled dwarf who keeps order and organizes the defense.
    *   **Personality:** Tough, pragmatic, and willing to make hard choices (like abandoning the injured to save the group). Dry sense of humor.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Kord was one of the miners who broke into the nest. He blames himself for the disaster but hides his guilt under stoicism.

2.  **Doc Mira Sunstone** — *The Heart*
    *   **Role:** The town's healer, an elven cleric who tends to the wounded and tries to keep morale up.
    *   **Personality:** Compassionate, optimistic, and refuses to give up on anyone. She is the moral center of the survivors.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Mira has a degenerative illness (kept secret) and knows she may not survive long-term. She's determined to save others before she goes.

3.  **Old Val** — *The Expert*
    *   **Role:** A grizzled, elderly prospector who knows the desert and the mines better than anyone.
    *   **Personality:** Cantankerous, paranoid, but ultimately brave. He's seen horrors in the deep places and thought he was rid of them.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Val once dynamited a mine entrance to seal something in—he suspects he didn't kill it, only delayed it.

4.  **Gregor the Merchant** — *The Coward*
    *   **Role:** The owner of the General Store, now hoarding supplies.
    *   **Personality:** Selfish, panicked, and willing to betray others to save himself. He represents the worst of humanity under pressure.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Gregor has a hidden escape route he's been preparing. He will try to use it and abandon the town—but the Sandwyrms find him first.

5.  **The Alpha Wyrm** — *The Mother*
    *   **Role:** The enormous, intelligent matriarch of the Sandwyrms. She is the final boss.
    *   **Personality:** Not evil, but a protective mother. She attacks because the miners threatened her nest.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Alpha is ancient, possibly the last of her kind. If the party discovers this, they may feel guilt for killing her—but survival demanded it.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival, adaptation, and the consequences of exploitation (the miners disturbed the Sandwyrms' nest). The central conflict is not just defeating the monsters, but maintaining humanity and cooperation under siege. The party must balance immediate survival with long-term strategy, all while the monsters evolve to counter their tactics.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Vibration-Based Detection**
*   Sandwyrms hunt by sensing vibrations. Any creature moving on the ground must make a **Stealth check (DC 12)** to move slowly and quietly. Running, combat, or loud actions automatically alert nearby Sandwyrms.
*   Players off the ground (on buildings, walkways, or flying) are safe unless a Sandwyrm has evolved climbing abilities.
*   **Tactical Tip:** Players can create diversions by throwing heavy objects or using *Thaumaturgy* to create vibrations elsewhere.

### 2. **Evolution Tracker**
*   The Sandwyrms evolve over time. The DM tracks an **Evolution Counter** that increases each day or after significant events (e.g., the party kills multiple Sandwyrms).
*   Evolution Stages:
    *   **Stage 1 (Day 1-2):** Basic Sandwyrms—serpentine, 30 feet, bite attacks.
    *   **Stage 2 (Day 3-4):** Climber Variant—develops crude legs, can climb onto first-floor structures.
    *   **Stage 3 (Day 5-6):** Spitter Variant—launches acid bile from range (30 feet).
    *   **Stage 4 (Day 7+):** Armored Variant—thicker hide, resistant to piercing/slashing damage.
*   This mechanic ensures the party cannot simply "turtle" indefinitely—the threat escalates.

### 3. **Resource Management**
*   The party has limited supplies: food, water, ammunition, and materials for repairs.
*   Each day, the party must allocate resources:
    *   **Feed the Survivors:** 1 unit of food per 10 people. Failure lowers morale.
    *   **Repair Defenses:** Requires materials. Neglecting this means Sandwyrms break through easier.
    *   **Medical Supplies:** Required to heal injured NPCs or PCs.
*   Scavenging runs are dangerous but necessary. The party must weigh risk vs. reward.

### 4. **Morale System**
*   Survivors have a **Morale Score** (starts at 10, ranges from 0-20).
*   High morale means NPCs cooperate, fight bravely, and trust the party. Low morale leads to panic, hoarding, and potential mutiny.
*   Morale is affected by:
    *   Deaths: -2
    *   Successful defense: +1
    *   Running out of food: -3
    *   Party speeches/inspiration (Persuasion DC 15): +1d4
*   If Morale drops below 5, NPCs may turn on each other or the party.
