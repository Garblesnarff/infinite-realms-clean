# Descent into Yomi: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
Yomi is not a place. It is a state of being, a "cosmic regret" that exists in the collective unconscious of humanity. It is the sum total of all unfulfilled promises, all unspoken apologies, all forgotten duties. The "dead" are not dead; they are merely trapped in this state of cosmic regret, endlessly replaying their failures. The "Descent into Yomi" is not a physical journey, but a psychic one, a journey into the depths of one's own and humanity's collective unconscious. The "monsters" are not demons; they are manifestations of these unfulfilled promises and forgotten duties, twisted into horrifying forms. The "curse" is not on the dead, but on the living, who are slowly being pulled into Yomi by the weight of their own unfulfilled obligations. The original myth of Izanagi and Izanami was not a journey to a physical underworld, but a desperate attempt to retrieve a loved one from the clutches of this cosmic regret, a journey that ultimately failed, leaving a permanent scar on the collective unconscious.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Promise (The Dawn of Humanity):** The first human makes a promise. The concept of "obligation" is born.
2.  **The First Unfulfilled (Ancient History):** The first human breaks a promise. The first "Echo of Regret" is born, a faint whisper in the collective unconscious.
3.  **The Myth of Izanagi and Izanami (c. -5,000 years):** Izanagi attempts to retrieve Izanami from Yomi. His failure, and his subsequent breaking of a promise, creates a massive, permanent scar on the collective unconscious, solidifying Yomi as a powerful force.
4.  **The Age of Obligation (c. -3,000 to -500 years):** Societies are built on complex webs of promises and duties. Yomi is a distant, theoretical threat.
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Words Died (c. -500 years):** For 24 hours, all words related to "promise," "duty," and "apology" vanish from human language. The resulting chaos and broken trust cause a massive surge in Yomi's power.
6.  **The Great Forgetting (c. -200 years):** The rise of modern society, with its emphasis on individualism and fleeting connections, leads to a widespread "forgetting" of duties and obligations. Yomi begins to grow, its influence spreading.
7.  **The First Manifestation (c. -50 years):** The first "Oni of Unfulfilled Promise" appears, a physical manifestation of a broken vow. It is a terrifying, but localized, event.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Lie (c. -10 years):** A single, powerful lie told by a community leader echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original lie.
9.  **The Descent Begins (Present Day):** The weight of unfulfilled obligations has reached critical mass. The veil between the living world and Yomi is thinning. People are experiencing vivid, terrifying nightmares, and the "Oni of Regret" are manifesting more frequently and more powerfully.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Mirror (1 week ago):** All reflective surfaces in the affected region begin to show not your reflection, but the reflection of the person you *should* have been, had you fulfilled all your promises. The horror of self-deception becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the weight of unfulfilled obligations. The players are not just fighting for their lives; they are fighting for their souls, and the souls of humanity. The horror comes from the realization that the monsters they are fighting are born from their own failures, their own regrets. The goal is not to "kill" the monsters, which is impossible, but to fulfill the promises, to speak the apologies, to remember the duties, and to find a way to "redeem" the collective unconscious of humanity before it is completely consumed by Yomi. The ultimate horror is the realization that Yomi is not a place you go to when you die; it is a place you are already in, if you have lived a life of unfulfilled obligations.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Mirror of Unfulfilled Promises
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A hand mirror with a frame of gnarled, petrified wood. It reflects not your image, but the face of the person you *should* have been, had you fulfilled all your promises.
**Mechanics:** When a creature looks into the mirror, it sees the face of the person they should have been. This causes 1d6 psychic damage per unfulfilled promise it is holding. If a creature fulfills a promise to the mirror, the mirror absorbs the promise, and the creature is cleansed of its regret. The mirror can then project the absorbed promise as a powerful, psychic attack.

### 2. The Scroll of Forgotten Duties
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A scroll made of ancient, faded paper. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature holding the scroll can feel the "psychic pulse" of Yomi. They can sense the location of any major unfulfilled obligation (e.g., a place of great guilt, a strong manifestation of an Oni of Regret). Once per day, the scroll can be used to perform a "Duty-Recall" ritual, which temporarily calms the psychic miasma in a 1-mile radius, making the Oni's manifestations less frequent and less aggressive.

### 3. The Bell of Apology
**Type:** Cursed Item
**Description:** A small, brass bell, covered in ancient, faded carvings. It rings with a clear, pure tone that seems to compel honesty.
**Mechanics:** When the bell is rung, all creatures within 30 feet must make a WIS save. On a failure, they are compelled to speak their deepest, darkest apology. The bell can also be used to "absorb" an apology, cleansing the apologizer of their guilt, but the bell then becomes heavier with the weight of the absorbed regret.

### 4. The Threads of Fate
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A spool of shimmering, iridescent thread. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature holding the threads can see the threads of fate. They can subtly manipulate them, re-weaving broken promises into new, binding obligations. Once per day, the threads can be used to perform a "Fate-Weaving" ritual, which temporarily alters the threads of fate in a 1-mile radius, making the Oni's manifestations less frequent and less aggressive.

### 5. The Yomi Gate (Orb)
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A single, glowing, pulsating orb of pure, concentrated regret. It is the heart of Yomi.
**Mechanics:** The orb cannot be destroyed. If a creature touches it, they are flooded with the "First Promise" that was broken. They must make a high DC Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 minute and take 10d10 psychic damage. If the orb is "redeemed" (by a powerful act of fulfillment or apology), Yomi will be healed, and the world will be transformed into a paradise. If it is "destroyed" (by an act of ultimate forgetting), the world will be destroyed.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative Debt
Every unfulfilled promise, unspoken apology, and forgotten duty creates a "narrative debt" that must be paid.
*   **Yomi-Corruption:** The weight of unfulfilled obligations creates "Yomi-Corruption." This manifests as a psychic miasma that slowly pulls the living into Yomi. Prolonged exposure to Yomi-Corruption can lead to physical and mental decay, and eventually, assimilation into Yomi.
*   **Redemption:** The only way to "pay off" narrative debt is through acts of redemption: fulfilling promises, speaking apologies, remembering duties. These acts create "narrative credit" that can counteract Yomi-Corruption.
*   **The Threads of Fate:** The universe is woven from threads of fate. Each promise, each duty, each apology is a thread. Broken promises create frayed threads, which weaken the fabric of reality. The Promise-Weavers can re-weave these threads, but their methods are dangerous.

### Subsystems: Obligation Score and Sanity
*   **Obligation Score:** Each player has an "Obligation Score" (from 0 to 10). This score increases when they break promises, leave apologies unspoken, or forget duties. High Obligation makes them more susceptible to Yomi's influence and its manifestations. At 10, the character is fully assimilated into Yomi. Fulfilling obligations can reduce their Obligation Score.
*   **Sanity:** The constant exposure to the psychic miasma of Yomi can take a toll on a character's sanity. Players have a Sanity score. When they encounter a powerful manifestation of an Oni of Regret, or witness a major reality warp, they must make a Sanity check. Failure results in temporary or permanent madness, reflecting the psychological horror of the campaign.
