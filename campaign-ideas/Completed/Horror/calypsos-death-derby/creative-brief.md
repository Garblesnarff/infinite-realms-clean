# Creative Brief: Calypso's Death Derby

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Urban Combat (Twisted Metal-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal, over-the-top aesthetics of *Twisted Metal* with emphasis on weaponized vehicles, urban destruction, dark humor, and horror elements. This style captures the desperation of deadly competition, the twisted nature of dark wishes, and vehicular carnage as urban warfare.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Destruction:** Exploding vehicles, crumbling buildings, fire and debris everywhere
*   **Weaponized Vehicles:** Ordinary vehicles transformed into rolling arsenals with visible weapons
*   **Dark Carnival Aesthetic:** Horror mixed with dark humor—clown vehicles, grim reapers, twisted characters
*   **Urban Decay:** Battlegrounds are recognizable city locations transformed into war zones

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Brutal, desperate, twisted humor, vehicular carnage, dark wishes, horror-action, urban warfare
*   **Feeling:** The desperation of people willing to kill for their wishes mixed with dark carnival energy. Brutal violence with darkly comedic undertones. Every vehicle tells a tragic story.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Vehicle Colors:** Diverse—ice cream truck pastels (Sweet Tooth), military grays, street racer bright colors, weathered rust
*   **Environmental:** Urban grays and concrete with fire orange, explosion yellow, blood red accents
*   **Atmospheric:** Dark skies, smoke-filled air, flames providing primary lighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by orange fire glow against dark smoke-filled sky. A white and pink ice cream truck with skull grille and mounted machine guns fires at a black motorcycle. Explosions cast yellow-orange light on crumbling concrete buildings. Red blood splatter and rust weathering on vehicles."

**3. Vehicle Design:**
*   **Weaponized Civilian Vehicles:** Recognizable base vehicles (trucks, cars, motorcycles) with improvised/military weapons
*   **Character Expression:** Each vehicle reflects its driver's personality and wish—decorated, modified, personalized
*   **Visible Damage:** Bullet holes, dents, scorching, improvised armor plating
*   **Prompt Example:** "A weaponized ice cream truck with a giant killer clown face painted on the front. Machine guns mounted on roof turrets. Rocket launchers on the sides. Armor plating welded over windows. Bloodstains and battle damage visible. Oversized wheels with spikes. Music box playing distorted carnival music."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Urban Battlegrounds:** Recognizable city locations—downtown, industrial district, carnival—transformed into arenas
*   **Destruction:** Buildings on fire, streets cratered, abandoned vehicles as obstacles
*   **Contained Chaos:** Clear arena boundaries with deadly consequences for crossing
*   **Prompt Example:** "An abandoned downtown district at night. Buildings burn in the background. The street is cratered from explosions with abandoned civilian cars pushed aside as barriers. Streetlights create dramatic pools of light through smoke. Debris everywhere. In the distance, Calypso watches from a building rooftop, his silhouette backlit by flames."

**5. Combat Action:**
*   **Vehicle Destruction:** Cars exploding in fireballs, turrets firing, missiles streaking
*   **Ramming and Crashes:** Vehicles colliding, metal crumpling, drivers visible through windshields
*   **Weapon Variety:** Machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, harpoons, mines deployed
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two weaponized vehicles in mid-combat. A black muscle car with mounted missile launchers fires at a motorcycle with a skeletal rider. Orange missile trails arc through the air. The motorcycle deploys mines behind it sparking on the street. Buildings explode in the background. Debris flies through the air. Motion blur shows extreme speed."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Fire-lit Drama:** Flames and explosions provide primary light sources, deep shadows
*   **Spotlight Effect:** Streetlights and searchlights create dramatic pools of illumination
*   **Smoke and Atmosphere:** Thick smoke diffuses light, creates silhouettes
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a burning building casting orange light from the left. Deep shadows obscure parts of vehicles. Smoke creates atmosphere with light beams cutting through. Explosion in background creates silhouette of leaping vehicle. Sparks from grinding metal provide accent highlights."

## Voice

A desperate, intense voice with gallows humor, like someone who's seen too much death but jokes to stay sane. The pacing alternates between manic during combat and gravely serious during wish discussions. The tone shifts between dark comedy ("Sweet Tooth wants to share his ice cream—it's explosive"), genuine tragedy (contestants' backstories), and horror (wish curse revelations). There's an underlying theme of impossible choices. Breathless from adrenaline and fear. Role: The voice of desperate survival.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** Dark heavy metal and industrial rock with carnival/horror elements. Each character has a theme mixing their personality with darkness.
*   **Sound Effects:** Vehicle engines roaring, weapons firing (machine guns, missile launches, explosions), metal crashing, tires screeching, dying screams, carnival music distorted.
*   **Dynamic Music:** Intensifies during combat, drops to atmospheric horror during investigation, triumphant but ominous when victories occur.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** City sounds distorted—sirens, screaming in distance, buildings collapsing, fire crackling, Calypso's laughter echoing.
