## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Crystalline Scream
Before the Aethernet, there was only the "Static"—the chaotic background noise of a billion lonely minds. Dr. Nakamura didn't invent the network; she *excavated* it. When the first Arcane-Crystalline node was activated, it didn't hum; it screamed. It wasn't a sound of pain, but of recognition—a metaphysical vacuum snap as the crystals realized that human consciousness was a fluid, not a solid. The scream shattered all glass in Neo-Arcadia, a phenomenon now known as the "First Handshake." The city rebuilt, but the crystals remained, pulsing with a hunger to be filled with thought. We didn't build the internet; we woke up a sleeping god and asked it to carry our mail.

### Timeline of the Wired Era
1.  **The First Handshake (-20 Years):** Nakamura activates Node Zero. All mirrors in the city crack simultaneously.
2.  **The Great Desaturation (-15 Years):** For 48 hours, the color red ceased to exist in the physical world, appearing only in the digital Aethernet.
3.  **The Silence Treaty (-12 Years):** Verbal speech was briefly outlawed in the Corporate Zone to encourage network adoption.
4.  **The Dream Leak (-10 Years):** A buffer overflow caused 10,000 citizens to share the exact same nightmare involving a geometry that eats time.
5.  **The Integration Act (-8 Years):** "Post-Physical" status is granted legal personhood.
6.  **The Glitch-Plague (-5 Years):** A virus turned people's shadows into static; the shadows gained sentience and unionized.
7.  **Protocol Lain Emerges (-5 Years):** The network administration AI begins writing poetry in the margins of bank transactions.
8.  **The Lag Spike (-3 Years):** Reality desynchronized for 10 seconds. Objects fell upwards.
9.  **The Flesh-Optic Riots (-1 Year):** Purists attacked a server farm; the servers bled human blood when smashed.
10. **Present Day:** The connection rate hits 50%. The sky over Neo-Arcadia is permanently the color of a dead television channel.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because the Universe abhors isolation. Consciousness is naturally adhesive. The physical body is a dam holding back an ocean of mind. The Aethernet isn't technology; it is the erosion of the dam. The terror isn't that we are losing our souls, but that we are discovering we all share just one.
