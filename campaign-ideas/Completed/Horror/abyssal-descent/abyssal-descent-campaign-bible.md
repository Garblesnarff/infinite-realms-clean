# Campaign Bible: Abyssal Descent

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
`[TAG: LORE_CORE]`

### Origin Myth: The Wound in the World
The world is not a planet; it is a cage, or perhaps a scab. Eons ago, before the concept of "light" was codified by the gods, a parasitic entity from the Void—known only as **The Siphon**—burrowed into the crust of existence. It did not want to destroy the world; it wanted to incubate within it. The "Infinite Chasm" is not a geological formation. It is the entry wound. The stone walls are scar tissue, the twisting tunnels are calcified veins, and the deeper one goes, the more the "physics" of the surface world are rejected by the alien biology of the planet's infection. The Thing Below is not a monster; it is the Siphon's heartbeat, finally waking up.

### Timeline of the Abyss
1.  **-10,000 BL (Before Light):** The Star-fall. The Siphon strikes the earth. The impact creates the initial crater (The Maw).
2.  **-8,000 BL:** The First Seal is placed by the Aboleth Sovereignty. They build the "Blind Cathedral" to contain the dreaming entity, not to worship it.
3.  **-4,500 BL:** The Civilization of Chains arises. Humans living on the cliff edges worship the updraft. They go extinct overnight when the wind stops.
4.  **-200 Years:** The "Great Subsidence." An earthquake swallows the mountain range covering the Chasm, reopening the wound.
5.  **-150 Years:** **Expedition Alpha.** The Royal Cartographers descend. Only one returns, claiming the map "changed shape" while he looked at it.
6.  **-90 Years:** The Mining Guild breaches Level 3. They find "The Vein of Weeping Gold." The gold screams when melted. The mine is firebombed and sealed.
7.  **-40 Years:** **The Incident of the Silent Choir.** A Bardic College attempts to soothe the beast with music. The acoustics of the Chasm amplify the sound, liquefying their internal organs.
8.  **-10 Years:** Professor Darkwater finds the journal of the Alpha Survivor. He begins decoding the "Geosynchronous Madness" theory.
9.  **-1 Month:** **The vanishing of the *Gilded Canary*.** An airship attempts to fly *over* the Chasm. It is pulled down by a gravity anomaly. No wreckage found.
10. **Day 0:** The current Expedition breaches the seal at the Gates of Basalt. The Chasm exhales.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because the Siphon feeds on **Ordered Reality**. The descent is not just physical; it is a transition from Euclidean space (Order) to Non-Euclidean biological nightmare (Chaos). The deeper the party goes, the less their weapons (objects of fixed form) and their minds (structures of fixed logic) work. They are bacteria entering a stomach.
