# Creative Brief: Abyssal Descent

## Art Style: Cosmic Horror meets Cave Survival

Inspired by The Descent (2005), Dead Space, The Thing, At the Mountains of Madness, and brutal survival horror. Emphasizes absolute darkness, claustrophobia, impossible geometry, and sanity-breaking revelations.

### Visual Principles:

* **Darkness Dominates**: Most scenes are almost entirely black with tiny points of light.
* **Impossible Geometry**: Angles that hurt to look at, spaces that shouldn't exist.
* **Body Horror**: What the darkness does to people—physical and mental deterioration.
* **Minimal Color**: Black, grays, blood-red, and sickly bio-luminescence.

### Color Palette:
Almost monochromatic—blacks and dark grays. Light sources are warm but dying (fading orange torch light). Horror elements glow with sickly green or impossible colors that don't have names.

### Character Design:
Progressive deterioration. Start: clean, well-equipped, hopeful. End: filthy, broken equipment, thousand-yard stares, physical and mental damage visible. Creatures are glimpsed partially—never fully seen, always wrong.

## Music Direction:
Minimal. Long silences broken by sounds that shouldn't exist. Heartbeat percussion. Breathing getting ragged. Dripping water. Distant screams. When music appears, it's discordant strings and reality-bending audio that makes listeners uncomfortable.

## Voice Acting:
Progressive breakdown—start confident, end broken. Whispers in darkness. Characters' voices changing as madness takes hold. The Thing Below doesn't speak in words but in sounds that suggest meaning while breaking minds.
