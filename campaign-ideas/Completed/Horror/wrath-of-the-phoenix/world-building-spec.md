**Key Factions:**
- **Sinegard Academy Students:** Elite military trainees learning strategy, martial arts, and forbidden shamanism.
- **The Nikara Empire:** Fantasy China, imperial power with shamanic traditions sealed but not forgotten.
- **The Federation of Mugen:** Invaders committing systematic genocide, industrial military horror.
- **The Shamans (Trifecta and others):** Those who call upon the Pantheon, power at cost of sanity.
- **The Pantheon:** Mad gods (Phoenix-fire, Dragon-water, Tortoise-earth, etc.) who grant power but consume humanity.
