# Campaign Bible: Wrath of the Phoenix

## [TAG: LORE_CORE] Deep Lore & History

### Origin Myth: The fractured Celestial
In the beginning, there was only the Celestial Emperor, a being of pure conceptual light. To understand mortality, he consumed the Void, but the Void was indigestible. He vomited it back out, fracturing his own psyche into twelve shards—the Pantheon. These shards fell to the material plane, embedding themselves in the geography of the Nikara Empire. They are not benevolent deities; they are starving, specific madnesses (Rage, Greed, Sorrow) that require a biological host to experience the world. The Empire was built not to worship them, but to keep them sedated under the crust of the earth using the "Great Sealing" of the first Red Emperor.

### Timeline of the Nikara Empire
1.  **Year 1:** The Red Emperor binds the Twelve Gods into the tectonic plates of the continent using the blood of his entire cabinet.
2.  **Year 300:** The "Silence of Birds." For one year, no birds sang in Nikara. They only mimicked the sound of sharpening blades.
3.  **Year 450:** The First Poppy War. Federation ships arrive. They do not fire cannons; they fire canisters of weaponized nightmares that cause mass sleep-paralysis.
4.  **Year 452:** The Speer Genocide. The Federation wipes out the island of Speer. The sea boils for three months due to the thermal output of dying Fire Shamans.
5.  **Year 480:** **The Year of Weeping Iron.** All iron mined in the Southern Provinces begins to bleed when forged. Blacksmiths go mad; weapons are deemed cursed but highly effective.
6.  **Year 500:** The Empress Su Daji ascends. She does not age. Rumors say she eats the dreams of her handmaidens to sustain her youth.
7.  **Year 515:** The "Bureau of Clouds" is disbanded after they accidentally summoned a rainstorm of boiling vinegar over the capital.
8.  **Year 520:** The Federation develops "Gas-Mask Theology," believing that breathing unfiltered air allows sins to enter the body.
9.  **Year 535:** The Sinegard Academy begins accepting "low-born" students to increase the fodder for the meat-grinder of the border wars.
10. **Current Year:** The Federation Navy is spotted off the coast. The water turns purple—the color of bruised sky.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because the Seal is failing. The Gods are waking up because the Federation's industrial warfare (mass death) generates a specific frequency of psychic agony that acts as caffeine to the sleeping deities. The Federation invades because their own island is sinking, eaten by a Sea God they failed to control.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM] Mechanics & Systems

### 1. The Sanity/Addiction Spiral
*   **The Mechanic:** Players have a **Lucidity Die** (starts at d20).
*   **Trigger:** Whenever they use Shamanic Magic or witness an Atrocity.
*   **Roll:** Roll the current Lucidity Die. On a 1 or 2, the die size degrades (d20 -> d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4).
*   **Effect:** At d6, the player gains a permanent madness quirk. At d4, the God takes over the PC as an NPC temporarily.
*   **Recovery:** Smoking Opium resets the die to d20 but adds a level of **Addiction**.
*   **Addiction:** -1 to all physical stats per level of addiction if not smoking daily.

### 2. Physics of War
*   **The Red Haze:** In zones of mass death, gravity is lighter (souls lifting the air). Jump distance is doubled, but fall damage is lethal (spirits drag you down).

### 3. Reputation
*   **Scale:** Hero <-> Monster.
*   Actions move the needle. Killing civilians shifts to Monster. Saving them shifts to Hero.
*   *Effect:* Monsters get bonus intimidation but cannot heal at temples. Heroes get discounts but become primary targets for assassins.
