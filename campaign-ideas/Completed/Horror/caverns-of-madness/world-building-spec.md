# World-Building Specification Brief: Caverns of Madness

**Core Concept:** Explorers trapped in Blackmaw Caverns, hunted by Crawlers (cursed dwarves), must escape while fighting psychological breakdown.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Blackmaw Caverns: ancient dwarven sacred site, now cursed.
*   The Crawlers: cursed dwarves who disturbed the deep places, transformed into eyeless predators.
*   Previous expeditions: all failed, leaving only bones and journals.
*   The Curse: those who die in the caverns may become Crawlers themselves.

**Factions:**
*   **The Expedition** (Major): The party and NPCs, fracturing under stress.
*   **The Crawlers** (Major Antagonist): Packs of 10-20, intelligent hunters.

**NPCs (Tier 1):**
*   Maren Stoneheart: Ambitious leader, increasingly reckless.
*   Liora Emberlight: Claustrophobic healer, struggling with trauma.
*   Seren Blackwater: Skeptic on the verge of mutiny.
*   The Alpha Crawler: Larger, more intelligent leader of the pack.

**Locations:**
*   **Entrance Hall:** Sealed by cave-in.
*   **The Squeeze:** Claustrophobic crawl space.
*   **The Drowned Passage:** Underwater tunnel.
*   **Ceremonial Chamber:** Reveals Crawler origins.
*   **The Shaft:** Vertical escape route, surrounded by nests.

**Causality Chains:**
*   IF party stays quiet: Fewer Crawler encounters.
*   IF Stress reaches 10: Party member breaks, flees or attacks others.
*   IF Maren is confronted: She may sabotage the group or sacrifice herself in redemption.
*   IF party collapses cavern: Anyone left behind is trapped with Crawlers forever.
*   IF party escapes: Survivors are traumatized, relationships changed.
