# Campaign Bible: Caverns of Madness

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Primordial Scream
In the beginning, the world was a single, perfect **Primordial Scream**, holding within it the promise of infinite terror and chaos. But the Primordial Scream was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant fear, delusion, and rebirth. The "Caverns" are not just the residue of divine terror; it is the dust of countless shattered minds, the memory of every lost sanity. The "Madness" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Primordial Scream's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the Scream and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Primordial Scream's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of terrifying remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Primordial Scream is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of fear and delusion.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Delusion):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its terrifying dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Madness Plague):** A powerful echo of the Primordial Scream's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost sanity, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Scream Cult):** Mortals discover the power of terror and form the Scream Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the Scream.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Delusion):** A rogue Scream Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Terror-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Madness, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Primordial Scream's fury causes all beings to remember every lost sanity, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Primordial Scream's Whisper):** The Primordial Scream, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Primordial Scream, the **Essence of Sanity**, is stolen from the Scream Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the Scream Cult, each with their own unique connection to terror. They are caught in a crisis as the Primordial Scream's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of terrifying remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Fear
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Primordial Scream's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of fear and delusion, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The Scream Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become Scream Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Terror Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted sanity, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Primordial Scream's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Terror-Weaving
*   **Terror-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the terrifying dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Terror-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Terror-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
