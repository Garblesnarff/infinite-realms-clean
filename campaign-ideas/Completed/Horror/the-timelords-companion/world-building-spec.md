# World-Building Specification Brief: The Timelord's Companion

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Timelord's Companion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are companions to the Wanderer—a mysterious time-traveler who explores space and time in the TORDIS, a living ship. They face Daleks, Weeping Angels, and cosmic threats while learning that some tragedies are fixed points that cannot be changed. Through wit, compassion, and sacrifice, they must save civilizations while confronting the burden of impossible choices and the loneliness of outliving everyone they love.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Time Lords of Gallifrey—an ancient civilization that mastered time travel and adopted a policy of non-interference, watching history but never changing it.
    *   Write the history of the Time War between the Time Lords and Daleks—a conflict so terrible it threatened all of reality and was erased from history itself.
    *   Describe the Moment—a sentient super-weapon used to destroy both Time Lords and Daleks, ending the Time War but making the Wanderer the last of their kind.
    *   Explain the concept of regeneration—when mortally wounded, Time Lords transform into new bodies with new personalities, effectively living thirteen lives.
    *   Detail fixed points in time—events that must happen or causality itself fractures, creating paradoxes that can erase the universe.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Time Lords of Gallifrey** (Major - Extinct)
        *   **Goals:** (Former) Observe and protect the timeline while maintaining non-interference policy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** High Council, Lord President, Cardinals, Time Lords, initiates.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Safeguard time itself from paradoxes and temporal corruption.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** (Revealed) Many grew corrupt and stagnant, using their power to dominate rather than protect.
        *   **Assets:** (Former) TORDISes, time manipulation technology, regeneration, weapons that could destroy reality.
        *   **Relationships:** Destroyed in the Time War along with the Daleks. The Wanderer is the sole survivor, wracked with guilt.
    *   **The Dalek Empire** (Major - Nearly Extinct)
        *   **Goals:** Exterminate all non-Dalek life in the universe; Daleks are the supreme species.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Emperor Dalek, Dalek Supreme, standard Daleks (no individuals, collective purpose).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Purity through genocide—anything not Dalek is inferior and must be destroyed.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None—they are utterly sincere in their hatred and supremacy.
        *   **Assets:** Massive fleets, time travel (stolen from Time Lords), weapons that can crack planets, impenetrable casings.
        *   **Relationships:** Survived the Time War in small numbers. Fear the Wanderer above all else. Incapable of mercy or negotiation.
    *   **Torchwood Institute** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Defend Earth from alien threats using captured alien technology.
        *   **Hierarchy:** British government-funded agency, operates in secrecy.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—officially does not exist.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Capture and weaponize alien technology, including the Wanderer and the TORDIS if possible.
        *   **Assets:** Alien artifacts, secret bases beneath major cities, retcon (memory-erasing drugs).
        *   **Relationships:** Suspicious of the Wanderer, sometimes allies, sometimes antagonists. "If it's alien, it's ours."
    *   **The Silence** (Minor - Mysterious)
        *   **Goals:** Control human history from the shadows to prevent a prophesied catastrophe.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Unknown—they operate in secret, erasing themselves from memory after being seen.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown—no one remembers encountering them.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Shape human evolution to prevent the Wanderer from answering a specific question.
        *   **Assets:** Instant memory erasure (you forget them the moment you look away), control of religious and political institutions.
        *   **Relationships:** Ancient enemies of the Time Lords. The Wanderer doesn't remember fighting them—no one does.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.

    *   **Dalek Emperor:** Massive golden Dalek casing, commands Dalek fleet, survived Time War by hiding in the void between realities.
    *   **The Face of Boe:** Ancient, enigmatic being—a giant humanoid face in a tank. Offers cryptic prophecies.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party saves someone from a fixed point in time (e.g., the Mars colonists).
    *   **THEN:** Generate temporal cracks appearing across space and time. Events and people begin erasing from existence. Reality itself becomes unstable. The party must undo their rescue to restore causality.
    *   **IF:** The Wanderer dies in combat or sacrifice.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a regeneration sequence. The Wanderer transforms into a new body with different personality, appearance, and mannerisms. The party must adapt to a stranger wearing their friend's memories.
    *   **IF:** A party member is touched by a Weeping Angel.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where that PC is sent to the past (decades or centuries). They must live a full life and leave clues, messages, or items to help their companions in the present.
    *   **IF:** The party destroys all Daleks permanently.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where the universe's timeline shifts. Species the Daleks would have conquered thrive. Other threats emerge. The Wanderer loses their purpose—they defined themselves by fighting Daleks.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to close the temporal cracks by erasing the Wanderer from time.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a timeline where the Wanderer never existed. All their victories are undone, but so are the cracks. The party retains faint, impossible memories.
    *   **IF:** A party member chooses to stay in a historical period or alien world permanently.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue showing their life after leaving the TORDIS. The Wanderer visits occasionally across their timeline, watching them age while the Wanderer stays young (or regenerates).
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to let a fixed tragedy occur (e.g., Pompeii, Titanic).
    *   **THEN:** Generate escalating consequences—localized paradoxes, temporal entities hunting the party, the Wanderer becoming increasingly alien and detached as they consider abandoning the party to save the timeline.
