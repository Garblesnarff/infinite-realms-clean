# CAMPAIGN BIBLE: THE AETHER-MARINER'S CHRONICLE

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Weaving of the Loom
Before time flowed, it pooled. The universe was a chaotic slurry of entropy and potential until the **Chronarchs of Aion-Prime** erected the **Loom of Causality**. Through arrogant science and arcane willpower, they anchored the "Web of Time," transforming chaos into a linear narrative. They declared themselves the Authors of History, watching the universe from their silver citadels, vowed to observe but never touch—a lie they told themselves as they pruned timelines like bonsai trees.

But the **Krell** rose from the toxic slime of the planet Skaro-V (renamed **Ferrum-Major**). Genetically engineered for hate, encased in mobile tanks of bronze and hate-steel, the Krell viewed the Chronarchs not as gods, but as clutter. The resulting conflict, **The Temporal Schism**, did not just burn planets; it weaponized moments. Tuesdays were erased. Entire constellations were weaponized into paradox bombs.

In the final hour, the Aether-Mariner, a renegade Chronarch who loved the universe more than the rules, stole the **Moment**—a sentient galaxy-eater—and ended the war. He burned Aion-Prime. He burned the Krell fleet. He survived, the lonely god of a silent timeline, drifting in his stolen S.A.R.C., wearing faces that aren't his own.
