# Ascension Protocol
## *The higher you climb, the closer you get to the truth. And the truth wants you to fall.*

### Campaign Overview

The Skyward Cliffs aren't a mountain range—they're a staircase. Each cliff face is exactly 500 meters tall, stacked impossibly on top of each other, ascending into clouds and beyond. Ancient glyphs carved into the stone reveal that this is the Ascension Protocol: a test left by the Architects, a vanished civilization. Climbers who free-solo (no ropes, no safety) specific routes on each of the Twelve Faces unlock portions of reality-altering power. Complete all twelve, reach the summit, and you can reshape the world itself.

Players are recruited by the Foundation, a secret society of climbers who've been attempting the Protocol for centuries. But the Vertigo Syndicate—cult-like climbers who believe humanity shouldn't have godlike power—actively murders anyone approaching completion. Worse, the Protocol itself is sentient: it tests not just physical skill but moral worth, creating illusions, manipulating gravity, and literally rewriting reality to challenge climbers. Success means ultimate power. Failure means a very long fall.

This is Free Solo meets The Matrix meets Lovecraftian reality manipulation, where every handhold is a choice, every climb is meditation and terror combined, and the stone itself judges your soul.

### Core Themes

- **Absolute Commitment**: No safety nets, total focus or death
- **Solitude vs Community**: Free-soloing alone but supported by crew
- **Worthiness**: Being tested by inhuman intelligence
- **Perfectionism**: One mistake is fatal
- **Meditation in Motion**: Flow state as spiritual practice
- **Reality as Consensus**: Power to reshape existence
- **Hubris vs Ambition**: Seeking godhood vs seeking growth

### Key NPCs

**Elder Pitch (Foundation Leader)**: Ancient climber, completed 11 faces, refused the 12th. Wisdom and regret. Secret: He knows what's at the summit and fears it.

**Razor Edge (Vertigo Syndicate Head)**: Fanatic who believes Protocol should remain incomplete. Lost entire team to previous climbers' reality manipulation. Sympathetic antagonist—traumatized, not evil.

**The Architect (AI/Entity)**: Intelligence embedded in the cliffs. Communicates through stone patterns and hallucinations. Tests moral worth more than climbing skill. Alien perspective.

**Ghost (The Failed)**: Climber who died attempting Face 9. Appears as hallucination/ghost, gives cryptic warnings. Reveal: Actually alive, trapped in pocket dimension between reality states.

**Nova (The Prodigy)**: Young climber, unnaturally gifted, potentially chosen by Protocol itself. Represents new generation. Arc: Temptation to rush versus wisdom to prepare.

**The Summit Entity**: Whatever waits at the top. Is it god? Machine? Test? Players discover gradually.

### Major Locations

**Base Camp Twelve**: Foundation headquarters, training walls, archive of previous attempts

**The Twelve Faces**:
1. **Courage**: Beginner difficulty, teaches Protocol basics
2. **Strength**: Overhang endurance, physical challenge
3. **Precision**: Tiny holds, exactitude required
4. **Endurance**: Hours-long climb, mental fortitude
5. **Trust**: Invisible holds (must trust Protocol)
6. **Creativity**: No set route, improvise path
7. **Sacrifice**: Must leave behind something valued
8. **Wisdom**: Puzzle climb, brainwork over muscle
9. **Truth**: Face your deepest fears manifest
10. **Death**: Deliberately falling and being caught
11. **Transcendence**: Climbing while reality breaks down
12. **The Unknown**: ??? (revealed at summit)

**Vertigo Temple**: Cult base, meditation chambers, memorial to victims of reality manipulation

**Between-Spaces**: Pocket dimensions accessed through Protocol, surreal climbing in impossible gravity

**The Summit**: Unknown until reached

### Unique Mechanics

**Free Solo System**: One failed check = death. No safety equipment. Players must succeed on ALL climbing checks for a Face.

**Reality Manipulation** (unlocked per Face completed):
- **Courage**: See future holds (1 second prediction)
- **Strength**: Enhance grip strength temporarily
- **Precision**: Slow time perception during moves
- **Endurance**: Eliminate fatigue
- **Trust**: Make invisible holds visible
- **Creativity**: Create temporary handholds
- **Sacrifice**: Store ability for later
- **Wisdom**: Understand stone's "intent"
- **Truth**: See through illusions
- **Death**: Survive one fall per day
- **Transcendence**: Ignore gravity briefly
- **Unknown**: Total reality rewrite

**The Protocol's Tests**: Each Face includes moral dilemma beyond physical climbing—choosing to save others vs complete climb, etc.

**Vertigo Interference**: Cult actively sabotages attempts, creates distractions mid-climb, psychological warfare

**Flow State**: Players must achieve "zen focus"—roleplay meditation before climbs, failure means disadvantage

### Plot Twists

1. **Elder Pitch's Fear**: The 12th Face grants reality control but erases climber's original personality
2. **Razor Edge's Truth**: His team didn't die—they ascended and became alien to humanity
3. **The Protocol's Purpose**: Test to find worthy successors to Architects
4. **Ghost's Survival**: Trapped in reality fold, completing Protocol might free or kill him
5. **Nova's Nature**: She's an Architect fragment, not fully human
6. **Multiple Summits**: Each climber's summit is different—personalized test
7. **Vertigo's Funding**: They're right—previous reality manipulators caused catastrophes
8. **Foundation Corruption**: Some members want power for wrong reasons
9. **The Twelve Faces**: Actually rungs on imprisoned entity's cage—completing frees it
10. **Player's Choice**: Can rewrite reality but doing so undoes their entire existence

### Victory & Defeat Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Complete all Twelve Faces, reach Summit, make wise choice about reality-altering power (likely refusing it or using it selflessly)

**Secondary**: Prevent Vertigo catastrophic sabotage, preserve Foundation knowledge, redeem Razor Edge, free Ghost, guide Nova safely

**Defeat**: Fall to death, driven mad by Protocol's tests, become Vertigo convert, misuse reality powers and break world, Summit Entity judges unworthy and erases team

### Campaign Tone

Every session should feel like watching Free Solo—long periods of meditation, focus, and preparation, then intense climbing where one slip means permanent death. Emphasize:

- Pre-climb mental preparation rituals
- Absolute silence during critical moves
- Ground crew's helpless watching
- Beauty of stone and routes
- Terror of exposure
- Transcendent moments of perfect execution
- Philosophical weight of reality-altering power
- Found family in climbing community

This is about confronting mortality, testing limits, and deciding if godhood is worth the price. Make every Face completion feel earned. Make players genuinely afraid of falling. Make the choice at the Summit genuinely difficult.
