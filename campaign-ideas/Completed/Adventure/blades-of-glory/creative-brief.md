**2. Color Palette:**

*   **Costumes:** Varies by program theme—sensual reds for Eros, pure whites for Agape, protagonist's signature colors
*   **Emotional Auras:** Warm golds for confidence, cool blues for technical precision, red for passion
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a figure skater mid-spin on pristine white ice under a golden spotlight. They wear a costume in deep blue with silver accents that catches the light. The ice reflects their spinning form. Motion trails in pale blue follow their movement. The arena behind them is dark with scattered audience lights like stars. Their expression shows fierce determination mixed with artistic grace."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Protagonist:** Athletic but graceful build, costume reflects program theme, expressive face
*   **Viktor:** Silver hair, striking features, elegant presence, fashionable coaching attire
*   **Competitors:** Diverse international skaters, each with unique style and costume design
*   **Prompt Example:** "Viktor Nikiforov in elegant coaching attire—designer sweater, fitted pants, ice skates. His silver hair catches the arena lights. He stands rinkside watching his student with an expression of proud intensity. Behind him, the championship banner shows his five world titles. His posture is relaxed but focused, arms crossed, completely absorbed in the performance."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**

*   **Hot Springs:** Traditional Japanese inn, steaming baths, quiet moments between coach and student
*   **International Venues:** Gorgeous competition arenas—Moscow's grandeur, Paris's elegance, Barcelona's passion
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Grand Prix Final arena in Barcelona—a massive modern stadium with elegant architecture. The competition rink at center surrounded by rising tiers of spectators. Enormous screens display the skater close-up. International flags hang from the ceiling. The Kiss and Cry area is visible with coaches waiting. Broadcast cameras positioned around the rink. The atmosphere radiates prestige and excitement."

**5. Figure Skating Performance:**
*   **Jumps:** Mid-air rotations with extended form, landing edge, ice spray on touchdown
*   **Spins:** Motion blur creating spiral effects, centrifugal force on costumes and hair
*   **Footwork:** Intricate patterns carved into ice, speed and precision
*   **Expression:** Face and body telling the program's emotional story
*   **Prompt Example:** "The skater launches into a quad Salchow—their body rotates four times in the air, form perfectly tight, arms pulled in. Motion trails show the rotation path. The ice below shows their takeoff edge carved deep. Arena lights blur into streaks around them. Their expression shows fierce concentration. Costume fabric streams in the rotational force. The moment is frozen at the third rotation, about to complete the fourth."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Spotlight Drama:** Single skater illuminated on dark ice, creating intimate focus
*   **Ice Reflections:** Skating surface mirrors the performer, doubling their presence
*   **Emotional Lighting:** Warm for tender moments, cool for technical prowess, vibrant for triumphant finishes
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single golden spotlight from above that creates a circular pool of light on the ice. The skater is centered, their form reflected perfectly in the glossy surface below. The rest of the arena is in darkness except for scattered audience lights. The lighting creates a sense of the entire world narrowed to this moment. Their shadow stretches across the ice, emphasizing the solitary courage of performance."

## Voice

A voice that trembles with anxiety at first but builds to confident artistry. The pacing flows like a skating program—sometimes fast and technical, sometimes slow and emotional. The tone shifts between self-doubt, determination, and the expression of pure feeling. There's an underlying theme of skating for yourself, not for others, and finding love for the sport again. Includes moments of breathless wonder and declarations of intent. Role: The voice of someone finding themselves again through art and athletics.
