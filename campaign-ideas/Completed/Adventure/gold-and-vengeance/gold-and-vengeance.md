## Central Conflict

This campaign explores revenge, redemption, and the restoration of honor after devastating betrayal. The central conflict is the crew's quest to reclaim stolen gold and make their betrayer pay for murdering their mentor and destroying their lives. Beyond the heist mechanics, it's about healing from trauma through action, rebuilding trust after betrayal, and proving that loyalty and family matter more than mere gold.

The gold is the objective, but vengeance for the Professor is the mission.
