# Mountain Pass Legends: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The Mountain is a god. Not a god of stone and ice, but a far older, more abstract entity: The God of Passage, of journeys, of the space between here and there. The mountain range known as the "Spine of the World" is merely its physical shell, and the treacherous pass that cuts through it is its heart. This god, known only as "Janus" in forgotten texts, is neutral, demanding only one thing from those who seek to cross its domain: a toll. The toll is not gold or blood, but something more fundamental. To cross the pass, a traveler must give up a story, a secret, a cherished memory, or a sliver of their future potential. These tolls, given up over millennia, do not simply vanish. The most potent ones—stories of great love, secrets of forgotten magic, memories of intense joy or sorrow—have coalesced, gaining sentience. They are the "Legends" of the pass: living narratives, emotional ghosts, and conceptual predators that now haunt the mountain, seeking to become whole by consuming the stories and potential of new travelers.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Crossing (Time Immemorial):** The first living creature crosses the mountain, instinctively giving up its "memory of the sea" to do so. The God of Passage, Janus, awakens.
2.  **The Age of Tolls (Ancient History):** For thousands of years, tribes, empires, and individuals cross the pass, each paying their toll. The pass becomes a repository of the world's lost stories and forgotten histories.
3.  **The Birth of the First Legend (c. -4,000 years):** The memory of a king's betrayal, a particularly "heavy" toll, achieves sentience. It becomes the "Legend of the Weeping King," a sorrowful ghost that drains the hope from travelers.
4.  **(Surreal) The River of Memories (c. -3,000 years):** For one year, the main river flowing from the pass does not carry water, but a shimmering, liquid substance. Drinking from it causes one to experience the memories of a thousand different people at once.
5.  **The Rise of the Wall-God (c. -1,500 years):** A new, rival god comes into being: Terminus, the God of Walls, Stagnation, and Endings. It begins to exert its influence, seeking to "close" the pass, not just physically, but metaphysically.
6.  **The First Closing (c. -1,000 years):** The first major manifestation of Terminus's power. A massive, impassable glacier, the "Wall of Ages," forms at one end of the pass, cutting it off for a century. The world stagnates, with little trade, travel, or innovation.
7.  **The Toll of a Hero (c. -900 years):** A hero named Anya pays the ultimate toll—her entire future potential—to Janus, asking it to re-open the pass. The glacier melts in a single day. Anya lives out the rest of her life as a simple, content farmer, her potential for greatness utterly spent. The "Legend of the Sacrificed Hero" is born.
8.  **(Surreal) The Day the Wind Spoke (c. -500 years):** For 24 hours, the wind that blows through the pass speaks in the voices of everyone who ever paid a toll. It tells a million conflicting stories at once, driving many who hear it mad.
9.  **The Weakening (c. -100 years to present):** Terminus's influence grows. The pass becomes more dangerous, the weather more extreme, and the Legends more aggressive and hungry. Janus is losing its power.
10. **(Surreal) The Silent Echo (c. -1 month):** The echoes in the pass begin to fail. A shout into a canyon is met with silence. The very concept of "passage" is breaking down. The pass is on the verge of its final, permanent closing.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is between the concepts of Journey and Destination, Change and Stasis. Janus, the God of Passage, believes that life is the journey itself. Terminus, the God of Walls, believes that the only purpose of a journey is to reach a destination, and that the perfect state is to have never had to travel at all. The players, as travelers on the pass, are the last prayers of a dying god. Their own personal journey through the pass is a microcosm of the larger cosmic struggle. If they succeed in crossing, they are not just saving themselves; they are proving the philosophical necessity of the journey. If they fail, or turn back, or are stopped, they are casting a vote for a world of walls, a world where no one ever leaves home, and nothing ever changes.

The entrance to the pass, a massive fortified roadhouse run by the Toll-Takers Guild.
*   **The Toll-House:** A large, bureaucratic hall where travelers must have their "toll" assessed and paid. **Smell:** Old paper, ink, and the faint, metallic scent of fear. **Sound:** The scratching of quills, the stamping of documents, the low murmur of nervous travelers.

### The Weeping Peaks
A section of the pass haunted by powerful, sorrowful Legends. The emotional landscape is one of deep grief.

A high-altitude section of the pass, battered by constant, supernatural winds.

*   **The Silent Monastery of Janus:** A hidden monastery in a valley where the wind never blows. **Smell:** Incense, old stone, and a profound sense of peace. **Sound:** Absolute, perfect silence.
*   **The 'Sea-Dragon's' Perch:** The impossible sight of a full-sized sailing ship, perched precariously on a high mountain lake. **Smell:** Salt, rotting wood, and confusion. **Sound:** The creak of the ship's hull, the frantic shouts of Captain Eva's crew.
*   **The Wall of Ages:** The massive, sentient glacier that marks the domain of the god Terminus. **Smell:** Ancient ice, cold, and the absence of life. **Sound:** The slow, grinding, groaning sound of the glacier's movement.

### The Heart of the Pass
The center of the mountain and the domain of Janus itself. A place where the physical and metaphysical blur.
*   **The Toll-Troll's Bridge:** A massive, ancient stone bridge guarded by Grak, the troll. **Smell:** Wet stone, troll musk, and the faint scent of stories. **Sound:** Grak's deep, rumbling questions.
*   **The Cave of the Future:** A cave system where the Prospectors of Potential are "mining." The walls are lined with glittering veins of "potential." **Smell:** Ozone, hot rock, and the electric scent of possibility. **Sound:** The clink of pickaxes, Sal's fast-talking sales pitch.
*   **The Emotional Landscape:** A valley where the terrain changes based on the emotional state of the travelers within it. **Smell:** Constantly shifting. **Sound:** Constantly shifting.
*   **The Library of Legends:** Not a building, but a place. A quiet grove where the most ancient and powerful Legends "rest." **Smell:** Old memories, dust, and magic. **Sound:** A faint, overlapping chorus of a thousand stories.
*   **The Altar of Passage:** The "heart" of Janus. A simple, flat, bronze-colored rock that is warm to the touch. It is here that the final toll must be paid to save the pass. **Smell:** The clean scent of ozone and ancient power. **Sound:** A low, deep hum that is the "voice" of the god.

### The Final Wall
The far side of the pass, where the influence of Terminus, the God of Walls, is strongest.
*   **The Half-Built Wall:** A massive wall being built by the Servants of the Wall, not of stone, but of silenced sounds and stolen echoes. **Smell:** Dust, and the metallic scent of despair. **Sound:** A profound, unnatural silence.
*   **The City of Stasis:** A small town at the foot of the mountain that has fallen completely under Terminus's influence. Nothing ever changes here. The same day repeats, over and over. **Smell:** Dust, and the absence of cooking or life. **Sound:** The same, few conversations, repeated endlessly.
*   **The First Anchor's Perch:** A high cliff where the First Anchor is chained to the mountain, performing his ritual to close the pass. **Smell:** Cold stone, fanatical sweat. **Sound:** The rhythmic, monotonous chanting of the First Anchor.
*   **The Labyrinth of Dead Ends:** A maze of canyons and box-canyons, where every path leads to a dead end. **Smell:** Stagnation, despair. **Sound:** The echo of your own, frustrated shouts.
*   **The Gate of No Return:** The final archway leading out of the pass. If Terminus wins, this gate will become a solid, impassable wall, sealing the pass forever. **Smell:** The cold, hard smell of a final ending. **Sound:** The silence of a closed door.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Compass of the Heart
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A compass made of polished wood and bronze. The needle is a single, petrified tear. It does not point North.
**Mechanics:** The compass points towards the location of the thing the holder desires most in the world. However, it does not point to a physical location, but to the "heart" of that desire. If you desire wealth, it may point to a dragon's hoard, or it may point to the heart of a greedy king. If you desire knowledge, it may point to a library, or to the mind of a wise old man.

### 2. Anya's Final Footstep
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A single, preserved boot-print of the hero Anya, solidified into a glassy, amber-like substance. It is warm to the touch.
**Mechanics:** Once, and only once, the user can place the Footstep on the ground and step into it. When they do, they can make a single, selfless, sacrificial act for the good of others. The power of Anya's original sacrifice will ensure that this act succeeds, no matter how impossible. For example, a user could step into it and declare "I will hold off the avalanche," and they would succeed, though they would be buried. After its use, the Footstep crumbles to dust.

### 3. The Story-Jar of the Weeping King
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A clay jar, sealed with wax, containing the "captured" Legend of the Weeping King. The jar is cold to the touch and sobs softly.
**Mechanics:** The jar can be opened. When opened, the Legend of the Weeping King is released. For the next hour, all creatures within a 1-mile radius (including the one who opened it) are overcome with profound sorrow and must make a high DC Wisdom save or fall into a catatonic state of grief for the duration. The jar can also be used as a bargaining chip with the Legend-Hunters or the Echo-Herders.

### 4. The Wall-God's Nail
**Type:** Cursed Weapon (Dagger)
**Description:** A shard of black, unmoving ice, taken from the Wall of Ages. It is unnaturally cold and absorbs all sound around it.
**Mechanics:** The dagger is a +2 weapon that deals an extra 1d8 cold damage. Any creature struck by it must make a CON save or have their speed reduced to 0 for 1 minute as they are frozen in place. **Curse:** The wielder slowly becomes stagnant. They cannot learn new skills or languages. If they gain a level, they cannot choose new abilities, only improve existing ones. They begin to hate travel and change.

### 5. The Toll-Troll's Ledger
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Book)
**Description:** The massive, stone ledger in which Grak, the troll, records the stories he collects as tolls.
**Mechanics:** A creature who can read the ledger (it is written in a unique, pictographic script) can read one of the stories within. Reading a story grants the reader the knowledge and experience of the person who told it for 24 hours. For example, reading the story of a master swordsman might grant the reader proficiency with all martial weapons for a day. Reading the story of a king might grant them proficiency in persuasion. Only one story can be "active" at a time.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Map That Leads to a Single, Delicious Berry:** A very complex and dramatic-looking treasure map. The "treasure" is a single, perfect, and utterly delicious berry.
2.  **The Homesick Rock:** A rock from the base of the mountain that desperately wants to get to the other side. It will vibrate and hum when pointed in the right direction.
3.  **A Bottled Echo of a Bad Joke:** A bottle that, when opened, releases the faint sound of a terrible pun, followed by a single, polite cough.
4.  **The Mountaineer's Spoon:** A spoon with a tiny, built-in grappling hook and rope.
5.  **A Pet Rock with Anxiety:** A small, smooth rock that gets nervous and sweaty when you hold it.
6.  **The Compass of Poor Decisions:** A compass that always points towards what is objectively the worst, most dangerous, and least rewarding course of action.
7.  **A Single, Un-meltable Snowflake:** A perfect, beautiful snowflake, preserved in a small jar. It will never melt, even in direct flame.
8.  **The Alpinist's Teacup:** A teacup with crampons and a tiny ice-axe.
9.  **A Story That Is Just Okay:** A small, written story. It's not good, it's not bad. It's just... fine. The Toll-Takers will accept it, but they will sigh with disappointment.
10. **The Echo-Herder's Crook:** A shepherd's crook that can be used to gently nudge and guide incorporeal creatures.
11. **A Piece of "Fool's Potential":** A glittering rock that looks like a nugget of "potential," but it's just a rock.
12. **The Pessimist's Trail Rations:** Trail rations that are nutritious, but taste of disappointment and regret.
13. **A Guidebook to the Pass, Written by a Liar:** A helpful-looking guidebook where every single piece of information is a clever, well-disguised lie.
14. **The Climber's Gloves of Butterfingers:** A pair of high-quality climbing gloves that make you strangely clumsy.
15. **A Single, Very Judgmental Pinecone:** A pinecone that, when you hold it, gives you the distinct impression that it is judging your life choices.
16. **The Inconvenient Tent:** A tent that is warm and waterproof, but can only be pitched on a sheer, vertical cliff face.
17. **A Rope That Is Afraid of Heights:** A 50-foot rope that will begin to tremble and weep if held over a drop of more than 10 feet.
18. **The Yodeler's Lozenge:** A cough drop that, when consumed, makes you unable to speak, but able to yodel with perfect, angelic beauty for one hour.
19. **A Map of the Places You've Already Been:** A map that magically fills itself in, but only with places you have already visited.
20. **The Wind's Complaint:** A small, leather pouch that has "captured" the wind's complaint about a particularly annoying tree. It's just a lot of sighing.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Tolls
The pass is a sentient being that demands payment. This is a fundamental law of this region.
*   **The Toll:** Every 24 hours a creature spends in the pass, they must pay a toll. They can choose what to pay: a memory, a secret, a skill, a story, or a piece of their future. The "cost" is determined by the DM. A minor memory might be forgetting what you had for breakfast. A major one might be forgetting your wife's face. Giving up a skill means you lose a proficiency for a week. Giving up potential means you gain a level of "Toll-Debt."
*   **Toll-Debt:** For each level of Toll-Debt, you have a cumulative -1 penalty on all d20 rolls. This represents your future being "spent." This debt can only be repaid by performing a great deed or making a great sacrifice.
*   **Narrative Weight:** The Legends that haunt the pass are drawn to travelers with "heavy" stories. A character with a dark secret, a tragic backstory, or a grand destiny will be targeted by the Legends more often.

### Subsystems: The Emotional Landscape
The pass is a place of powerful, raw emotion. This is a tangible, environmental effect.
*   **Emotional Terrain:** Certain areas of the pass are dominated by a specific emotion (e.g., The Weeping Peaks are sorrowful, the Howling Ridge is full of rage). While in one of these areas, characters have advantage on saves against that emotion (it's hard to make someone sad when they are already in the saddest place in the world), but have disadvantage on saves against its opposite emotion.
*   **Legend-Food:** The Legends feed on emotion. A character who displays a powerful emotion (grief, joy, rage) may attract the attention of a Legend that feeds on that emotion. This can be used as a lure, or it can be a dangerous liability.
