# Creative Brief: The Crimson Spire

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Urban Martial Arts (The Raid meets Dark Fantasy)

Inspired by intense martial arts action films shot in claustrophobic urban settings, this aesthetic combines brutal realism with fantasy elements. It's visceral, immediate, and relentless—every frame should communicate physical exhaustion and the desperate fight for survival.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Enclosed Brutality:** Emphasize tight spaces where combat becomes desperate and personal.
*   **Kinetic Choreography:** Show the flow of martial arts combat through tight corridors and cramped rooms.
*   **Exhaustion Visible:** Characters should show progressive damage, fatigue, and determination.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Relentless, escalating, brutal, claustrophobic, visceral, martial-excellence, desperate, exhausted-determination.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of endless combat. Sweat, blood, and determination in equal measure. No escape but up. Each floor harder than the last.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Gritty realism with sharp, dynamic lines for combat. Architecture should feel oppressive—low ceilings, narrow hallways, practical but worn spaces.
*   **Textures:** Rough concrete, chipped paint, blood spatters, worn wood, broken glass, aged metal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gritty digital painting of a narrow apartment hallway, fluorescent lights flickering above. Rough concrete walls show years of wear. Blood spatters tell stories of previous violence."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated, harsh colors dominated by industrial grays, browns, and the sickly green of fluorescent lighting. Blood provides the only vibrant color.
*   **Accent Colors:** The red of blood (used prominently), the harsh green-yellow of fluorescent lights, the blue-gray of bruises.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Harsh overhead fluorescent lighting creating unflattering shadows and emphasizing exhaustion.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh fluorescent lights casting sickly green-yellow tones over everything. The palette is desaturated grays and browns, with only fresh blood providing vivid red color. Shadows under eyes show exhaustion."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical combat attire showing progressive damage. Characters should look more beaten down each floor they climb.
*   **Warriors:** Guard uniforms torn and bloodied, makeshift bandages, weapons scavenged from enemies, visible injuries accumulating.
*   **Expression:** Exhaustion, determination, the thousand-yard stare of those who've seen too much combat but refuse to stop.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elite guard member midway through the tower climb: uniform torn and blood-stained, face showing bruises and cuts, breathing hard. They wield a scavenged weapon. Every detail shows they're running on pure determination."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Oppressive urban architecture—narrow corridors, cramped apartments, industrial stairwells. Every space feels designed to trap rather than escape.
*   **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, hostile, no wasted space. Architecture becomes an enemy as much as the gangs.
*   **Details:** Graffiti, drug paraphernalia, broken furniture, flickering lights, blood trails, evidence of previous violence.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cramped tenement hallway with water-stained walls and flickering fluorescent lights. Doors to apartments hang open, showing signs of hasty evacuation or violence. The space is barely wide enough for two people to fight side-by-side. No escape route is visible."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh overhead lighting creating stark shadows and emphasizing vertical lines. Pools of darkness where lights have failed.
*   **Shadows:** Sharp, unflattering, creating pockets of danger where enemies could hide.
*   **Purpose:** Emphasize the oppressive environment, make viewers feel the claustrophobia, highlight the physical toll.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...illuminated by a single working fluorescent light, creating a pool of harsh green-yellow light in an otherwise dark corridor. Shadows are deep and black. The vertical nature of the space is emphasized by the lighting falling from above."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Tight framing emphasizing enclosed spaces. Use of vertical lines to emphasize the upward journey. Camera angles that make spaces feel more confined.
*   **Techniques:** Low ceilings in frame, narrow field of view, bodies packed into tight spaces, vertical stairwells shot looking up or down.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vertical composition looking up a narrow stairwell that seems to go on forever. Harsh light comes from above. A figure stands halfway up, silhouetted, looking down at the camera. The framing emphasizes how far there still is to climb."

## Voice

A ragged, exhausted voice—male or female, breathing hard between words. The accent is working-class urban, with the clipped speech of someone conserving energy. Pacing is broken by heavy breathing and occasional grunts of pain. Emotion is tightly controlled exhaustion—the determination to keep going despite body screaming to stop. Audio quality includes ambient sounds of the tower—distant combat, dripping water, flickering lights, the echo of movement in stairwells. Role: A warrior halfway through the climb, checking in with their team, knowing they can't stop now.
