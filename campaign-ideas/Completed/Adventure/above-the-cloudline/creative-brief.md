# Above the Cloudline - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction

### Overall Aesthetic
**Style**: Fairy-tale wonder meets practical physics. Think Studio Ghibli's Castle in the Sky mixed with Honey I Shrunk the Kids and classical fairy-tale illustration. Emphasize verticality, scale contrast, and the dreamlike quality of cloud architecture.

**Color Palette**:
- **Sky Realm**: Soft blues, whites, crystal rainbows, golden sunlight
- **Beanstalk**: Rich greens, earth browns, vibrant flower colors
- **Giants**: Natural skin tones, practical clothing (farmers to royal finery)
- **Contrast**: Warm human scale vs cool vast giant scale

**Lighting**: Always emphasize height—sun rays through clouds, dramatic sky colors, sense of being "above" the world. Crystal refractions creating rainbow light. Soft but clear visibility.

### Environmental Design

**The Beanstalk**: Massive beyond comprehension, trunk like ancient redwood, leaves the size of ships, flowers blooming with interior ecosystems, vines creating natural pathways, growth rings showing age, living and growing.

**Cloud Kingdoms**: Clouds solidified into crystalline surfaces, architecture that flows organically, rainbow refractions everywhere, impossible structures floating, gardens of cloud-flowers, weather contained and controlled.

**Giant Scale**: Everything is 10-15x human size—chairs are platforms, doorknobs are climbing challenges, tables are mesa-like, utensils are weapons, books are building-sized.

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme**: Whimsical and grand orchestral, harp and flute for fairy-tale quality, building to epic brass for scope and danger.

**Beanstalk Climbing**: Woodwinds, rustling leaves, creaking wood, wind intensifying with altitude.

**Cloud Kingdom**: Ethereal choir, crystalline chimes, vast atmospheric ambience, giant footsteps as timpani thunder.

**Giants**: Voices deep and resonant, movements causing bass rumbles, but also humanized—laughter, conversations, daily life at massive scale.

**Action**: Fast strings for party movement, slow dramatic percussion for giant combat, weather effects (wind, thunder, rain impacts).

## Voice Acting Direction

**Grimble** (Giant child): Higher voice for giant (still deep for humans), curious inflection, wonder and loneliness, excitement when discovering friends.

**King Cumulus**: Regal, burdened, deep and measured, speaks slowly, weight of responsibility in every word.

**Lady Tempest**: Military authority, sharp, decisive, anger covering fear, genuine conviction.

**Seeker Nimbus**: Elderly, kind, academic enthusiasm, speaks to party as equals despite size, gentle and patient.

**Captain Helena**: Clipped military cadence, no-nonsense, patriotic fervor, pain beneath professionalism.

**The Beanstalk Druid**: Echoing, layered voices (human, giant, and plant unified), ancient and tired, alien intelligence.

## Atmospheric Direction for DM

**Emphasize Scale**: Constantly remind players of size difference through descriptions. "The doorknob alone is at head height." "You could walk through the keyhole."

**Wonder and Danger**: Balance fairy-tale beauty with practical lethality. Pretty clouds, but falling means death.

**Cultural Differences**: Giants aren't alien—they're people with different perspectives, literally and figuratively.

**Vertical Combat**: Use height, falling, climbing, and three-dimensional movement in every encounter.

## Additional Immersion Tools

- Giant-scale maps where party tokens are tiny dots
- Oversized props (giant's coin, huge buttons) for physical representation
- Weather sound effects for cloud kingdom
- Vertical battle maps using 3D elements

This campaign is **fairy-tale made real**—wonder with consequences, adventure with depth, classic story retold as complex political fantasy.
