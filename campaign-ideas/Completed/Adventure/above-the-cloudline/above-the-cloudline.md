# Above the Cloudline
## *Where Giants Tread Among the Clouds, and Mortals Dare to Climb*

### Campaign Overview

A mysterious beanstalk has erupted overnight, tearing through the center of the capital city and piercing the cloud layer above. It grows impossibly tall—miles into the sky—its massive vines thick as castle towers, leaves large enough to serve as platforms. The royal court is in chaos. Scholars are baffled. And something is descending from above: enormous objects falling through clouds, crushing buildings. Thunderous footsteps echo from the heights.

The party is hired (or volunteers) to climb the beanstalk and discover what lies above the clouds. What they find is a fully-realized world: the **Cloud Kingdoms of the Giants**, a civilization existing on clouds made solid through ancient magic. Giants live here—some peaceful farmers, some aggressive hunters, others noble lords in crystalline castles. To the giants, the world below is legend, a dangerous "underworld" they avoid. The beanstalk's growth was accidental, and now both societies face a crisis.

The campaign combines fairy-tale wonder with practical challenges: navigating a world where you're mouse-sized, diplomacy with beings who might accidentally crush you, heist-style infiltration of giant-scale locations, and moral complexity when you discover the giants aren't monsters—they're people whose society is as nuanced as your own. Jack and the Beanstalk meets Gulliver's Travels, with D&D politics and environmental puzzles.

### Core Themes

**Perspective and Scale**: Everything familiar becomes alien at different sizes. A breakfast table is a terrain challenge. A giant child's toy room is a dungeon. Scale creates gameplay and narrative opportunities.

**First Contact Diplomacy**: Neither society knew the other existed. The party serves as ambassadors, spies, or invaders—depending on choices. Can two vastly different peoples coexist?

**Wonder vs. Danger**: The Cloud Kingdoms are beautiful and magical, but also fundamentally dangerous to small beings. A giant's casual movement can kill. Weather is weaponized. Falling is always fatal.

**Class and Society**: Both worlds have class structures. Poor giants vs. giant nobility mirrors the party's own world. Complicated alliances form across size lines.

**The Ethics of Theft**: Jack stole from giants in the fairy tale. Is that heroism or villainy? The campaign asks: when you're small and disadvantaged, does that justify taking from giants? What about taking back what giants took first?

**Home vs. Heaven**: The Cloud Kingdoms seem like paradise—clean air, magical wonders, abundant resources. But it's not home. Do humans try to colonize, trade, or seal the beanstalk forever?

### Session Breakdown (25-35 Sessions)

**Act I: The Ascent (Sessions 1-6)**
- **Session 1: The Beanstalk Erupts**: Campaign opens with disaster. A massive plant tears through the city overnight. Party investigates origin—finds magical beans planted by mysterious stranger (or party member, if backstory chosen). Royal decree: climb and investigate.

- **Session 2-3: The Climb**: Multi-session ascent. Encounters on the beanstalk: giant insects, birds, weather challenges, sections where beanstalk is damaged. Establish climbing mechanics. First glimpse of clouds solidifying unnaturally. Something lives above.

- **Session 4: Breaking the Cloudline**: Party emerges above clouds to find solid ground—clouds compressed into terrain. Temperature drops. Unfamiliar constellations. In distance: castle made of crystal and cloud. First giant encounter: farmer checking beanstalk growth, terrified to find "underworld creatures" climbing up. Chase/hide sequence.

- **Session 5-6: The Giant Village**: Party reaches settlement of cloud-giant farmers. Must navigate giant-scale environment: homes like mountains, chickens the size of dragons, livestock that could crush cities. Stealth and social encounters. Meet sympathetic giant (maybe an outcast child) who becomes NPC ally. Learn basics: Cloud Kingdoms are real civilization with politics, history, and problems.

**Act II: Among the Clouds (Sessions 7-16)**
- **Session 7-8: The Crystal Court**: Summoned before giant nobility. Diplomatic encounter—party must argue their world's right to exist (giants thought below was void/chaos). Meet the Cloud King, various noble houses (Storm Giants, Cloud Giants, factions). Learn about **Sky Law**: ancient prohibition against descending below clouds. Beanstalk broke the law; consequences brewing.

- **Session 9-10: The Goose Quest**: Classic fairy-tale element reimagined. A giant noble's magical goose was stolen by previous human climber (Jack, decades ago). Goose lays golden eggs—actually, condenses wealth from clouds. Giants demand return or recompense. Party must find it in mortal world or provide alternative. Downward expedition—seeing home from giant's perspective.

- **Session 11-12: Political Intrigue**: Return to Cloud Kingdoms. Discover factional conflict:
  - **Isolationists**: Want to destroy beanstalk, seal clouds forever
  - **Warmongers**: Want to invade below, take resources, subjugate humans
  - **Traders**: See opportunity for commerce
  - **Scholars**: Fascinated by smaller world, want peaceful study
  Party must navigate these factions.

- **Session 13-14: The Giant's Problem**: Giants have their own crisis: Cloud Kingdoms are slowly descending. The magic holding clouds solid is weakening. In generations, the sky-world will fall. Some giants want to colonize below preemptively. Others seek solutions. Party might help or exploit this.

- **Session 15-16: The Vault of the Sky Lords**: Heist sequence. Party infiltrates massive treasury/library of giant scholars. Navigate giant-scale dungeon: trapped chests are room-sized, a simple lock is a puzzle taking hours, guard patrols are environmental hazards. Steal/discover ancient lore: humans and giants once lived together before "The Sundering."

**Act III: The Sundering's Truth (Sessions 17-26)**
- **Session 17-18: Historical Discovery**: Ancient texts reveal truth: humans and giants shared world millennia ago. Humans grew envious and treacherous, attempting to poison giants. Giants retaliated with genocide attempt. Surviving humans fled below; surviving giants fled above. A powerful mage (human or giant, lost to time) cast **The Separation**—clouds became solid barrier, memories erased on both sides. The beanstalk growing means the spell is failing.

- **Session 19-20: The Faction War Begins**: Warmonger giants send expeditions down the beanstalk. Attacks on mortal cities begin—but it's not invasion, it's confused retaliation for perceived threats. Human kingdom prepares military response. Party caught in middle: prevent war or choose a side?

- **Session 21-22: Mortal Armies Ascend**: Human forces climb beanstalk, using magic and engineering. First major battle between giants and humans. Party must manage the combat: protect allies (both sides), prevent atrocities, seek ceasefire. Encounter **Giant Slayers**—humans with specialized anti-giant tactics (attacking tendons, poison, traps). Morally gray allies.

- **Session 23-24: The Falling Sky**: Cloud Kingdom's descent accelerates. Pieces of cloud-land fall to mortal world, causing devastation. Giants begin evacuating downward—but where can they go? Human cities can't hold them. Refugee crisis with 60-foot beings. Logistics and humanity.

- **Session 25-26: The Spell's Source**: Party discovers The Separation was cast by a dying archdruid, buried deep within the beanstalk itself—now an awakened entity. The druid's spirit still exists, maintaining the spell through the plant. It's failing because the druid's will is weakening after millennia. Three options: reinforce spell (eternal separation), destroy spell (forced coexistence), or negotiate with druid's spirit (compromise).

**Act IV: Two Worlds, One Future (Sessions 27-35)**
- **Session 27-28: The Druid's Bargain**: Party enters beanstalk's heart—magical space where plant's consciousness lives. Confronts ancient druid (now alien plant-entity). It demands:
  - Proof that coexistence won't repeat genocide
  - Sacrifice from both species
  - Or: total separation forever
  Party must present arguments, evidence, and make binding magical vows.

- **Session 29-30: The Giant's Sacrifice**: If pursuing coexistence, a giant hero must volunteer to become new anchor for cloud magic—preventing total collapse. Introduces NPC giant ally's choice: eternal transformation into living pillar holding up part of cloud continent. Emotionally devastating. Or party finds alternative (epic magical artifact quest).

- **Session 31-32: The Human's Gambit**: Human kingdom must decide: share land with giants (impossible?), create reservation (problematic), or war. Party influenced politics over campaign—now decisions matter. Council scenes, persuasion challenges, potential assassination attempts by extremists (both sides).

- **Session 33-34: The Final Confrontation**: Depending on path:
  - **War Ending**: Battle against giant warlord or human extremist leader. Epic combat at scale, armies clashing on beanstalk itself. Victory prevents genocide but leaves scars.
  - **Peace Ending**: Defend peace summit from saboteurs (both species). Protect leaders while treaty signed. Combat against extremists from both sides.
  - **Separation Ending**: Ritual to reinforce The Separation. Must fight manifestations of broken unity. Melancholic—saving both by keeping apart.

- **Session 35: New World Order**:
  - **If Coexistence**: Giants settle in designated territories. Party oversees integration. Challenges ahead but hopeful. Trade begins—giant-made goods, cloud magic, shared knowledge. Party honored by both peoples.
  - **If Separation**: Beanstalk destroyed, clouds re-sealed. Both societies return to isolation. Party returns home with knowledge that giants exist but are unreachable. Bittersweet.
  - **If War Victory**: One side subjugated (depends on party choices). Occupation, resistance movements, empire building. Party might be heroes to one side, monsters to other.
  - **If War Loss**: Failed to prevent catastrophe. Reduced to guerrilla resistance or rebuilding from ruins.

### Unique Mechanics

**Scale Navigation**
- Giants are 30-80 feet tall; party is 5-6 feet
- Ratio: 1:6 to 1:15 depending on giant
- Giants' objects are proportionally larger
- Climbing checks to navigate furniture, stairs, etc.
- Falling damage always maximum—everything is deadly height

**Giant Awareness**
- Giants have disadvantage on Perception checks against human-sized beings (too small)
- Party can hide easily but creating distractions is hard (too quiet)
- Giant casual movements = environmental hazards (Dexterity saves)

**Weather as Weapon**
- Giants control weather magically
- Lightning strikes as artillery
- Fog as concealment (both ways)
- Wind as forced movement
- Rain as difficult terrain (for party—droplets are basketball-sized)

**Giant Social Encounters**
- Communication at range (party might need to shout)
- Giants speak slowly from party perspective (time dilation)
- Miscommunication risks—cultural differences and scale-based confusion
- Giants can't easily shake hands, make facial expressions visible to party, etc.

**Logistics**
- Food: Giant-scale rations last party weeks
- Time: Crossing giant room takes hours
- Equipment: Rope lengths irrelevant at giant scale
- Gravity: Same, but falls always fatal
- Magic: Works normally but giant targets require consideration of scale

**Political Influence**
- Reputation tracker: Human side, Giant side (independent)
- Actions affect factional support
- Can be hero to one side, villain to other
- Ending depends on accumulated influence

**The Separation Magic**
- Lingering effects: Memory blocks about shared history
- Finding evidence requires specific searches
- Breaking conditioning is difficult (Wisdom saves)
- Learning truth is traumatic for NPCs

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Giants Are Refugees** (Early)
Giants aren't invaders—they're descendants of genocide survivors. Their "heaven" was escape from extinction.

**Twist 2: Jack Was Villain** (Mid-Act I)
The original climber wasn't hero—he murdered a giant and stole family treasures. Fairy tale was human propaganda.

**Twist 3: The Sky Is Falling** (Mid-Act II)
Cloud Kingdoms are literally descending. This isn't theoretical future problem—it's decades away. Giants face extinction again.

**Twist 4: Humans Started It** (Act III)
Historical evidence shows humans attempted genocide first, using poison/magic. Giants' retaliation was defensive.

**Twist 5: But Giants Went Too Far** (Act III)
Giants didn't just defend—they tried to eradicate humans entirely. Both sides are guilty of attempted genocide.

**Twist 6: The Beanstalk Is Alive** (Mid-Campaign)
It's not plant—it's transformed druid. Sentient. Suffering. Keeping spell active through its own existence is torture.

**Twist 7: No Reunion Without Death** (Late Campaign)
Coexistence requires sacrifice—giant must become living pillar, or party member must bind their life to spell maintenance.

**Twist 8: Third Option Hidden** (Secret)
Ancient artifact exists that could expand cloud magic to cover mortal world too—everyone lives above. But retrieving it requires mortal-giant cooperation (impossible without trust).

**Twist 9: Children Are Key** (Throughout)
Giant children and human children get along immediately. Adults carry historical baggage. Youth might save both species.

**Twist 10: The Separation Is Breaking Everywhere** (Late Game)
Other beanstalks growing globally. This isn't isolated. World will change regardless of party choices—only question is how.

### Victory Conditions

**Path of Unity (Coexistence)**
- Broker lasting peace treaty
- Establish shared territories or vertical cities (giants in highlands, humans in lowlands)
- Prevent extremists from sabotaging
- Find magical solution to falling clouds
- Outcome: Difficult but hopeful integration begins

**Path of Separation (Reinforcement)**
- Convince druid to maintain spell
- Destroy beanstalk permanently
- Re-seal cloudline
- Accept both species will never meet again
- Outcome: Safe but isolated, wonder lost

**Path of Conquest (Giant Victory)**
- Ally with giant warmongers
- Help giants conquer mortal world
- Humans subjugated but under "benevolent" rule
- Party becomes giant-allied governors
- Outcome: Peace through submission

**Path of Slaying (Human Victory)**
- Ally with giant-slayers
- Kill enough giants to force surrender
- Claim Cloud Kingdoms for humanity
- Colonize sky world
- Outcome: Empire built on corpses

**Path of Compromise (Partial Descent)**
- Giants settle in remote regions (mountains, tundra)
- Limited contact, trade only
- Mutual non-aggression pact
- Refugee giants allowed, others stay above
- Outcome: Tension remains but war avoided

### Defeat Conditions

**Mutual Genocide**
- Failed to stop war
- Both sides suffer catastrophic losses
- Campaign continues in post-apocalyptic mode
- Party tries to rebuild from ruins

**Giant Invasion Success**
- Giants conquer, party opposed them
- Resistance campaign or guerrilla warfare mode
- Dark ending: humanity enslaved

**Cloud Kingdom Falls**
- Failed to solve cloud descent
- Entire giant civilization crashes into world
- Environmental catastrophe
- Survival/rescue campaign

**The Separation Kills Both**
- Reinforcing spell goes wrong
- Beanstalk explodes or druid dies
- Dimensional collapse zones appear
- Party must prevent total reality breakdown

### Campaign Themes Summary

**Above the Cloudline** is about **perspective, coexistence, and challenging narratives**. The fairy tale told one story—heroes vs. monsters—but reality is complex. Giants are people. Humans are flawed. Neither is purely victim or villain.

Scale creates constant gameplay challenges: environmental navigation, creative problem-solving, understanding that "normal" is relative. Combat isn't straightforward—how do you fight someone 50 feet tall? Diplomacy is complicated when shouting from their ankle.

Morally, the campaign asks: Can peoples with violent shared history coexist? Is separation safer even if sadder? When resources are limited (land, sky), how do you share? The campaign has no perfect answers—only choices with consequences.

This is **Jack and the Beanstalk as complex political fantasy**: wonder and danger, fairy-tale aesthetics with grown-up themes, vertical exploration meets diplomatic intrigue.
