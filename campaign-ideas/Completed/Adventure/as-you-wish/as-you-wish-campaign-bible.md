# Campaign Bible: As You Wish

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Storyteller
Before anything was, there was the **Cosmic Storyteller**, a being of infinite imagination. It spoke the universe into existence, not with words, but with desires. Every star, every planet, every creature was a wish made manifest. But the Storyteller was fickle, and its wishes often contradicted each other, leading to paradoxes and inconsistencies. To bring order, it created the **Grand Narrative**, a set of rules and tropes that governed reality. The world is not a planet; it is a stage, and all its inhabitants are characters in an unfolding drama. The "Wish-Weavers" are not mages; they are the Storyteller's forgotten children, capable of bending the Grand Narrative itself. The conflict arises because the Storyteller has grown bored, and its attention is drifting, causing the Grand Narrative to fray, and wishes to run wild.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Wish):** The Cosmic Storyteller speaks the universe into existence.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Grand Narrative):** The Storyteller, bored with chaos, imposes rules on reality. Tropes become laws.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Wish-Weavers):** Mortals discover they can tap into the Storyteller's power, becoming the first Wish-Weavers.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Contradiction):** A Wish-Weaver wishes for "eternal peace," while another wishes for "eternal conflict." Reality splits into two parallel timelines for a century.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Plot Hole Plague):** The Storyteller's attention wavers, causing "plot holes" to appear in reality. People forget their names, objects vanish, and logic breaks down.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Hero's Journey Protocol):** The Storyteller, in an attempt to re-engage, creates a universal "Hero's Journey" template, forcing certain individuals into archetypal roles.
7.  **-500 Y (The Deus Ex Machina Incident):** A Wish-Weaver, cornered by a dragon, wishes for a "divine intervention." A giant, mechanical hand descends from the sky, crushes the dragon, and then accidentally crushes the Wish-Weaver.
8.  **-100 Y (The Fourth Wall Breach):** A particularly powerful Wish-Weaver, frustrated with their role, wishes to "speak to the manager." They briefly glimpse the Cosmic Storyteller, driving them mad.
9.  **-10 Y (The Unreliable Narrator):** The Storyteller's attention drifts further. The Grand Narrative becomes unreliable. History changes daily.
10. **Present Day:** The party is caught in a "narrative loop." They are forced to repeat the same "meet in a tavern, get a quest" scenario every day, with minor variations. They are the only ones who remember the previous loops.

### The "Why": The Tyranny of the Narrative
The conflict is not about good versus evil; it is about **Agency versus Archetype**. The Grand Narrative, once a tool for order, has become a prison. Mortals are forced into roles, their lives dictated by tropes and plot points. The Storyteller's boredom is causing the Narrative to become self-aware and tyrannical, forcing characters to play out increasingly absurd and repetitive scenarios. The party's struggle is to break free from their predetermined roles, to write their own story, and to reclaim their free will from a universe that sees them as mere characters.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Narrative Cohesion
*   **Cohesion Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the Grand Narrative. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Cohesion:** Following tropes, resolving plot points, making narratively satisfying choices.
*   **Losing Cohesion:** Breaking tropes, creating plot holes, making illogical or unexpected choices.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Cohesion:* Reality is stable, predictable. GNEA agents are less active.
    *   *Low Cohesion:* Reality is unstable, unpredictable. Plot holes appear, Narrative Golems spawn.
    *   *0 Cohesion:* The Narrative collapses, leading to a chaotic, nonsensical reality.

### Subsystem: Archetype Points
*   **Archetype Points:** Players earn Archetype Points by leaning into specific archetypes (e.g., "Hero," "Rogue," "Mentor").
*   **Spending Points:** These points can be spent to gain temporary abilities associated with that archetype (e.g., a "Hero" can spend a point to gain advantage on a saving throw against fear).
*   **Breaking Archetype:** Players can choose to defy their archetype, but doing so costs Archetype Points and may lead to a loss of Narrative Cohesion.
