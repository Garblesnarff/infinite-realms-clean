# Campaign Bible: Impossible Heist Protocol

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Locksmith
Before the universe was, there was the **Cosmic Vault**, holding the blueprints of reality. The **Cosmic Locksmith**, a being of infinite precision, crafted the intricate mechanisms that governed existence: gravity, time, magic, and consciousness. But the Locksmith, in its pursuit of perfect security, also created the **Impossible Protocol**, a failsafe that would lock away reality itself if its fundamental laws were ever breached. The world is not a planet; it is a series of nested vaults, each layer protected by increasingly complex protocols. "Heists" are not just thefts; they are attempts to understand and manipulate these cosmic mechanisms. The "Impossible Heist Protocol" is not a mission; it is the ultimate challenge, a test of whether free will can truly exist within a perfectly secured universe, or if all actions are merely predetermined tumblers in the Locksmith's grand design.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Cosmic Vault):** The Cosmic Locksmith creates the universe as a series of nested vaults, protected by the Impossible Protocol.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Breach):** A rogue entity, later known as **The Glitch**, accidentally breaches a minor protocol, causing a localized reality distortion.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Protocol Enforcers):** The Cosmic Locksmith deploys "Protocol Enforcers," beings designed to maintain the integrity of the Impossible Protocol.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Great Lockout):** A major protocol breach causes a continent to be temporarily "locked out" of reality, vanishing for a century.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Master Key Fragment):** A fragment of the Cosmic Locksmith's Master Key is discovered, hinting at a way to bypass the Impossible Protocol.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Heist Guilds):** Mortals, fascinated by the intricate mechanisms of reality, form "Heist Guilds" dedicated to understanding and breaching protocols.
7.  **-500 Y (The Time-Lock Heist):** A legendary crew attempts to steal a "time-lock" artifact, but the heist goes catastrophically wrong, trapping them in a temporal loop.
8.  **-100 Y (The Director's Protocol):** Director Corvus, a former Protocol Enforcer, establishes a rogue agency dedicated to using heist techniques to "fix" reality's glitches.
9.  **-10 Y (The Raven's Betrayal):** The Raven, a top agent under Director Corvus, betrays the agency, stealing a vital piece of the Master Key.
10. **Present Day:** Reality is unraveling due to increasing protocol breaches. Director Corvus assembles a new, elite crew (the party) for an impossible heist: to retrieve the Master Key fragment from The Raven and prevent the ultimate lockout.

### The "Why": The Illusion of Control
The central conflict is the struggle between **Control and Chaos**. The Cosmic Locksmith designed a perfect, controlled universe, but The Glitch and its agents (like The Raven) seek to introduce chaos, to prove that no system is truly impenetrable. The Impossible Protocol is the ultimate expression of this control, threatening to erase all who deviate. The party's struggle is to navigate this intricate dance between order and disorder, to master the art of breaching protocols without causing a catastrophic lockout, and to decide whether to restore the Locksmith's perfect order or to embrace the beautiful chaos of a truly free universe.
