### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Spire Ascendant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party ascends the Spire—a reality-warping tower that tests climbers through card-based combat. Each run is unique: choose paths, build decks from discovered cards, adapt strategies based on random offerings. Death returns you to the base, but knowledge persists. Through mastering deck-building synergies, risk management, and strategic thinking, reach the summit and defeat the corrupt Heart at the Spire's core. The challenge is eternal—roguelike mastery is the goal.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Spire's origin—why it exists, who built it, what purpose it serves.
    *   Write the history of climbers before the party—have any succeeded?
    *   Describe the three character origins: Ironclad (corrupted warrior), Silent (assassin seeking redemption), Defect (escaped construct).
    *   Explain the Heart—is it the Spire's creator, or its corruption?
    *   Detail why the Spire tests climbers—is it trial, punishment, or selection?
    *   Describe Neow's role—who is the whale spirit, and why does she help?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Climbers** (Major): Ironclad, Silent, Defect, and presumably others attempting ascension.
    *   **The Spire's Guardians** (Major): Enemies, elites, and bosses defending each floor.
    *   **The Merchants** (Minor): Mysterious vendors throughout the Spire offering goods and services.
    *   **The Heart's Corruption** (Minor): The malevolent force at the Spire's core.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Neow (whale spirit), The Merchant (shopkeeper), The Heart (final boss), Act bosses (Hexaghost, Slime Boss, Guardian, etc.).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Elite Enemy" (Lagavulin, Gremlin Nob, etc.), "Common Enemy" (Jaw Worm, Cultist, etc.), "Event Character" (Sensory Stone, The Mausoleum, etc.).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Base Camp:** Starting point where characters prepare for ascent, contains Neow.
*   **Act I — The Exordium:** Floors 1-17, lower Spire, basic enemies and first bosses.
*   **Act II — The City:** Floors 18-34, urban decay, harder enemies and Act II bosses.
*   **Act III — The Beyond:** Floors 35-51, reality distortion, toughest enemies and Act III bosses.
*   **Act IV — The Heart Chamber:** Optional true ending, requires three keys, faces The Heart.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party defeats Act boss → **THEN:** Gain boss relic, advance to next act, difficulty escalates.
*   **IF:** Party dies → **THEN:** Return to base, lose all progress except knowledge and unlocks.
*   **IF:** Elite defeated → **THEN:** Gain random rare relic, significant power spike but high risk.
*   **IF:** Card removed at shop → **THEN:** Deck becomes more focused and consistent.
*   **IF:** Three keys collected during run → **THEN:** Act IV unlocks, can face The Heart.
*   **IF:** The Heart defeated → **THEN:** True victory achieved, highest mastery demonstrated.

**7. Deck-Building Philosophy**
*   Success requires focused strategy, not collection of "good cards."
*   Synergy is more valuable than individual power.
*   Removing bad cards is as important as adding good ones.
*   Adaptation to random offerings separates masters from novices.
*   Different strategies counter different bosses—no universal deck.

**8. Roguelike Mastery Loop**
*   Each run is lesson in strategy—failure teaches as much as success.
*   Knowledge of enemy patterns, card synergies, and event outcomes persists.
*   Meta-progression through understanding, not just unlocks.
*   Ascension levels provide endless challenge for those seeking perfection.
*   The journey (deck-building process) is as rewarding as destination (victory).
