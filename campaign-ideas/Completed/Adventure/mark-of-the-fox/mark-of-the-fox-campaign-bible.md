# Mark of the Fox: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The Fox is not a person. It is a story. A sentient, self-replicating narrative that spontaneously generates in societies suffering under extreme oppression. It is a living meme of rebellion, a "story-spirit" that seeks a host to become its protagonist. The "Mark of the Fox," a swirling, nine-tailed brand, is the physical sign of this memetic infection. The host does not gain superpowers in the traditional sense; instead, they become subject to "narrative causality." They can perform incredible feats of acrobatics, swordplay, and wit not because they are strong, but because it would make for a better story. They are impossibly lucky, surviving certain death because a hero's demise should be dramatic and meaningful, not random. The Fox meme's goal is not merely to liberate the people, but to craft the most thrilling, dramatic, and enduring tale of rebellion possible. It actively shapes events around its host to maximize narrative tension, introducing witty rivals, dramatic betrayals, and hair's-breadth escapes. The current host, an aging hero known as "El Zorro," is becoming too predictable. His story is growing stale. The Fox meme is becoming restless, and it is actively "auditioning" new protagonists—individuals with flair, passion, and a knack for drama—to become the hero of its next great story.

### Timeline
1.  **The Age of Whispers (Ancient History):** The Fox meme first appears in a primordial, tyrannical empire, "infecting" a slave who overthrows a god-king through cunning and wit. The story is passed down orally for generations.
2.  **The First Mark (c. -3,000 years):** The story becomes so potent it achieves true sentience. The first "Mark of the Fox" appears on a poet who leads a rebellion against a silent, emotionless regime.
3.  **The Era of a Hundred Foxes (c. -2,900 to -500 years):** The meme spreads. At any given time, dozens of "Foxes" exist in different oppressed nations across the world, each with their own unique style and story.
4.  **(Surreal) The Day the Statues Wept (c. -400 years):** In the city-state of Aleria, the tyrannical "Architects of Law" are about to execute the current Fox. At dawn, every statue in the city weeps tears of blood, turning the streets into red rivers and allowing the Fox to escape in the ensuing panic.
5.  **The Rise of the Grey Directorate (c. -100 years):** A new form of tyranny emerges: a bureaucratic, corporatist regime that seeks to stamp out not just freedom, but individuality and narrative itself. They see stories as "inefficient variables."
6.  **The Great Silencing (c. -90 to -50 years):** The Grey Directorate successfully hunts and "erases" every active Fox in the world, save one. They burn libraries, outlaw fiction, and punish public displays of emotion.
7.  **The Last Fox, El Zorro (c. -40 years to present):** In the oppressed nation of Alta California, a nobleman named Diego de la Vega is "infected" by the last active Fox meme. He becomes El Zorro, a swashbuckling hero who fights the Directorate's local governor.
8.  **(Surreal) The Festival of Stolen Faces (c. -10 years):** For one week, no one in the capital city can recognize anyone else, even their own family. Faces seem to shift and blur. This is the Fox meme, bored with El Zorro's aging story, beginning to "audition" new protagonists by seeing how people act when they are anonymous.
9.  **The Fading of the Mark (c. -1 year):** El Zorro's "Mark of the Fox" begins to fade. His luck is running out, his wit is not as sharp. The story needs a new hero, and the meme's search becomes desperate.
10. **(Surreal) The Ink-Tide (c. -1 week):** All the ink in the Grey Directorate's central bureaucracy spontaneously liquefies and flows out of the building in a great, black tide, spelling out the first sentence of a new story: "No one expected the hero to be..."

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a war between Story and Data. The Grey Directorate believes that reality is a system to be optimized. They seek to eliminate all "unnecessary" variables: emotion, hope, heroism, love, and, most importantly, stories. They want a world of pure, predictable data. The Fox is the literal antithesis of this: a being of pure narrative, which thrives on unpredictability, drama, and meaning. The players are not just fighting a corrupt government; they are fighting for the right of reality to be interesting. They are potential authors of the next chapter of the world's story, and their every action is a word on the page. The central question is not "Can we win?" but "Can we tell a story worth remembering?"

A massive, ancient library where every book has had its text magically erased.

*   **The Secret Auditorium:** A hidden theatre where the "real" performances happen: biting political satires and illegal works of fiction. **Smell:** Cheap wine, unwashed bodies, and rebellion. **Sound:** Hushed whispers, sudden gasps, and explosive, quickly-suppressed laughter.
*   **The Critic's Box:** A private box overlooking the stage, where The Critic sits every night, passing judgment. **Smell:** Stale wine and superiority. **Sound:** The scratching of The Critic's pen, his nasal, critical sighs.

### The Margins
A "place" that is not a place, a conceptual space that exists in the gaps of reality. Home of the Society of Forgotten Characters.
*   **The Alley of Lost Footnotes:** An alleyway that seems to exist between any two other streets. **Smell:** Damp brick, and the faint scent of something you can't quite remember. **Sound:** A muffled conversation from a nearby room that you can never quite make out.
*   **The Un-Remembered Room:** A room that you can only find when you are not looking for it. **Smell:** Dust, and the absence of memories. **Sound:** The sound of your own breathing, which seems unnaturally loud.
*   **The Cafe of Deus Ex Machina:** A small cafe where characters who were saved by a sudden plot twist wait for their next story. **Smell:** Stale coffee and relief. **Sound:** The soft murmur of people telling unbelievable stories.
*   **The Library of Redacted Files:** A library filled with the Grey Directorate's "redacted" files. The books are full of blacked-out lines. **Smell:** Ink, and the sharp scent of censorship. **Sound:** The rustle of pages, the whisper of secrets.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Rapier of Narrative Causality
**Type:** Legendary Rapier
**Description:** The traditional weapon of the Fox. A simple, elegant rapier that seems to hum with potential.
**Mechanics:** This is a +3 rapier. While wielded by the current host of the Fox meme, it has the "Rule of Cool" property. Once per combat, the wielder can describe a swashbuckling, improbable, but "cool" action (e.g., "I swing on the chandelier and land on the balcony behind the guards"). If the DM agrees that it is cool, the action succeeds automatically. The sword also allows the wielder to use their Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls, instead of Strength or Dexterity.

### 2. The Mask of a Thousand Faces
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A simple, black domino mask. When worn by the Fox, it is impossible to recognize them, even for their closest family.
**Mechanics:** The mask grants the wearer a "narrative identity." They cannot be magically identified. Anyone looking at them sees not their true face, but the "idea" of the Fox. Furthermore, the wearer can perfectly replicate the voice and mannerisms of any person they have heard speak for at least a minute.

### 3. The Ink of Oblivion
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A small, unassuming bottle of black ink, held by the Archivist of the Un-Narrators.
**Mechanics:** This is not an item for the players to use, but to fear. If a creature's true name is written with this ink, that creature is erased from existence. All memories, records, and evidence of them vanish. If used on an object or place, it too is erased. Using the ink consumes the writer, erasing them as well. It is the ultimate narrative weapon.

### 4. The Play That Must Go On
**Type:** Wondrous Item (Scroll)
**Description:** The master script for the Theatre of the Real's most ambitious play. It is chaotic, messy, and brilliant.
**Mechanics:** If the script is read aloud on a stage, it begins to come true. The events described in the play begin to happen in the real world, in a localized area. The play is, of course, a dramatic, chaotic, and ultimately triumphant story of rebellion. Using it is a massive gamble that will plunge the city into chaos but will always, in the end, result in a "heroic victory," though the definition of "victory" is up to the play's author, Masque.

### 5. The Director's First Draft
**Type:** Artifact (Book)
**Description:** A small, leather-bound journal, containing the story of the first Fox, written in his own hand before he became The Director.
**Mechanics:** A creature reading the book learns the Director's true name and his original motivations. If the book is read aloud to the Director, it forces him to remember who he was. He must make a high DC Wisdom save. On a failure, he is "redeemed," his personality reverting to that of the heroic first Fox. On a success, he is so horrified by his past self that he becomes even more fanatically devoted to his cause.

## [TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
1.  **A Self-Writing Quill:** A quill that writes on its own, but it only writes scathing, negative reviews of everything.
2.  **The Amulet of Witty Banter:** An amulet that, once per day, will whisper a perfect, witty retort into your ear, but only about 10 minutes after you needed it.
3.  **A Wanted Poster for a Fictional Character:** A perfectly detailed wanted poster for a hero from a banned book.
4.  **The Grappling Hook of Inconvenience:** A grappling hook that will always hook onto the most dramatic, but least convenient, object possible.
5.  **A Mask That Looks Exactly Like Your Own Face:** A well-made mask that is a perfect replica of your own face. It's slightly unsettling.
6.  **The Boot-Strap Paradox:** A single boot strap. If you pull on it, you are lifted one inch off the ground for one second.
7.  **A Bottle of "Plot-Armor":** A potion that, when drunk, makes the next attack against you miss in a dramatic, unbelievable way.
8.  **The Chekhov's Gun:** A small, ornate, single-shot pistol. The DM must ensure that if the players acquire it, it absolutely *must* be used to resolve a major plot point later.
9.  **A Bag of Red Herrings:** A bag that contains several, literal, red herring fish. They are very smelly.
10. **The Deus Ex Machina:** A small, clockwork box. Once, when the situation is absolutely hopeless, you can open the box. A small, clockwork god will emerge, solve one minor, immediate problem, and then break.
11. **The Fourth-Wall-Breaking Hammer:** A small hammer that, when you use it to knock on a wall, allows you to speak directly to the DM for 10 seconds.
12. **The Narrator's Spectacles:** A pair of glasses that allows you to read the "internal monologue" of one person for one minute.
13. **The MacGuffin:** A strange, glowing, and intricately-carved object. It does nothing. Absolutely nothing. But everyone *thinks* it's incredibly important, and will try to steal it from you.
14. **The Foreshadowing Mirror:** A small hand-mirror that, instead of your reflection, shows a brief, cryptic, and ominous image of a future event.
15. **The Training Montage Whistle:** A whistle that, when blown, causes a 1-minute, inspiring training montage to occur, complete with heroic music. At the end of it, you gain one temporary hit point.
16. **The Anti-Climax Horn:** A horn that, when blown, causes the most dramatic moment in a scene to end abruptly and awkwardly.
17. **A Single, Unsubtle Metaphor:** A small, lead weight with the word "Burdens" carved on it.
18. **The Flashback Potion:** A potion that, when drunk, causes you to vividly re-live a memory from your past. You are useless for 1d4 rounds as you stare off into space.
19. **The Side-Character's Shield:** A shield that offers great protection, but makes you feel strangely unimportant and peripheral to the main story.
20. **A Pen That Is Mightier Than The Sword:** A pen that, when used as an improvised weapon, deals 1d4 psychic damage because the pen is, indeed, mightier than the sword.

### 7. Sentient Metaphor

**Abilities:**
*   **Passive: Heavy-Handed:** The area around the metaphor is difficult terrain, as the very air becomes thick with meaning.

## [TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
### Physics/Magic: The Law of Narrative
In this world, reality is subservient to the needs of a good story. This is a tangible, mechanical force.
*   **Rule of Cool:** As described in the Rapier's entry, a player can attempt an action that is physically impossible but "cool." If the DM agrees, the action succeeds. This is a core mechanic for the Fox host, but any player can attempt it by spending inspiration.
*   **Plot Armor:** The main protagonists of the story (the players) have "plot armor." This manifests as a pool of d6s, called "Story Points," equal to their level. They can spend a point to add a d6 to any roll. They regain all points when they do something particularly dramatic, heroic, or in-character.
*   **Foreshadowing:** The DM is encouraged to "foreshadow" future events. If a player correctly identifies a piece of foreshadowing ("Aha! The one-armed man from the tavern must be the assassin you mentioned three sessions ago!"), they gain inspiration.

### Subsystems: Panache and Infamy
*   **Panache:** This is a group score. The party gains Panache by performing heroic deeds *with style*. Liberating a prison is good. Liberating a prison while leaving your calling card, kissing the governor's daughter, and escaping on a stolen horse is better. High Panache inspires the common people, creating allies and opportunities. Low Panache makes the story "boring," which is the worst possible fate. A boring story will not attract the Fox meme's attention.
*   **Infamy:** This is the party's score with the Grey Directorate. It increases with every act of rebellion. High Infamy means more, and more elite, enemies are sent after you. Inquisitor Valerius will not be dispatched for a simple tavern brawl. He will be dispatched for a hero who has embarrassed the Governor and inspired a rebellion.
