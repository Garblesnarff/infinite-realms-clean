### **World-Building Specification Brief: Ghost Who Walks**

**1. Core Concept:**
Party discovers or joins legendary Phantom—a 400-year lineage of jungle guardians—protecting indigenous peoples from pirates, slavers, and tyrants while maintaining the immortality legend through the mark of the skull and secrets of the Skull Cave.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the origin of the Phantom legacy—first Phantom's oath after pirates killed his father
*   Explain how the secret is kept—each generation looks similar, Bandar never speak of truth
*   Describe the Skull Cave's accumulation over 400 years—treasures, chronicles, artifacts
*   Write about the Bandar Pygmy tribe and their role as guardians
*   Detail Bangalla's history—colonization, independence, current political situation
*   Explain the Singh Brotherhood and their multi-generational conflict with Phantoms

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Phantom Legacy** (Major) - Single hero supported by tradition and legend
*   **The Bandar People** (Major) - Pygmy tribe, guardians of Skull Cave, keepers of secret
*   **Bangalla Government** (Major) - Post-colonial nation, ally but doesn't know secret
*   **The Singh Brotherhood** (Major) - Ancient pirate confederation, marked by tattoos
*   **Indigenous Tribes** (Minor) - Various peoples protected by the Phantom
*   **Colonial Remnants** (Minor) - Those seeking to re-establish exploitation
*   **The Jungle Patrol** (Minor) - Police/military force, sometimes allies

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** The Phantom (21st), Diana Palmer, Guran, President Luaga, General Bababu, Singh Brotherhood Leader, Devil the Wolf
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Pirate Captain," "Bandar Warrior," "Palace Guard," "Jungle Patrol Officer," "Tribal Elder," "Singh Assassin," "Colonial Exploiter," "Village Chief"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Skull Cave** - Ancient cavern, treasure chambers, chronicle library, throne room

*   **Eden** - Phantom's home when in civilian identity
*   **Colonial Outpost** - Remnants of old exploitation system

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Phantom's identity revealed THEN immortality legend shattered, tribes lose faith
*   IF Skull Cave discovered by criminals THEN 400 years of treasures at risk
*   IF current Phantom dies without heir THEN legacy ends unless someone assumes mantle
*   IF Singh Brotherhood destroyed THEN piracy reduced but new threats emerge
*   IF Bandar tribe betrayed THEN Phantom loses support network
*   IF oath sworn by skull of father THEN bound by honor to fulfill it

**7. MacGuffins & Artifacts:**
