## Central Conflict

Legacy versus individuality, tradition versus progress. Each Phantom must balance personal desires against the oath sworn by their ancestor. The jungle natives believe the Phantom is immortal—revealing the truth could shatter their faith and leave them vulnerable. Colonial and post-colonial tensions create complex politics—the Phantom defends indigenous people against exploitation but must navigate changing world. The question: can one person (or one legacy) still make a difference in modern age?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Ghost's Reputation**

### 3. **The Skull Mark**

*   Access to chronicles of 20 previous Phantoms. Can research past adventures for clues to current problems.

### 5. **The Oath of the Skull**
*   When swearing oath "I swear by the skull of my father," gain temporary resolve and inspiration.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Adventure pulp with strong themes of legacy and justice. The jungle is vibrant and alive—dangerous but beautiful. Indigenous peoples are portrayed with respect and agency. Colonial exploitation is clearly villainous. The Phantom represents unchanging justice in changing world. Combat is action-adventure, not graphic. The immortality legend creates mystique. Romance between Phantom and Diana adds human element. Pirates are theatrical villains. The weight of 400 years of history creates gravitas. Honor and oath-keeping matter deeply.
