## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act journey from zero to championship challengers.

*   **Act I — Building the Team (Sessions 1-7):** The protagonist is tricked into joining Deimon High's nonexistent football team by the devilish strategist Hiruma. Hiding their identity behind an eyeshield mask, they must help recruit players from school misfits—a catcher with golden hands, a shy lineman with hidden strength, a rhythmic running back. Through practice games and scrimmages, they learn football basics and develop their signature "Lightning speed" running style. First tournament tests whether rookies can compete.
*   **Act II — The Road to Christmas Bowl (Sessions 8-13):** Having proven they're not a joke team, Deimon enters the Tokyo tournament facing schools with established programs. They face teams with overwhelming size, genius quarterbacks, unbreakable defenses, and must innovate tactics to overcome superior opponents. Each victory comes through teamwork and Hiruma's devilish strategies. Protagonist's secret identity creates tension as rivals try to unmask Eyeshield 21.
*   **Act III — The Christmas Bowl (Sessions 14-20):** The national championship tournament brings together Japan's strongest teams. They face Shinryuji Naga—the undefeated champions with the God-Speed Impulse runner. In the ultimate match, every player's specialized skill must combine perfectly. The protagonist must reveal that strength comes from the team supporting them, not just individual speed. Win or lose, they've proven rookies can achieve the impossible.
