# Campaign Bible: Court of Redemption

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Shattered Mirror
In the beginning, the **Cosmic Mirror** reflected all of existence, showing every being their true self, their potential for both light and shadow. But as mortals grew, so did their capacity for self-deception. They began to lie to their reflections, twisting their images until the Mirror, overwhelmed by falsehoods, shattered into countless shards. Each shard became a soul, carrying within it the fractured truth of its origin. The world is not a planet; it is a vast, cosmic therapy session, a stage where these shattered souls attempt to piece themselves back together. The "Court of Redemption" is not a place of judgment; it is a fragment of the Cosmic Mirror, still reflecting, still seeking to show beings their true selves, but now it reflects not what *is*, but what *could be*.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Great Reflection):** The Cosmic Mirror reflects all of existence, showing true selves.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Lie):** A mortal lies to their reflection, causing a tiny crack in the Mirror.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Shattering):** The Mirror, overwhelmed by falsehoods, shatters into countless soul-shards.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Age of Masks):** Mortals, unable to face their fractured selves, begin to wear literal and metaphorical masks, hiding their true natures.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Court of Redemption):** A powerful Wish-Weaver, seeking to heal the world, gathers fragments of the Mirror and establishes the Court of Redemption, a place where souls can seek to mend themselves.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Trial of Shadows):** A powerful demon, seeking to corrupt the Court, undergoes a "Trial of Shadows," attempting to prove its capacity for good. It fails, but leaves a lingering darkness.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Chamber Plague):** A magical plague causes all reflections to speak the deepest, darkest secrets of their owners, leading to widespread paranoia and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Broken Oath):** A champion of the Court, undergoing a Trial of Redemption, breaks their oath, causing a massive fragment of the Mirror to crack, weakening the Court's power.
9.  **-10 Y (The Whispering Reflections):** Reflections in ordinary mirrors begin to whisper temptations and doubts, subtly influencing mortals towards their darker impulses.
10. **Present Day:** The Court of Redemption is in crisis. A powerful entity, the **Lord of Lies**, has infiltrated the Court, seeking to shatter the remaining fragments of the Mirror and plunge the world into eternal self-deception. The party, each with their own fractured past, is drawn to the Court, seeking their own redemption.

### The "Why": The Illusion of Self
The central conflict is the struggle between **Truth and Deception**. The world is filled with beings who have lost their way, who have embraced their masks and forgotten their true selves. The Court of Redemption offers a path back to truth, a chance to mend the shattered soul. But the Lord of Lies seeks to destroy this hope, to convince all beings that their masks *are* their true faces, that redemption is a lie, and that self-deception is the only path to power. The party's struggle is not just to save the Court, but to confront their own inner demons, to face their own reflections, and to decide whether they are truly capable of redemption.

### Subsystem: Reflection Combat
