# Yard Sale Apocalypse
## "Saturday morning. Front lawn. The end of everything we know."

### Campaign Overview
The Henderson family is moving across the country, and they're not taking everything. The yard sale is in 72 hours. For the toys of the Henderson household, this is the apocalypse—an extinction event that will scatter their community to the winds, separate bonded pairs, and send beloved companions to strangers' homes or worse, the trash. Price tags are death sentences measured in quarters.

Players are toys desperately trying to survive the sale. Some seek to make themselves essential (hide, make child remember them), others plan escape (flee before sale begins), still others embrace new futures (hoping for better homes). But the campaign's dark heart reveals itself when toys discover THE COLLECTOR—a wealthy toy collector who buys vintage toys at yard sales, seals them in plastic cases forever. Preserved. Pristine. Never played with again. Is this salvation or a fate worse than the trash?

The countdown to Saturday creates pressure. Factions form: The Loyalists (trying to stay with family), The Escapists (planning to run), The Hopefuls (preparing for new homes), and The Nihilists (accepting oblivion). As toys are priced and sorted, relationships are tested, sacrifices made, and the fundamental question asked: Is it better to be remembered by one child or discovered by another?

### Core Themes
- **Disposability**: Being reduced to monetary value
- **Separation**: Bonds severed by circumstance
- **Change vs. Loss**: New beginning or ending?
