- Archives, ruins, technology throughout galaxy

### Technology Legacy
- Beacons: Information dumps, visions
- Data caches: History and warnings
- Experimental weapons
- Genetic manipulation projects

### Extinction Event
- Reapers harvested them
- Some survived in stasis (Javik, if included)
- Built Crucible plans (multi-cycle project)
- Left warnings in beacons

## The Reapers

### Nature
- Sentient starships, capital-ship scale

- Three endings: Destroy, Control, Synthesis
- Requires massive resources to build

### Operation
