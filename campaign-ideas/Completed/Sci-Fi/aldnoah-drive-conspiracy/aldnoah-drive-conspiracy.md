# Aldnoah Drive Conspiracy

*An Asymmetric Warfare / David vs Goliath Mecha campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Aldnoah Drive Conspiracy
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Asymmetric Warfare / Military Strategy / Class Warfare
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **13–15**
**Tone (keywords):** asymmetric warfare, tactical genius vs. overwhelming power, class divide, Martian nobility vs. Earth, exploiting weaknesses, revenge and justice
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are Earth soldiers piloting mass-production mecha when the Vers Empire (Martian nobility with advanced Aldnoah-powered superweapons) invades. Each Martian Kataphrakt has a unique, overpowered ability (gravity manipulation, molecular phasing, barriers), while Earth has only numbers and ingenuity. The campaign is about David vs. Goliath battles where the party must analyze enemy abilities, find their singular weakness, and exploit it through teamwork and tactics—all while uncovering the conspiracy behind the war.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Each enemy Kataphrakt is a puzzle boss—unbeatable by direct assault. Players must observe, deduce weaknesses, and execute precise plans.
*   **Investigation:** Uncover the truth—the Martian princess was assassinated by her own people to justify the invasion. The party must expose this to end the war.
*   **Consequences:** Failure means permadeath. Earth mechs are fragile. One mistake against overwhelming power ends characters. Victory requires perfect execution.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Princess Asseylum** — *The Peacemaker*
    *   **Role:** Martian princess who sought peace, nearly assassinated, becomes the party's ally.
    *   **Personality:** Idealistic, kind, sheltered from war's reality.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her naivety is exploited by her own people. Grants Aldnoah activation rights to the party.

    *   **Personality:** Idealistic but desperate, makes increasingly dark choices to protect the princess.

    *   **Personality:** Pragmatic, ruthless, lost family in previous war and seeks revenge on Earth.

4.  **Inaho Kaizuka** — *The Tactical Genius*
    *   **Role:** Earth soldier (party member or NPC ally), emotionless analyst who defeats Martians through pure logic.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, calculating, emotionally stunted, sees everything as a tactical problem.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Asymmetric Combat**

*   **Martian Kataphrakts:** Each has a unique overpowered ability (energy barriers, gravity manipulation, time dilation, molecular phasing, teleportation).
*   **Earth Mechs:** Generic, mass-production, fragile. Only advantages are numbers and tactics.
*   **Victory Conditions:** Rarely "defeat in combat." Usually "exploit weakness," "survive for X rounds," "destroy environment to neutralize ability."

### 2. **Weakness Analysis**

*   Each Kataphrakt has exactly one exploitable weakness derived from its power.
*   **Example:** Gravity-manipulating Kataphrakt has incredible force but can't affect plasma. Use energy weapons instead of kinetics.
*   Players must investigate (observation, research, interrogation) to discover weaknesses.

### 3. **Aldnoah Activation Factor**

*   Aldnoah tech only activates for Martian royalty or those granted permission.
*   **Narrative Mechanic:** If Asseylum grants the party Aldnoah rights, they can pilot captured Kataphrakts—but become targets for assassination.

### 4. **Permadeath Stakes**

*   Earth mechs are fragile. Failed tactics = character death.
*   Encourages cautious planning over reckless heroics.

## Key Locations

1.  **Earth (Post-Invasion):** Devastated cities, refugee camps, guerrilla hideouts. Humanity on the defensive.
2.  **Landing Castles:** Massive Martian orbital fortresses that crashed to Earth, serving as invasion bases.
3.  **Vers Empire (Mars):** Feudal society in orbiting castles above a dead planet—nobility rules, Terran slaves suffer.
4.  **The Princess's Ship:** Mobile base and refuge for Asseylum and the party.
5.  **Orbital Fortress:** The conspiracy's headquarters, final battle location.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is class warfare—Martian nobility with god-like technology vs. oppressed Earth masses. The party must overcome overwhelming power through intellect and solidarity. The deeper conflict is whether peace is possible between oppressors and oppressed, or if justice requires revenge.

---

## Themes

*   **Asymmetric Warfare:** Intelligence defeats power. The weak can win if they're smarter.
*   **Class Divide:** Martian nobles see Terrans as subhuman. Earth must prove their worth through ingenuity.
*   **Conspiracy and Truth:** The war is built on lies. Exposing truth can end it—or make things worse.
*   **Tragic Loyalty:** Slaine's devotion to Asseylum destroys him. Love without boundaries becomes obsession.
*   **David vs. Goliath:** Every battle is impossible odds. Victory feels earned, not given.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Expose the Conspiracy:** Reveal that Mars assassinated its own princess. Achieve peace through truth.
*   **Military Victory:** Destroy the Martian invasion force. Costly but decisive.
*   **Revolution:** Arm Terran slaves on Mars to overthrow the nobility. Risky, changes everything.
*   **Martyrdom:** Sacrifice the party to ensure Asseylum survives and creates peace. Heroic but final.

## Enemy Kataphrakt Examples

1.  **Nilokeras (Barrier):** Impenetrable energy shield. **Weakness:** Shield doesn't block slow-moving objects. Use melee or slow projectiles.
2.  **Argyre (Gravity):** Crushes anything with localized gravity wells. **Weakness:** Can't affect plasma. Use beam weapons.
3.  **Dioscuria (Duplication):** Creates physical copies of itself. **Weakness:** Copies share damage. Hit all simultaneously.
4.  **Sirenum (Phasing):** Becomes intangible at will. **Weakness:** Must solidify to attack. Strike during attack windows.
