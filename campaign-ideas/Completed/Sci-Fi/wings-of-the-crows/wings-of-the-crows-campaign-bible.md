## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### **The Origin Myth: The Severing of Gravity**
In the Era of Lead, the world was flat and heavy. Creatures crawled on their bellies, crushed by the jealous god **Gravitas**, who hoarded the sky. The first rebellion was not a war of swords, but a war of *leaping*. The Progenitor, a nameless entity composed of pure kinetic energy, challenged Gravitas to a game of "Keep Away." For ten thousand years, the Progenitor kept a sphere of condensed starlight from touching the ground.

Exhausted and furious, Gravitas swung his hammer, missing the Progenitor and shattering the earth into floating archipelagos. In that moment of distraction, the Progenitor spiked the star-sphere through Gravitas's chest, shattering his hold on physics. The Progenitor dissolved into the **Aether currents**, granting mortals the ability to momentarily defy gravity through will and momentum. Skyblade is not just a sport; it is a ritual reenactment of the liberation of the sky.

### **Cosmology: The Pantheons of Momentum**
1.  **The Golden Parabola:** The god of perfect aim and inevitable futures. Patron of Setters. Represented by a calculating eye.
2.  **The Hollow Lung:** The patron of stamina and oxygen. Depicted as a pair of silver bellows. Demands offerings of breath and sweat.
3.  **The Silent Aegis:** A minor deity of blockage and denial. Patron of blockers. It appears as a sudden, solid wall of force.
4.  **The Floor-Kisser:** The humble god of receiving and recovery. Worshipped by Liberos. Its avatars are scars and bruises.
5.  **The Six-Strand Knot:** The chaotic entity of team infighting and miscommunication. Must be appeased before every match to prevent collisions.

### **The Historical Timeline (20 Events)**
1.  **The First Spike (Year 0):** The Progenitor shatters Gravitas. Gravity becomes a suggestion rather than a law.
2.  **The Invention of the Pulse-Core (Year 45):** Alchemists trap a storm elemental in leather, creating the first self-propelling ball.
3.  **The Great Grounding (Year 102):** A plague of "Heavy Feet" curses the populace; jumping becomes illegal for a decade.
4.  **Founding of The Ravens (Year 150):** Established by the "Black Wing Magus" in a scrapyard behind a wizard tower.
5.  **The Net War (Year 200):** A conflict over the height of the magical net. 4,000 mages die arguing over 2 inches.
6.  **The Miracle of the Chronos Set (Year 330):** A setter moves faster than time, aging 50 years in one match to win the cup.
7.  **The Year of No Winners (Year 400):** A dragon ate the championship trophy.
8.  **The Tiny Titan's Ascent (Year 600):** A 5-foot warrior jumps 20 feet without magic, baffling scholars.
9.  **The Cursed Whistle (Year 605):** A referee blows a whistle that summons a swarm of bees. The match continues anyway.
10. **The Formation of the Iron Bastion (Year 610):** The Bastion Guild constructs a magical barrier that blocks *emotional* damage as well as physical.
11. **The Day the Sky Cracked (Year 615):** A spike so powerful it tore a rift to the Elemental Plane of Air.
12. **The Invasion of the Ground-Dwellers (Year 620):** Subterranean moles try to ban Skyblade; they are defeated by a barrage of jump serves.
13. **Coach Marshall’s Collapse (Year 625):** The legendary coach suffers a mana-burn stroke during Nationals.
14. **The Flightless Era (Year 626):** The Ravens lose funding; the gym is briefly repurposed as a potion brewery.
15. **The Rise of the Azure King (Year 628):** Prince Valerius takes command of The Sovereigns, instituting a regime of "Tyrannical Elegance."
16. **The Shadow Egg Incident (Low Probability):** A Skyblade ball hatches into a void-bird during a match. It is now a mascot.
17. **The Sweat Flood (Low Probability):** The locker rooms of The Griffons flood with magically amplified perspiration, drowning three goblins.
18. **The Whispering Knee-Pads (Low Probability):** A batch of enchanted gear gains sentience and critiques players' form audibly.
19. **The Vanishing Court (Low Probability):** An entire stadium teleports 3 feet to the left. The game is paused for 2 minutes.
20. **Present Day:** The PCs arrive at the dilapidated Raven's Perch.

### **The Metaphysical "Why"**
The world is slowly sinking. The "Heavy layer" beneath the floating islands is rising. Only the kinetic energy generated by **Skyblade Matches** keeps the islands afloat. If the league stops, the world falls into the abyss. You are not just playing for a trophy; you are playing for altitude.
