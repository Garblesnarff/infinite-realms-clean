# Campaign Bible: Wings of the Void

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Flinch of the Earth
History records that Skydancer Kaia broke the sky, but the esoteric texts of the Deep Void suggest otherwise. The earth was not broken; it *let go*. For eons, the tectonic plates held a breath they could no longer sustain. When Kaia hit the "Concept of Down" with her experimental velocity-rune, she didn't shatter the rock—she startled the planet's localized gravity into a metaphysical flinch. The ground recoiled in sheer panic, splitting open to reveal the raw, digesting stomach of the universe: The Abyss. The Skyrift is not a hole; it is a scream frozen in geology, and the Void creatures are merely the antibodies of a reality trying to heal a wound that refuses to clot.

### Timeline of the Abyss
1.  **Year 0 (The Shattering):** Kaia impacts the unseen barrier at Mach 1. The continent splits. 10,000 souls fall; 3 survive by accidentally inventing the "Surrender Technique."
2.  **Year 2:** The First Updraft. A massive exhale from the Void returns the clothes (but not the bodies) of the victims, neatly folded on the cliff edge.
3.  **Year 5:** The Rim Cities are founded. Real estate prices skyrocket for "View of Infinity."
4.  **Year 12 (The Day of Rain):** It rains frogs, but the frogs are made of glass and sing in perfect harmony before shattering.
5.  **Year 15:** The Fallers officially organize. The first "Wingsuit" is stitched from the membrane of a deceased Void Glider.
6.  **Year 22:** The "Sky Council" bans gravity-reversal boots after a senator "falls" into the sun.
7.  **Year 30:** The Great Migration. Millions of Void Jellyfish float up to the Twilight Zone, clogging airship turbines with neon slime.
8.  **Year 38 (The Silent Tuesday):** All sound in the Abyss ceases for 24 hours. Fallers report hearing the thoughts of clouds.
9.  **Year 45:** Razor Wind’s squadron bombs a "hostile cloud," which turns out to be a hallucination caused by nitrogen narcosis. He blames the Void.
10. **Year 50 (Present Day):** The Void King wakes. Seismographs read a heartbeat coming from 20km down.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil; it is **Stasis vs. Flow**. The Material Plane relies on Fixed States (Stone, Law, Gravity). The Void relies on Fluid States (Motion, Chaos, Potential). The Abyss is the friction point where Physics argues with itself. If the Council seals it, Reality calcifies, and the world stops spinning. If the Void expands, Reality liquefies, and humans become soup. The Fallers represent the synthesis: Controlled Chaos.
