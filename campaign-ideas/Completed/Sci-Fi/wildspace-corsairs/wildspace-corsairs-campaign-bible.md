# Campaign Bible: Wildspace Corsairs

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Architect's Glass
In the time before time, the Cosmos was a chaotic, burning soup of raw creation known as the Phlogiston. The Architects—beings of pure order—sought to create sanctuaries where life could thrive without being consumed by the rainbow fire. They blew the "Crystal Spheres" like glassblowers, isolating solar systems in bubbles of static reality. However, the Architects vanished, leaving behind their tools (the Spelljammer helms) and one massive, living "Master Key"—The Great Vessel. The spheres were meant to be temporary incubators, but they have become cages. The Arcane, a mercantile race of blue giants, discovered the secret: if the spheres are ever fully opened, the Phlogiston will flood in, rewriting the laws of physics. They maintain the monopoly not just for profit, but because they believe "Free Space" spells the end of existence.

### Timeline of the Spheres
1.  **The Glassblowing (-10,000 Y):** The Architects encase solar systems in crystal shells.
2.  **The First Helm (-8,000 Y):** A scavenger race finds a discarded Architect’s chair; the first ship takes flight.
3.  **The War of the Void (-5,000 Y):** The Illithid Empire attempts to darken the suns; they are pushed back to the fringes.
4.  **The Great Desaturation (-3,200 Y):** *[Surreal]* For one year, all color vanished from the Greyspace sphere. When it returned, gravity worked sideways for a decade.
5.  **Rise of the Arcane (-2,000 Y):** The Arcane Mercantile Union standardizes spelljamming, destroying all independent research.
6.  **The Day of Raining Whales (-1,500 Y):** *[Surreal]* A portal from a water plane opened in vacuum; millions of space-whales fell into the sun of Realmspace, changing its color to azure.
7.  **The Neogi Pact (-800 Y):** The Arcane and Neogi sign a treaty allowing the trade of sentient life, provided the Arcane get a cut.
8.  **The Silence of the Rock (-300 Y):** The Rock of Bral is hollowed out; the original inhabitants (giant rock-eating slugs) are evicted.
9.  **The Whisper Plague (-50 Y):** *[Surreal]* A contagious melody spread through the Phlogiston; anyone who hummed it turned into glass.
10. **The Current Era:** The "Great Vessel" (The Spelljammer) is sighted for the first time in a millennia, drifting near the Corsair’s Fringe.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
**Stagnation vs. Dilution.** The Crystal Spheres protect life but stifle the soul and magic; the Phlogiston offers infinite potential but burns the unprepared. The conflict is not just Good vs. Evil, but Security (The Arcane) vs. Radical Freedom (The Corsairs).
