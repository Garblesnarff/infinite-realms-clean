### **World-Building Specification Brief: Songstress and the Valkyrie**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   The party pilots Variable Fighters (transforming mecha) aboard a colony ship that encounters the Zentraedi—giant warriors who know only combat. Music awakens their suppressed emotions, becoming humanity's weapon. The campaign blends dogfighting, cultural exchange, and romance as music ends war where weapons failed.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail first Zentraedi attack on Earth—automated war fleet seeking "Protoculture" (ancient tech). Millions died.
*   Explain Zentraedi creation—bio-engineered warriors by ancient Protoculture civilization, emotions suppressed to make perfect soldiers.
*   Describe Variable Fighters—reverse-engineered from crashed alien tech, transform for versatility.
*   Outline colony ship (SDF-1)—accidentally fold-jumped from Earth, now trying to return home with civilian population.

**3. Factions:**
*   **UN Spacy** (Major - Player Faction): Earth defense force aboard SDF-1, protecting civilian colony ship.
*   **Zentraedi Main Fleet** (Major - Antagonist): Millions-strong armada of giant warriors seeking Protoculture.
*   **Zentraedi Defectors** (Minor): Warriors exposed to culture who choose individuality over programming.
*   **Anti-Unification Movement** (Minor): Humans who opposed global government, sabotage efforts.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Lynn Minmay** (idol singer), **Max Sterling** (ace pilot), **Milia Fallyna** (enemy ace turned ally), **Breetai** (honorable Zentraedi commander), **Bodolzaa** (supreme Zentraedi leader), **Roy Focker** (mentor pilot who dies).

**5. Locations:**
*   **SDF-1 Macross Bridge** (command center), **Fighter Bays**, **Minmay's Concert Stage**, **City Streets** (inside ship), **Zentraedi Flagship** (hostile then allied).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** Minmay performs during battle **THEN** Zentraedi become confused/distracted, some defect, hardliners enraged.
*   **IF** Max and Milia's romance succeeds **THEN** proof that former enemies can coexist, but both face prejudice.
*   **IF** Bodolzaa defeated **THEN** Zentraedi splinter—some integrate, others remain hostile as remnants.
*   **IF** culture rejected by Zentraedi **THEN** total war, must destroy the fleet with heavy casualties.

**7. Variable Fighter Mechanics:**
*   **Three Modes:**
    *   Fighter: Speed +2, range weapons only.
    *   Gerwalk: Hover, can use all weapons.
    *   Battroid: Humanoid, hand-to-hand capable, slower.
*   Switch modes as bonus action.
*   Each mode suited for different tactical situations.

**8. Song Energy Mechanics:**
*   When singer performs during combat, area buff:
    *   Allies: +2 to attacks and saves, advantage on morale checks.
    *   Enemies (first exposure): Wisdom save or become distracted (disadvantage).
*   Prolonged exposure can cause defection (cultural conversion through music).

**9. Cultural Exchange:**
*   Roleplay teaching Zentraedi about human concepts:
    *   Food (they only eat nutrients), Music (never heard), Love (forbidden concept), Family (engineered, not born).
*   Success opens dialogue, failure offends and reignites hostilities.
