**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is a crew of bounty hunters aboard the Bebop—a converted fishing vessel traveling the solar system chasing criminals for money. Each member is running from a tragic past they can't escape: a former syndicate hitman, an amnesiac woman, a debt-ridden gambler, a genius hacker child, and an intellectually enhanced dog. They scrape by on small bounties while their pasts catch up to them one by one, learning that no matter how far you run in space, you carry your burdens with you.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Fights are gritty and realistic—guns jam, allies betray, and running is often wiser than fighting.
*   **Investigation:** Heavy emphasis on tracking bounties, reading criminal networks, and confronting personal demons.
*   **Consequences:** The crew is perpetually broke, hungry, and one bad job from disaster. Emotional wounds matter more than physical ones.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A melancholic arc about running from the past while it hunts you.

*   **Act I — Chasing Woolongs (Sessions 1–3):** The crew takes bounty hunting jobs while establishing dynamics. They're broke, hungry, and struggling. Their pasts are hinted at but not confronted.
*   **Act II — Ghosts Resurface (Sessions 4–8):** Each crew member's past catches up—the syndicate, amnesia, gambling debts, abandoned families. Bounties become personal.
*   **Act III — The Weight of the Past (Sessions 9–12):** The main character's former syndicate returns. His lost love is alive but aligned with enemies. The crew fractures as everyone confronts whether they can escape their histories.
*   **Act IV — Whatever Happens, Happens (Sessions 13–15):** Final confrontations with the past. Some crew members leave, some die, some accept their burdens. The ending is bittersweet—"you're gonna carry that weight."

## Key Locations

1.  **The Bebop:** Converted interplanetary fishing vessel, cramped, always breaking down, home.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **escaping versus confronting the past**. Every crew member is running from trauma, but space is finite and the past infinite. The campaign explores whether people can change, whether love can survive tragedy, and whether found family is worth the inevitable pain of loss. It's melancholic, noir, and beautiful—like jazz.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Perpetual Poverty**
*   The crew is always broke. Bounties barely cover fuel and food.
*   **Hunger:** Mechanical penalties when the crew can't afford food for days.

### 2. **Tragic Flashbacks**
*   Each session can include flashback scenes revealing character pasts.
*   **Emotional Weight:** Flashbacks grant insight but also inflict emotional damage.

### 3. **Noir Investigation**
*   Bounties require detective work—interviewing informants, following leads, reading criminal networks.

### 4. **The Weight You Carry**
*   Each character has a "Weight" track representing unresolved trauma.
*   **Breaking Point:** High Weight causes breakdowns, bad decisions, or leaving the crew.

### 5. **Bang**
*   When a character faces near-certain death with acceptance, they can use "Bang" to survive one impossible situation—but it costs everything.
