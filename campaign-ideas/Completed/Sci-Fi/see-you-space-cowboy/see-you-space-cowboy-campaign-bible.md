## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Severance
In a forgotten past, humanity was a single, psychic hive-mind, spanning the solar system. This gestalt consciousness, known as **Vast**, grew bored and lonely. To experience individuality, it performed the **Great Severance**: a psychic cataclysm that shattered the hive-mind into billions of individual, amnesiac souls, each imbued with a profound, inexplicable sense of loss and nostalgia for a home they couldn't remember. The "Hyperspace Gates" were not built; they are the scar tissue from this event, unstable psychic wounds in space-time. The "Blues," a pervasive, melancholic musical form, is not just a genre; it is the echo of Vast's original, unified consciousness, a song of cosmic loneliness that all humanity subconsciously remembers.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-500 Y (The Great Severance):** The Vast hive-mind shatters itself. Humanity "awakens" as amnesiac individuals on various planets, believing they are the survivors of a forgotten catastrophe.
2.  **-400 Y (The Rediscovery):** Humanity rediscovers space travel, using primitive rockets. They find the Hyperspace Gates, believing them to be alien artifacts.
3.  **-350 Y (The Gold Rush):** The Gates are stabilized for travel. A chaotic, lawless gold rush to colonize the solar system begins. The first crime syndicates are formed.
4.  **-250 Y (The Corporate Wars):** Megacorporations battle for control of the Gates and planetary resources. The Inter-Solar System Police (ISSP) is formed but is immediately crippled by corruption.
5.  **-100 Y (The Bebop Era Begins):** The rise of the "Cowboy" system. The ISSP, unable to police the vastness of space, begins issuing bounties on criminals, privatizing law enforcement.
6.  **-50 Y (The Red Dragon Ascendancy):** The Red Dragon Crime Syndicate, through a series of brutal assassinations and corporate takeovers, becomes the de facto government in the outer colonies.
7.  **-10 Y (The Titan War):** A bloody conflict on Titan between the ISSP and the Syndicate. A young, promising ISSP officer named Spike Spiegel and a Syndicate enforcer named Vicious are at the center of it. The war ends in a bloody stalemate.
8.  **-3 Y (The "Accident"):** Spike Spiegel fakes his own death to escape the Syndicate and his past, abandoning the woman he loves, Julia.
9.  **-1 Y (The *Bebop* Crew Forms):** Spike partners with ex-ISSP officer Jet Black. They acquire a converted fishing trawler, the *Bebop*, and begin life as bounty hunters.
10. **Present Day:** The crew of the *Bebop* is broke, hungry, and chasing a low-level bounty. A mysterious data-dog, Ein, containing a wealth of encrypted information, falls into their laps. The bounty for a man named "Vicious" is re-activated with a death mark.

### The "Why": The Burden of the Past
The central conflict is the struggle between **Amnesia and Memory**. Every character is running from a past they can't escape, haunted by a nostalgia for a unity they don't understand (the echo of Vast). The plot is not about saving the world, but about whether it's possible to save oneself. The criminal underworld is a physical manifestation of this struggle: a system of debts, grudges, and old scores that can never be truly settled. The ultimate question is not whether the crew can catch their bounty, but whether they can confront their own history without being destroyed by it.

### Artifacts of the Bebop Era
1.  **The Data-Chip of Vast:** The fully decrypted data file from Ein's brain. It does not contain schematics or secrets, but a single musical note that, when played, causes all who hear it to remember the feeling of being part of the hive-mind for one minute.
2.  **Vicious's Katana:** A masterwork katana that has been folded a thousand times. It is unnaturally sharp and seems to absorb the light around it. It deals psychic damage in addition to slashing, fueled by the wielder's own pain.
3.  **Spike's Jericho 941:** A seemingly standard, well-maintained pistol. However, it has never once jammed or misfired. It has a supernatural "luck" to it, allowing the wielder to re-roll one missed attack per session.

6.  **The Bonsai Tree of Patience:** A perfectly manicured bonsai tree. Staring at it for an hour grants advantage on the next Wisdom save.
7.  **The VHS Tape:** A Betamax tape labeled "For Julia." It's impossible to find a machine that can play it.
8.  **The Deck of 51:** A deck of playing cards that is inexplicably missing the Queen of Hearts.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Debt & Desperation
*   **The Tab:** The crew starts with a massive, crippling debt. At the end of each session, expenses (fuel, food, repairs, docking fees) are added to the tab.
*   **Bounties:** Completing bounties is the only reliable way to earn money. The GM should have a "bounty board" of available jobs, from easy cash to legendary scores.
*   **Desperation Dice:** If the crew's debt exceeds a certain threshold, they enter a state of "Desperation." Each player gets one Desperation Die (a d6) per session. They can add this die to any roll, but doing so has a narrative consequence (e.g., your gun jams, you tick off a powerful faction, a crewmate resents you for being reckless).

### Physics: The "Analog" Future
*   **No AI:** True, sentient AI is rare and feared. Most technology is clunky, analog, and requires manual operation. Hacking is a physical act of "net-diving," not just typing.
*   **The Blues:** The GM should curate a playlist of jazz and blues music. The mood of the music can have a subtle effect on the game, granting advantage on melancholic social checks or disadvantage on optimistic ones. The music is the heartbeat of the setting.
