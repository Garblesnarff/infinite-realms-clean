# Starfire Rebellion - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Primary Style**: Epic space opera with gritty realism
- **Visual Philosophy**: "Star Wars meets Battlestar Galactica" - mythic heroism grounded in real consequences
- **Technology Design**: Worn, lived-in tech; Empire is sleek and oppressive; Rebellion is jury-rigged and improvised
- **Lighting**: Dark corridors lit by emergency lights; dramatic shadows; lens flares from stars and explosions

### Art Direction by Location

**Imperial Locations**
- Sterile white corridors with black accents
- Oppressively symmetrical architecture
- Officers in crisp uniforms, stormtroopers in identical armor
- Everything polished, cold, intimidating
- Ominous red lighting in military installations

**Rebellion Bases**
- Cramped, makeshift, repurposed civilian structures
- Exposed wiring and improvised repairs visible
- Diverse species and clothing styles creating visual chaos
- Warm lighting (yellows, oranges) creating hope despite grimness
- Inspiring graffiti and propaganda posters

**Space Battles**
- Massive scale emphasized - tiny fighters, huge capital ships
- Explosions are bright against black void
- Debris fields from destroyed ships
- Laser fire in vibrant blues, reds, greens
- Motion blur and speed effects for dogfights

**Oppressed Worlds**
- Industrial planets: Smog, pollution, gray everywhere
- Mining colonies: Dangerous conditions, exploited workers
- Paradise worlds: Beautiful but guarded, occupation visible
- Destroyed worlds: Rubble, fire, despair

**Capital Worlds**

### Character Visual Design

**Imperial Characters**
- Uniform perfection, no individuality
- Officers: Black uniforms with rank insignias

**Supporting Cast**

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Theme

- **Inspiration**: John Williams' Star Wars + Bear McCreary's Battlestar Galactica
- **Leitmotif**: "Hope theme" (4-note rising progression)

### Faction Themes

**The Rebellion**
- Instruments: Acoustic guitar, violin, human voices
- Feel: Folk music becoming symphony, grassroots to grand
- Main theme starts small, adds instruments as Rebellion grows
- Hope motif present in all variations

**The Empire**

- Feel: Imperial march, oppressive, overwhelming
- No melody, only rhythm and power
- Tyrannus's theme: Organ music, ancient and unstoppable

**Prince Dante**

- Feel: Classical elegance hiding madness
- Starts friendly, becomes discordant as true nature revealed

### Combat Music

**Space Battles**
- Fast tempo orchestral with electronic elements
- Different motifs for Empire and Rebellion ships
- Moments of silence when ships are destroyed (respect for fallen)
- Victory fanfare or retreat theme based on outcome

**Ground Combat**
- More intimate than space battles
- Focus on percussion and staccato strings
- Personal stakes emphasized through quieter moments between volleys

**The Final Battle**
- Everything from campaign combines
- All leitmotifs present, fighting for dominance
- Choir for epic scope
- Resolves to either triumphant or tragic based on outcome

### Emotional Scenes

**Hope/Inspiration**
- Soft piano or solo violin building to full orchestra

**Betrayal**

### Sound Effects Library

- Rebellion ships: Older engines, coughing and sputtering, but reliable
- Imperial ships: Smooth, powerful, intimidating hum
- Fighter dogfights: Screaming engines, laser fire, explosion rumble

**Weapons**
- Laser cannons: Distinctive pew-pew for fighters, deeper boom for capital ships
- Explosions: Satisfying booms with debris scatter
- Lightsaber-equivalent: Energy sword hum and clash

**Environments**
- Refuge base: Echoing cramped corridors, maintenance sounds, chatter

**Emotional Moments**
