# Starfire Rebellion
**Hope Burns Brightest in the Darkest Night**

## Campaign Overview

The Starfire Rebellion campaign places the party in the midst of a galactic uprising against the iron-fisted Dominion Empire. What begins as a desperate mission to steal Imperial weapons specifications escalates into a full-scale rebellion that will determine the fate of billions. The party starts as unlikely heroes—smugglers, deserters, ex-slaves, and idealists—who become the spark that ignites a revolution across a thousand worlds.

The campaign blends daring heists and space battles with intimate character moments and impossible moral choices. Players will lead fleets into battle, inspire downtrodden populations to rise up, and confront the reality that victory demands terrible sacrifices. The Empire's grip is maintained through fear, but the party will prove that hope is more powerful than any superweapon—though that hope comes at a steep price paid in blood and betrayal.

This is a campaign about ordinary people doing extraordinary things, about found family forged in fire, and about the eternal struggle between freedom and tyranny. It asks whether the ends justify the means, whether violence can birth peace, and whether heroes can remain untarnished by the very darkness they fight against.

## Core Themes

- **Hope Against Despair**: The power of belief in a better tomorrow
- **Found Family**: Strangers becoming closer than blood through shared struggle
- **Sacrifice**: What are you willing to give up for freedom?
- **Moral Complexity**: Fighting monsters without becoming one yourself
- **The Power of Unity**: Diverse peoples overcoming differences to oppose tyranny
- **Redemption**: Former Imperial agents seeking to atone for past crimes

### Act I: Ignition (Sessions 1-9)

**Session 3: Flight and Refuge**
Fleeing Imperial pursuit, the party limps to Refuge, a hidden asteroid base where they meet General Kora Vance and the nascent Rebellion. They're initially just assets, but their success makes them heroes despite themselves.

**Session 4-5: Recruitment Drive**
Sent to recruit allies, the party visits the mining world Keppra-5. They must inspire the oppressed workers to rise up while avoiding Imperial Intelligence agents. First taste of leadership and public speaking. The miners join after emotional appeal.

**Session 6-7: The Imperial Defector**
Commander Raith Sundered, an Imperial ace pilot, defects with a prototype stealth fighter. But is it genuine or a trap? The party must vet them while Imperial hunter-killer squads close in. Trust issues and exciting dogfights.

**Arc: Building the Rebellion**

**Session 10-11: Ghost Fleet**
The Rebellion discovers an ancient shipyard from a long-dead civilization. If they can restore the automated facilities, they'll have a fleet. But the AI is hostile and the Empire is also searching for it. Balance between negotiation and sabotage.

**Session 12-13: The Propaganda War**
Rebel operative Lyssa Vex wants to broadcast the stolen Apocalypse Cannon plans galaxywide, proving the Empire's monstrosity. The party must break into the Holonet Hub while Imperials trace their signal. Tense countdown.

**Session 14-15: Alliance of Necessity**
The Syndicate, a criminal organization, offers weapons in exchange for the party rescuing crime lord Vex Kavros from Imperial prison. Moral dilemma: deal with criminals or maintain moral high ground? Decision has consequences.

**Session 16-17: The Emperor's Wrath**
In retaliation for the holonet broadcast, the Empire uses the Apocalypse Cannon on civilian target Sanctuary-3 (2 billion dead). The party wasn't even there. They must cope with guilt—did their actions cause this? Characters question the cost of rebellion.

**Session 18: Fractured Rebellion**

**Session 19-20: Turning the Tide**
Using the Ghost Fleet, the Rebellion wins its first major fleet engagement at the Battle of Antares. The party leads fighters in the thick of combat. Victory! Recruitment surges across the galaxy. The Empire can be beaten.

**Session 21-22: The Chosen One?**
Rumors spread of a prophesied liberator—"The Starfire." People think it's one of the party members. The party must decide whether to embrace the myth (morale boost) or reject it (maintain authenticity). False messiah complications.

**Session 23-24: Operation Kingfall**
Assassination attempt on Emperor Tyrannus himself at a public ceremony. Morally complex—is political assassination justified? Can they live with it? The attempt fails, but they wound him badly, proving he's mortal.

**Session 25-26: The Second Weapon**
Intelligence reveals a second Apocalypse Cannon, nearly complete. Desperate mission to destroy it before activation. Assault on heavily fortified shipyard. They succeed but at terrible cost—beloved NPCs die holding the line.

**Session 27: Betrayal**
Cipher, their original benefactor, is revealed as Imperial Prince Dante, the Emperor's son. He's been feeding information to both sides, prolonging the war for his own amusement. The party's early victories were allowed. Trust shatters.

### Act IV: The Final Conflagration (Sessions 28-35)
**Arc: End of Empire**

**Session 28-29: Dark Revelations**
Prince Dante reveals Emperor Tyrannus is dying and the Empire is fracturing. Multiple warlords will tear the galaxy apart. Dante offers alliance—help him take the throne, he'll reform the Empire peacefully. Temptation of easy victory vs. principles.

**Session 30-31: The Rebellion Divided**
The party must choose: accept Dante's offer or continue fighting. The Rebellion splits based on their decision. Whichever path chosen, they've lost allies. Intimate roleplay as friends become enemies over ideology.

## Major Locations

**Ironhold Station** (Imperial Superweapon Research Facility)
Massive orbital platform where the Empire develops its most terrible weapons. High security, sterile corridors, oppressive atmosphere. The heist location that starts everything.

**Refuge** (Original Rebel Base)
Hidden asteroid base, cramped and makeshift. Shows rebellion's desperate early days. Lost in Session 8-9, creates emotional connection to place and people lost.

**Haven** (New Rebel Base)
Mobile command ship and station, constantly relocating. More professional than Refuge but retains scrappy spirit. War room, barracks, civilian quarters, shipyard.

**Keppra-5** (Mining World)
Oppressed workers toiling in dangerous mines for Imperial profit. Gray, polluted, desperate. The party's recruitment here shows Empire's cruelty firsthand. Post-liberation becomes symbol of hope.

**The Ghost Yards** (Ancient Shipyard)
Massive automated facility from extinct civilization. Eerie, beautiful, dangerous. Hostile AI defends it. Once convinced, produces dozens of warships for Rebellion.

**Sanctuary-3** (Doomed Paradise)
Beautiful garden world, 2 billion civilians, no military value. Empire destroys it with Apocalypse Cannon as retaliation. The party never visits—it's destroyed off-screen, making loss more abstract and haunting.

**Antares System** (Major Battle)
Industrial sector with orbital platforms, asteroids, and gas giant. Site of Rebellion's first major fleet victory. Space combat among shipyards and stations.

**Dominion Throne** (Imperial Capital)
City-covered planet, monumental architecture designed to intimidate. The Emperor's palace at the center, surrounded by defensive platforms. Final battle location.

**The Holonet Hub** (Communications Center)
Civilian station that broadcasts news and entertainment galaxywide. The party hijacks it to broadcast truth. Mix of corporate offices and broadcast studios.

**The Pits** (Imperial Prison)
Where the Empire sends political prisoners. Grim, torturous, designed to break spirits. The party infiltrates to rescue Vex Kavros and discover horrors that harden their resolve.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Cipher's Identity**
The mysterious benefactor who hired them is Prince Dante, the Emperor's son, manipulating both sides for entertainment and to prove himself worthy of succession.

**Twist 2: The Emperor's Mortality**
Emperor Tyrannus is dying. The Apocalypse Cannons are his scorched-earth contingency. If he can't rule, no one will. His cruelty comes from desperation.

**Twist 3: The Ghost Fleet AI**
The shipyard AI isn't hostile randomly—it was enslaved and abused by its creators. It attacks out of trauma. Showing compassion wins it over, violence only confirms its fears.

**Twist 4: Raith's Secret Mission**
Commander Sundered's defection was genuine, but they planted a tracking beacon in their ship (unknowingly). The Empire always knows where Haven is. They discover this just before a major attack.

**Twist 5: The Apocalypse Cannons' True Purpose**
The superweapons were originally designed to defend against extra-galactic invasion. The Emperor saw the threat coming and militarized. His tyranny has terrible justification.

**Twist 6: Lyssa Vex's Shapeshifting**
She's unconsciously mimicking people, raising questions about her true self. Eventually reveals she's actually the last of a extinct species, hiding among others so long she forgot her original form.

**Complication 1: Civilian Casualties**
Every Rebellion victory costs civilian lives. The Empire uses hostages and human shields. The party must weigh liberation against body count.

**Complication 2: War Crimes Trials**
After victory, party might face prosecution for questionable wartime actions. Were their sacrifices necessary or excessive? Former allies may testify against them.

**Complication 3: The Syndicate's Price**
Vex Kavros's aid comes with strings. They want territory and legitimacy post-war. Refuse and lose vital support. Accept and potentially replace tyranny with criminal rule.

**Complication 4: Refugee Crisis**
Millions flee war zones. The Rebellion lacks resources to help. Choosing between feeding refugees or funding military operations. Both are life-or-death.

**Complication 5: Imperial Defectors**
As Empire crumbles, soldiers defect. But many committed atrocities under orders. How much mercy do war criminals deserve? Realpolitik vs. justice.

**Complication 6: The Fracturing**
Post-Dante's betrayal, the Rebellion splits into factions. The party must either unite them (difficult) or choose a side (lose allies). Climactic battle might have former friends as enemies.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory: End the Empire**
Defeat Emperor Tyrannus and prevent the Apocalypse Cannons from firing. The tyranny ends and freedom begins. The basic "win" condition.

**Secondary Victory: United Rebellion**
Keep the Rebellion united despite internal conflicts. Achieve victory without splitting into factions. Post-war government will be stable and democratic.

**Tertiary Victory: Minimize Casualties**
Through clever tactics and moral choices, keep civilian deaths low. The new galaxy won't be built on mountains of corpses. Harder but more heroic.

**Redemption Victory: Save Prince Dante**
Despite his evil, redeem the Prince. He has resources and power. A reformed Dante can peacefully transition the Empire into democracy. Risky but potentially best outcome.

**Perfect Victory: The Third Way**
Unite Empire AND Rebellion against true threat (extra-galactic invasion). Ancient enemies become allies. The galaxy transforms without the war's worst consequences.

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat: Apocalypse**
Emperor Tyrannus activates all Apocalypse Cannons. The Rebellion and hundreds of civilian worlds are destroyed. The Empire wins through genocide. Everyone the party cared about dies.

**Political Defeat: Warlord States**
Empire falls but no unified Rebellion exists. Galaxy fractures into dozens of warlord states. Endless civil war replaces single tyranny. The party's victory makes everything worse.

**Moral Defeat: Becoming the Empire**
In fighting monsters, the party became one. Their Rebellion uses tyranny, terror, and atrocity. They defeat Tyrannus only to replace him. Same empire, different emperor.

**Pyrrhic Victory: Ashes**
Win the war but at catastrophic cost. Most of the galaxy is destroyed, billions dead, civilization set back centuries. Victory is technically achieved but feels like defeat.

**Betrayal Defeat: Prince Dante's Triumph**
Fall for Dante's manipulations. Help him take the throne. He reforms nothing, proves tyranny with charm instead of fear. The party realizes too late they've been used.

**Stalemate: Forever War**
Neither side can win. The war grinds on indefinitely. The party becomes old soldiers in an endless conflict, watching idealism die and pragmatism replace hope. A slow, grinding defeat.
