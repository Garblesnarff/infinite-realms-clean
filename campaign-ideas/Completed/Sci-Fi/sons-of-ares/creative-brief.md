## Art Style: Brutal Space Opera with Color-Coded Castes (Red Rising meets Gladiator in Space)

Roman Empire aesthetics reimagined in futuristic Mars colonization, with color-coded castes, razor duels, and brutal class warfare.

### Core Principles:
*   **Color Hierarchy:** Each caste wears their color prominently—Golds in golden armor, Reds in red mining gear, Silvers in silver business attire, etc.
*   **Roman Aesthetics:** Gold culture mimics Rome—togas, laurels, gladiatorial combat, Senate politics, Latin names.
*   **Brutal Contrast:** Underground Red poverty (dark, cramped mines) vs. surface Gold luxury (gleaming cities, vast estates).

### Color Palette:
*   **Red Mining Colonies:** Deep reds, rust, coal blacks, dim artificial lighting, cramped darkness.
*   **Gold Societies:** Metallic golds, whites, rich purples (Roman emperor colors), marble architecture, bright sunlight.
*   **The Institute:** Natural Martian landscape—red desert, rust-colored rocks, harsh sunlight, scattered oases.
*   **Agea (Gold City):** Gleaming white marble, gold accents, holographic displays, floating architecture.
*   **Each Color Caste:** Visually coded—Blues in flight suits, Grays in military armor, Obsidians in black war paint, Pinks in revealing clothing, etc.

### Character Design:
*   **Reds:** Short (5'2"-5'5"), lean from malnutrition, pale from underground life, scarred hands from mining, red work jumpsuits.
*   **Golds:** Tall (6'-7'), muscular perfection, golden-blonde hair, chiseled features, wearing golden armor or togas, carrying razors.
*   **The Carved Red (Player):** Red transformed to Gold—tall, strong, golden dyed hair, scars from surgery hidden, struggling with identity.
*   **Sevro:** Small for a Gold, goblin-like features, wild energy, leading a pack of loyal Howlers.
*   **The Jackal:** Pale gold with unsettling intellect in his eyes, surgical scars from self-modification, dressed in dark gold armor.

### Voice:
Dual voice: (1) Red—working class, Irish or Scottish accent, passionate, defiant. (2) Gold—patrician, Latin-influenced, aristocratic, commanding. The carved infiltrator shifts between both, creating identity tension. Role: Narrating class struggle and infiltration.
