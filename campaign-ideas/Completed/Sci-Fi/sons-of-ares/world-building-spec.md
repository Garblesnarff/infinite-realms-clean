### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Sons of Ares**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players are Reds (lowest caste) mining helium-3 on Mars, believing they're terraforming the surface for humanity. When recruited by rebels, one is carved into a Gold (ruling elite) and infiltrates the Institute. They must navigate brutal Gold politics, maintain their Red identity, and spark revolution against the color caste system.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   After Earth's resources were exhausted, humanity colonized the Solar System, establishing a color-based caste hierarchy.
*   Golds conquered and enslaved other colors, ruling through superior genetics (engineered) and military might.
*   The "terraforming lie"—Reds believe they're making Mars habitable, but the surface has been green and populated by Golds for generations.
*   The Institute is a brutal war academy where young Golds prove their dominance through year-long combat trials.
*   The Sons of Ares is an underground rebellion seeking to overthrow Gold rule and establish equality.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Golds (Ruling Caste):** Genetically superior, control all wealth and power, divided into rival Houses (Augustus, Bellona, Arcos, etc.).
*   **The Sons of Ares (Rebellion):** Multi-color rebellion led by Dancer, seeks to expose the terraforming lie and unite low colors.
*   **The Institute Houses (Factional Competition):** Mars, Apollo, Diana, Minerva, Ceres, etc.—young Golds competing for dominance.
*   **The Sovereign's Court (Antagonists):** Octavia au Lune rules the Solar System, maintains Gold supremacy through fear.
*   **Low Colors (Oppressed Majority):** Reds, Pinks, Obsidians, Browns—exploited for labor, kept ignorant of true conditions.

*   **Tier 2/3:** Red miners, Gold nobles, Obsidian warriors, Gray soldiers, Proctors (Institute overseers), various color castes.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Lykos (Red Mine):** Underground colony, cramped tunnels, helium-3 extractors, dim lighting, oppressive heat and darkness.
*   **The Institute:** Massive Martian wilderness (1000 square kilometers), castle fortresses for each House, resource scarcity, brutal war games.
*   **Agea:** Floating Gold city, marble palaces, gardens, gladiatorial arenas, obscene wealth on display.

*   **IF** party allies with the Jackal → **THEN** they gain power but enable a sociopath's rise.
*   **IF** party allies with Mustang → **THEN** they gain strategic genius but she questions their methods.
*   **IF** revolution succeeds → **THEN** civil war erupts across the Solar System, millions die.
