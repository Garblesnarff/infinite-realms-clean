# Steel Prophets [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi (Cyberpunk/Post-Cyberpunk)]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In a hyper-connected, corporatized future, megacorporations wield absolute power, controlling every aspect of life through vast data networks and ubiquitous surveillance. The physical world is decaying, but the digital realm – the "Datasphere" – is a vibrant, all-encompassing reality. A rare few augmented individuals, known as "Steel Prophets," have developed the ability to not just access, but to *predict* and subtly *manipulate* the flow of information within the Datasphere. This precognitive data-sight allows them to foresee market crashes, political upheavals, and corporate betrayals. They are a new kind of oracle, challenging the megacorporations' iron grip on society, fighting for free will in a world increasingly defined by algorithms and data.

## Setting [SETTING: Neon Dystopia]
The world is a perpetually rainy, neon-drenched metropolis, dominated by the towering, monolithic headquarters of megacorporations. The streets below are a chaotic, grimy labyrinth of street markets, noodle stalls, and augmented citizens. The air is thick with pollution and holographic advertisements. Human bodies are heavily augmented with cybernetics, blurring the lines between flesh and machine. Beyond the physical city lies the Datasphere, a shimmering, abstract digital landscape where information flows like a river and consciousness can be uploaded or downloaded.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **Neo-Kyoto Arcology (The Spire):** [LOCATION: Corporate Hub] The central hub of the most powerful megacorporation, OmniCorp. Its upper levels are pristine, exclusive corporate offices, while its lower levels are a dense, vertical city of workers and data farms.
*   **The Glitch Alley (Undercity):** [LOCATION: Slum] A sprawling, lawless district beneath Neo-Kyoto, where illegal augmentations are installed, black market data is traded, and the Steel Prophets maintain hidden safe houses. It's a haven for those off the grid.
*   **The Datasphere Nexus:** [LOCATION: Digital Realm] A conceptual, non-physical location within the Datasphere, where the most critical data streams converge. It's a place of immense power and danger, accessible only to the most skilled netrunners and Steel Prophets.
*   **The Memory Market:** [LOCATION: Black Market] A clandestine market operating in the physical world, where memories, skills, and even personalities can be bought, sold, or illegally extracted and implanted.
*   **The Oracle's Sanctuary:** [LOCATION: Secret Base] A hidden, heavily shielded physical location where the most powerful Steel Prophets gather to interpret their visions and plan their moves, protected from corporate surveillance.

## Factions [FACTION: Corporate]
*   **OmniCorp:** [FACTION: Megacorporation] The dominant megacorporation, controlling vast sectors of the global economy and wielding immense political power. They seek to monopolize information and suppress any threats to their control.
*   **The Steel Prophets:** [FACTION: Rebel Underground] A decentralized network of augmented individuals with precognitive data-sight. They believe in the free flow of information and fight against corporate determinism, often acting as digital vigilantes.
*   **The Data Wraiths:** [FACTION: Hacker Collective] A shadowy, anarchist hacker group that seeks to dismantle the Datasphere entirely, believing it to be the ultimate tool of corporate oppression. They are known for their destructive, chaotic attacks.
*   **The Augment Enforcers:** [FACTION: Corporate Military] OmniCorp's elite, heavily augmented security forces. They are cybernetically enhanced soldiers, fanatically loyal to the corporation, and tasked with hunting down netrunners and Steel Prophets.
*   **The Flesh Cult:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A radical, anti-cybernetic cult that believes all augmentation is an abomination. They seek to purify humanity by removing all technology, often resorting to violent attacks on augmented individuals.
