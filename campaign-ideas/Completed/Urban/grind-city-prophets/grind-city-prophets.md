# Grind City Prophets
## *Your graffiti rewrites reality. Your grinds shake foundations. Your crew is the revolution.*

### Campaign Overview

New Babylon is a city built on lies—literally. The Consensus Bureau uses propaganda broadcasts to maintain "agreed reality," suppressing dissent by making people forget it exists. But the Prophets, guerrilla inline skaters with magical spray paint, have discovered that combining sick grinds with graffiti art can overwrite the Bureau's reality edits. Each tagged location becomes a "truth anchor" where people remember what the government wants them to forget.

Players are rookie Prophets recruited after spontaneously creating truth graffiti. They must grind and tag the Twelve Ministry Buildings while avoiding the Bureau's enforcers—the Silence Squad, who literally erase people from existence. Complete all twelve tags, trigger the Grand Broadcast, and the city remembers everything the government buried. Fail, and the Prophets themselves will be edited out of reality.

This is Jet Set Radio meets 1984 meets Inception, where every grind is rebellion, every spray can rewrites history, and style literally saves the world.

### Major Locations

**The Underground (Prophet Base)**: Abandoned subway converted to skate park, planning center, graffiti workshop

**Twelve Ministry Buildings**:
1. **Truth**: Propaganda headquarters
2. **Peace**: Police/military
3. **Prosperity**: Economics (hiding poverty)
4. **Safety**: Surveillance
5. **Health**: Medicine (hiding illness data)
6. **Justice**: Courts (rigged trials)
7. **Culture**: Arts (censorship)
8. **Memory**: Archives (rewritten history)
9. **Unity**: Social cohesion (forced compliance)
10. **Freedom**: "Free choice" bureau (ironic)
11. **Reality**: Consensus maintenance
12. **Consensus**: Central Bureau (final boss location)

Each building has unique architecture demanding specific skating skills and graffiti approach.

**The Rooftop Routes**: Secret skating paths above city where Bureau has less control

**Silence Zones**: Areas where reality editing is strongest, dangerous to enter

**The Broadcast Towers**: Communication infrastructure, can be hacked with right graffiti

### Unique Mechanics

**Combo Skating System**: Chain tricks (grinds, spins, grabs, manuals) for higher combo. Higher combo = stronger reality art magic.

**Reality Graffiti**:
Each color has specific effect:
- **Red**: Aggression, passion, remembered anger
- **Blue**: Clarity, truth, factual recall
- **Yellow**: Joy, hope, positive memories
- **Green**: Growth, change, alternative possibilities
- **Purple**: Mystery, hidden truths, conspiracy reveal
- **Black**: Void, deletion of Bureau edits
- **White**: Pure truth, reset to original

**Ministry Tagging Challenges**:
- Must reach specific wall via skating route
- Create graffiti piece under time pressure (Silence Squad incoming)
- Combo meter must be above threshold to "lock in" reality edit
- Success = Truth anchor established, people in area remember
- Failure = Alert, must retry later

**Memory Mechanics**:
Players can lose memories from Silence Squad attacks. Other Prophets must remind them (roleplaying opportunities). Forgotten PC loses skills/abilities until restored.

**Style Points**:
Currency earned through creative tricks. Spent on:
- New skate gear (inline customization)
- Spray paint colors
- Music tracks (buff abilities)
- Safe houses
- Information

### Plot Twists

1. **Beat's Origin**: He's a Bureau experiment that went rogue—living proof reality edits can become independent

2. **Vinyl's Power**: Her music doesn't just disrupt—it contains recorded pre-edit memories

3. **Director Gray's Truth**: He witnessed a Prophet-caused disaster the Bureau covered up—his defection was justified

4. **The City Wants This**: New Babylon's consciousness is tired of being controlled, actively helping Prophets

5. **Ghost Was Leader**: The previous Prophet leader, erased for getting too close to truth

6. **Some Edits Were Good**: Bureau prevented panics, riots, disasters—moral complexity

7. **Players Are Edited**: One PC was someone else before Bureau changed them

8. **The Grand Broadcast**: Will restore ALL memories, including traumatic ones—mass psychological crisis

9. **Silence Squad Members**: Some are former Prophets who accepted Bureau offers to save loved ones

10. **Final Truth**: The entire city is an experiment, everyone's memories were fake from the start

### Victory & Defeat Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Tag all Twelve Ministries, trigger Grand Broadcast, city awakens to truth, establish new consensus based on transparency, defeat/redeem Director Gray

**Secondary**: Save Ghost from full erasure, recruit Silence Squad defectors, preserve Prophet culture, minimize casualties during awakening, maintain crew integrity

**Defeat**: Prophets erased from existence, Bureau perfects reality editing, resistance forgotten, truth permanently buried, city remains controlled

### Campaign Tone

Every session should feel like Jet Set Radio's rebellious energy mixed with Orwellian paranoia—vibrant street art clashing with sterile authoritarianism, hip-hop beats fighting propaganda, found family versus enforced conformity. Emphasize:

- Pre-mission planning and route scouting
- Skating POV with impossible grinds
- Graffiti as collaborative art
- Crew bonding through shared danger
- Style and substance equally important
- "Understanding the truth"—investigative elements
- Musical integration (every operation has soundtrack)
- Memory as precious commodity

Make players feel the rhythm of skating, the defiance of illegal art, the terror of being forgotten, the triumph of truth revealed. Make every successful tag feel like revolution. Make the Bureau sympathetic but wrong. Make choosing what truth to reveal genuinely difficult.

This is about proving that what we remember, and how we express it, defines who we are.
