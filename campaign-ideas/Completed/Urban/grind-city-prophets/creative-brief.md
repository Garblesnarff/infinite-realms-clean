# Grind City Prophets - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

**Aesthetic**: Jet Set Radio cel-shading meets 1984 dystopia meets street art explosion
- Vibrant graffiti vs sterile government buildings
- Cel-shaded character outlines
- Motion blur on skate tricks
- Reality glitches when memories conflict
- Propaganda posters everywhere (that Prophets deface)

**Colors**:
- **Prophet**: Rainbow graffiti, neon underglow on skates, street fashion primaries
- **Bureau**: Oppressive gray, sterile white, surveillance black
- **Reality Magic**: Prismatic shimmer when graffiti activates, truth = gold glow
- **Silence Squad**: Void black with static noise visual

**Key Visuals**: POV grinding on impossible rails, spray paint arcing through air, combo meter building, graffiti manifesting reality changes, Bureau propaganda transforming to truth

## Audio Design

**Music** (critical—define tone):
- **Operations**: Funk, hip-hop, breakbeat, electronic (Jet Set Radio vibes)
- **Vinyl's Tracks**: Each mission has custom DJ mix
- **Bureau**: Discordant, propaganda jingles twisted sinister
- **Victory**: Triumphant hip-hop with air horns
- **Silence Squad**: Silent (creepy absence of music)

**Sound Effects**:
- Skates grinding (metal on rail, satisfying scrape)
- Spray paint hiss
- Combo announcer (stylish!)
- Reality ripple (when truth anchors)
- Bureau alerts (sirens, propaganda voice)
- Music scratching when memories conflict

## Voice Acting

**Beat**: Charismatic Black American, speaks in rhythmic cadence, inspiring
**Vinyl**: Cool female DJ voice, speaks in musical terms, laid-back
**Sketch**: Soft-spoken, shy, communicates in half-sentences and art metaphors
**Director Gray**: Corporate British, reasonable tone hiding authoritarian control
**Ghost**: Glitching, distorted, desperate to be heard
**The City**: Whispers from everywhere, helpful coincidences manifesting as voice

## Cinematics

**Opening**: Propaganda broadcast, camera pulls back showing city, zoom to player spontaneously creating truth graffiti, reality ripples, Beat appears, "Welcome to the Prophets," freeze-frame title card in graffiti style

**Ministry Tags**: Combo building POV, perfect grind sequence, spray paint in slow-motion, art completing, reality wave rippling out, people remembering (montage), truth locked in

**Grand Broadcast**: All twelve pieces activate simultaneously, city-wide awakening, propaganda dissolving, truth flooding back, people crying/laughing/angry, new reality solidifying

## Tone

**Primary**: Rebellious joy through art and skating
**Secondary**: Orwellian horror of controlled reality
**Tertiary**: Found family fighting together

Every session: Vinyl's DJ intro, planning the route, skating with style, tagging with meaning, escaping authority, crew celebrating, investigating hidden truths, deciding what to reveal.
