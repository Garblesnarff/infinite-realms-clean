## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of justice in a fundamentally corrupt system, where doing the right thing often means becoming what you fight. The central conflict is the investigation of a massacre that reveals systemic corruption touching every institution the players serve. Each player represents a different approach to justice—violence, procedure, or public heroism—creating internal conflict as they discover that all approaches are compromised. The campaign asks: What is justice when the system is corrupt? How far will you go outside the law to achieve it? Can you maintain your principles while getting your hands dirty? And what happens when the city's image matters more than the truth? "Rollo Tomasi" becomes the symbol of justice the system can't provide—whatever that means to each player personally.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Corruption Layers**
*   The investigation reveals corruption in layers, each deeper than the last.
*   Different factions are corrupt in different ways, creating moral complexity.
*   Players must decide which corruption to expose and which to use for leverage.

### 2. **Justice Approaches**
*   Each player has a different approach to justice that provides different mechanical and narrative benefits.
*   Brutal violence gets results but compromises principles; procedure is clean but slow; celebrity justice is public but superficial.
*   Player approaches can complement or conflict based on the situation and choices.

### 3. **Rollo Tomasi System**
*   Players can invoke "Rollo Tomasi"—their personal symbol of justice—for powerful but costly actions.
*   This represents going outside the law for justice the system won't provide.
*   Using it has consequences but feels emotionally satisfying.

### 4. **The Hush-Hush Tracker**
*   Shows what scandals are public, what's being covered up, and what powerful people want buried.
*   Exposing secrets provides leverage but creates powerful enemies.
*   The campaign can end with everything exposed or with hush-hush deals that bury inconvenient truths.
