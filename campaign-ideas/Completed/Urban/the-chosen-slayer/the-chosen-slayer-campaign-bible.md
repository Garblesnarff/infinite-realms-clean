# Campaign Bible: The Chosen Slayer / Infinite Realms

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth
In the primordial era, before the continents drifted apart, the Shadow Men of the Savannah realized they could not hunt the Old Ones—pure demons of immense size and cruelty—with spears alone. In a ritual that defied the natural order, they chained a young girl to the earth and infused her with the heart of a shadow demon. This violation birthed the First Slayer, a human-demon hybrid anchored to the light but powered by darkness. The Shadow Men believed they created a weapon; instead, they created a lineage of lonely gods. The Slayer is not just a warrior; she is the universe's immune response, a biological necessity that ensures humanity survives its own ignorance of the dark.

### Timeline of the Hellmouth
1.  **Pre-History:** The Old Ones are banished from this dimension, but their "breath" remains trapped in deep subterranean pockets. One such pocket settles beneath what will become California.
2.  **1799:** Spanish missionaries found the Mission of Santa Rosita. Within a week, the monks inexplicably sew their own mouths shut and die of thirst. The Vatican buries the records.
3.  **1812:** An earthquake swallows a Russian fur-trading outpost. Local indigenous tribes refuse to go near the crater, claiming the earth "chewed" the settlers.
4.  **1899:** Mayor Richard Wilkins founds Sunnydale. He signs a pact with the demon Larnig in blood and lemon juice (invisible ink) on the town charter, granting him immortality in exchange for turning the town into a "feeding trough."
5.  **1920:** A Prohibition-era speakeasy, *The Blind Tiger*, accidentally serves "Demon Gin." Patrons turn into literal tigers. The National Guard firebombs the block; it is blamed on a gas leak.
6.  **1955:** The "Sunnydale High Prom Massacre." A greaser gang races their hot rods through a portal to a hell dimension. They return 40 years later, unaged, still demanding malt shakes.
7.  **1996:** The Master, a vampire king, rises from the sewers but gets stuck in a magical barrier because he forgot to account for the shifting tectonic plates. He waits, annoyed.
8.  **1997:** **(Current Era Start)** Buffy Summers burns down her previous school gym (full of vampires) and moves to Sunnydale.
9.  **The Week of Endless Tuesday:** A warlock trying to extend a deadline accidentally loops Tuesday for three years. Only the Slayer and the warlock notice.
10. **The Great Cabbage Patch Riot:** A possessed shipment of dolls in 1983 causes a riot that burns down the local mall. The dolls are still buried in the landfill, screaming.

### The "Why" (Metaphysical Conflict)
The Hellmouth is not just a door; it is a metaphysical magnet. Reality is thinner in Sunnydale. The conflict exists because the "membrane" between Earth and the Demon Dimensions requires constant friction to stay sealed. The Slayer's violence is the stitch that holds the fabric together. If the fighting stops, the wound opens. Peace is the apocalypse.

## 8. MECHANICS

[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Reality Bending: The Hellmouth Effect
*   **The Weirdness Magnet:** If a player rolls a Natural 1 on a Knowledge check, they don't just fail; they hallucinate a truth that isn't real yet.
*   **Narrative Causality:** Saying "At least it can't get any worse" triggers an immediate encounter roll.

### Subsystems
1.  **Sanity (The Trauma Track):** Characters have a "Trauma" score (0-10). At 10, they gain a permanent quirk (e.g., "Mute," "Afraid of Bunnies"). Reduced by "Normalcy" activities (Bowling, watching movies).
2.  **Research Montage:** Players can pool INT checks. 3 Successes = They find the monster's weakness. Failures = They find the wrong weakness (e.g., "Fire heals it").
3.  **Dusting:** Vampires do not leave corpses. Looting must be done *before* the kill or immediately after (catching the dust).
