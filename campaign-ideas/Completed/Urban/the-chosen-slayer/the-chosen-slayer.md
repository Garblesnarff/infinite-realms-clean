The party includes the Slayer—a teenage girl chosen by mystical forces to fight vampires and demons—and her "Scooby Gang" of friends, mentors, and reluctant allies.

They must balance typical high school problems (tests, relationships, social hierarchies) with nightly vampire patrols and apocalypse prevention, learning that growing up is the real monster—but literal monsters help put it in perspective.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Vampires dust when staked, demons have specific weaknesses. Combat is frequent but survivable with research and tactics.
*   **Investigation:** Mix of occult research, prophecy interpretation, and recognizing patterns in supernatural attacks.
*   **Consequences:** Death is possible but rare for main characters. The greater threats are emotional trauma, corruption, and world-ending prophecies.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **the burden of being chosen**. The Slayer didn't ask for power or responsibility, but destiny called. It explores loneliness of heroism, the cost of saving the world repeatedly, and whether one person should bear humanity's burden—or if power should be shared. Growing up means accepting responsibility, loss, and that life isn't fair—but friends make it bearable.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Slayer Powers**

*   Enhanced strength, speed, healing, and danger sense (prophetic dreams).
*   **The Burden:** Only one Slayer exists at a time (until the finale). If she dies, another is called.

### 2. **Scooby Gang Research**

*   Before major threats, party researches in libraries, occult texts, or online.
*   **Knowledge is Power:** Successful research reveals monster weaknesses, ritual requirements, or prophecies.

### 3. **Vampires and Stakes**

*   Vampires turn to dust when staked through the heart, beheaded, or exposed to sunlight.
*   **Feeding:** Vampires can create minions quickly, making numbers their advantage.

### 4. **High School as Metaphor**

*   Monsters represent teen anxieties—invisible (feeling overlooked), controlled by others (possession), turning into something monstrous (adolescence).

### 5. **The Wish Spell**

*   Vengeance demons grant wishes with twisted consequences.
*   **Alternate Timelines:** Wishes can create dark alternate realities that must be undone.
