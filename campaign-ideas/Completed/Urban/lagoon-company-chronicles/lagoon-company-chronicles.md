The party joins the Lagoon Company—modern pirates and smugglers operating in Roanapur, Thailand's lawless criminal haven. One member is a former corporate employee dragged into this world, learning that morality is a luxury the damned can't afford. They run jobs for cartels, triads, and the Russian mob while Revy—a nihilistic gunslinger—teaches them that violence is the only language Roanapur speaks. It's a story about losing your innocence and accepting damnation.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Enemies use modern firearms, explosives, and military tactics. One mistake means death.
*   **Investigation:** Criminal networks are paranoid and violent. Information costs blood.
*   **Consequences:** Betrayal is constant. Allies become enemies. Everyone has a price.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions)

A descent into moral darkness where survival trumps ethics.

*   **Act I — Welcome to Roanapur (Sessions 1–3):** The party is introduced to Roanapur's chaos, meets the major crime factions, and runs simple smuggling jobs while the innocent member adjusts.
*   **Act II — Blood Money (Sessions 4–7):** Increasingly dangerous jobs—rescuing kidnapped heirs, smuggling weapons, fighting cartels. The line between right and wrong blurs.
*   **Act III — Revy's Past (Sessions 8–10):** Revy's traumatic childhood resurfaces. The party confronts that everyone in Roanapur is broken. They're not heroes—just survivors.
*   **Act IV — The Vampire Twins (Sessions 11–13):** Psychotic child assassins arrive, representing pure nihilism. Final jobs test whether the party has any humanity left.
