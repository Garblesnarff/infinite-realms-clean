# Lagoon Company Chronicles [CAMPAIGN: Urban Fantasy (Action/Adventure)]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In the lawless, pirate-infested port city of Roanapur, a melting pot of cultures, crime, and hidden magic, a crew of morally ambiguous mercenaries, the "Lagoon Company," takes on dangerous jobs for various criminal organizations. From high-stakes smuggling runs and daring rescues to brutal assassinations and intricate heists, they navigate a world of gunfights, explosions, and shifting alliances. Beneath the surface of this gritty, modern chaos, ancient magical threats stir, and the players, as members of the Lagoon Company, find themselves caught between the mundane underworld and a hidden supernatural war, fighting for survival, profit, and a semblance of freedom in a city that thrives on violence.

## Setting [SETTING: Modern Pirate City]
Roanapur is a sprawling, chaotic port city, a haven for criminals, mercenaries, and those seeking to disappear from the world. It's a place where anything can be bought or sold, and loyalty is a rare commodity. The aesthetic is gritty, modern, and action-packed, with a constant undercurrent of tension and danger. Skyscrapers stand alongside dilapidated docks, neon signs illuminate dark alleyways, and the air is thick with the smell of salt, gunpowder, and exotic spices. Magic is subtle but present, often manifesting as curses, blessings, or the strange abilities of certain individuals.
