# Campaign Bible: The Dark Lord's Day Job

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth
In the beginning, the cosmos was divided not by good and evil, but by **Productivity** and **Leisure**. The realm of Ente Isla was forged from the sweat of titans, a world where worth was measured in conquest and magical output. But as the cosmic balance shifted, a metaphysical drain formed—a puncture in reality leading to a realm of pure Chaos, known only as "The Big Apple." Here, magic does not flow through ley lines but is ground into a fine dust by the turning of turnstiles and the crushing weight of capitalism. When the Demon Lord Maou was blasted through the void, he did not fall into hell; he fell into the ultimate crucible of the soul: The Service Industry.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-500 Years (Ente Isla):** The Great Separation. Humans and Demons agree to disagree, mostly by stabbing each other.
2.  **-20 Years (Ente Isla):** Maou ascends to the Obsidian Throne, promising affordable healthcare and total domination.
3.  **-1 Year (Ente Isla):** Hero Emilia completes the "Grind of Destiny," leveling up sufficiently to kick down Maou's door.
4.  **Day 0 (The Fall):** The Final Battle. Emilia casts *Dimensional Punt*. Maou and generals land in a dumpster behind a Times Square McRonald's.
5.  **Day 2:** General Alciel discovers the concept of "Inflation" and weeps openly in a bodega.
6.  **Day 7:** The "Fryer Incident." Maou instinctively uses Hellfire to heat the oil, creating the crispest fry known to man. He is hired immediately.
7.  **Month 1:** The Veil Council notices a spike in demonic energy, traced to a disgruntled customer dispute over pickles.
8.  **Month 2:** The "Latte Art Skirmish." A local witch Coven declares turf war on the McRonald's breakfast crew.
9.  **Month 3:** A Pigeon steals the last fragment of Maou’s Mana Crystal. The Pigeon is now the size of a minivan (The Great Pigeon Crisis).
10. **Current Day:** Rent is due in 48 hours. The fate of the world takes a backseat to the threat of eviction.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The conflict is no longer Light vs. Dark, but **Identity vs. Reality**. The universe of Earth is a "Magic Sink"—it actively drains supernatural energy to fuel its mundane laws of physics. To survive, magical beings must either consume others (become monsters) or generate "Stability" through mundane routines (become citizens). The struggle is to maintain one's soul without magic to prop it up.
