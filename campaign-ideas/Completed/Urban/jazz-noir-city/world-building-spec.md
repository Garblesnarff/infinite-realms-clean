# Jazz Noir City - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Flatfoot Guild
**Formal Name:** The Order of Investigative Harmonies
**Founded:** Year 1 of Crescendo City (dimensional founding)
**Current Membership:** ~200 active detectives
**Headquarters:** The Union Station (converted train depot)

**Organizational Structure:**
- **Grand Conductor:** Maestro Ellington (retired detective, blind, "sees" through sound)
- **First Chair Detectives:** 12 master investigators, each specializing in different jazz styles
- **Journeyman Flatfoots:** 50 experienced detectives with established cases
- **Rookies:** 138 trainees learning musical investigation techniques

**Philosophy:**
Truth is harmony; lies create dissonance. Every crime scene has a musical signature that reveals what happened. Detectives train for years to "read" these signatures like sheet music.

**Methods:**
- Musical Investigation: Using instruments to reveal hidden clues
- Harmonic Interrogation: Detecting lies through vocal analysis
- Scene Composition: Reconstructing crimes through musical reenactment
- Evidence Preservation: Recording crime scenes as musical notation

**Guild Benefits:**
- Access to the Evidence Archive (recorded crimes from 100+ years)
- Informant Network across all districts
- Legal authority to investigate anywhere in the city
- Training in improvisation magic

**Internal Conflicts:**
- Traditional detectives vs. new-school "fusion" investigators
- Debate over working with criminals (Syndicate, Collective)
- Corruption within ranks (some take bribes to suppress investigations)
- Disagreement on dimensional politics (isolationist vs. interventionist)

**Key Members Beyond Main NPCs:**
- **Detective Minnie:** Specialist in ragtime reconstruction (can "rewind" time at crime scenes)
- **Sergeant Parker:** Bird-like aarakocra, bebop expert, impulsive but brilliant
- **Inspector Monk:** Uses dissonant magic to break illusions and lies
- **Flatfoot Ella:** Voice specialist, can identify anyone by their vocal signature

### The Blue Note Syndicate
**Formal Name:** The Blue Note Preservation Society
**Founded:** Year 23 (response to increasing dimensional instability)
**Current Membership:** ~500 core members, thousands of associates
**Territory:** Waterfront, Industrial District, Old Town

**Organizational Structure:**
- **The Founder's Chair:** Currently vacant (was Solomon Keys)
- **The Four Standards:** Top lieutenants, each controlling a district
  - Big Brassy Bruno (Waterfront)
  - Stella "Starlight" Nova (Old Town)
  - The Count (Industrial District)
  - Lady Day (Cultural District)
- **Made Musicians:** ~100 enforcers with combat training
- **Associates:** Business owners paying protection, informants, corrupt officials

**Philosophy:**
Traditional jazz is dying. The old standards, the classic compositions, the respect for the art form—all being lost to chaos and fusion. The Syndicate preserves the pure form of jazz and the city's original culture, by force if necessary.

**Operations:**
- Protection rackets (legitimate: they do protect businesses)
- Smuggling instruments and sheet music from other dimensions
- Control of major performance venues
- Illegal gambling dens and speakeasies
- Enforcement of "musical standards" (harassing fusion musicians)

**Code of Conduct:**
- Never harm civilians who respect the music
- Always keep your word (a standard is unchanging)
- Dress with respect (the suit maketh the musician)
- Improvisation within structure (follow the form)
- Protect the city from outside influences

**Internal Conflicts:**
- Debate over Solomon Keys' disappearance and who should lead
- Younger members want to modernize, elders resist
- Tension with Flatfoot Guild (some detectives are on payroll)
- Disagreement on how to handle the Bebop Collective (war vs. coexistence)

**Key Members:**
- **Big Brassy Bruno:** Half-orc, tuba player, enforcer with a code of honor
- **Stella "Starlight" Nova:** Chanteuse who runs high-class speakeasies
- **The Count:** Vampire (literally), runs the Industrial District with iron fist
- **Lady Day:** Former Guild detective, betrayed them after partner's death
- **Fingers McGee:** Master pickpocket and infiltrator
- **Sax "The Knife" Mulligan:** Assassin who only kills those who disrespect jazz

### The Bebop Collective
**Formal Name:** The Free Improvisers' Collective
**Founded:** Year 67 (recent, formed in opposition to Syndicate)
**Current Membership:** Fluid, ~800 at any given time
**Territory:** Underground, rooftops, abandoned buildings, anywhere authority isn't

**Organizational Structure:**
Deliberately chaotic, rejects hierarchy
- **The Circle:** Rotating council of 7, changes weekly
- **Current Voice:** Thelonious (emerged as natural leader despite anti-authority stance)
- **Cell Structure:** Small independent groups coordinate loosely
- **Everyone is Equal:** No ranks, no titles, pure democracy (in theory)

**Philosophy:**
All authority is oppression. Music must be free to evolve, change, chaos is creativity. The Syndicate's preservation is stagnation. Break all rules, follow no standards, improvise constantly. The city's rigidity is killing it—only chaos can save it.

**Operations:**
- Guerrilla performances in public spaces
- Vandalism of Syndicate properties (with artistic graffiti)
- Helping dimensional refugees
- Running underground clubs and jam sessions
- Sabotaging "oppressive" organizations (including government)
- Distributing free instruments to the poor

**Code (such as it is):**
- Question everything
- No permanent hierarchy
- Music belongs to everyone
- Chaos is not violence (mostly peaceful protest)
- Protect the outcasts
- Express yourself completely

**Internal Conflicts:**
- Constant leadership struggles (by design)
- Violent faction vs. peaceful resistors
- Some members are criminals hiding behind ideology
- Debate over allying with anyone (even against worse threats)
- Thelonious's growing authority contradicts their philosophy

**Key Members:**
- **Thelonious:** Reluctant leader, genius pianist, complex motivations
- **Dizzy Chromatic:** Chaos mage, comic relief, secretly very dangerous
- **Bird:** Legendary street performer, disappeared but followers remain
- **The Coltrane Sisters:** Triplets who finish each other's sentences/melodies
- **Free Willie:** Graffiti artist whose murals come alive
- **Modal Mike:** Experimental magician working on new forms of jazz magic

### The Silent Hand
**Formal Name:** Unknown (they don't name themselves)
**Founded:** Unknown (possibly as old as the city)
**Current Membership:** Unknown (estimated 20-50)
**Territory:** They operate everywhere, visible nowhere

**Organizational Structure:**
Unknown. Players might never fully understand their hierarchy.

**Philosophy:**
Music is chaos. Silence is peace. The city's suffering comes from sound itself. All dimensions should be collapsed into the Void—the space between notes, the rests, the silence. Only in absence of sound can true peace exist.

**Operations:**
- Possession of key individuals (Sergeant Brass, others)
- Sabotaging dimensional barriers
- Assassinating powerful musicians
- Spreading "deafness"—magical silence that corrupts
- Recruiting those who've suffered from music's chaos

Their god/patron/source. A being from outside all musical dimensions, representing the absence of creativity, the heat death of culture, entropy itself.

## Causality Chains and Sonic Conflicts

### The Solomon Keys Mystery

**What Really Happened:**
1. Solomon discovered dimensional barriers failing (6 months ago)
2. Investigated cause, found the Silent Hand
3. Realized they couldn't be stopped conventionally
4. Created the five Soul Notes as solution
5. Faked his death to hide from the Silent Hand
6. Distributed his consciousness across the Notes
7. Left clues for worthy successors (the players)

**Why Velvet Believes He's Dead:**
1. She found his body in Warehouse 7
2. The body was real (magical clone)
3. She grieved genuinely
4. Grief turned to obsession with preventing future loss
5. The Silent Hand manipulated her grief
6. She made a deal with them (unknowingly)
7. Her plan actually serves them despite intentions

**The Truth About the Soul Notes:**
1. Each contains 20% of Solomon's consciousness
2. They also contain solutions to specific problems:
   - Note 1: How to identify the Silent Hand
   - Note 2: How to strengthen dimensional barriers
   - Note 3: How to purge Dissonance possession
   - Note 4: How to create Harmony Gates
   - Note 5: How to restore the City Song
3. Together they can resurrect Solomon OR save the city (not both)
4. Players must choose (emotional climax)

### Dimensional Barrier Degradation

**Timeline:**
- **1 year ago:** First microscopic cracks appear
- **6 months ago:** Solomon detects the problem
- **3 months ago:** Solomon "dies"
- **Campaign start:** Barriers at 70% integrity
- **Arc 1 end:** First major breach (Heavy Metal Hell bleed-through)
- **Arc 2 end:** Multiple small breaches daily
- **Arc 3 end:** Barriers at 40% integrity
- **Arc 4:** If players fail, complete collapse in 48 hours

**Causes:**
1. **Primary:** Silent Hand sabotage
2. **Secondary:** Syndicate's isolationist magic reinforced barriers badly
3. **Tertiary:** Collective's chaos magic destabilized weak points
4. **Contributing:** Natural entropy (barriers aren't permanent)
5. **Accelerating:** Velvet's ritual is making everything worse

**Effects of Degradation:**
- Reality bleed (aesthetics from other dimensions)
- Genre confusion (jazz becomes jazz-rock, jazz-metal, etc.)
- Refugees from other dimensions arrive unexpectedly
- Local magic becomes unpredictable
- The City Song develops more dissonance
- Eventually: complete dimensional merger or collapse

### The City Song Corruption

**Healthy State:**
- Unified melody all citizens contribute to unconsciously
- Creates shared emotional landscape
- Maintains dimensional integrity
- Sounds like late-night Bill Evans trio

**Corrupted States (Progressive):**
1. **Slight Dissonance (Arc 1):** Wrong notes occasionally, people feel uneasy
2. **Frequent Discord (Arc 2):** Fights break out more often, crime increases
3. **Harmonic Breakdown (Arc 3):** Citizens begin losing connection to reality
4. **Cacophony (Arc 4):** Mass hysteria, violence, dimensional instability

**Sources of Corruption:**
1. Silent Hand's Un-Song spreading through sewers
2. Faction conflict creating literal dissonance
3. Barrier degradation allowing outside influences
4. Citizens' fear and despair affecting the collective
5. Velvet's ritual imposing artificial harmony (equally bad)

**Restoration Requirements:**
1. Defeat or redeem major faction leaders
2. Unite citizens in common cause
3. Purge Silent Hand influence
4. Repair dimensional barriers
5. Perform healing ritual with Soul Notes
6. Players must contribute their own song

## World History

### The First Jazz War (150 years ago)

**The Belligerents:**
- **Classical Symphony Kingdom:** Rigid, authoritarian, believed in "correct" music
- **Romantic Opera Empire:** Emotional, dramatic, believed in individual expression
- **Folk Song Confederacy:** Decentralized, cultural preservation focused
- **Marching Band Militocracy:** Martial, disciplined, conquest-driven

**The Conflict:**
Each dimension tried to impose their musical philosophy on others. Millions died. Entire dimensions were silenced. Weapons of mass dissonance devastated populations.

**The Refugees:**
Musicians who rejected the war fled to the spaces between dimensions. Led by the First Conductors, they used improvisation (jazz, newly created) to forge a new dimension from the void.

**Crescendo City's Founding:**
Built in a pocket dimension using pure musical creation. The City Song was the foundation—everyone who lived there contributed to reality itself. It was meant to be a sanctuary where all musical philosophies could coexist.

**The Treaty of the Five Keys:**
Solomon Keys' ancestor brokered peace between dimensions. Established:
1. Dimensional sovereignty (non-interference)
2. Controlled portals for trade
3. Crescendo City as neutral ground
4. The Lighthouse as beacon/warning system
5. Emergency protocols if war returned

### The Bebop Uprising (5 years ago)

**Causes:**
- Syndicate became increasingly controlling
- Younger generation rejected "standards"
- Economic inequality in the city
- Influx of new musical ideas from other dimensions
- Prohibition on certain improvisation techniques

**The Conflict:**
Started as peaceful protests, escalated to violence. Three months of street fighting. The city nearly tore itself apart.

**Resolution:**
Solomon Keys mediated compromise:
- Bebop recognized as legitimate art form
- Underground territories granted semi-autonomy
- Some regulations relaxed
- But fundamental power structures unchanged

**Legacy:**
Uneasy peace. Both sides resent the compromise. Sets stage for current tensions.

### The Silent Hand's Origins (Unknown Age)

**Theories:**
1. They predate all musical dimensions (original void)
2. They're musicians who went mad from dissonance
3. They're from a dimension where music was destroyed
4. They're a natural force (entropy given consciousness)
5. They're the space between notes made manifest

**Known Facts:**
- They've attacked civilizations before
- They always work through corruption and possession
- They can't create, only destroy
- They're attracted to great works of musical creation
- They view all sound as suffering

**Previous Attacks:**
- Destroyed the Gregorian Chant Monastery dimension (1000 years ago)
- Corrupted the Siren's Song (forcing their dimension into lockdown)
- Attempted to silence the Folk Song Confederacy (failed)
- Now targeting Crescendo City (most diverse musical creation)

## Additional Lore

### Musical Magic Theory

**The Three Forms:**
1. **Composition Magic:** Pre-written spells (reliable but inflexible)
2. **Improvisation Magic:** Created in the moment (unpredictable but powerful)
3. **Harmony Magic:** Multiple casters working together (exponentially powerful)

**Skill Requirements:**
- Musical training (instrument or voice)
- Understanding of theory (patterns and structures)
- Emotional openness (music is feeling)
- Practice and discipline
- Natural talent helps but isn't required

**Limitations:**
- Can't work in silence (Mute spell is devastating)
- Requires concentration (can't perform while badly injured)
- Genre-specific (a bebop musician can't easily cast swing spells)
- Emotional state affects power (depression weakens magic)
- Some people are "tone deaf" (can't cast at all)

### Dimensional Travel

**Methods:**
1. Harmony Gates (official, regulated, safe)
2. Dissonance Rifts (dangerous, unstable, unpredictable)
3. Musical Synchronization (matching your song to target dimension)
4. Lighthouse Navigation (only for experienced travelers)
5. Wild Portals (appear randomly, very dangerous)

**Dangers:**
- Getting lost between dimensions
- Arriving in hostile dimension
- Genre shock (adapting to different physics)
- Dissonance sickness (reality rejection)
- Temporal distortion (time flows differently)

**Known Accessible Dimensions:**
1. Classical Symphony Kingdom (orderly, beautiful, restrictive)
2. Heavy Metal Hell (chaotic, violent, liberating)
3. EDM Rave Dimension (energetic, modern, overwhelming)
4. Folk Song Meadows (peaceful, traditional, isolated)
5. Opera Dramatic Empire (emotional, theatrical, dangerous)
6. The Silence (avoid at all costs)

### Economics and Daily Life

**Currency:**
- Standard Notes (paper money)
- Platinum Records (valuable)
- Soul Residue (magical currency)
- Barter is common (especially underground)

**Occupations:**
- Musician (most respected)
- Detective (mysterious and cool)
- Merchant (traveling between dimensions)
- Service worker (clubs, restaurants, etc.)
- Craftsperson (instruments, magical items)
- Criminal (various types)

**Daily Routine:**
- City operates on "night shift" mentality
- Peak activity: 10 PM to 4 AM
- Most businesses open late afternoon
- The "day" is dim twilight, "night" is performance time
- Few people see actual sunlight

**Social Structure:**
- Merit-based (how well you play)
- Genre prejudice (classical looks down on bebop, etc.)
- Wealth disparity (Sugar Hill vs. Underground)
- Creativity valued above all
- "Squares" (non-musicians) are second-class citizens

### Religion and Philosophy

**The Song Divine:**
Belief that music is the voice of creation itself. Different denominations:
- **Traditionalists:** Old songs are prayers, standards are scripture
- **Progressives:** All new music is divine revelation
- **Mystics:** Silence between notes is where god lives
- **Atheists:** Music is just physics, no meaning beyond

**The First Note:**
Creation myth: Reality began with a single note. Everything since is harmonics and overtones of that original sound. When all music ends, reality ends.

**Death and Afterlife:**
Musicians believe their song joins the eternal symphony. Non-musicians fade to silence. The truly great become echoes heard forever.

**Ethics:**
- Creating is good
- Silencing is evil
- Copying is controversial (honoring tradition vs. stifling creativity)
- Improvisation is sacred
- Harmony is ideal but discord is necessary

### The Sixth Soul Note (Secret)

**Existence:**
Solomon created a sixth note representing rest/silence—the most powerful because it's the space where music happens.

**Location:**
Hidden in plain sight—it's the pause between his heartbeats in the moment of his "death," captured in temporal stasis in Warehouse 7.

**Power:**
Can rewrite reality on fundamental level. Could save the city, destroy it, or transform it into something entirely new.

**Danger:**
The Silent Hand desperately wants it. If they get it, they win permanently.

**Discovery:**
Players can only find it if they:
1. Understand the importance of rests in music
2. Think to investigate the exact moment of death
3. Have all five other notes (it resonates with them)
4. Collectively create perfect silence (near-impossible)

**Use:**
Could resurrect Solomon completely, or sacrifice it to permanently seal dimensional barriers, or use it to create entirely new solution players devise.
