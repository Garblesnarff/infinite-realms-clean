# Cartel Wars - World-Building Specification

## The Southern Kingdoms (Colombia Equivalent)

Tropical nation rich in natural resources and magical coca. History of colonialism, class division, and institutional weakness makes it perfect for cartel growth.

### The Cartels

**Medellín Cartel**:
- Leader: Pablo Escobar analogue
- Style: Violent, direct, terroristic
- Strength: Loyalty, ruthlessness, popular support
- Weakness: Attention-drawing, unsustainable violence
- Fall: Pride and escalation

**Cali Cartel**:
- Leaders: Rodríguez brothers
- Style: Corporate, quiet, patient
- Strength: Infiltration, legitimate facades
- Weakness: Eventually exposed through finances
- Legacy: Proved smarter approach still fails

**Mexican Cartels** (Later):
- Rising powers filling vacuum
- More violent than Medellín
- More sophisticated than Cali
- Future of the trade

### Law Enforcement

**DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency)**:
- American agents operating abroad
- Advanced resources, cultural outsiders
- Moral compromises in foreign land
- Personal costs of endless war

**Colombian National Police**:
- Some heroes, many corrupted
- Under-resourced, outgunned
- Caught between cartels and government
- High casualty rate

**Los Pepes** (People Persecuted by Pablo):
- Vigilante group, cartel-funded
- Enemy of my enemy
- Morally questionable allies
- Effective but disturbing

### The Cycle

1. Cartel rises to power
2. Violence and corruption spread
3. Government forced to respond
4. International pressure mounts
5. Major operation launched
6. Cartel leader killed/captured
7. New cartel rises to fill void
8. Repeat infinitely

### The Cost

**Colombian civilians**: Thousands dead in crossfire
**Police and military**: Outgunned, often corrupted
**Politicians**: Assassinated or bought
**American agents**: PTSD, broken marriages, moral injury
**Cartel families**: Wealth built on blood, always ends badly
**Society**: Institutional collapse, trauma for generations

### The Questions

- Can you fight evil without becoming it?
- Is American intervention helping or hurting?
- Do ends justify means?
- Can war on drugs be won?
- Who profits from eternal conflict?

### The Truth

The war on drugs is unwinnable. Demand exists, supply will meet it. Catching one kingpin creates three more. Violence begets violence. And everyone involved—cops, criminals, politicians—gets corrupted by proximity to it.

This campaign doesn't have heroes. Just people trying to survive in an impossible situation. Some choose violence, some choose law, but the game is rigged and everyone loses eventually.

"Plata o plomo" - Silver or lead. Those are the choices. And neither one saves your soul.
