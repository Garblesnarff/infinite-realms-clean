# Campaign Bible: Fates Warning

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Thread
In the beginning, the universe was a single, perfect **Cosmic Thread**, holding within it the promise of infinite destiny and order. But the Cosmic Thread was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant decay, hidden patterns, and rebirth. The "Fates" are not just the residue of divine creation; it is the dust of countless shattered destinies, the memory of every lost thread. The "Warning" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Cosmic Thread's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the Thread and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Cosmic Thread's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of destined remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Cosmic Thread is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of decay and hidden patterns.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Thread):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its destined dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Pattern Plague):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic Thread's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost thread, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Thread Cult):** Mortals discover the power of destiny and form the Thread Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the Thread.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Unraveling):** A rogue Thread Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Thread-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Fates, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic Thread's fury causes all beings to remember every lost thread, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Cosmic Thread's Whisper):** The Cosmic Thread, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Cosmic Thread, the **Essence of Free Will**, is stolen from the Thread Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the Thread Cult, each with their own unique connection to destiny. They are caught in a crisis as the Cosmic Thread's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of destined remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Destiny
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Cosmic Thread's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of decay and hidden patterns, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The Thread Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become Thread Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Destiny Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted thread, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Cosmic Thread's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Thread-Weaving
*   **Thread-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the destined dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Thread-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Thread-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
