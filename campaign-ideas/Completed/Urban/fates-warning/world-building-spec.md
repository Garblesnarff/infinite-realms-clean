### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Fate's Warning**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A diviner mage in London sees probability paths and future outcomes while avoiding Light Council and Dark mage attention. They navigate magical politics where Light Council claims morality but is corrupt, Dark mages pursue power but aren't necessarily evil, and independents face persecution from both sides. Their former Dark master Richard Drakh seeks to reclaim them for apocalyptic plans. Seeing the future means watching disasters approach with no good way to stop them.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Light Council's formation and its claim to moral authority over mages.
    *   Write the history of Light-Dark conflicts and why Dark mages reject Council rule.
    *   Describe divination magic—seeing probability paths, navigating futures, precognitive combat.
    *   Explain why many Light Council mages are as bad as or worse than Dark mages.
    *   Detail Richard Drakh's history training apprentices as pawns for his long-term plans.
    *   Describe Elsewhere—pocket dimensions where mages can hide from scrying and attack.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Light Council** (Major): Organized mages claiming moral authority, politically corrupt, enforce control.
    *   **Dark Mages** (Major): Independent mages pursuing power without Council restrictions, not organized.
    *   **Independents** (Minor): Mages avoiding both Light and Dark, often persecuted by both.
    *   **Adepts** (Minor): Humans with minor magical abilities, often exploited by mages.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Light Mage" (various specialties), "Dark Mage" (various powers), "Council Keeper" (enforcer), "Adept" (minor talents).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Arcana Emporium:** Diviner's magic shop in Camden, neutral ground.
*   **Council Chambers:** Formal meeting place, political arena as dangerous as any Dark lair.
*   **Shadow Realm:** Dimension of living darkness, dangerous and alien.
*   **Arachne's Cave:** Ancient being's home, safe refuge outside politics.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Diviner uses precognition in combat → **THEN:** See attacks before they happen, navigate probability for survival.
*   **IF:** Mage defies Council orders → **THEN:** Labeled as enemy, hunted by Keepers, potential execution.
*   **IF:** Life magic crosses certain lines → **THEN:** Becomes as dangerous as death magic, feared by all factions.
*   **IF:** Richard completes his plan → **THEN:** Gains power that makes him untouchable, reshapes magical world.
*   **IF:** Civil war within Council → **THEN:** All mages forced to choose sides, neutrality impossible.
