# Campaign Bible: The Crimson Thread of Silverport

---

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

**Origin Myth: The Hoard of Moments**
Standard myths claim Silverport was founded on a dragon’s gold. The truth is far more volatile. The Great Wyrm, *Aethelgard the Chronophage*, did not hoard gold; it hoarded *potential*. It consumed the futures of entire civilizations, freezing them in crystal stasis—pure, solidified time known as "Ghost-Silver." When Marius Thorne slew the beast, he didn't just liberate wealth; he shattered a dam of temporal energy. The city of Silverport is built upon a bleeding wound in causality. The "Crimson Thread" is not a cult symbol, but the visible scar tissue of reality trying to stitch itself back together, and the "Silver Rush" is a scramble for crystallized seconds that can extend life or rewrite mistakes.

**Timeline of Silverport**
1.  **-50 BF (Before Founding):** The Chronophage crashes into the Grey Coast. The area becomes a "no-time" zone where seasons change hourly.
2.  **0 BF:** The slaying of Aethelgard. Marius Thorne strikes the killing blow. The dragon explodes into a rain of silver dust.
3.  **5 AF (After Founding):** *The Mud-Lark Rebellion.* Miners discover that inhaling silver dust allows them to speak to the dead. Thorne bans the practice.
4.  **12 AF:** *The Night of Floating Ships.* Gravity momentarily inverted in the harbor. Three galleons drifted into the stratosphere and never returned.
5.  **20 AF:** Founding of the Iron Crows. Originally a burial society for those who died of "Time-Sickness" (rapid aging).
6.  **25 AF:** *The Weeping Wall Incident.* The city’s defensive wall began shedding tears of blood (The Crimson Thread's first manifestation).
7.  **30 AF (Act I Start):** The Great Expansion. Silverport is a boomtown.
8.  **45 AF:** *The Silence.* For three days, no sound could be produced within the city limits. Deals were signed in blood and pantomime.
9.  **48 AF:** The Spire of Seconds is constructed by the Vane family to "anchor" the city's timeline.
10. **60 AF:** *The Reflection Wars.* Dopplegangers from a potential future timeline invade the present to ensure their own creation.

**The "Why": The Metaphysical Conflict**
The conflict exists because Silverport shouldn't exist. The city is using "borrowed time" from the dragon's hoard to accelerate its growth. The Crimson Thread is the universe's immune system trying to reject the city, unraveling the timeline to return the coast to its natural, barren state.
