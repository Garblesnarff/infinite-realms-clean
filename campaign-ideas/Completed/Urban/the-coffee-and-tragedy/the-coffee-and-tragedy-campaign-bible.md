# Campaign Bible: The Coffee and Tragedy

**Lead Designer Note:** This Bible adapts the provided source material into a playable TTRPG format. While the core "Canon" characters (Kaneki, Touka) remain as pivotal anchors, the world has been expanded with "Low Probability/High Weirdness" elements to ensure the setting feels unpredictable and distinct from a standard retelling.

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Red Solstice
Standard biology textbooks claim "RC Cells" are a mutation. The truth is far stranger. Ghouls are not a species; they are a biological "glitch" in the planet's digestion of souls. Centuries ago, a metaphysical event known as the **Red Solstice** occurred where the barrier between the physical plane and the "Hunger" (a cosmic entropy) thinned. Humans born during this alignment were infected not with a virus, but with a predatory echo. Their bodies became cages for this hunger, manifesting as the *Kagune*—a literal materialization of the soul trying to escape the flesh to feed. To be a Ghoul is to be a jailer of your own biology.

### Timeline of Tragedy
1.  **1890:** The "Red Solstice" event. First recorded cases of humans growing appendages of solidified blood.
2.  **1923 (The Great Kanto Earthquake):** Ghouls use the chaos to feed openly; the first "Predator Districts" are formed.
3.  **1945:** Post-war starvation leads to the "Black Market Meat" era; the CCG is founded by the Washuu Clan.
4.  **1980:** **The Concrete Garden Incident:** A ghoul architect builds an apartment complex entirely out of calcified bone/RC cells. It is demolished, but the dust infects a city block.
5.  **1999:** **The Silence of Ward 13:** An entire ward goes silent. CCG investigates to find every human and ghoul merged into a single biomass. The area is quarantined.
6.  **2005:** **The Owl's First Cry:** A legendary ghoul single-handedly wipes out a CCG division.
7.  **2010:** Anteiku is founded by Yoshimura in Ward 20 as a sanctuary.
8.  **2012:** **The Rain of Teeth:** A freak weather event where hail mixed with RC cells falls, causing mass hallucinations in the human populace.
9.  **2014:** The "Binge Eater" (Rize) moves to Ward 20.
10. **Present Day:** The Steel Beam Incident occurs. The Campaign begins.

### The "Why" (Metaphysics)
The conflict exists because the laws of physics in this world are allergic to "Peace." RC Cells (Red Child Cells) are sentient biological matter. They *want* conflict because conflict generates evolution. Peace causes RC cells to atrophy. Therefore, the universe itself conspires to create tragedy to keep the cells potent.
