## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Violence is brutal but tactical—guns, blades, explosions. Reputation and intimidation matter as much as combat.
*   **Investigation:** Political machinations, reading rivals, understanding who's using whom, navigating class warfare.
*   **Consequences:** Every action affects reputation among gangs, police, politicians, and revolutionaries. Betrayal is constant.

It's about post-war trauma, working-class rage, and refusing to accept your place.
