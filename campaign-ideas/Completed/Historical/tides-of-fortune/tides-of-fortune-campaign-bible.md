# Campaign Bible: Tides of Fortune - The Star-Tide Saga

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
# 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### Origin Myth: The Weeping of the Star-Titan
In the time before tides, the world was a scorched rock. The Star-Titan Aethelgard, pursuing a thief across the cosmos, crashed into the planet's crust. Dying, Aethelgard wept for a thousand years. These tears did not just form the oceans; they formed the **Star-Tide**, a liquid medium that is half-water, half-stardust, where gravity is a suggestion and reality is porous. The Sapphire Archipelago is not merely islands; they are the exposed, calcified vertebrae of the Titan. To sail here is to navigate the corpse of a god, where the water glows with memory and the winds whisper prophecies.

### Historical Timeline
1.  **The Impact (-1000 BE):** Aethelgard impacts. The "First Waters" drown the ancient fire-civilizations.
2.  **The Age of Drift (-800 BE):** Survivors build raft-cities on the Titan’s floating rib-bones.
3.  **The Binding of the Current (-500 BE):** The first Sea-Mages learn to braid water into solid bridges.
4.  **The Rise of the Pirate King (-200 BE):** Gol D. Aethel (The Pirate King) discovers the Titan’s Heart (The Treasure).
5.  **The Unification (-190 BE):** The Pirate King unites the factions not by force, but by showing them the "Edge of the Map"—a waterfall into the sky.
6.  **The Betrayal of Blackthorn (-150 BE):** First Mate Blackthorn attempts to steal a vial of the Titan’s blood. The King exiles him to the Shadow-Reef.
7.  **The Great Vanishing (-149 BE):** The Pirate King sails into a hurricane and never returns. The Curse of the Atoll begins.
8.  **The Year of Raining Fish (-80 BE):** *[Weird]* For one year, the sky rained living koi fish, flooding the lower markets of Port Royal with gold-scaled life.
9.  **The Awakening of the Whispering Corals (-20 BE):** *[Weird]* The reefs began to speak in the voices of drowned sailors, driving local fishermen to madness.
10. **The Current Day:** The Star-Tide has begun to recede, revealing ancient, alien structures beneath the waves.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is not about gold. The "Treasure of the Pirate King" is the **Titan's Pineal Gland**. Whoever controls it controls the physics of the ocean itself—able to raise islands, reverse currents, or drown the world in a second flood.
