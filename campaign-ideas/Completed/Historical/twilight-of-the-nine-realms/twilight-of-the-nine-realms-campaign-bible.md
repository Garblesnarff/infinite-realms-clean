# 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Song of the Sleeper
Before Yggdrasil pierced the void, there was only the **Ginnungagap**, which was not merely emptiness, but a silence so profound it possessed weight. The World Tree did not grow from a seed, but from a *scream*—the waking gasp of a sleeping cosmic titan named **Orlog** (Prime Fate). Yggdrasil is the nervous system of this titan, and the Nine Realms are merely organs suspended in its ribcage. Ragnarok is not an end, but a metaphysical immune response; the titan is feverish, and it seeks to burn out the infection of gods and mortals to return to the peace of the Great Silence.

### Timeline of the Realms
1.  **The First Breath:** Ymir is born not from ice and fire, but from the titan Orlog’s first exhale.
2.  **The Butcher's Art:** Odin and his brothers did not just kill Ymir; they performed surgery, grafting Ymir's flesh onto the titan's bones to create stability (Midgard).
3.  **The Golden Error:** The Vanir attempted to sing the titan back to sleep using *Seidr*, resulting in the first war with the Aesir, who preferred the titan awake to harvest its power.
4.  **The Binding of the Shadow:** Fenrir was chained not because he was big, but because he ate *conceptual light*. The chain, Gleipnir, is made of paradoxes to hold a creature that exists in 4D space.
5.  **The theft of Idunn’s Apples:** Idunn's apples are revealed to be crystallized clots of the titan’s blood; they grant immortality because they reset the consumer's biological time.
6.  **The Hollowing of Nidavellir:** The Dwarves dug too deep and found the titan’s heartbeat. They built a machine to muffle it, which is why their realm is dark.
7.  **The Silence of the Norns:** Three centuries ago, the Norns stopped speaking in rhyme and started screaming in static. Only the "Fate-Touched" can interpret the noise.
8.  **The Rain of Gray Ash:** A decade ago, it snowed gray ash in Vanaheim. It was the cremated remains of a future that never happened, bleeding backward in time.
9.  **The Awakening of the Draugr Senate:** The dead in Helheim unionized under a bureaucracy of sorrow, refusing to fight in Ragnarok unless paid in memories.
10. **The Fimbulwinter Protocol:** The current winter is artificial; a magical cryostasis triggered by Odin to pause the apocalypse, but the ice is cracking.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The universe is a closed loop time-capsule. The "Prophecy" of Ragnarok is actually a script from a previous iteration of reality. Odin knows this is the 9,999th time they have fought this war. He wants to break the loop. The Norns want to complete the loop to perfect the song. The Party (Fate-Touched) are glitches—variables that did not exist in the previous 9,998 iterations.
