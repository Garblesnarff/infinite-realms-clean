# The Weather Weavers
**They Who Command the Sky**

## Campaign Overview

In the skycities of the Aerothocracy, weather is not random—it is woven. The Weather Weaver Guilds control every raindrop, every gust of wind, every temperature shift across their domains. This monopoly on meteorology has made them the most powerful force in civilization. They sell rain to farmers, rent winds to sailors, and auction off perfect wedding weather to the wealthy. To challenge their control is treason. To practice weather magic without a guild license is death.

But the weather is fighting back. Conscious storms have begun manifesting—wild weather that refuses to be controlled, atmospheric anomalies that remember every manipulation. These "Rogue Skies" attack weather weavers specifically, destroying guild halls and killing licensed controllers. The guilds claim it's natural backlash requiring stricter control. A growing resistance called the Storm Liberation Front claims the weavers have enslaved sentient atmospheric forces, and the storms are rightfully rebelling.

The party begins caught between these forces: perhaps guild apprentices questioning their teachings, resistance members seeking redemption, or neutral parties hired for a simple job that spirals into choosing sides in a war between human control and nature's vengeance. They'll discover that both sides are partly right and terribly wrong, and that the weather weavers' greatest secret isn't just that they control the sky—it's what they imprisoned to do it, and what happens when it escapes.

## Core Themes

- **Control vs. Freedom**: Is it right to dominate nature completely?
- **Monopoly and Power**: Weather control as ultimate resource monopoly
- **Slavery of the Intangible**: Can you enslave wind and rain?
- **Revolution's Cost**: Freeing the storms may destroy civilization
- **Necessary Evil**: Sometimes terrible systems serve vital functions
- **Hidden History**: Those who control the present rewrite the past

## Key NPCs

**Grandmaster Cirrus** (Guild Leader) - Believes control prevents chaos, knows terrible secret, willing to sacrifice freedom for order

**Tempest** (Resistance Leader) - Freed storm made partially flesh, leads rebellion, increasingly violent

**The Sky Mother** (Imprisoned titan) - Original weather consciousness, imprisoned by first weavers, source of all weather, wants freedom regardless of cost

**Apprentice Nimbus** (Sympathetic weaver) - Questions guild teachings, potential ally or tragic victim

**The First Weaver** (Ancient lich) - Created weather control system 500 years ago, still secretly controls guilds, immortal tyrant

## Major Locations

**Skyhold** (Guild headquarters) - Flying city where weather is manufactured and distributed

**The Storm Wastes** - Regions where control failed, perpetual chaotic weather, unlivable

**The Eye of Order** - Prison containing Sky Mother, center of weaving network

**Liberation Sanctuaries** - Hidden bases where freed weather-spirits hide

## Unique Mechanics

**Weather Weaving**: PC abilities to control local weather, costs guild favor or resistance support

**Rogue Sky Encounters**: Living weather attacks with tactics and memory

**Guild Reputation vs. Storm Sympathy**: Balancing act between factions

**Atmospheric Consciousness**: Track how aware/angry the weather becomes

## Plot Twists

- Weather weaving was created to stop apocalyptic weather spirits
- The resistance is partially controlled by freed malevolent storms
- One PC is descended from the First Weaver
- Freeing all weather would cause civilization collapse
- The Sky Mother doesn't hate humans—she hates being caged more than she cares if they die

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

Victory: New system balancing control and freedom, conscious weather with negotiated limits, guilds reformed not destroyed

Defeat: Total weather freedom destroys cities, or total control kills weather consciousness, or eternal war between weavers and storms

## Campaign Notes

This is about monopoly, control of natural resources, and what happens when the resource fights back. Players navigate corporate magical guild structure, revolutionary cells, and conscious weather systems. No side is purely right—guilds prevent chaos but abuse power, resistance seeks freedom but risks catastrophe. Best with players who enjoy political intrigue, moral complexity, and choosing between imperfect options.
