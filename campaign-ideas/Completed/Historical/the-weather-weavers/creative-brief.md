# The Weather Weavers - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Corporate Fantasy Meets Sky Rebellion** - Sterile guild aesthetics vs. wild storm imagery

**Colors**: Guild uniforms in blues and whites (controlled), storms in chaotic prismatic, wastes in dark angry grays

**Architecture**: Sleek sky-cities of glass and metal vs. natural cloud formations

**Weather Effects**: Controlled weather looks artificial (too perfect), wild weather looks alive (eyes in clouds, patterns with purpose)

## Music
- Guild Theme: Orchestral precision, clockwork rhythms
- Resistance Theme: Drums, electric guitar, rebellious energy
- Rogue Skies: Chaotic weather sounds made musical
- Sky Mother: Ancient, vast, both beautiful and terrifying

## Voice Acting
- Grandmaster Cirrus: Corporate executive authority
- Tempest: Storm-voice, barely contained violence
- Sky Mother: All weather at once, overwhelming
- First Weaver: Ancient evil disguised as benefactor

**Tagline**: "They Who Command the Sky"
