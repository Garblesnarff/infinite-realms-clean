# Campaign Bible: The Weather Weavers

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
## Section 1: Deep Lore & History

### The Origin Myth: The Weaving of the Scream
In the beginning, the sky did not just rain; it wept. It did not just blow; it screamed. The Sky Mother, *Aethelgard*, was not a benevolent goddess, but a churning titan of raw emotion. Five hundred years ago, the First Weaver, Malachai Vane, did not "battle" her. He tricked her. He constructed the **Helix of Silence**, a metaphysical loom that snagged the Sky Mother’s voice. As she roared to shatter the earth, Vane pulled the thread. The scream solidified into the first controlled storm. He didn't kill the god; he turned her agony into an engine. The world believes Vane brought Order to Chaos. The truth is he brought Silence to a Scream, and the pressure has been building inside the gag for five centuries.

### Historical Timeline
1.  **-500 BY (Before Yoke):** The Era of Gales. Cities are subterranean to survive the 300mph winds.
2.  **0 BY:** The Day of Stillness. Malachai Vane activates the Helix. The winds stop instantly. 40% of the bird population dies from sudden pressure drop.
3.  **15 AY (After Yoke):** Founding of Skyhold. The first city built *above* the clouds.
4.  **55 AY:** The Great Drought Rebellion. Farmers try to weave rain illegally. The Guild responds by "deleting" the moisture from their bodies. The first instance of desiccated execution.
5.  **102 AY:** The Invention of Solid Cloud. Aero-Architects discover how to calcify water vapor, allowing for floating fortresses.
6.  **250 AY:** The Whispering Plague. People begin hearing the Sky Mother’s dreams. The Guild brands this "Altitude Sickness" and institutes mandatory ear-cuffing laws.
7.  **300 AY:** The Year of Red Snow. It snows blood for three days. The Guild claims it is "alchemical runoff." It was the Sky Mother biting her tongue.
8.  **480 AY:** The First Rogue Sky. A cumulus cloud manifests a face and eats a Rain Weaver. The incident is erased from records.
9.  **498 AY:** The Formation of the Storm Liberation Front (SLF). Tempest survives a lightning strike that should have vaporized him, becoming a conduit for the Sky Mother’s rage.
10. **499 AY (Current Era):** The Barometric Crisis. Global air pressure begins fluctuating wildly, causing mass nosebleeds and structural fatigue in Skyhold.

### The Metaphysical Truth
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil. It is **Stasis vs. Cancer**. The Guild represents absolute Stasis—a world where nothing changes without a permit. The Sky Mother, now insane from isolation, represents Cancer—unrestricted, chaotic growth and destruction. If the Guild wins, the world becomes a sterile glass orb. If the Mother wins, the atmosphere becomes a solvent that dissolves civilization.

## Section 8: Mechanics

### Atmospheric Pressure System
The DM tracks the Global Pressure (1-10 scale).
*   **High Pressure (8-10):** Fire magic is maximized. Movement costs double (air is thick). People become aggressive.
*   **Standard (4-7):** Normal rules.
*   **Low Pressure (1-3):** Flight is difficult (DC 15 checks). Lightning magic is maximized. People become lethargic/depressed. Hallucinations occur at Level 1.

### Weather Weaving (Player Ability)
If a player gains a License or Resistance training, they can "Weave."
*   **Cost:** Weaving generates "Static."
*   **Static:** If Static exceeds CON score, player discharges (takes 1d10 damage per level of spell woven).
*   **Effect:** Can alter local weather (make it rain, stop wind, clear fog) without spending spell slots, but risks alerting the Guild or attracting Rogue Skies.
