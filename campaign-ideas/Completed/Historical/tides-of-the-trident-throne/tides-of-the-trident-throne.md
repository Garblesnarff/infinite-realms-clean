# Tides of the Trident Throne
**Tagline:** *Seven Kingdoms, One Ocean, Endless War*

## Campaign Overview

For ten thousand years, the Seven Seas have been ruled by the Atlantean Empire—a coalition of underwater kingdoms united under the Trident Throne. The current High King, Thalassor the Peacekeeper, maintained balance between the surface and the deep, between mer-folk, aquatic elves, tritons, and sea-dwelling dragonborn. But Thalassor is dead, assassinated during the Coral Summit, and the empire fractures.

The party, neutral adventurers with ties to multiple kingdoms, witness the assassination. With their last breath, Thalassor names them as investigators and mediators. Each of the Seven Kingdoms suspects the others. Ancient rivalries resurface. The surface world, sensing weakness, prepares invasion. And from the darkest trenches, something ancient stirs—an enemy that nearly destroyed Atlantis millennia ago.

The party must navigate political intrigue, prevent civil war, uncover the true assassin, and unite the kingdoms against the rising threat. They'll broker alliances, lead armies, dive into forbidden zones, and potentially claim the Trident Throne themselves. The fate of the ocean—and the surface world—rests in their hands.
