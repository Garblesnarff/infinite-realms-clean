# Campaign Bible: Tides of the Trident Throne

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Drowning of the Star-Fire
Before the oceans were water, they were the tears of a colossal astral entity known as the **Luminoth**, who wept upon realizing the universe was cold and empty. These tears, infused with divine grief and starlight, pooled upon the rock of the world, extinguishing its primal volcanic fires. The steam from this "Great Drowning" formed the atmosphere, and the cooled crust became the seabed. Life did not crawl from the sea to the land; it was trapped in the sea when the land rejected the divine tears. We are not inhabitants of a planet; we are the microscopic fauna swimming in the eye of a weeping god.

### Historical Timeline
1.  **-12,000 BY (Before Yoke): The Age of Invertebrate Tyranny.** The Kraken Lords rule. Humanoids are livestock kept in air-filled bubbles for food.
2.  **-10,000 BY: The Shattering of the Chains.** The first Atlantis rises. Using the *Trident of Sovereignty*, the slave races banish the Kraken Lords to the Abyssal Plane.
3.  **-8,500 BY: The Day of Dry Rain.** For 24 hours, the ocean receded entirely into the mantle, exposing the sea floor to the sun, before violently rushing back. Those who survived the "Dry Burn" founded the Deep Sage caste.
4.  **-5,000 BY: The Civil War of Glass.** Atlantis fractures. Magma-glass weapons are used, turning entire currents into boiling corridors of death.
5.  **-4,200 BY: The Whale-Song Silence.** All whales in the ocean stopped singing for a decade. No magical reason was found. It is regarded as a bad omen.
6.  **-2,000 BY: The Treaty of the Surface.** First formal contact with land-walkers. A magical barrier, the "Meniscus," is established to regulate trade.
7.  **-800 BY: The Migration of the Stone-Shells.** A massive city-sized turtle dies and sinks; its skeleton becomes the foundation for the current capital of the Benthic Alliance.
8.  **-50 BY: The Coronation of Thalassor.** A rare era of peace begins.
9.  **-1 Year: The Bleeding Current.** A mysterious red current appears near Corallia, sickening life. It is ignored by the High Council.
10. **Present Day:** The Assassination of High King Thalassor.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is not just political; it is a battle for the **Hydro-Soul**. Water in this setting is a conductive medium for memory. The Kraken Lords seek to pollute the water with "Anti-Memory," turning the ocean into a chaotic void where history dissolves. The Trident maintains the "Clarity," ensuring cause and effect remain linked. If the Trident falls, the ocean becomes a liquid nightmare where the past can be rewritten by the strongest will.
