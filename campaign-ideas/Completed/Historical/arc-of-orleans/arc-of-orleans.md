## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the Hundred Years' War through the lens of Joan of Arc and the transformation from medieval to modern warfare. The central conflict is whether divine inspiration, human courage, or historical forces saved France when English conquest seemed inevitable. Players navigate the death of chivalric warfare, the birth of national identity, and the power of inspired leadership to transform impossible odds. The campaign asks: Was Joan divinely inspired or brilliantly human (or both)? Can one person change history? How did medieval warfare give way to modern? And what's worth fighting for—dynasty or nation? The answer: Joan of Arc turned a dynastic feudal war into a national struggle, and whether through divine intervention or human inspiration, she saved France by making the French believe they were a nation worth saving.

*   Track the tension between chivalric ideals and brutal military reality.
*   Longbows kill knights, common soldiers become decisive, chivalry becomes obsolete.
*   Players witness and participate in warfare's transformation.

### 2. **Inspiration System**
*   Joan's presence grants morale bonuses based on soldiers' faith in her divine mission.

### 3. **Divine or Human?**

*   This ambiguity respects both faith and historical analysis.

### 4. **National Awakening**
