# Campaign Bible: Arc of Orleans

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Whispering Stone of Gaul
Before the Roman legions marched, before the Franks forged their kingdoms, the land of Gaul was alive with ancient spirits, bound to the very stones and rivers. The **Whispering Stone of Gaul** was the heart of this magic, a primordial nexus of belief and power. When foreign gods and new faiths arrived, the Stone did not break; it merely slept, its whispers fading into legend. The "Arc of Orleans" is not just a historical event; it is the moment the Whispering Stone stirred, its ancient magic awakening in a young peasant girl, **Jeanne d'Arc**. Her voices are not divine; they are the Stone's desperate plea, a final surge of Gaulish magic attempting to repel the foreign invaders and restore the land's ancient spirit, threatening to unravel the very fabric of history in its wake.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Whisper):** The Whispering Stone of Gaul forms, binding ancient spirits to the land.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Age of Druids):** The first Druids learn to commune with the Stone, becoming its guardians.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Roman Conquest):** Roman legions invade Gaul. The Stone sleeps, its whispers fading.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Frankish Kingdoms):** Frankish tribes forge their kingdoms. The Stone remains dormant.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Norman Invasion):** Norman invaders conquer England. The Stone stirs faintly.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Crusades):** Christian crusaders march. The Stone's whispers grow restless.
7.  **-500 Y (The Black Death):** A devastating plague sweeps Europe. The Stone weeps, its magic weakening.
8.  **-100 Y (The Hundred Years' War):** England and France engage in a brutal, protracted conflict. The Stone's whispers intensify.
9.  **-10 Y (The Voices of Domrémy):** A young peasant girl, Jeanne d'Arc, begins to hear voices, the awakening whispers of the Stone.
10. **Present Day:** The English lay siege to Orleans. Jeanne d'Arc, now leading the French forces, is a conduit for the Whispering Stone's magic, threatening to rewrite history with ancient Gaulish power.

### The "Why": The Clash of Eras
The central conflict is the struggle between **History and Legend**. The Hundred Years' War is a pivotal moment in human history, a clash of nations and cultures. But beneath the surface, an older, more primal conflict is brewing: the awakening of ancient Gaulish magic, embodied by Jeanne d'Arc, threatening to derail the established course of history. The party's struggle is not just to fight in a war, but to navigate this clash of eras, to decide whether to uphold the known historical narrative or to embrace the resurgence of ancient magic, and to prevent the Whispering Stone's power from consuming all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of historical revision.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Historical Integrity
*   **Integrity Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the historical narrative. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Integrity:** Upholding historical events, making choices that align with the known timeline.
*   **Losing Integrity:** Altering historical events, making choices that contradict the known timeline, embracing ancient magic.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Integrity:* History is stable, predictable. Events unfold as they should.
    *   *Low Integrity:* History is unstable, unpredictable. Paradoxes appear, historical figures act out of character.
    *   *0 Integrity:* The historical narrative collapses, leading to a chaotic, nonsensical timeline.

### Subsystem: Gaulish Magic
*   **Gaulish Magic:** Magic is treated as manipulating the ancient spirits of Gaul. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Stone's Whisper Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Stone's Whisper Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor historical glitch occurs in the timeline.
*   **Historical Injection:** Gaulish mages can attempt to "inject" custom historical events into the timeline, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Gaulish Magic) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
