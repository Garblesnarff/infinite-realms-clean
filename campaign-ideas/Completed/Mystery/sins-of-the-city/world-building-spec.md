# Sins of the City - World-Building Specification

## The Bayou Kingdoms: Setting Overview

### Geographic Region
The campaign takes place in the **Vermillion Parish**, a fictional Louisiana-analogue in a fantasy world where the American South exists but with different history and magical elements integrated into the culture. The region is characterized by endless swamplands, decaying antebellum architecture, extreme poverty alongside old wealth, and a culture that never quite recovered from a war fought generations ago.

**Climate:** Oppressively hot and humid, perpetual haze, frequent storms
**Terrain:** Swamps, bayous, cypress forests, occasional dry land
**Population:** ~50,000 across scattered communities
**Economy:** Oil/magical fuel extraction, fishing, tourism (failing), agriculture (declining)
**Culture:** Southern Gothic with Creole/Cajun influences, deep religious tradition, older spiritual practices beneath

### Historical Background

**The Before Times (500+ years ago):**
- Indigenous peoples worshipped various entities including "Him Who Dwells in Yellow"
- Ritual sites throughout swamp, many forgotten
- Cycles of sacrifice and renewal tied to cosmic forces
- Knowledge passed down through select bloodlines

**Colonial Period (200-400 years ago):**
- European colonizers arrived, established plantation system
- Founding families (Tuttles, Childresses, Ledouxs) gained power
- Indigenous practices suppressed but absorbed secretly
- Wealth built on exploitation and occult knowledge

**The War Between Kingdoms (150 years ago):**
- Devastating civil war destroyed much of the South
- Vermillion Parish occupied, plantation system collapsed
- Founding families lost official power but retained wealth
- Economic and social decay began, never reversed

**Reconstruction and Decline (150 years ago - 50 years ago):**
- Failed attempts to rebuild economy
- Founding families maintained control through corruption
- Cult practices revived in secret
- Carcosa Foundation established as front organization

**Modern Era (50 years ago - Present):**
- Oil/magical fuel discovery brought temporary prosperity
- Industry polluted waterways, poisoned communities
- Poverty deepened despite resource wealth
- Cult activities increased, protected by institutional corruption
- Pattern of abuse spanning generations

### The Cult of the Yellow King

#### Origins and Mythology

**Carcosa:**
- Ancient city existing outside normal spacetime
- May be real place in another dimension
- May be shared delusion/egregore given form
- May be both simultaneously
- "Lost Carcosa" - those who seek it never return the same

**The Yellow King:**
- Entity worshipped by the cult
- Name varies: "Him Who Dwells in Yellow," "The Pallid Mask," "The Unspeakable One"
- Nature uncertain: demon, elder god, mass psychosis, or genuine cosmic entity
- Powers: Warp perception, bend time, inspire devotion/madness
- Goal: Unknown, possibly incomprehensible to human understanding

**The Cycle:**
- Cult believes time is cyclical, not linear

### Cosmic Horror Integration

#### The Yellow Sign

**Physical Manifestation:**

- Seeing it everywhere
- Temporal displacement feelings
- Deja vu and false memories
- Eventual madness or enlightenment
- Permanent changes to consciousness

**Game Mechanics:**
- Exposure causes Wisdom saves

- Success: Gain insight into cult but risk corruption
- Accumulated exposure has lasting effects
- Some investigators embrace it for understanding
- Point of no return exists

#### Carcosa - The Lost City

**Nature (Deliberately Ambiguous):**

**Manifestations:**
- Seen in visions by cult members

- Moments when reality thins
- Non-euclidean geometry appearing in world
- The fortress is "closest" to Carcosa in material plane

**Truth About Carcosa:**
- DM can choose: Real, delusion, or ambiguous
- Recommendation: Keep ambiguous for cosmic horror
- Evidence exists for all interpretations
- Let players decide what they believe
- "The truth" may be that there is no truth
- Some questions shouldn't be answered

**Investigation Progress:**
- Start: Scattered evidence, no connections

- Mid: Network exposed, scope understood
- Late: Identities known, locations discovered
- End: All connections made, final confrontation

**Player Engagement:**
- Actual case board maintained between sessions
- Players make connections themselves
- DM can add evidence found "off-screen"
- Visual aid crucial for complex conspiracy
- Satisfying when everything connects

### Resolution Paths and Consequences

#### Path 1: By the Book
- Follow procedures, gather legal evidence
- Build prosecutable case
- Arrest cult members with warrants
- Public trial exposes conspiracy
- Outcome: Some justice, many escape on technicalities
- Personal: Careers intact but compromised
- Theme: System is broken but still worth using

#### Path 2: Rough Justice
- Bend/break rules to stop cult
- Kill rather than capture
- Plant evidence or force confessions
- Questionable methods for good end
- Outcome: Cult stopped, investigators compromised
- Personal: Justice served, souls damaged
- Theme: Fighting monsters, becoming monsters

#### Path 3: Burn It All
- Expose everything publicly
- Destroy the system protecting cult
- Consequences be damned
- Revolution over reform
- Outcome: Cult destroyed, chaos follows
- Personal: Heroes or terrorists depending on view
- Theme: Some systems can't be reformed

#### Path 4: The Sacrifice
- Stop immediate threat but not system
- One investigator dies stopping Errol
- Other carries burden of knowledge
- Partial victory, immense cost
- Outcome: Current generation stopped, cycle continues
- Personal: Survivor guilt, hollow victory
- Theme: Some battles can't be won, only fought

### Campaign Epilogues

**Rust's Perspective:**
- "Once there was only dark. You ask me, light's winning."
- Near-death experience changes nihilism to fragile hope
- Relationship with Martin repaired, damaged but real
- Continues investigating, can't stop, won't stop
- Found meaning in the fight itself

**Martin's Perspective:**
- Family destroyed, career damaged, faith shaken
- But did the right thing when it mattered
- Partnership with Rust most important relationship
- Retired but haunted
- Wondering if it was worth it

**The Bayou:**
- Cult leadership destroyed but roots remain
- System still corrupt, just more careful
- New generation will rise eventually
- But this generation is broken
- Small victory in endless war

**Cosmic Truth:**
- Did they stop the Yellow King or just delay?
- Is Carcosa real or did they imagine it all?
- Time is still a flat circle
- But maybe circles can be broken
- Or maybe that's just hope talking

This world is built for a slow-burn, atmospheric, philosophically complex campaign. The horror is both cosmic (unknowable forces) and mundane (human evil). The investigation is the journey, and the journey changes everyone who takes it. Truth exists, but finding it has a price, and knowing it may be worse than ignorance.

Time is a flat circle. But circles can be broken. Maybe.
