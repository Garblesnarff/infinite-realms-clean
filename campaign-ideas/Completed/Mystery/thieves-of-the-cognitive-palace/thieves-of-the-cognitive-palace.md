## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-30 sessions)

A dual-world arc balancing daily life simulation with supernatural heists.

*   **Act I — Awakening to Rebellion (Sessions 1-10):** The party discovers the Metaverse when they stumble into a Palace—the distorted heart of a corrupt teacher who abuses students. They awaken their Personas, rebellious inner spirits granting supernatural power. After successfully changing the teacher's heart and forcing his confession, they form the Phantom Thieves. They tackle a crime boss and an artist exploiting students, building their reputation while balancing school and part-time jobs. A mysterious cat-like creature named Morgana guides them.
*   **Act II — The Phantom Thieves Rise (Sessions 11-20):** The Thieves' fame grows as they target bigger villains: a mafia boss, a corporate CEO, a politician. Each Palace grows more complex, and they must manage time between infiltration, building relationships with confidants (who provide crucial abilities), and maintaining their cover. A detective begins investigating them, and a conspiracy within the government becomes apparent. Someone is using the Metaverse for their own agenda.
*   **Act III — The True Enemy (Sessions 21-30):** The conspiracy is revealed—a secret society manipulates the Metaverse to control society, and the "god" Yaldabaoth seeks to imprison humanity in comfortable apathy. The party discovers their guide Morgana's true nature, infiltrates a massive casino Palace, and faces betrayal within their own ranks. The final heist requires changing the heart of reality itself, storming a prison of the masses' collective sloth, and facing a god born from humanity's desire to be controlled.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of rebellion versus conformity, the masks people wear, systemic corruption, free will versus control, and the power of bonds. It asks: Can you change rotten adults by stealing their hearts? Is vigilante justice acceptable? What does society truly want—freedom or comfortable slavery? The central conflict pits the party's desire to reform society against both individual corrupt villains and humanity's collective apathy.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dual World System**
*   Real world where time management and social links happen
*   Metaverse where Palaces are infiltrated and combat occurs
*   Actions in one affect the other (infiltrating Palace advances time, social links grant combat abilities)
*   Must balance both to succeed

### 2. **Calendar & Time Management**
*   Each target has a deadline—change their heart before time runs out or fail
*   Days are divided: After School, Evening, each allowing one major action
*   Infiltrating Palaces costs time but is necessary to find the treasure route
*   Must choose between leveling up, strengthening social links, or advancing the heist

### 3. **Social Links / Confidants**
*   Building relationships with NPCs unlocks abilities and bonuses
*   Each confidant has 10 ranks, each providing mechanical benefits
*   Examples: Discounts at shops, bonus XP, ambush attacks, survive fatal hits, switch party members mid-battle
*   Relationships provide the power to fight gods—literally

### 4. **Persona System**
*   Each character has a primary Persona (rebellious spirit/god/demon)
*   One character (the wildcard) can switch Personas, holding multiple
*   Personas determine abilities, weaknesses, and strengths
*   Fuse Personas in the Velvet Room to create stronger ones
*   Personas evolve during character growth moments into ultimate forms

### 5. **All-Out Attacks & Weaknesses**
*   Hitting enemy weaknesses knocks them down
*   Knocking all enemies down allows devastating All-Out Attack finishers
*   Boss fights involve breaking defenses and exposing weaknesses
*   Combat is stylish, emphasizing strategy and exploitation

### 6. **Calling Cards & Psychological War**
*   Before stealing a treasure, send a calling card announcing your intent
*   This materializes the treasure but puts the target on high alert
*   The psychological pressure forces the Shadow to defend desperately
*   Creates a deadline for the final heist

### 7. **Negotiation & Recruitment**
*   Can negotiate with Shadows instead of killing them
*   Successful negotiation recruits them as Personas or earns items/money
*   Different personalities respond to different tactics (intimidate, humor, beg, etc.)
*   Adds non-combat resolution and resource management

### 8. **Infiltration Mechanics**
*   Palaces have safe rooms where you can retreat without losing progress
*   Stealth and ambushing enemies gives combat advantage
*   Security levels rise if spotted too often—getting ejected at 100%
*   Must find the treasure route through exploration and puzzle-solving before the calling card
