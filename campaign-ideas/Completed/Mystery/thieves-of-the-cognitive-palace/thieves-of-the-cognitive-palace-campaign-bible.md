# Campaign Bible: Thieves of the Cognitive Palace

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Dissociation
In the beginning, humanity did not have a subconscious; reality and thought were one. However, the weight of collective guilt, shame, and forbidden desire became too heavy for the waking world to sustain. To survive, the collective human psyche performed a violent act of metaphysical surgery: The Great Dissociation. Humanity severed its Shadow—the "Metaverse"—and hid it behind a veil of cognitive static. But the severed limb did not die; it festered. Now, the Metaverse is a parasitic dimension of neon-drenched psychodrama, feeding on the repressed emotions of the waking world, waiting for the moment the veil tears and the repressed becomes the ruler.

### Timeline of the Dual Worlds
1.  **The Severance (Pre-History):** The collective unconscious is sealed away; Magic dies in the real world, born in the Cognitive.
2.  **The First Mask (1890):** A Victorian psychologist accidentally physically enters a patient's dream, returning with a physical gold bar made of "crystallized greed." He is institutionalized immediately.
3.  **The Silent Roar (1945):** Following the atomic bomb, the Metaverse screamed. For 4 seconds, everyone on Earth heard the sound of a crying child, regardless of distance.
4.  **The Velvet Blueprint (1980):** Igor, a sentient construct of order, establishes the Velvet Room inside the gap between dimensions to manage the increasing cognitive pressure.
5.  **The Glitch of '99 (1999):** **[Weird/Rare]** For 24 hours, shadows replaced domestic pets globally. Cats spoke in riddles; dogs walked on two legs. Humanity collectively hallucinated that this didn't happen the next day.
6.  **The Midnight Broadcast (2005):** A rogue TV signal aired the internal monologues of the Prime Minister. It was dismissed as an avant-garde art project, but it was the first "leak" of a Palace.
7.  **The Wakening (2010):** Cognitive Psience is discovered by the Conspiracy. They begin inducing "Mental Shutdowns" to assassinate political rivals.
8.  **The Subway Incident (2014):** A subway train in Tokyo vanished, arriving three days later. Passengers hadn't aged, but all had forgotten their own names. They had traversed Mementos.
9.  **The Black Sun (2016):** **[Weird/Rare]** The sun in the Metaverse turned black and dripped oil, birthing the first "Monarch" Shadows (Palace Rulers).
10. **The Present Day:** The Distortion Level hits critical mass. High school students begin seeing "glitches" in reality—blue flames and chains on adults.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because **Apathy is Gravity.** The central antagonist, Yaldabaoth, is not an invader, but an immune response. Humanity desires control so desperately that the Metaverse is generating a god to enslave them, purely to alleviate the anxiety of free will. The Phantom Thieves fight not just villains, but the gravitational pull of societal laziness.
