## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Grafting of Spheres
It was not a collision, but a surgical error in the cosmos. The Conjunction of Spheres was the moment the universe tried to heal a wound that didn't exist, stitching together realities that were allergic to one another. Magic did not flow into our world; it bled into it like an infection. Humans arrived not as conquerors, but as refugees on ships made of bone and desperation, fleeing a world consumed by the White Frost. We are the invasive species here. The Elves know it, the monsters know it, and the earth itself tries to shake us off with every earthquake.

### Timeline of the Wolf Age
1.  **The First Landing:** Humans arrive on the Continent. They burn the Elder Groves to build the first huts. The sky rains ash for three years.
2.  **The Creation of the First Witcher:** Alzur the Mage pours mutagenic sludge into the veins of thirty boys. One survives. He screams for a week.
3.  **The Betrayal at Stygga:** The Cat School of Witchers accepts a contract to kill a King, permanently staining the reputation of all mutant-kind.
4.  **The Night of Long Knives:** The Elven capital of Shaerrawedd is razed. The elves burn their own city rather than let humans take it.
5.  **The Curse of the Black Sun:** Sixty noble girls are born during an eclipse. Prophecy says they are monsters. They are locked in towers; they grow up to be worse than predicted.
6.  **The Rain of Toads:** (Low Probability Event) In Velen, it rained poisonous toads for three days. The peasants ate them and went mad, forming the Cult of the Croak.
7.  **The Wild Hunt’s First Descent:** Spectral riders abduct the population of the village of Hogsfeet. Only the livestock is left behind, arranged in a perfect spiral.
8.  **The Usurper’s Rise:** Emhyr var Emreis reclaims the Nilfgaardian throne by digging up his enemies' graves and dancing on their coffins—literally.
9.  **The Sodden Hill Massacre:** Fourteen mages hold a hill against an army of 50,000. The grass there still grows red and smells of sulfur.
10. **The Appearance of the Ashen Girl:** Ciri is spotted in the charred remains of a forest, weeping tears that freeze before they hit the ground.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The **White Frost** is not weather. It is cosmic entropy given consciousness. It is the heat-death of the universe, hungry and impatient. The "Elder Blood" is a genetic mutation that acts as a skeleton key to reality—the only thing that can lock the door against the cold, or open it wide enough to freeze hell itself.
