# Just One More Thing - World-Building Specification

## The City

Generic urban fantasy setting. Not specific geography, universal types: Wealthy neighborhoods, police headquarters, various professional environments. Focus on characters and class dynamics rather than unique setting.

### The Class Divide

**Wealthy Elite**:
- Professionals: Doctors, lawyers, executives, artists
- Live in: Estates, penthouses, exclusive communities
- Characteristics: Educated, sophisticated, arrogant
- Assumption: Above consequences due to wealth and intelligence
- Reality: One mistake away from justice

**Working Class**:
- Columbo represents: Honest, hardworking, underestimated
- Background: Blue-collar, street smart, life experience
- Advantages: People underestimate them, different perspective
- Values: Justice, persistence, doing right thing

### The Police Department

**Homicide Division**:
- Columbo works here, rank of Lieutenant
- Respected for results, questioned for methods
- Given latitude due to success rate
- "He gets results, I'll give him that"

**The Brass**:
- Uncomfortable with Columbo's lack of polish
- Pressure from wealthy/powerful when he investigates them
- Can't argue with perfect solve rate
- Tension between politics and justice

### The Criminal Psychology

**Why They Kill**:
- Greed: Inheritance, insurance, business opportunity
- Self-Preservation: Covering previous crime or scandal
- Jealousy: Romantic or professional rivalry
- Anger: Revenge for wrong (real or perceived)

**Why They Fail**:
- Hubris: Too confident in own intelligence
- Underestimation: Dismiss Columbo as incompetent
- Overthinking: Perfect plan too complicated
- The One Mistake: Human error in inhuman act

**The Pattern**:
1. Commit "perfect" murder
2. Construct airtight alibi
3. Meet Columbo, feel superior
4. Make small defensive mistakes
5. Watch net tighten
6. Try to explain away evidence
7. Caught by detail they overlooked
8. Arrested, ego shattered

### The Columbo Method Detailed

**Phase 1: Observation**
- Arrive at crime scene
- Bumble around, seem incompetent
- Ask basic questions everyone else asked
- Notice one small thing nobody else did
- Plant seed of doubt in killer's mind

**Phase 2: Engagement**
- Visit suspect "just routine questions"
- Express admiration for their work/accomplishments
- Seem star-struck, differential
- Ask about details of alibi
- Listen more than talk
- "Oh, I'm sure you're right..."

**Phase 3: Persistence**
- Return visits with "just one more thing"
- Each time, slightly different question
- Inconsistencies noted but not confronted
- Building psychological pressure
- Killer realizes: He's not going away

**Phase 4: The Trap**
- Identify THE mistake
- Set up demonstration or confrontation
- Present irrefutable evidence
- "You see, there's something that's been bothering me..."
- Watch killer try to explain
- Politely dismantle every excuse

**Phase 5: The Resolution**
- "I know you did it. You know you did it."
- Present reconstruction of crime
- Explain how they missed ONE thing
- Acknowledgment: "It was a good plan"
- But: "Nobody's perfect"
- Arrest, respect, justice

### Case Types

**The Locked Room**
- Impossible murder mystery
- Killer creates elaborate scenario
- Mistake: ONE detail breaks illusion
- Columbo: "How did that get there?"

**The Perfect Alibi**
- Killer establishes being elsewhere
- Witnesses, evidence, seeming proof
- Mistake: Impossible knowledge or one thing out of place
- Columbo: "How did you know that?"

**The Accident**
- Murder staged as accident
- Too perfect to be real
- Mistake: Staging reveals intention
- Columbo: "That's the funny thing about accidents..."

**The Suicide**
- Murder staged as self-inflicted
- Victim "left note," had motive
- Mistake: Something victim wouldn't/couldn't do
- Columbo: "Just one thing doesn't make sense..."

**The Frame Job**
- Killer sets up innocent person
- Evidence points to patsy
- Mistake: Too convenient, reveals real killer
- Columbo: "That's almost too perfect..."

### The One Mistake - Examples

- **Time**: Alibi puts them in two places simultaneously
- **Knowledge**: Know something only killer would know
- **Evidence**: Left or took something revealing
- **Behavior**: Reaction inconsistent with innocence
- **Logic**: Story breaks down under scrutiny
- **Pride**: Can't resist showing off cleverness
- **Technology**: Recording/evidence they didn't know existed
- **Witness**: Someone saw something they claim didn't happen
- **Physical**: Evidence contradicts story (direction, force, timing)
- **Psychological**: Human nature exposes lie

### Character Gallery - Sample Killers

- Perfect crime using medical knowledge
- Mistake: Didn't account for post-mortem medical detail
- Motive: Inheritance and reputation

- Mistake: "Predicted" something she couldn't have known
- Motive: Blackmail victim threatening exposure

**Reginald Finch** - Art Collector
- Murdered to hide forgery scheme
- Mistake: Knew too much about "undiscovered" painting
- Motive: Financial fraud exposure

**Senator Victoria Crown** - Politician
- Political killing staged as robbery
- Mistake: Gunshot residue despite alibi

### The Formula's Appeal

- Justice always served

**Endless Variations**:
- Different killer each case
- Different method each time
- Different mistake each time
- Different social commentary
- But same satisfying structure

**Player Engagement**:
- If playing Columbo: Satisfaction of being smarter than smart people
- If playing killers: Dread as perfect plan unravels
- Either way: Appreciation of craft
- Intellectual challenge
- Roleplaying opportunities

### Campaign Philosophy

This is comfort food gaming. Formula is feature. Structure provides safety to explore character and theme. Each case is complete story. But Columbo's character thread continues.

Players know what they're getting. And that's what they want. Because watching humble detective take down arrogant killer never gets old.

Class commentary never stops being relevant. And justice, served politely but certainly, never stops being satisfying.

"Oh, just one more thing before I go..."

And then the trap springs. And another perfect murder fails. And another wealthy criminal learns: Nobody's above the law.

Not when Lieutenant Columbo is on the case.
