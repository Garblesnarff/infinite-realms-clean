# Just One More Thing
## *"Oh, just one more thing..."*

### Campaign Overview

Lieutenant Columbo—a seemingly disheveled, rambling detective—investigates murders committed by the wealthy, powerful, and brilliant. Unlike traditional mysteries, this is an "inverted detective story": The audience (players) know who did it from the beginning. The joy comes from watching Columbo methodically, politely, and brilliantly dismantle perfect alibis and expose arrogant killers who underestimated him.

The party can play as: (1) Columbo and his investigative team, or (2) In a unique twist, different murderers each arc, experiencing the slow horror of being caught by someone you dismissed as incompetent. Either way, this is cat-and-mouse investigation at its finest, emphasizing deduction, persistence, and the satisfying downfall of hubris.

Each "episode" (2-4 sessions) features a new murder, new killer, and new methodology. The formula is consistent but endlessly entertaining: Perfect crime meets imperfect criminal meets perfect detective.

### Core Themes

- **Hubris**: Pride comes before the fall
- **Class Warfare**: Working-class detective vs. elite criminals
- **Appearances Deceive**: Rumpled exterior, brilliant interior
- **Persistence**: Relentless, polite, unstoppable
- **Justice for All**: Wealth and power don't protect you
- **The Little Things**: One detail, one mistake, unravels everything
- **Respect and Psychology**: Understanding criminals to catch them

### Session Breakdown (20-30 Sessions = 6-10 Cases)

- Introduce killer: Wealthy, intelligent, arrogant
- Motive established: Greed, jealousy, self-preservation
- Murder committed "perfectly"
- Alibi seems airtight
- Enter Columbo: Rumpled, apologetic, "just a few questions"

**Act 2: The Investigation (Sessions 2-3)**
- Columbo asks seemingly stupid questions
- Killer patronizes him, thinks they've fooled him
- Each visit, Columbo notices one more inconsistency
- "Just one more thing..."
- Killer growing concerned, making small mistakes
- Columbo getting closer, never directly accusing

**Act 3: The Trap (Session 4)**
- Columbo reconstructs crime, identifies THE mistake
- Confrontation: Polite but devastating
- Killer tries to explain away evidence
- Columbo reveals he knew all along
- "I hate to bother you, but there's just one thing that bothers me..."

And then, politely, methodically, brilliantly, justice is served.
