## Resolution Framework

### The Apex Revealed

**Option 1: The Trainee**
Former BAU member who learned too much. Rejected from program or voluntarily left. Using inside knowledge.

**Option 2: The Correspondent**
Someone who wrote to imprisoned killers, studied cases. Obsessed fan who became participant.

**Option 3: The Family**
Relative of serial killer or victim. Trauma transformed into violence. Proving something.

**Option 4: The Academic**
Professor or researcher who had access to classified information. Conducting "experiment" on investigators.

**Option 5: The Inside Man**
Current law enforcement, possibly someone investigators work with. Ultimate betrayal.

### Final Confrontation
Not a battle but a conversation. The Apex wants to engage intellectually, prove superiority, force investigators to understand.

**Questions posed**:
- "What makes you different from me?"
- "You've studied monsters. Have you become one?"
- "Was the knowledge worth the price?"

**Resolution options**:
- Intellectual defeat of The Apex
- Violent confrontation (feels like failure)
- Apex's capture through own mistake
- Suicide (taking knowledge to grave)
- Escape (setting up sequel)

### Aftermath

**Program Future**:
- Legitimized by results despite costs
- Expanded to train new investigators
- Research published becomes standard
- Team's legacy: Changed law enforcement forever

**Personal Futures**:
- Some investigators continue, forever changed
- Some leave, seek normalcy
- Some broken beyond repair
- All marked by experience
- Question: Would they do it again?

**The Greater Question**:
Did they create The Apex by teaching the world about serial killers? Would ignorance have been better? Is understanding evil worth the risk of enabling it?

No easy answers. Just the work. The endless, necessary, soul-destroying work.

Time to interview the next monster.
