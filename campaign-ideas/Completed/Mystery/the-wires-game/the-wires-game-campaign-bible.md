# Campaign Bible: Ironport - The City of Rust and Wire

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
# 1. Deep Lore & History

### The Origin of the Rot
Ironport was not founded; it was dredged. Established on a swamp of industrial runoff and salt marshes, the city was designed as a "Closed Loop Economy" in the late 19th century—a utopian experiment where the workers lived in the factories and the factories owned the housing. The experiment failed, but the legal charter remained. Now, Ironport exists as a "Sociological Singularity": a place where the collective psychic weight of bad decisions, bureaucratic deadlock, and institutional cruelty has created a tangible "gravity" that prevents anyone from leaving. The city feeds on hope and excretes statistics.

### Timeline of Tragedy
1.  **1892 - The Dredging:** The marshes are drained; the first foundations sink 3 feet immediately.
2.  **1920 - The Iron Pact:** City Council signs a charter protecting unions, which unintentionally freezes all technological advancement in the port for 80 years.
3.  **1945 - The Victory Riot:** Soldiers return home to find their jobs automated; the first "Corner" is established as an economic protest.
4.  **1968 - The Great Fire of West Side:** A clerk misfiles a fire safety inspection; three blocks burn. The city zones the ash as "Historic," preventing rebuilding.
5.  **1982 - The Cocaine Flood:** The port becomes the primary entry point for the cartel.
6.  **1994 - The Paperwork Purge:** To save space, City Hall burns 50 years of property records. Ownership becomes a matter of "who is standing there with a bat."
7.  **2002 - The Towers Fall:** The high-rise projects are demolished, not to improve lives, but to disperse the crime into easier-to-hide row houses.
8.  **2008 - The "Ghost Budget":** The Mayor admits the city has been operating on a theoretical budget for six years. Schools are funded by lottery tickets.
9.  **2015 - The Gray Spring:** Police go on an unofficial strike ("The Blue Flu"). Crime drops because no one is there to report it. Stats improve.
10. **2024 - The Algorithm:** The Department of Justice installs an AI to predict crime; it immediately recommends arresting the entire City Council. It is unplugged.

### The Metaphysics: " The Juke"
Reality in Ironport is defined by **The Juke**. If a thing is not written down, it didn't happen. If a murder is reclassified as a "suspicious passing," the ghost does not haunt. The conflict is not Good vs. Evil; it is **The Truth vs. The File**. The players are fighting to make the reality match the paperwork.

[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]
# 8. Mechanics

### The Stat Game (Reputation System)
The party does not track Experience Points (XP) in the traditional sense. They track **Clearance Rate**.
*   **Black Board:** Unsolved cases. High Black Board = Budget cuts, hostile Command.
*   **Red Board:** Solved cases. High Red Board = Promotions, but high target for criminals.
*   **Juking:** Players can choose to "Juke" the stats (lie about a crime's severity) to lower the Black Board, but this increases the **City Corruption** meter.

### Wiretap Rules
To tap a phone, players must:
1.  **Exhaustion:** Gather evidence (Intel checks).
2.  **Persuasion:** Convince a Judge (DC 15-25 depending on evidence).
3.  **Patience:** Listen to audio logs. The DM reads boring transcripts. The players must identify the **Code**.
    *   *Example:* "I need 2 tickets to the movie" = 2 Kilos of Cocaine.

### Cynicism & Burnout
Instead of Sanity, characters have **Burnout**.
*   Starts at 0. Max 10.
*   Gain Burnout when: A case is dropped by politics, a child dies, you work 48 hours straight.
*   **Effect:** At Burnout 5, Disadvantage on Charisma. At Burnout 10, the character quits the force or becomes corrupt (NPC).
*   **Recovery:** Drinking (temporary), solving a real case (permanent).
