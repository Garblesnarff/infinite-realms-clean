# Campaign Bible: Blood in the Water

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Primordial Tide
In the beginning, the world was a single, perfect **Primordial Tide**, holding within it the promise of infinite life and mystery. But the Primordial Tide was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant currents, secrets, and rebirth. The "Blood" is not just the residue of spilled life; it is the dust of countless shattered mysteries, the memory of every lost secret. The "Water" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Primordial Tide's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the Tide and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Primordial Tide's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of watery remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Primordial Tide is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of currents and secrets.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Current):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its watery dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Secret Plague):** A powerful echo of the Primordial Tide's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost secret, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Tide Cult):** Mortals discover the power of secrets and form the Tide Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the Tide.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Drowning):** A rogue Tide Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Water-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Blood, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Primordial Tide's fury causes all beings to remember every lost secret, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Primordial Tide's Whisper):** The Primordial Tide, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Primordial Tide, the **Essence of Truth**, is stolen from the Tide Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the Tide Cult, each with their own unique connection to secrets. They are caught in a crisis as the Primordial Tide's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of watery remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Secrets
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Primordial Tide's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of currents and secrets, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The Tide Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become Tide Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Secret Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted secret, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Primordial Tide's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Water-Weaving
*   **Water-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the watery dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Water-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Water-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
