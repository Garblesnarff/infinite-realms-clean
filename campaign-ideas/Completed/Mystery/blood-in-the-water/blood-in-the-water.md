## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the noir tragedy of fighting corruption in a system designed to protect the corrupt. The central conflict revolves around uncovering a conspiracy so deeply embedded in the city's power structure that exposing it may be impossible and stopping it may cost everything. The players must navigate a world where nearly everyone is compromised, witnesses die before they can testify, and the truth is less powerful than money and influence. The campaign forces uncomfortable questions: What do you do when the system is the enemy? How much are you willing to sacrifice for a truth that may not matter? And can you walk away from injustice knowing you can't fix it? In the end, "Forget it, it's Ashenvale" becomes both warning and epitaph.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Conspiracy Web**
*   A visual map connects NPCs, locations, and evidence, revealing the conspiracy's structure as players investigate.
*   Each connection discovered provides clues but also increases danger as powerful people notice the investigation.
*   The web shows how deeply corruption has spread and why simple solutions are impossible.

### 2. **The Corruption Tracker**
*   Tracks how many city officials, guards, and institutions the players discover are compromised.
*   As the tracker fills, it becomes harder to find help and easier to be betrayed.
*   The tracker visualizes the noir theme that "everyone's dirty" and resistance is nearly futile.

### 3. **The Witness Mortality Clock**
*   Key witnesses have limited time before they're silenced by the conspiracy.
*   Players must prioritize which witnesses to protect and which information to gather first.
*   Creates tension and tragedy as not everyone can be saved.

### 4. **Noir Consequences**
*   Every victory comes with a cost: exposing one conspirator makes another more dangerous, saving one witness dooms another.
*   The game tracks pyrrhic victories and moral compromises the players must make.
*   Emphasizes that in noir, the good guys rarely win cleanly—if they win at all.
