**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The famous detective Hercule Poirot (PC or NPC) and companions board the luxury Orient Express train for a journey across the continent.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Locked Room Complexity:** Murder occurred in sealed compartment on moving train—impossible crime.
*   **Everyone is Guilty:** Traditional investigation assumptions don't apply.
*   **Twelve Suspects:** Must investigate, interview, and evaluate numerous NPCs.
*   **Moral Philosophy:** No clear right answer to the final choice.
*   **Time Pressure:** Must solve before train reaches destination and authorities board.
*   **Social Deduction:** Every suspect is lying about something.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Departure (Session 1):** Board the Orient Express. Introduction to luxurious train and eclectic passengers. First night, snowstorm derails train in remote mountain pass. Discovery: Samuel Ratchett (alias) is found stabbed twelve times in his locked cabin. Poirot takes charge of investigation.

*   **Act II — The Interviews (Sessions 2–4):** Methodical interrogation of twelve passengers and staff. Each has alibi, each seems to have motive. Evidence includes: twelve different stab wounds (different weapons, different strengths), inconsistent testimonies, a charred note fragment, multiple timelines that don't align, a woman in a red kimono seen in corridor (multiple sightings).

*   **Act III — The Past Revealed (Sessions 5–6):** Discovering Ratchett's true identity: Cassetti, who kidnapped and murdered the Armstrong child years ago, escaped justice on technicality. Learning each passenger's connection to the Armstrong family tragedy—governess, secretary, chauffeur, relatives, retainers—all people whose lives were destroyed.

*   **Act IV — The Truth (Session 7):** Poirot reveals the impossible solution: all twelve passengers conspired to murder Cassetti as collective jury and executioner. They planned it meticulously—each delivering one stab, creating alibis for each other, staging it to look like outside intruder. The "woman in red kimono" was multiple people wearing same garment.

*   **Act V — The Choice (Session 8):** Poirot presents two solutions to authorities:
    1. The truth: twelve conspirators committed premeditated murder
    2. The lie: unknown assassin boarded train, killed Cassetti, escaped into snowstorm
    Party must decide which version to support. There is no "correct" answer—only consequences.

## Key Locations (All on the Train)

1.  **Ratchett's Compartment:** Locked room murder scene, body with twelve stab wounds.
2.  **The Dining Car:** Where social interaction and interviews occur.
3.  **Various Passenger Compartments:** Each suspect's private cabin.
4.  **The Corridor:** Narrow passage where "woman in red kimono" was spotted.
5.  **The Locomotive:** Stopped by avalanche, trapped in mountain pass.
6.  **The Snowdrift:** Blocking the tracks, isolating the train.

## Central Conflict

Justice versus Law. Cassetti committed heinous crime and destroyed innocent lives, then escaped legal punishment through corruption. Twelve people connected to his victims formed a jury, convicted him in absentia, and executed the sentence themselves. They committed premeditated murder—clearly illegal. But is it morally wrong?

The central question: When the legal system fails, do individuals have the right to administer justice? Is collective murder for a just cause still murder? Can twelve people share guilt and reduce individual culpability?

Poirot (embodiment of justice and order) must grapple with: Does his duty to truth supersede mercy? Can he allow murder to go unpunished, even if justified?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Locked Room**
*   Ratchett's door was locked from inside.
*   Window was latched from inside.
*   No way in or out except through locked door.
*   Classic impossible crime—solution requires thinking differently.

### 2. **Twelve Wounds, Twelve Weapons**
*   Medical examination reveals twelve distinct stab wounds.
*   Different depths and angles suggest different attackers (varying strength/height).
*   Some wounds deep (strong attacker), some shallow (weak or hesitant).
*   Not all wounds were fatal—symbolic participation.

### 3. **The Alibi Web**
*   Each suspect has alibi provided by another suspect.
*   Alibis form interlocking circle—each confirms others.
*   All alibis are lies, but perfectly coordinated lies.
*   Breaking one alibi doesn't help—the web holds.

### 4. **Physical Evidence**
*   Charred note in Ratchett's compartment mentioning "Armstrong"
*   Red kimono found in Poirot's luggage (planted to confuse)
*   Pipe cleaner from suspect who doesn't smoke
*   Handkerchief with initial "H" (multiple suspects have that initial)
*   Button from conductor's uniform found in cabin
*   Watch stopped at 1:15 AM (giving false timeline)

### 5. **Conflicting Testimonies**
*   Multiple people claim to have seen woman in red kimono at different times
*   Timelines don't align—unless multiple people wore same kimono
*   Each suspect tells partial truth mixed with strategic lies
*   No single testimony is fully accurate

### 6. **The Armstrong Tragedy**
*   Background event that motivates everything
*   Research reveals: child kidnapped, ransom paid, child murdered anyway
*   Mother died in childbirth from shock, baby was stillborn
*   Father died by suicide from grief
*   French nursemaid accused and died by suicide
*   District Attorney died of heart attack from shame of losing trial
*   Cassetti walked free, changed name, lived in luxury

### 7. **The Moral Choice System**
*   At climax, party must vote: report truth or protect conspirators
*   Arguments for truth: law must be upheld, murder is murder, slippery slope
*   Arguments for lie: justice was served, legal system failed, victims deserve peace
*   DM should present both sides compellingly—no "right" answer

*   Watch for reactions and tells
*   Piece together the conspiracy

**Phase 5 — Reconstruction:**
*   Understand how twelve people could coordinate
*   Realize all alibis are collaborative lies
*   Discover how they accessed locked room (conductor had key)

**Phase 6 — Confrontation:**
*   Poirot gathers all suspects
*   Presents complete solution
*   Suspects neither fully confirm nor deny
*   Moral weight of decision becomes clear

## Campaign Themes

*   **Collective Justice:** Can twelve people share the burden of execution?
*   **Law vs. Morality:** When legal system fails, what recourse exists?
*   **Class and Privilege:** Wealthy people can escape justice (Cassetti did).
*   **Impossible Crimes:** The solution requires paradigm shift.
*   **Ensemble Drama:** Every character has depth and valid motivation.
*   **The Weight of Truth:** Is knowing the truth always better?

## The Two Solutions (Poirot's Presentation)

**Solution One (The Lie):**
*   Unknown assassin (likely connected to Cassetti's criminal past)
*   Boarded train while stopped, killed Cassetti in revenge for some past crime
*   Escaped into snowstorm before investigation began
*   All evidence can be interpreted to support this

**Solution Two (The Truth):**
*   All twelve passengers conspired to murder Cassetti
*   They knew his true identity as Armstrong kidnapper/murderer
*   Each delivered one stab wound, sharing guilt equally
*   Conductor used his key to access locked cabin
*   Woman in red kimono was disguise shared by conspirators
*   Meticulously planned to appear as outside job

Which solution the party supports determines the ending.

## Victory Conditions

The campaign "succeeds" when:
*   The murder is completely solved (truth discovered)
*   All twelve conspirators are identified
*   Their connection to Armstrong tragedy is understood
*   The party makes an informed choice about justice
*   They grapple meaningfully with the moral dilemma

There is no "correct" choice—only consequential one.

---

## Possible Endings

**Ending A — Truth Reported:**
*   Twelve conspirators arrested, face trial
*   Legal system works this time (ironically)
*   Media spectacle, public sympathy for accused
*   Likely lenient sentences due to circumstances
*   Poirot's reputation for truth preserved but at moral cost

**Ending B — Lie Accepted:**
*   Conspirators go free
*   Justice served outside the law
*   Poirot allows injustice (legally) for higher justice (morally)
*   Twelve people carry secret forever
*   Cassetti's fate remains mysterious to authorities

**Ending C — Hung Decision:**
*   Party cannot agree
*   Poirot must break tie with his own choice
*   Demonstrates that even detective genius struggles with this

---

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Create detailed dossiers for all twelve conspirators
*   Pre-write their coordinated false testimonies
*   Prepare timeline of murder night showing how conspiracy worked
*   Study locked room mystery conventions
*   Present Cassetti as genuinely despicable—no sympathy for victim
*   Give each conspirator moment of humanity—they're not monsters
*   Armstrong tragedy should be heartbreaking in detail
*   Practice Poirot's mannerisms if using as NPC (Belgian accent, mustache, "little gray cells")
*   The reveal should be shocking but logically deducible
*   Don't force party toward either ending—present dilemma honestly
*   Research philosophy of justice, vigilantism, jury nullification
*   Make the final choice matter—show consequences either way

---

## Adaptation Notes

*   Can be run in single long session (one-shot) or expanded to short campaign
*   Works well as interlude between major campaign arcs
*   Train can be magical (lightning rail, spelljammer, etc.)
*   Armstrong tragedy can be adapted to fantasy setting
*   Twelve conspirators allows twelve players (huge table) or mixed PC/NPC
*   Moral dilemma provides excellent roleplaying opportunity
*   No "boss fight"—this is pure investigation and ethics
