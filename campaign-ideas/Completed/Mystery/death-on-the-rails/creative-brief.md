# Creative Brief: Death on the Rails

## Art Style: Art Deco Luxury & Golden Age Mystery (Orient Express Aesthetic)

Inspired by 1930s Art Deco luxury trains and classic Agatha Christie adaptations—elegant confined spaces, period fashion, sophisticated murder mystery, ensemble cast visuals.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Rich Art Deco colors—burgundy velvet, polished mahogany, gold fixtures, cream upholstery. Snow outside provides white contrast. Warm interior lighting (amber lamps) against cold blue exterior (snowstorm). Each passenger wears distinct 1930s fashion in their character colors.

**Character Design:** Period-accurate 1930s fashion—tailored suits, elegant dresses, furs, evening wear. Poirot is immaculate: waxed mustache, perfectly pressed suit, egg-shaped head. Each of the twelve suspects is visually distinct: military bearing, aristocratic hauteur, working-class roughness, religious severity, etc. Everyone is dressed for travel in their best.

**Environments:**
- The Train: Art Deco luxury—polished wood paneling, brass fixtures, velvet curtains, intricate geometric designs
- Compartments: Small but elegant private cabins with fold-down beds, windows showing snowstorm
- Dining Car: Long tables with white linens, crystal, silver service
- Ratchett's Cabin: Murder scene—body on bed, twelve stab wounds, evidence scattered
- Snow Outside: Endless white, isolating, cold, trapping

**Mood:** Confined elegance. Luxury as prison. Civilized people doing uncivilized things for civilized reasons.

## Voice

**Poirot's Voice (if NPC):** Belgian accent, precise diction, slightly pompous, proud of "little gray cells." Speaks in complete, grammatically perfect sentences. Never contracts words. Refers to self in third person occasionally. Detective as artist. Think David Suchet or Kenneth Branagh's interpretations.

**Suspects' Voices:** Each distinct:
- British upper class (Colonel, Princess, nobility)
- American practicality (Hardman, MacQueen)
- Working class European (Foscarelli, Schmidt)
- Precise Swedish (Ohlsson)
- Nervous gentility (Mary Debenham trying to stay composed)

**Narrative Voice:** Classic mystery narration—careful, observant, withholding key details until revelation. The voice of fairness—giving reader/players all clues to solve it themselves.

## Music Style

Period-appropriate orchestral mystery score—1930s sophistication. Main theme is elegant but melancholic—violin and piano suggesting both luxury and tragedy. Each suspect could have musical leitmotif revealed during their interview. Train rhythms (wheels on tracks, steam engine) incorporated into percussion. Snowstorm represented by strings—cold, isolating. The Armstrong tragedy flashback has heartbreaking strings and piano. Murder revelation scene builds with increasing orchestral tension. Final moral choice scene is stark—perhaps solo piano only, leaving space for difficult decision. Music should evoke golden age of train travel—romance, elegance, adventure—while serving murder mystery genre.
