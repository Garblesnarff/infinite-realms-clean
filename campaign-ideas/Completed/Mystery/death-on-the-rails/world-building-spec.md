### **World-Building Specification Brief: Death on the Rails**

**1. Core Concept:**
When despicable child-killer Cassetti is murdered in his locked train compartment, detective Hercule Poirot discovers an unprecedented crime: all twelve suspects are guilty conspirators who administered collective justice for a victim the law failed to punish, forcing a choice between law and morality.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the Orient Express—luxury train service connecting continents, epitome of elegant travel
*   Explain the Armstrong tragedy five years prior—kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, ransom paid, child murdered anyway
*   Write about the aftermath—mother died in childbirth from shock, father died by suicide, multiple related deaths
*   Describe Cassetti's trial—witness intimidation, technicalities, justice system failure, his freedom
*   Detail how Mary Debenham organized the conspiracy over years—finding all connected people, coordinating plan
*   Explain the plan's execution—everyone boards same train under pretenses, coordinates murder night
*   Write about each conspirator's connection to Armstrong family—servants, relatives, friends, professionals
*   Describe the legal versus moral justice debate—vigilantism, jury nullification, collective guilt

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Twelve Conspirators** (Major) - Armstrong family connections, united in purpose, equal guilt
*   **The Armstrong Legacy** (Major) - Dead family and their destroyed associates, motivating force
*   **The Legal Authorities** (Minor) - Waiting at destination, will require explanation
*   **Cassetti's Criminal Network** (Minor) - His past crimes provide alternative explanation

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Hercule Poirot (detective), Samuel Ratchett/Cassetti (victim), Mary Debenham (organizer)
*   **Tier 2:** The Twelve Suspects (all equal importance as conspirators)
*   **Tier 3:** "Train Staff," "Authorities at Destination," "Armstrong Family (deceased, in flashbacks)"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Orient Express Train** - Luxury Art Deco train, entire campaign location
*   **Ratchett's Compartment** - Locked room murder scene
*   **The Dining Car** - Social space, interviews, final revelation
*   **Individual Compartments** - Each suspect's private cabin
*   **The Locomotive** - Stopped by avalanche
*   **The Snowstorm** - Isolating environment, blocks escape and entry
*   **Flashback: Armstrong Home** - Scene of original tragedy (memory/investigation)

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Poirot investigates locked room THEN discovers impossible crime requiring new thinking
*   IF medical examination conducted THEN reveals twelve distinct wounds from different attackers
*   IF suspects interviewed individually THEN each provides alibi supported by others
*   IF Ratchett's identity investigated THEN revealed as Cassetti, Armstrong kidnapper
*   IF Armstrong tragedy researched THEN connects all twelve suspects to victim family
*   IF alibis cross-referenced THEN internal contradictions emerge but web holds
*   IF evidence analyzed carefully THEN points to conspiracy rather than single killer
*   IF red kimono investigated THEN reveals it was worn by multiple people (shared disguise)
*   IF conductor questioned hard THEN admits he used master key for the group
*   IF all facts compiled THEN only solution is collective murder
*   IF Poirot presents both solutions THEN authorities must choose which to believe
*   IF party supports truth THEN conspirators face trial, legal consequences
*   IF party supports lie THEN conspirators go free, justice outside law prevails
*   IF truth revealed publicly THEN media circus, public sympathy for accused
*   IF lie accepted THEN case closed as unknown assassin, conspirators disperse forever
