# Shadows of Inaba: Campaign Bible

## [TAG: LORE_CORE]
### Origin Myth
The "Shadows" are not monsters. They are the suppressed, unacknowledged aspects of human personality, given physical form by a localized "reality-glitch" in the sleepy rural town of Inaba. The "Midnight Channel" is not a TV show; it is a psychic projection of the collective unconscious of Inaba, a mirror reflecting the town's hidden desires, fears, and lies. The "murders" are not murders; they are "assimilations," where a Shadow consumes its human counterpart, becoming whole, but leaving the human a hollow shell. The "mystery" is not who is killing people, but *why* the Shadows are manifesting, and *what* they truly represent. The original "Fog" that blankets Inaba is not weather; it is the psychic miasma of unacknowledged truths, a veil between the conscious and unconscious mind, thinning as the reality-glitch intensifies.

### Timeline
1.  **The First Suppression (Ancient History):** A small, isolated community in what will become Inaba buries a terrible secret—a ritual sacrifice to appease a vengeful spirit—deep within the collective unconscious. The land begins to absorb the suppressed emotions.
2.  **The Age of Conformity (c. 1950s):** Post-war Japan emphasizes conformity and social harmony. Inaba, a microcosm of this, becomes a place where individuality and negative emotions are heavily suppressed. The psychic wound deepens.
3.  **The First Reality-Glitch (c. 1980s):** A powerful, localized reality-glitch occurs in Inaba, caused by a confluence of suppressed emotions and a minor cosmic anomaly. The veil between the conscious and unconscious thins.
4.  **The Birth of the Midnight Channel (c. 1990s):** The collective unconscious of Inaba begins to project itself onto reflective surfaces during foggy nights, manifesting as the "Midnight Channel."
5.  **(Surreal) The Day the Reflections Spoke (c. 2000s):** For 24 hours, all reflections in Inaba speak the deepest, darkest secrets of anyone who looks into them. Many go mad or commit suicide.
6.  **The First Shadow (c. 5 years ago):** A powerful, suppressed aspect of a human personality manifests as a physical Shadow. It consumes its human counterpart, leaving behind a hollow shell.
7.  **The Fog Deepens (Present Day):** The reality-glitch intensifies. The Fog becomes a constant presence, and the Midnight Channel is active almost every night. The Shadows are manifesting more frequently and more powerfully.
8.  **(Surreal) The Echo of a Lie (1 week ago):** A single, powerful lie told by a community leader echoes through the very fabric of reality. For a week, every time someone speaks, their words are subtly twisted to reflect the original lie.
9.  **The Narrative Collapse (Present Day):** The collective unconscious of Inaba is becoming too complex, too contradictory. It is on the verge of collapsing, threatening to unravel the very fabric of reality.
10. **(Surreal) The Day the World Became a Mirror (1 day ago):** The entire world begins to manifest as a mirror. People's lives become reflections, their actions distorted images. The horror of narrative control becomes undeniable.

### The "Why"
The metaphysical conflict is a struggle against the dissolution of self. The Shadows are not evil; they are a symptom. They force people to confront the lies they tell themselves and each other. The players are caught in this cycle, and the horror comes from the realization that the monsters they are hunting are reflections of their own suppressed desires. The goal is not to "kill" the Shadows, which is impossible, but to "integrate" them, to acknowledge and accept the darker aspects of human personality, or, perhaps, to find a way to "re-write" the collective unconscious of Inaba into something benevolent. The ultimate horror is the realization that the monster is you.

A section of Inaba where reality is unstable, a place where the Persona-Hackers are strongest.

## [TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]
### 1. The Persona Compendium
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A massive, leather-bound book that contains the entire narrative of the Investigation Team. The pages are made of a strange, translucent material, and the narrative is written in blood.
**Mechanics:** A creature who studies this book for 1 hour gains a deep understanding of the Investigation Team's narrative. They can pinpoint the location of any "plot point," "character arc," or "narrative thread." It also contains the "true name" of the Midnight Channel, which, if spoken aloud, can cause it immense pain or, if spoken with love, can soothe it.

### 2. The Midnight Channel's Remote
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A remote control that seems to be made of pure static. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this remote to manipulate the Midnight Channel. They can change the channel, fast-forward, rewind, or pause the psychic projection. They can also use it to "mute" a Shadow, temporarily suppressing its abilities. **Curse:** The remote slowly consumes the wielder's own memories. Each day the remote is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own memory. At 5 failures, the wielder's memory is completely erased, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 3. The Velvet Room Key
**Type:** Legendary Key
**Description:** A key made of pure, solidified static. It hums with a faint, psychic energy.
**Mechanics:** The key can open any door to the Velvet Room. It can also be used to "unlock" a Persona's true potential, allowing it to evolve into a more powerful form. **Curse:** The key slowly consumes the wielder's own identity. Each day the key is used, the wielder must make a WIS save. On a failure, they lose a piece of their own identity (e.g., a memory, a personality trait, a skill proficiency). At 5 failures, the wielder's identity is completely consumed, and they become a new Blank Page.

### 4. The Persona-Hackers' Goggles
**Type:** Wondrous Item
**Description:** A pair of high-tech goggles with glowing, multi-faceted lenses. They hum with a faint, electronic energy.
**Mechanics:** A creature wearing these goggles can see the "source code" of reality. They can detect reality-glitches, identify Shadow-manifestations, and perceive the Midnight Channel's narrative-logic. Once per day, the goggles can be used to perform a "Reality-Patch," which temporarily stabilizes a localized reality-warp.

### 5. The Master Scribe's Quill
**Type:** Artifact
**Description:** A quill made from a single, black feather. It writes in a neat, implacable, and utterly final script.
**Mechanics:** The wielder can use this quill to write a single, binding, magical contract. Any party who signs the contract is magically bound to uphold their end of the bargain, on pain of being "erased" from existence by the Shadows. The quill can also be used to "serve a summons" on any being, forcing them to appear for a negotiation.
