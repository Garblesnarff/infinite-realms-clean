# Campaign Bible: Murder on the Astral Express

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The First Timetable
Before space and time were separate concepts, reality was a single, infinitely dense point. The **First Conductor**, a primordial being of pure order, sought to create distance and duration. It took the "point" and stretched it into a "line," inventing the concept of a journey. The Astral Express is not a train; it is the physical manifestation of the First Conductor's original thought, a self-propelled argument for the existence of "here" and "there." Its tracks are the ley lines of causality, and its destinations are moments in time as much as places in space. The "engine" is a captured paradox: a clock that runs backward and forward simultaneously, powering the train with the energy released by its constant self-contradiction.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **The Un-Point (-1,000,000 Y):** The First Conductor creates the concept of a "journey." The Astral Express begins its first, endless run.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Passenger):** A lost god stumbles upon the train and boards, becoming the first being to travel between planes.
3.  **-6500 Y (The Modron Contract):** The Modrons of Mechanus, recognizing the train as a pinnacle of order, sign a contract to become its eternal staff in exchange for a single, perfect gear from the engine.
4.  **-4200 Y (The Githyanki Heist):** Githyanki pirates, seeking to control the flow of time, successfully board the train and steal the Dining Car. They are repelled, but the car is never recovered, replaced by a new one with weaker enchantments.
5.  **-3000 Y (The Year of Three Wednesdays):** The engine's paradox-core hiccups, causing a single day to repeat three times for all passengers. This surreal event establishes the train's reputation for temporal weirdness.
6.  **-1500 Y (The Neutrality Accords):** After a war between devils and angels spills into the Lounge Car, the Express is declared neutral ground by all major planar powers. Violence is magically forbidden aboard the train (a rule with loopholes).
7.  **-700 Y (The Sleeper Car Incident):** A Night Hag attempts to turn the Sleeper Car into a permanent annex of the Plane of Nightmares. She is sealed within a single cabin, which is now permanently locked.
8.  **-100 Y (The Unscheduled Stop):** The train makes its first-ever unscheduled stop in a dimension of pure, silent thought. It returns a week later, with every passenger's inner monologue now faintly audible to others.
9.  **-10 Y (The Murder of the Conductor):** The First Conductor is found shattered into a million pieces of glass. Its replacement is a lesser being, a Deva, who is more of a manager than a cosmic entity.
10. **Present Day:** The Archmage of Paradoxes, a being who was studying the engine, is found murdered in the Dining Car. The train is put on lockdown between dimensions, and the party is deputized to solve the crime.

### The "Why": The Fragility of Causality
The murder is not just a crime; it is a metaphysical attack on the concept of linear time. The victim was not just a person; he was the "lock" on the engine's paradox-core. With him dead, the engine is becoming unstable. The train is beginning to "skip" on the tracks of causality, causing time loops, spatial distortions, and paradoxes. If the murderer is not found and the engine is not stabilized before the train reaches its next destination (The End of Time), all of history could unravel, re-shuffling events into a chaotic, meaningless sequence.

## 6. ITEM DATABASE
[TAG: ITEM_LEGENDARY]

### Artifacts of the Express
1.  **The Timetable of Inevitability:** A train schedule that shows the "scheduled" time of death for anyone on board. It can be altered, but doing so requires "paying" the lost time from your own lifespan.
2.  **The Master-Key of Departures:** A key that can open a door on the train to any location the user has previously been. Each use, however, leaves the door open for 1 minute, risking an unscheduled passenger.
3.  **The Conductor's Whistle:** A silver whistle that can stop time for 6 seconds (1 round) for everyone except the user. It can only be used once per "stop."
4.  **The Paradox-Gear:** A gear from the engine's core. It exists in multiple states at once. It can be used to force a single d20 roll to be both a success and a failure simultaneously, creating a chaotic but potentially useful outcome.
5.  **The Black Box:** A small, indestructible box from the original Dining Car. It contains a perfect, incorruptible recording of one event. The party must choose which event to record over the course of the investigation.

[TAG: ITEM_LOOT]
### Custom Loot (Weird/Low Probability)
1.  **A Ticket to a Place That Doesn't Exist.**
2.  **The Suspiciously Heavy Spoon:** A silver spoon that weighs 50 pounds, but only when someone isn't looking at it.
3.  **The Sommelier's Corkscrew:** It doesn't open wine bottles; it uncorks repressed memories.
4.  **A Monocle of Scrutiny:** Allows you to see the "flaws" in any person or object, manifesting as tiny, glowing cracks.
5.  **The Alibi-Maker's Watch:** A pocket watch that can be set back by up to one hour, but it only changes the user's memory of events, not reality.
6.  **The Red Herring:** A literal, smoked red herring. If you present it as evidence, everyone will focus on it for 10 minutes, ignoring all other clues.
7.  **The Disappearing Ink:** Ink that vanishes after an hour, but the words reappear on a random, nearby surface.
8.  **The Motive-Monger's Handkerchief:** A handkerchief that, when held, whispers plausible (but almost certainly wrong) motives for any crime.
9.  **The Schrödinger's Cat-in-a-Box:** A small, sealed box. You don't know if the cat inside is alive or dead. It's a great conversation starter.
10. **The Butler's Gloves:** A pair of white gloves that are perpetually clean, no matter what you touch.
11. **The Tell-Tale Heart:** A small, clockwork heart that beats faster when someone nearby tells a lie.
12. **The Final Chapter:** A single, bound page from a book. Reading it makes you feel a profound sense of closure.
13. **The Smoking Gun:** A small pistol that constantly emits a thin stream of harmless, pleasant-smelling smoke.
14. **The Untraceable Poison:** A vial of liquid that is only poisonous if the victim believes it to be.
15. **The Perfect Alibi:** A signed, notarized document from a Modron stating you were with them at the time of the murder. The Modron does not exist.
16. **The Crumpled Confession:** A note found on the floor that reads "I did it." The handwriting is yours.
17. **The Fingerprint-less Gloves:** Gloves that don't just hide your fingerprints; they temporarily erase them from your hands.
18. **The Locked-Room Mystery Box:** A small puzzle box that is impossible to open, even from the inside.
19. **The Detective's Deerstalker:** A hat that gives you advantage on Investigation checks, but disadvantage on all social checks because you look ridiculous.
20. **The Chekhov's Gun Permit:** A permit that legally allows you to have a gun on the train, provided it was mentioned in the first act and will be fired in the third.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: The Deduction Board
*   **The Board:** The GM maintains a "Deduction Board" (physical or virtual) with pictures of all the suspects.
*   **Clues & Testimonies:** When the party discovers a key piece of evidence or testimony, they get a physical card to place on the board. Clues can be linked to suspects with string.
*   **Making Accusations:** To make a formal accusation, the party must have at least three clues linked to a single suspect. A false accusation will cause the accused to become uncooperative for the rest of the investigation.
*   **The Final Reveal:** During the final gathering, the party must use the board to lay out their entire theory of the crime, from motive to opportunity to means.

### Physics: Temporal Hiccups
*   At the start of each "day" (or major act), the GM rolls a d20. On a 1-3, a "Temporal Hiccup" occurs. The GM rolls on a table of strange time-based effects:
    *   **Time-Loop:** The last 6 seconds repeat 1d4 times.
    *   **De-Sync:** One party member is 3 seconds ahead of everyone else (acts first, but can't interact with others).
    *   **Echoes:** Ghostly after-images of the passengers replay events from an hour ago.
    *   **Reverse:** Everything in one train car happens in reverse for one minute.
