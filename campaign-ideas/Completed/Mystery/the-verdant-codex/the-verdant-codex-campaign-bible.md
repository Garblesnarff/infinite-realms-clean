# CAMPAIGN BIBLE: THE VERDANT CODEX

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Molting of the Weave
Before the gods categorized magic into schools, the raw Weave was a living, breathing entity. In a prehistoric era known as the "Botanical Eon," the Weave molted its skin to shed the chaotic energies of the primordial chaos. This shed skin did not dissolve; instead, it fossilized into pages of vellum, pressing the patterns of raw creation into leaf-like script. The *Verdant Codex* is not merely a book; it is the fossilized exoskeleton of Magic itself. To read it is to bypass the gods and access the source code of reality, which is why the text appears to move—it is still alive, merely dormant.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-4000 Years:** The Weave molts. The "skin" is gathered by the First Gardener (Archfey ancestor).
2.  **-2500 Years:** The Gloomwood Archive is grown (not built) around the Codex to suppress its radiation.
3.  **-1500 Years:** **The Great Silence.** All birds in the Material Plane stop singing for one year. (Reason: A page of the Codex was turned, briefly overwriting the concept of "sound").
4.  **-800 Years:** The Archmage Valerius I (ancestor of the current antagonist) attempts to steal the Codex but only tears the binding.
5.  **-300 Years:** **The Rain of Upside-Down Fish.** A localized gravity inversion event caused by a leaking page.
6.  **-50 Years:** The "Mad Mage" Xylos successfully steals the Codex but shatters his mind. He scatters the pages across dimensions to hide them.
7.  **-49 Years:** The Magus Covenant creates the "Seeker’s Compass," a device that tracks magic density, to hunt the pages.
8.  **-10 Years:** The Court of Gloomwood declares a "Wild Hunt" that never ends until the book is returned.
9.  **-6 Months:** **The Whispering Plague.** People in the coastal regions begin speaking Sylvan in their sleep, marking the awakening of a submerged page.
10. **Present Day:** The players find Page 7 (The Page of Unsprouting).

### The "Why": Metaphysical Instability
The Codex acted as a metaphysical anchor for the Feywild. Without it, the Feywild is "drifting" closer to the Material Plane. This is causing "bleed-through"—forests growing overnight in cities, people turning into wooden statues, and seasons changing daily. If the Codex is not reassembled, the two planes will collide, erasing civilization and replacing it with eternal, chaotic wilderness.

## Section 8: MECHANICS

[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Physics: The Fey Bleed
Whenever a page of the Codex is used, roll a d6. On a 1, reality shifts nearby. Gravity might flip, colors might swap, or time might loop for 1 round.

### Subsystem: Glamour Sickness
Spending too long in the Feywild or holding a Codex page requires CON saves. Failure results in "Glamour Sickness":
*   **Stage 1:** You see things that aren't there.
*   **Stage 2:** You forget your own name.
*   **Stage 3:** You physically turn into a plant or animal.

### Subsystem: Reputation
*   **Fey Court:** Tracks "Etiquette." High etiquette grants safe passage. Low etiquette invites the Wild Hunt.
*   **Magus Covenant:** Tracks "Academic Credit." High credit grants access to libraries. Low credit gets you branded a heretic.

---
