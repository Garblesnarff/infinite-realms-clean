# Campaign Bible: The Watchmen Protocol

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### [TAG: LORE_CORE]

**Origin Myth: The Silence of the Weave**
Before the Paragons, reality was not fixed. The "Unmaking" was not a war of armies, but a metaphysical erosion where concepts ceased to exist—colors were forgotten, gravity became a suggestion, and love became toxic radiation. The world did not fight back; it forgot how to fight. The Paragons did not save the world by killing a dark lord; they saved it by anchoring reality. They utilized the **Axiom Engines**—artifacts of absolute law—to nail the laws of physics back into the firmament. The peace that followed is not natural; it is a forced, artificial stasis held together by the will of broken men and women. The "Gods" are dead; the Paragons are the jailers of physics.

**Timeline of the Era of Silence**
1.  **-40 BP (Before Protocol):** *The Day of Black Sun.* The Unmaking begins; the sun turns into a weeping eye for 24 hours.
2.  **-35 BP:** *The Culling of Concepts.* The concept of "Compassion" briefly ceases to exist globally; millions die in riots.
3.  **-30 BP:** *The Axiom Integration.* The Paragons activate the Engines. The Laughing Blade sacrifices his ability to feel pain to fuel the binding.
4.  **-25 BP:** *The Treaty of Glass.* The Eastern Empire and Western Alliance sign a peace treaty on a sheet of glass suspended over a volcano; symbolism for the fragility of the new age.
5.  **-20 BP:** *The Great Retirement.* The Paragons disband. The public cheers, not knowing the heroes were forced out by the fear of their own power.
6.  **-15 BP:** *The Rain of Clocks (Weird Event).* Over the city of Oakhaven, it rains functional pocket watches for three days. All are set to five minutes to midnight.
7.  **-10 BP:** *The Bureau Act.* The government criminalizes unsanctioned heroism. The "Watchmen Protocol" is drafted in secret.
8.  **-5 BP:** *The Neon Pox (Weird Event).* A magical plague turns victims into living, glowing glass statues. Vex cures it, gaining massive political favor.
9.  **-2 BP:** *The Whispering Senate.* The Western Alliance senate building becomes sentient and refuses to let politicians leave until they pass a budget.
10. **0 BP:** *The Fall.* The Laughing Blade is thrown from his tower. The campaign begins.

**The Metaphysical "Why"**
The conflict exists because the **Axiom Engines** are failing. Reality is trying to untether itself again. Vex believes the only way to re-seal the cracks is a massive sacrifice of souls—a metaphysical mortar. The "War" he fabricates is a ritual to feed the Engines, disguised as a political false flag.
