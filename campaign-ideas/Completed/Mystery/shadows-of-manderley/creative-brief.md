# Creative Brief: Shadows of Manderley

## Art Style: Gothic Coastal Romance (Rebecca Aesthetic)

Inspired by Daphne du Maurier's Gothic romance and Hitchcock's film—windswept coastal estates, oppressive manor houses, 1930s elegance mixed with decay, psychological horror through atmosphere.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Muted, atmospheric colors—gray skies, dark green seas, black cliffs, white fog. Manderley interiors are rich but oppressive—deep reds, dark woods, heavy curtains. Rebecca's colors (when remembered): vibrant, alive—blues and whites. Second wife's colors: muted, uncertain—grays and pastels. Fire at end: bright destructive oranges and reds, liberating.

**Character Design:**
- **Second Mrs. de Winter:** Young, plain, uncertain posture, inappropriate clothes initially (traveling suits when evening gowns needed). Visual transformation through campaign as confidence grows.
- **Maxim:** Dark, brooding, handsome but haunted. Initially cold and distant, eventually vulnerable.
- **Mrs. Danvers:** Severe, black dress always, gaunt, ghost-like, rarely blinks, appears silently. Possibly gender-ambiguous.
- **Rebecca (in memories/paintings):** Impossibly beautiful, vibrant, alive, perfect posture, expensive clothes. Too perfect—uncanny valley.
- **Jack Favell:** Handsome but dissolute, charming smile hiding cruelty.

**Environments:**
- Manderley: Gothic revival mansion, beautiful but oppressive. Rebecca's taste everywhere—perfect but cold.
- Rebecca's Bedroom: Frozen in time, shrine, her monogrammed items, hairbrush with hair still in it.
- The Cliffs: Dramatic coastal setting, waves crashing, dangerous beauty.
- The Cove: Where boat is discovered, site of death.
- Fog and atmosphere constantly—Gothic weather.

**Mood:** Beautiful but menacing. Elegance as prison. The past refusing to stay dead. Every beautiful thing hides decay.

## Voice

**Mrs. Danvers' Voice:** Cold, quiet, appears behind you without sound. Passive-aggressive perfection. "Rebecca always did it this way." Every word cuts. Never raises voice—doesn't need to. Obsessive devotion turned to weapon.

**Maxim's Voice:** Upper-class British, controlled, occasionally breaking into passion or rage. Guards emotions carefully. When confessing truth, finally vulnerable.

**Narrator/PC Internal Voice:** Insecure, self-doubting initially. "I am not the sort of person men marry. I am gauche and awkward." Evolves to confidence by campaign end.

**Rebecca (in others' descriptions):** Never heard directly, only through worshipful remembrance. Described as witty, charming, perfect hostess. Contrast with revealed truth.

## Music Style

Lush orchestral Gothic romance—Bernard Herrmann's Rebecca score as template. Main theme is haunting strings and piano, beautiful but melancholic. Manderley theme is grand but oppressive—full orchestra suggesting weight of history. Rebecca's theme is deceptively beautiful, romantic on surface but with dissonant undertones hinting at darkness beneath. Mrs. Danvers has no theme—just cold silence or single sustained note. The sea is represented by low strings and brass—dangerous, eternal, witnessing everything. Costume ball is period dance music turning horrific when costume reveal happens. Fire climax is intense orchestral crescendo—destruction as liberation. Final theme is hopeful but tinged with loss—freedom bought at great cost.
