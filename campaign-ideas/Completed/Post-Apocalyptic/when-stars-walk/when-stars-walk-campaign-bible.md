# Campaign Bible: When Stars Walk

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Celestial Fascia
In the beginning, the universe was not a void, but a screaming ocean of raw, corrosive possibility called the "Flux." To create a safe harbor for causality, the Architects did not build a wall; they skinned a dead god. The "Sky" is the stretching, translucent hide of a cosmic entity, pinned in place by the Celestial Anchor. The Stars were not lights, but the glowing, pressure-bearing rivets holding this skin taut against the Flux. When the Anchor shattered, the skin went slack. The "Constellations" that fell are not merely energetic avatars; they are the sentient rivets of reality, confused and traumatized, frantically trying to pin down the laws of physics in a world that is dissolving back into the Flux.

### Timeline of the Shattering
1.  **-10,000 Years:** The Architects drive the Golden Nails (Stars) into the Firmament, sealing the Flux.
2.  **-500 Years:** The Order of the Anchor forgets the "Skin" myth, treating the Anchor as a religious idol rather than a structural bolt.
3.  **-3 Months (The Event):** The Void Prophet, seeking to hear the "music beyond," strikes the Anchor with a hammer made of silenced sound.
4.  **Day 0:** The Sky wrinkles. Twelve massive impact craters appear simultaneously. The sun turns a bruised purple for one hour.
5.  **Day 2:** Gravity fails in the Northern Hemisphere for 6 seconds; 40,000 people "fall" into the upper atmosphere and freeze.
6.  **Day 14 (The First Miracle):** Taurus weeps over a barren field; the tears grow corn made of solid gold that screams when harvested.
7.  **Day 30:** The "Metric Inquisition" forms, burning books that claim a mile is 5,280 feet, as distance is now subjective near Starborn.
8.  **Day 45:** Rain turns to mercury in the Western Reaches. The economy collapses; glass becomes the new currency.
9.  **Day 60:** Aries declares war on the concept of "Peace," physically manifesting Peace as a golden calf and butchering it.
10. **Day 90 (Current):** The Horizon Line begins to curl upward. Seers predict the "Great Unraveling" in 90 days.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil; it is **Structure vs. Entropy**. The Starborn are hyper-dense nodes of "Rule of Law." They are trying to save Earth by imposing their specific physical laws (War, Growth, Balance) with absolute rigidity. However, Earth is a flexible reality. The Starborn are too heavy for this dimension. Their presence is cracking the tectonic plates of logic. If they stay, reality crystallizes and shatters. If they leave without a new Anchor, the Flux consumes everything.
