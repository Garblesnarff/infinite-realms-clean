# World-Building Specification: When Stars Walk

## The Celestial Anchor

Ancient magical construct holding constellations in sky. Created millennia ago by Celestial Architects to prevent divine beings from descending. Kept stars distant and abstract. When it shattered:
- All twelve zodiac constellations fell simultaneously
- Created massive impact zones
- Released cosmic energy across world
- Mortals near impacts became Anchor-Touched

## The Starborn Transformation

Constellations are naturally abstract concepts given form by belief. When forced into physical reality:
- Become titan-sized embodiments of their nature
- Gain physical bodies of stellar material
- Experience mortality (hunger, pain, desire) for first time
- React differently to embodiment

**Why They're Dangerous:**
Not inherently evil, but cosmic beings with absolute power and new understanding of physical desires create catastrophe.

## Earth Stability Crisis

Planet has material reality limit. Embodied constellations exceed this:
- Their presence warps physics
- Each day they remain, Earth's structure weakens
- Symptoms: Earthquakes, reality tears, dimensional bleeding
- Timeline: 6 months until complete collapse
- Currently 3 months in (halfway to doom)

## The Twelve Domains (Brief)

Each Starborn claimed territory and remade it:
- **Aries:** Eternal battlefield kingdoms
- **Taurus:** Abundant but hoarded paradise
- **Gemini:** Civil war between twin gods
- **Cancer:** Fortress-cities of perfect protection
- **Leo:** Golden empire of hierarchy
- **Virgo:** Geometric perfection killing variety
- **Libra:** Enforced absolute fairness
- **Scorpio:** Life and death are negotiable
- **Sagittarius:** Wandering god leaving chaos
- **Capricorn:** Fossilized hierarchy
- **Aquarius:** Revolutionary constant change
- **Pisces:** Dream-reality fusion

## Mortal Reactions

**Worshippers:** See Starborn as gods to serve
**Resisters:** Fight against divine tyranny
**Pragmatists:** Negotiate with Starborn for survival
**Transforming:** Slowly becoming constellation-beings themselves
**Anchor-Touched:** Immune to compulsion, can fight back

## Magic System

**Starborn Powers:** Reality-warping divine abilities
**Anchor Fragment Magic:** Party wields stellar power
**Transformation Magic:** Mortals becoming part-constellation
**Coalition Magic:** Combined Starborn powers

## The Path Forward

Three possible endings:
1. **Restoration:** All Starborn return to sky, old Anchor rebuilt
2. **New Covenant:** Flexible Anchor allows visiting not staying
3. **Age of Gods:** Some Starborn stay, Earth adapts (barely)

Campaign is race against collapse while building coalition to restore Anchor before too late.

## Philosophical Core

Explores what happens when the divine and mortal mix. Gods discovering mortality. Mortals encountering real gods. Power's corrupting influence. The price of divinity made flesh.
