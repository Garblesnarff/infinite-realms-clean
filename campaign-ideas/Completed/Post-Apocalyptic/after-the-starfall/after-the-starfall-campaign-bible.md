# Campaign Bible: After the Starfall

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Shattered Sky
In the beginning, the world was a single, perfect **Cosmic Egg**, holding within it the promise of infinite life and order. But the Cosmic Egg was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant wreckage, chaos, and rebirth. The "Starfall" is not just the residue of divine destruction; it is the dust of countless shattered stars, the memory of every lost world. The "After" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Cosmic Egg's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the Egg and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Cosmic Egg's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of cosmic remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Cosmic Egg is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of wreckage and chaos.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Starfall):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its cosmic dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Wreckage Plague):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic Egg's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost world, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Star Cult):** Mortals discover the power of destruction and form the Star Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the Egg.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Collapse):** A rogue Star Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Wreck-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the After, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic Egg's fury causes all beings to remember every lost world, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Cosmic Egg's Whisper):** The Cosmic Egg, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Cosmic Egg, the **Essence of Creation**, is stolen from the Star Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the Star Cult, each with their own unique connection to destruction. They are caught in a crisis as the Cosmic Egg's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of cosmic remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Destruction
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Cosmic Egg's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of wreckage and chaos, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The Star Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become Star Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Destruction Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted world, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Cosmic Egg's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Wreck-Weaving
*   **Wreck-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the cosmic dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Wreck-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Wreck-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
