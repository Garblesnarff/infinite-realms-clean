# Creative Brief: Road Warriors of the Wasteland

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Vehicular Warfare (Mad Max-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal, practical aesthetics of *Mad Max: Fury Road* with emphasis on improvised vehicle modification, desert wasteland beauty, vehicular combat intensity, and survival through chrome and blood. This style captures the desperate beauty of the apocalypse where vehicles are life itself.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Practical Improvisation:** Vehicles built from scrap, visible welds, functional over aesthetic, creative problem-solving
*   **Wasteland Beauty:** Harsh desert landscapes, dust storms, toxic beauty, brutal sun
*   **Chrome and Blood:** War paint, chrome spray, violent action mixed with ritualistic meaning
*   **Convoy Action:** Multiple vehicles in formation, escort tactics, boarding actions, explosive combat

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Post-apocalyptic survival, vehicular combat, wasteland beauty, death cult chrome, desperate hope, resource scarcity
*   **Feeling:** The brutal simplicity of survival where your vehicle is your life. Finding beauty and meaning in wasteland's harshness. Glory through chrome and blood.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Desert Wasteland:** Orange-brown sand, bleached blue sky, rust reds, toxic yellows
*   **Vehicles:** Weathered metals, rust browns, chrome silver, war paint whites and blacks
*   **Action:** Orange explosions and fire, chrome spray silver, red blood, dust clouds brown
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by orange-brown desert wasteland under bleached blue sky. Rusted vehicle with chrome accents and white war paint races forward. Orange explosion blooms behind. Brown dust cloud trails. Silver chrome spray catches sunlight. Red blood splatter on windshield."

**3. Vehicle Design:**
*   **Improvised War Machines:** Built from scavenged parts—muscle car bodies, truck armor, motorcycle frames
*   **Functional Decoration:** Spikes for ramming, armor plates welded on, skulls as hood ornaments, practical weapons
*   **Weathered Survivors:** Rust, dents, scratches, parts from multiple vehicles, held together by willpower
*   **Prompt Example:** "A post-apocalyptic war rig—massive truck with fortress built on trailer. Armor plates welded haphazardly. Spikes jutting from all sides. Multiple skull decorations. Jury-rigged weapons. Rust and weathering visible. Chrome accents catching light. War boys clinging to sides. Dust cloud trailing. Functional brutal magnificence."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Endless Wasteland:** Desert stretching to horizon, occasional rock formations, dead trees, toxic patches
*   **Dust Storms:** Massive brown clouds with electrical discharges, visibility near zero
*   **The Citadel:** Vertical fortress carved from mesa, water cascading from top, slaves below
*   **Prompt Example:** "Endless orange-brown desert wasteland stretching to horizon. Bleached sky with brutal sun. Distant rock formations. A massive dust storm approaches from left—towering brown cloud with lightning. Scattered vehicle wreckage as landmarks. Heat shimmer distorts distance. Toxic patches show different colored sand."

**5. Combat Action:**
*   **Vehicular Warfare:** Ramming, boarding with poles, shooting from moving vehicles, explosive chases
*   **War Boy Tactics:** Chrome-sprayed faces, suicide attacks, acrobatic boarding, steering wheel worship
*   **Convoy Protection:** Central rig surrounded by escort vehicles, organized chaos
*   **Prompt Example:** "High-speed convoy battle. Central War Rig massive and armored. Multiple escort vehicles—modified cars with weapons. War boys on poles swing between vehicles attempting boarding. Explosions from mines. Chrome-sprayed war boy stands on hood preparing kamikaze. Dust clouds everywhere. Orange fire and chrome silver dominate."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Harsh Desert Sun:** Intense overhead light creating deep shadows, heat shimmer effects
*   **Practical Light Sources:** Fire, explosions, chrome reflections, no artificial neon
*   **Dust Atmosphere:** Light diffused through constant dust, creating atmospheric depth
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by intense overhead desert sun creating harsh shadows under vehicles. Chrome surfaces reflect bright sunlight. Orange explosion in background casts warm light creating rim lighting. Dust in air diffuses light creating atmospheric haze. Deep shadows show brutal contrast."

## Voice

A gritty, survival-hardened voice with underlying hope refusing to die, like someone who's seen too much death but keeps fighting anyway. The pacing is intense during combat, contemplative during wasteland travel. The tone shifts between brutal pragmatism ("We need fuel or we die"), reverent witness to glory ("Witness me!"), and defiant hope. There's an underlying theme of finding humanity in brutality. Dusty, weathered, but unbroken. Role: The voice of wasteland survival.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** Heavy percussion-driven rhythms, industrial sounds, taiko drums, electric guitar, primal energy. Moments of quiet string instruments showing beauty in desolation.
*   **Sound Effects:** Engine roars, explosions, gunfire, metal grinding, chrome spray hissing, war boys chanting "witness!", dust storms howling, vehicles crashing.
*   **Dynamic Music:** Builds during chases, percussion intensifies with combat, drops to atmospheric during wasteland travel, triumphant when victories occur.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** Wind howling across desert, engine hum during travel, distant explosions, war boys chanting in distance, mostly harsh silence of wasteland.
