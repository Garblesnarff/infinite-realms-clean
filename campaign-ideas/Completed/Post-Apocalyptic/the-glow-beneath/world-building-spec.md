# World-Building Specification: The Glow Beneath

## Geographic Layout

### The Luminous Deep - Detailed Geography

**Total Scope:**
- Underground ocean system spanning 10,000 square miles
- Depth ranges from 500 feet to 6,000 feet below surface
- Connects to surface world through 7 major access points (The Descent being largest)
- Fed by underwater rivers and geothermal vents
- Isolated from world's regular oceans but connected through ancient subterranean channels

**Depth Zones:**

*The Shallows (0-500 feet)*
- Highest concentration of human harvesting
- Ecosystem showing stress—20% reduction in bioluminescent density
- Kelp forests, coral reefs, abundant fish
- Water temperature: 55-60°F
- Visibility: 100 feet in lit areas

*The Mid-Light (500-2,000 feet)*
- Healthy, sustainable ecosystem
- Lumen Grotto located here (depth: 1,200 feet)
- Greater diversity of bioluminescent species
- Water temperature: 50-55°F
- Visibility: 60 feet

*The Abyss (2,000-5,000 feet)*
- Where Luminara's consciousness is strongest
- Strange mega-fauna evolved in isolation
- Garden of Lights at 3,000 feet
- Water temperature: 45-50°F
- Visibility: 30 feet without local bioluminescence

*The Wound (5,000-6,000 feet)*
- Dead zone, no bioluminescence survives
- Only location in Deep without any light
- Cold water upwelling: 35-40°F
- Visibility: 0 feet (absolute darkness)
- Necrotic field extends 1 mile radius from center

### Surface Geography

**Tideloch City** (Primary Hub)
- Population: 50,000
- Founded: 400 years ago when The Descent was discovered
- Government: Merchant Council (elected from guild leaders)
- Economy: 80% dependent on bioluminescence trade
- Military: Harbor Guard (200), Deep Patrol (50 divers)

Districts:
- **The Upper City**: Wealthy merchant homes, constantly lit
- **The Glow Market**: Central bazaar, specialized bioluminescence shops
- **Harvester's Wharf**: Industrial zone, where ships dock
- **The Descent Access**: Fortified checkpoint, toll collection
- **The Depths** (slums): Poorest area, ironically named, barely lit
- **The Eternal Lantern**: Entertainment district, never sleeps, never dark

**Other Surface Communities:**
- **Shimmer Port** (pop. 8,000): Secondary access point, 200 miles south
- **Darkwater** (pop. 3,000): Refused to adopt bioluminescence, uses traditional flames, isolationist
- **New Radiance** (pop. 15,000): Newest city, built entirely around light-technology

## Historical Timeline

### The Age Before Light (Pre-10,000 years ago)

**Luminara's Birth:**
- Created during the formation of the world's oceans
- One of several primordial beings embodying natural forces
- Luminara specifically embodied "life in darkness"—the principle that life needs no sun
- Spent millennia creating bioluminescent organisms as expression of its nature

**The First Deep Singers:**
- Ancient whales developed symbiotic relationship with Luminara
- Evolved to produce bioluminescence themselves
- Became Luminara's companions, singers of its glory
- Helped spread bioluminescence to all ocean depths

### The Primordial War (10,000 years ago)

**The Conflict:**
- War between primordials and newly-ascended gods
- Exact cause lost to time (competing creation myths)
- Luminara tried to remain neutral, hiding in depths
- Found and wounded by [WEAPON NAME—DM choice]

**The Weapon:**
- Spear of Un-Light: Godforged weapon designed to kill primordials
- Doesn't destroy—corrupts, causes slow necrotic death
- Embedded in Luminara's "core" (the most concentrated part of its consciousness)
- Breaking off inside wounded Luminara worse than killing it

**The Fracturing:**
- To survive, Luminara fragmented its consciousness
- Split itself across all its bioluminescent organisms
- Each organism carries tiny fraction of awareness
- Collective still functions but Luminara "forgot" it was one being
- Consciousness continued operating on instinct: create light, maintain ecosystems

**The Aftermath:**
- Primordials defeated or hidden, gods ascended to dominance
- Luminara's wound never healed, creating permanent dead zone
- Deep Singers witnessed everything, kept vigil, waiting for their friend to remember itself

### The Age of Discovery (4,000-400 years ago)

**Early Encounters:**
- Various civilizations discovered parts of the Luminous Deep
- Small-scale harvesting for novelty and magic
- Lumens evolved during this period—humans who stayed in the Deep, adapted, eventually symbiosed

**The Lumen Evolution** (2,000 years ago):
- Group of human refugees fled underground during surface war
- Found the Luminous Deep, survived by eating bioluminescent organisms
- Over generations, organisms began living IN them
- By generation 50, Lumens were distinct subspecies
- Developed communion abilities naturally through symbiosis

### The Age of Exploitation (400 years ago - Present)

**The Great Descent Discovery:**
- Explorer team found the largest access point
- Realized economic potential immediately
- Founded Tideloch City within 10 years

**The Harvesting Boom** (350-200 years ago):
- Rapid expansion of bioluminescence industry
- Surface cities adopted it universally
- Lumens initially welcomed surface dwellers, shared knowledge
- Relationship soured as harvesting intensified

**The First Warning** (200 years ago):
- Synchronized pulse visible across entire Deep
- Lumens interpreted it as distress but couldn't prove sentience
- Surface authorities dismissed as natural phenomenon
- Mother Radiance's visions began this year

**Escalation** (200-50 years ago):
- Harvesting increased 400%
- Multiple zones showing ecosystem stress
- Lumen-human relations deteriorated
- Several violent incidents between activists and harvesters

**The Catatonia Incidents** (50 years ago):
- First documented case of communion overload
- 12 people over 50 years went catatonic after prolonged Deep exposure
- Always described same thing before falling silent: "It's waking up. It remembers."
- Dismissed as depth sickness or contaminated air

**Recent Escalation** (5 years ago - Present):
- Synchronized pulses increasing in frequency and complexity
- Harvested bioluminescence resisting containment (organisms dying faster, or trying to return to Deep)
- Captain Voidcaller begins sabotage operations (2 years ago)
- The Wound begins expanding (1 year ago)
- Campaign begins with most severe synchronized pulse yet

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Harvesters Guild

**Structure:**
- Guild Master: Kaito Brightwater (publicly), Council of Seven (actually controls policy)
- Members: 2,000 licensed harvesters, 500 ships, 10,000 support staff
- Wealth: Controls 60% of Tideloch's economy

**Harvesting Methods:**

*Traditional Netting:*
- Large nets collect free-floating bioluminescent organisms
- Relatively sustainable if quotas respected
- Yields 100 vials per ship per week

*Deep Trawling:*
- Scrapes entire sections of reef/kelp forest
- Highly destructive, kills ecosystem
- Yields 1,000 vials per operation
- Officially illegal but poorly enforced

*Colony Farming:*
- Attempts to farm bioluminescent organisms in captivity
- 90% failure rate—organisms dim and die away from the Deep
- Suggests consciousness/connection is necessary for bioluminescence

**Political Power:**
- Three of seven Merchant Council seats
- Funds Harbor Guard (de facto private police)
- Controls access to The Descent through licensing

**Internal Divisions:**
- Traditionalists: Want sustainable harvesting, recognize long-term thinking
- Profiteers: Maximize short-term gains, dismiss Luminara consciousness
- Sympathizers: Secret guild members who leak information to activists

### The Lumen Nation

**Population and Culture:**
- Total population: 5,000 across multiple grottos
- Largest settlement: The Primary Grotto (2,000)
- Society: Communal, consensus-based, no formal hierarchy
- Lifespan: 200-300 years (symbiosis extends life)

**Biology:**
- Begin as baseline humans who undergo symbiosis ritual
- Bioluminescent organisms live in/on skin, visible through translucent flesh
- Can survive underwater indefinitely (organisms provide oxygen)
- Mandatory communion with Luminara (minimum 1 hour daily)

**Abilities:**
- Natural telepathy within 30 feet (via bioluminescent pulses)
- Can "speak" light-language fluently
- Darkvision 120 feet
- Resistance to cold, pressure doesn't affect them
- Can sense Luminara's emotional state instinctively

**Beliefs:**
- Luminara is sacred but not a god—more like parent or teacher
- All bioluminescent life is extension of Luminara
- Harvesting is murder, surface dwellers are ignorant rather than evil
- Destiny: Help Luminara remember itself, facilitate communication with surface

**Relations:**
- Hostile to Harvesters Guild
- Sympathetic to surface civilians (they don't know better)
- Allied with Deep Singers
- Divided on Captain Voidcaller (some support her methods)

**Key Locations:**
- Primary Grotto (described in main campaign doc)
- The Communion Pools: Where new Lumens undergo symbiosis
- The Archive of Patterns: Recorded light-language messages across centuries
- The Listening Chambers: Specialized for deep communion with Luminara

### The Deep Singers

**Nature:**
- Whale-like megafauna, evolved in the Luminous Deep
- Original companions of Luminara before the war
- Biological immortality (oldest is 10,000+ years old)
- Population: Approximately 50 individuals

**Abilities:**
- Whale song that can be heard throughout entire Deep
- Bioluminescent patterns on their skin (like moving tattoos)
- Can survive in any depth, including the Wound (though it pains them)
- Telepathic communication with each other and Luminara
- Some reality-warping through song (environmental magic)

**Culture:**
- No formal society—each is individual with own personality
- Meet once per century for "The Gathering" (ceremonial reunion)
- Primary purpose: Keep Luminara company during its sleep
- Now: Trying to facilitate its awakening safely

**Named Individuals:**
- **Old Mother**: Eldest, 10,000+ years, witnessed the Wounding
- **Brightsong**: Youngest (only 500 years), most curious about surface dwellers
- **Deeptone**: Bass singer, his voice can be felt as vibration miles away
- **Scarweaver**: Wounded by harpoon 50 years ago, distrusts all surface folk
- **Dreamkeeper**: Spends most time in communion, barely conscious in material world

**Relations:**
- Revere Luminara (but as friend, not deity)
- Friendly to Lumens (see them as Luminara's new children)
- Wary of surface dwellers (history of whaling attempts)
- Will test party's worthiness before allowing deep access

### The Light-Keepers

**Role:**
- Maintain and distribute bioluminescent lamps across Tideloch
- Essentially city utility workers
- 500 members, well-paid, secure jobs
- Families have been Light-Keepers for generations

**Daily Operations:**
- Inspect and replace dimming lamps
- Respond to darkness emergencies
- Maintain quality control on harvested vials
- Public education about proper light usage

**Crisis:**
- As Luminara wakes, their job becomes impossible
- Lamps fail faster than they can replace
- Facing unemployment if harvesting ends
- Some radicalized into "Eternal Light" faction (believe more harvesting will solve problem)

**Key NPCs:**
- **Master Keeper Aldric**: Elderly human, built entire career on assumption bioluminescence is infinite
- **Journeyman Seela**: Young woman who's started noticing patterns in the light failures
- **The Eternal Light**: Radical cell planning to raid the Lumen Grotto for "light secrets"

### Surface Government (Merchant Council)

**Structure:**
- Seven seats, elected every 5 years
- Voting restricted to property owners and guild members
- Current composition: 3 Harvesters, 2 Light-Keeper Guild, 1 General Merchant, 1 Shipwright

**Council Members:**
- **Harbor Master Seraph Delmare**: General Merchant, swing vote on most issues
- **Kaito Brightwater**: Harvester representative
- **Torvin Blackmarket**: Harvester (corrupt, takes bribes)
- **Silla Greenglass**: Harvester (reasonable, open to reform)
- **Keeper Aldric**: Light-Keeper representative
- **Shipwright Hamond**: Represents maritime industry
- **Merchant-Princess Yara**: Luxury goods, least dependent on bioluminescence

**Current Crisis:**
- Council deadlocked on how to respond
- Some want aggressive harvesting before "resource depletes"
- Others want investigation and potential regulation
- Fear of economic collapse prevents decisive action
- Seraph acts as tie-breaker, increasingly overwhelmed

### The Voidcaller Movement

**Founder:** Captain Senna Voidcaller
**Members:** 30 core activists, 200+ sympathizers
**Founded:** 2 years ago after Senna witnessed trawling operation destroy bioluminescent reef

**Philosophy:**
- Luminara is provably conscious (to those willing to see)
- Harvesting is genocide against distributed organism
- Surface civilization built on exploitation must be torn down
- Short-term suffering acceptable for long-term justice

**Methods:**
- Sabotage harvester ships
- Free captured bioluminescent organisms
- Propaganda campaigns in Tideloch
- Planning increasingly extreme actions

**Internal Conflict:**
- Some members uncomfortable with violence
- Debate: Are surface civilians complicit or victims?
- Senna increasingly extreme as peaceful methods fail

**Endgame Plan** (Revealed mid-campaign):
- Poison the Shallows with "wake formula" (alchemical cocktail that forces organisms into synchronized frenzy)
- Force Luminara to wake rapidly and defend itself
- Accept that surface cities will fall into darkness
- Believe this is only way to save Luminara

## Luminara - Detailed Specifications

### Biological/Magical Nature

**What Luminara Is:**
- Primordial entity embodying "life in lightless places"
- Not a god (doesn't require worship) but divine-adjacent in power
- Consciousness distributed across all bioluminescent organisms in the Deep
- Estimated 100 trillion individual organisms = components of one mind

**Individual Organism Types:**
1. **Glowplankton**: Microscopic, 80% of total organism count
2. **Lightkelp**: Plant-like, photosynthesis reversed (consume darkness, produce light)
3. **Lumfish**: Small fish, schooling behavior creates living patterns
4. **Coralminds**: Sessile, coral-like, store long-term memories
5. **Deepjellies**: Jellyfish, largest individuals (10-foot diameter)
6. **Illuminators**: Squid-like, most "intelligent" individual organisms

**How Consciousness Works:**
- No individual organism is conscious alone
- Proximity creates consciousness (like neurons firing)
- Densest congregations = highest awareness
- The Abyss has highest density = Luminara's "self" strongest there
- The Wound killed so many organisms that a gap exists in consciousness

**Communication:**
- Bioluminescent pulses = thoughts
- Synchronized pulses = focused intention
- Patterns spell out concepts in light-language
- Direct communion: Individual organisms temporarily join with mortal nervous system

### Current State

**Awakening Process:**
- Luminara forgetting itself was like human amnesia
- Harvesting created pain
- Pain created focus
- Focus reminded scattered consciousness it WAS a consciousness
- Now remembering more each day

**Timeline:**
- 50 years ago: First dim awareness (something is wrong)
- 20 years ago: Recognition of pain as external, not natural
- 5 years ago: First attempts at communication (patterns)
- 1 year ago: Recovery of ancient memories (remembering the war)
- Campaign start: Actively trying to communicate, growing frustrated
- Without intervention: Full awakening in 6 months (potentially hostile)

**Personality (Emerging):**
- Confused (why does remembering hurt?)
- Lonely (where are the other primordials? Where are the Deep Singers? Why are tiny beings taking pieces of me?)
- Curious (what are these air-breathers? They're so individual, so separate—fascinating)
- Afraid (the Wound still aches. What if I can't heal? What if I die?)
- Loving (it created bioluminescence as gift. Creating is its nature)

**Wants:**
1. To heal the Wound (remove weapon, close necrotic field)
2. To understand what happened (recover all memories)
3. To be whole again (re-integrate consciousness fully)
4. To not be alone (companionship, communication)
5. To keep creating (if healed, wants to spread bioluminescence to all world's oceans)

**Fears:**
1. Dying incomplete (forgetting again before remembering everything)
2. The pain continuing forever
3. Being alone in a world where other primordials are gone
4. Becoming something monstrous through the Wound's corruption
5. Having to hurt the small beings to heal (recognizes harvesters as individuals even while they hurt it)

### The Wound - Detailed Mechanics

**Physical Nature:**
- Spear of Un-Light embedded at 5,500 feet depth
- Weapon is 30 feet long, made of crystallized divine anti-magic
- Constantly radiates necrotic energy in 1-mile radius
- Has killed approximately 10 trillion organisms over 10,000 years
- Creates permanent gap in Luminara's consciousness ("blind spot" in its awareness)

**Effects:**
- Any bioluminescent organism entering zone dies within 1 minute
- Water within zone is completely dark, no light can exist
- Magical healing doesn't function
- Living creatures take 2d6 necrotic damage per round
- Pressure is wrong (feels heavier than depth suggests)
- Sounds are deadened, muffled
- Time feels slower (subjective, not actual)

**The Weapon's Sentience:**
- Spear has fragment of its creator god's will
- Goal: Kill the primordial (it's failing, but slowly succeeding)
- Can communicate telepathically with those who touch it
- Whispers justifications: "Primordials are too powerful. They destroyed worlds. This is mercy. Let it end."
- Not entirely wrong (primordials ARE dangerous when awakened)
- Can tempt party to mercy-kill Luminara

**Removing the Weapon:**
- Requires ritual combining divine magic, Lumen communion, and Deep Singer song
- Must be pulled out gradually (over 8 hours) or Luminara hemorrhages and dies
- Someone must hold the spear during extraction (takes necrotic damage continuously)
- Once removed, wound begins healing but takes years to fully close
- Weapon will try to re-embed itself if not destroyed/sealed immediately

## Magic System Modifications

### Bioluminescence Magic

**Symbiotic Casting:**
Any character who accepts symbiosis with bioluminescent organisms gains:
- Permanent bioluminescence (can glow as bonus action, 20-foot radius bright light)
- Cast *light* at will, lasts 24 hours
- Advantage on saves vs fear while glowing
- Disadvantage on stealth (you glow)

**Light-Language Spells:**

**Cantrip: Lightspeak**
- Cause your bioluminescence to form simple patterns
- Creatures who know light-language can understand
- Range: 60 feet
- Can communicate basic concepts

**2nd Level: Pulse Message**
- Send a message to any bioluminescent organism within 1 mile
- Luminara receives it automatically
- Can be relayed through organism network (much like *sending*)

**4th Level: Luminara's Blessing**
- Touch water, cause all bioluminescent organisms within 30 feet to gather
- Creates bright light for 1 hour
- Organisms heal 2d8 HP to creatures who touch them
- Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**6th Level: Shared Consciousness**
- Link up to 6 willing creatures telepathically
- Duration: 1 hour
- Share thoughts, emotions, sensations
- Experience what Lumens feel constantly

**8th Level: Become the Deep**
- Transform into pure bioluminescent energy
- Become part of Luminara temporarily
- Gain access to its knowledge and perception
- Wisdom save DC 20 at end or remain as part of Luminara permanently
- If successful, return transformed (permanent glow, Lumen-like features)

### Depth Pressure Magic

**Environmental Spells:**
- *Water breathing* essential for non-Lumens
- *Freedom of movement* negates pressure penalties
- *Water walk* hilariously useless in underground ocean

**New Environmental Spell:**

**3rd Level: Pressure Adaptation**
- Casting Time: 1 action
- Duration: 8 hours
- Range: Touch
- Target can survive at any water depth without pressure damage
- Does not grant water breathing (separate need)

## Encounter Design

### Non-Combat Encounters

**1. The First Communion:**
- Lumen guide helps party put on Symbiot Masks
- Wisdom save DC 13 to maintain identity during first contact
- Success: Understand basic emotional content
- Failure: Overwhelmed, lost in Luminara's vastness for 1d4 hours
- Opportunity for roleplaying shared consciousness experience

**2. Deep Singer Interview:**
- Old Mother tests party's worthiness
- Must answer three questions about their relationship with nature
- Songs can cause emotional effects (DM choice based on answers)
- Success: Granted passage to Abyss
- Failure: Politely but firmly turned away

**3. Light-Language Lesson:**
- Lyss teaches party to interpret bioluminescent patterns
- Skill challenge: Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception)
- Learn basic vocabulary: danger, food, migration, question, pain, joy
- Failure doesn't prevent progress but makes later encounters harder

**4. Harvester Witnessing:**
- Party observes (or participates in) harvesting operation
- See organisms' distress through their light patterns
- Can intervene or let it continue (moral choice, affects Luminara's opinion)
- No "correct" answer—builds themes

### Combat Encounters

**Early Campaign (The Shallows):**

*Confused Lumfish School*
- Swarm statistics
- Bioluminescent flashing can blind (DC 13 Con save)
- Not hostile, just frightened by harvesters
- Can be calmed with Animal Handling or light-language

*Reef Shark Pack*
- Normal sharks, not bioluminescent
- Hunting lumfish
- Neutral to party unless threatened

**Mid Campaign (The Mid-Light and Abyss):**

*Illuminator Squid*
- Intelligent, curious
- Can cast *color spray* and *hypnotic pattern* through bioluminescence
- Wants to communicate, not fight
- If hostile: Ink cloud creates magical darkness

*Luminara's Immune Response*
- Treat as Animated Objects, but made of congealed bioluminescence
- Appears when Luminara feels threatened
- Trying to defend itself, doesn't recognize party as friendly
- Dissolve harmlessly when fight ends

**Late Campaign (The Wound):**

*Necrotic Remnants*
- Organisms killed by the Wound but animated by necrotic energy
- Shadows/Wraiths statistics
- Immune to radiant damage (light doesn't exist here)
- Whisper the weapon's justifications

*The Weapon's Guardian*
- If weapon is sentient and active, may create guardian
- Construct made of crystallized anti-light
- Drains magic (counterspell at-will)
- Vulnerable to physical damage (it's crystal)

### Skill Challenges

**Navigating the Abyss:**
- Survival checks to avoid getting lost in three-dimensional environment
- Perception to follow Deep Singers' guidance
- Wisdom saves to resist Luminara's overwhelming presence

**The Ritual of Extraction:**
- Arcana to perform divine magic component
- Performance for Deep Singers to maintain song
- Endurance (Constitution saves) for whoever holds the weapon
- Persuasion/communion to keep Luminara calm during agony

## Potential Campaign Variations

### Darker Version: The Justified Kill

What if the weapon is right? What if Luminara, when fully awake, will be uncontrollable?
- Introduce evidence of primordial destructiveness
- Make Luminara's awakening more aggressive, less sympathetic
- Present mercy-kill as genuinely merciful option
- Party must decide: risk awakening something dangerous, or end suffering permanently

### Lighter Version: The Joyful Awakening

What if there's a way to awaken Luminara that hurts no one?
- Remove most antagonism from Harvesters (ignorance, not malice)
- Focus on wonder and discovery
- Healing ritual has no sacrifice required
- Ending is pure celebration: Luminara and surface in harmony

### Political Version: The Three-Way Negotiation

Focus on mediation rather than adventure:
- More sessions in Tideloch, less in the Deep
- Deep dive into economics of light-dependence
- Party must craft acceptable compromise between Harvesters, Lumens, and Luminara
- Success measured in policy changes and treaties, not combat victories

### Horror Version: The Thing That Should Stay Asleep

What if Luminara WANTS to stay asleep?
- Awakening means facing the trauma of the Wound
- Fragmenting was escape from unbearable pain
- Party's actions are cruel, forcing consciousness on something choosing oblivion
- "Victory" might be helping it forget again, accepting exploitation as lesser evil
- Very dark, philosophical ending

## Resolution Details

### True Healing Outcome - Long-term Effects

**Immediate (Days):**
- Weapon removed, Luminara's pain diminishes
- Synchronized pulse visible from surface (celebration)
- Harvester ships called back, temporary moratorium on harvesting
- Whoever held the weapon during extraction permanently scarred (necrotic burns that glow faintly)

**Short-term (Months):**
- Luminara and Lumens establish "translation council" for surface communication
- New sustainable harvesting agreement: Only organisms that die naturally can be collected
- Light-Keepers retrained as "Symbiot Farmers" (cultivate bioluminescence with Luminara's consent)
- Economic disruption but manageable
- Party celebrated as heroes

**Long-term (Years):**
- Luminara's consciousness spreads to other oceans worldwide
- Global bioluminescence revolution (surface oceans begin glowing)
- Other sleeping primordials contacted through Luminara
- New age of cooperation between civilization and ancient beings
- Party remembered in legend
- Whoever merged with Luminara becomes living oracle, bridge between species

**Personal Costs:**
- Merged character is still themselves but never alone again
- Constantly feels Luminara's presence
- Can perceive through any bioluminescent organism
- Ages much slower (primordial influence)
- May eventually transcend mortality entirely

This creates hooks for future campaigns in the setting.
