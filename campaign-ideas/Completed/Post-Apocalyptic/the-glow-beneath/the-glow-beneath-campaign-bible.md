# The Glow Beneath [CAMPAIGN: Post-Apocalyptic]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
Centuries ago, a surface-level cataclysm rendered the world uninhabitable, forcing humanity to retreat into vast, pre-built subterranean shelters. Over generations, these shelters expanded into sprawling underground cities. But the deep earth held its own secrets: a vast, bioluminescent ecosystem, strange, adapted flora and fauna, and, most unsettlingly, the ruins of an ancient, alien civilization that radiates an ethereal "Glow." This Glow is both a source of power and a creeping threat, subtly altering the environment and the minds of those exposed to it. The players are explorers, guardians, or scavengers in this subterranean world, tasked with understanding, exploiting, or containing the mysteries of the Glow.

## Setting [SETTING: Subterranean World]
The world is a labyrinth of colossal caverns, winding tunnels, and subterranean rivers. The primary light source comes from bioluminescent fungi, crystalline formations, and strange, glowing flora, casting an otherworldly pallor over everything. Human settlements are carved into the rock, relying on geothermal energy and recycled air. Beyond the known territories lie the "Deep Glow" zones, where the alien influence is strongest, and reality itself seems to bend.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Citadel of Echoes:** [LOCATION: Underground City] The largest human settlement, built within a massive, naturally formed cavern. It's a marvel of engineering, with multi-tiered dwellings, hydroponic farms, and advanced air recycling systems. It serves as the central hub for human civilization.
*   **The Fungal Forests:** [LOCATION: Cavern] Vast caverns dominated by towering, bioluminescent fungi that form dense, glowing forests. These provide food, medicine, and building materials, but also hide dangerous, adapted creatures.
*   **The Crystal Veins:** [LOCATION: Mines] Deep mining tunnels where rare, glowing crystals are extracted. These crystals are a primary energy source and are subtly influenced by the Glow, sometimes exhibiting strange properties.
*   **The Sunken Archives:** [LOCATION: Ruin] The waterlogged ruins of a pre-Collapse data center, now partially submerged in a subterranean lake. It's a dangerous dive, but rumored to hold invaluable information about the surface world and the initial cataclysm.
*   **The Alien Nexus:** [LOCATION: Alien Ruin] The heart of the alien ruins, a colossal structure radiating the most intense "Glow." Its purpose is unknown, but it seems to be the source of the Glow's influence and power.

## Factions [FACTION: Survivalist]
*   **The Lumina Keepers:** [FACTION: Guardians] A dedicated order of scientists and mystics who study the Glow, seeking to understand its nature and harness its power safely. They believe it holds the key to humanity's future.
*   **The Deep Scavengers:** [FACTION: Explorers] Independent groups of daring explorers and prospectors who venture into the dangerous Deep Glow zones, seeking alien artifacts, rare crystals, and forgotten pre-Collapse tech.
*   **The Surface Zealots:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A radical faction within the Citadel of Echoes who believe the surface world is still habitable and that humanity must return, often sabotaging subterranean efforts to force the issue.
*   **The Glow-Touched:** [FACTION: Mutated] Individuals who have been profoundly altered by prolonged exposure to the Glow, gaining strange abilities but often losing their sanity or becoming subservient to the alien influence.
*   **The Chitinous Swarm:** [FACTION: Hostile Organism] A vast, insectoid species native to the deep earth, now agitated and empowered by the Glow, constantly threatening human settlements and mining operations.

## NPCs [NPC: Key]
*   **High Elder Theron:** [NPC: Leader] The venerable leader of the Citadel of Echoes, burdened by the responsibility of his people's survival and the growing threat of the Glow. (Male, 70s, wise, cautious)
*   **Dr. Aris Thorne:** [NPC: Scientist] A brilliant but increasingly erratic Lumina Keeper, obsessed with deciphering the alien language and understanding the Glow's true nature. (Female, 40s, intellectual, driven)
*   **Kael "Deep-Delver" Roric:** [NPC: Explorer] A legendary Deep Scavenger, known for his courage and his uncanny ability to navigate the most dangerous Glow zones. (Male, 30s, rugged, independent)
*   **Prophetess Lyra:** [NPC: Fanatic] The charismatic leader of the Surface Zealots, who preaches of a verdant surface world and condemns the subterranean existence as a prison. (Female, 20s, passionate, manipulative)
*   **The Silent Weaver:** [NPC: Glow-Touched] A mysterious Glow-Touched individual who communicates through intricate patterns of bioluminescent fungi, seemingly able to manipulate the Glow itself. (Androgynous, unknown age, enigmatic, powerful)
*   **Unit 9000:** [NPC: Construct] A pre-Collapse automated mining drone, partially corrupted by the Glow, that now wanders the Crystal Veins, sometimes aiding, sometimes hindering, those it encounters. (Robot, ancient, unpredictable)

## Quests [QUEST: Primary]
*   **The Fading Lights:** [QUEST: Resource Management] The bioluminescent fungi in a vital Fungal Forest are dying, threatening the Citadel's food supply. Players must find a way to revitalize them, perhaps by venturing into a Deep Glow zone for a rare nutrient.
