# The Fever of the World - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Climate Apocalypse With Consciousness** - Environmental disaster given face and will

**Colors**: Oppressive oranges/reds (heat), sickly yellows (drought), artificial blues (domes), dying greens (last nature)

**The Fever's Form**: Heat shimmer given shape, mirage of suffering planet, temperature distortions, visible rage

**Contrast**: Cool sanctuary domes vs. burning wasteland outside

## Music
- Fever Theme: Industrial sounds, heat distortion, planet's heartbeat irregular
- Sanctuary Music: Artificial calm, elevator muzak hiding horror outside
- Burning Lands: Harsh ambient, desperate survival sounds
- Memory Sequences: Historical music distorted by heat and time

## Voice Acting
- The Fever: Crackling heat, boiling water, forest fires, speaks in rising temperatures
- Dr. Celsius: Scientific precision crumbling into climate madness
- CEO Frost: Corporate smooth hiding monstrous indifference
- Salamander: Passionate revolutionary accepting apocalypse as justice
- Glacier's Ghost: Melting ice, drowning bubbles, lost cold speaking

**Tagline**: "Climate Change Achieved Consciousness—And It's Angry"

**Key Art**: Massive thermometer shattering, mercury spilling out and forming face of rage, burning cityscape below, cool dome in distance ignoring suffering
