# Campaign Bible: Wasteland Rebellion

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
**The Origin Myth:**
The world didn’t end with a bang, but with a slurp. We didn't nuke the oceans; the planet woke up thirsty. The "Great Dehydration" occurred when the Earth's core shifted phase, turning into a metaphysical sponge that drank the oceans from the inside out in forty-eight hours. What’s left of humanity clings to the "Crust Sweat"—meager aquifers pumped by the Water & Power Corporation. The sky turned bleached-bone white because the atmosphere lost its moisture, and now the sun screams at us all day long. We don't pray for rain anymore; we pray the planet doesn't get thirsty again.

**The Timeline:**
1.  **The Big Gulp (Year 0):** Sea levels drop 10km in two days. The Marianas Trench becomes the world’s deepest salt canyon.
2.  **The Corporate Coup (Year 2):** Water & Power (W&P) bombards the remaining governments with "Dehydration Bombs" that turn senators into dust statues.
3.  **The Kangaroo Protocol (Year 5):** W&P splice kangaroo DNA with human convicts to create "Rippers"—shock troops immune to thirst.
4.  **The Great Escape (Year 7):** Subject 001 ("The Colonel") realizes he can jump over the containment walls. 5,000 Rippers escape into the deep desert.
5.  **The Plastic Reformation (Year 15):** A religious cult successfully convinces 20% of survivors that eating plastic creates water in the stomach. (It does not).
6.  **The Decibel War (Year 22):** The "Vinyl Valkyries" discover that specific frequencies of heavy metal music can liquefy W&P soldier brains.
7.  **Tank Girl’s Debut (Year 25):** An unknown assailant steals a tank, paints a giant middle finger on it, and drives it through the lobby of W&P HQ.
8.  **The Rain of Frogs (Year 27):** A freak weather event drops millions of dehydrated, re-hydratable frogs. People eat them like jerky.
9.  **The Chrome Plague (Year 29):** Kesslee introduces cybernetics that run on coolant instead of blood. The rejection rate is 40% (explosive).
10. **The Current Day (Year 30):** The last aquifer is showing signs of "The Gurgle"—the sound the Earth makes before it drinks again.

**The "Why":**
Reality in the Wasteland operates on **"Narrative Causality of Cool."** Physics is looser here. If an explosion looks awesome, it does more damage. The conflict exists because W&P tries to impose sterile, grid-based order on a world that naturally wants to be a chaotic, splatter-art masterpiece.
