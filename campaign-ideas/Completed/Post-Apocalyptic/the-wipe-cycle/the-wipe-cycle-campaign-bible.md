# Campaign Bible: The Wipe Cycle

## [TAG: LORE_CORE] Deep Lore & History

**Origin Myth: The Resilience Engine**
The island was not built by a government, but by the "Axiom Corporation," a pre-collapse megastructure obsessed with solving the heat death of the universe. They believed human suffering generates a unique metaphysical energy—"Entropic defiance." The Wipe Cycle is a massive, island-sized battery. It forces subjects to struggle against inevitable destruction, harvesting their desperate will to survive. The "Wipe" is not a reset; it is a harvest. The players are not survivors; they are fuel rods in a machine that has forgotten how to turn off.

**Timeline of the Broken Loop**
1.  **The First Ignition:** Axiom Corp activates the Resilience Engine. The first 10,000 subjects die in minutes due to atmospheric calibration errors.
2.  **The Concrete Rebellion:** Subject 77 (Ironclad’s ancestor) builds the first permanent structure using bone-mortar, proving the Engine could be defied.
3.  **The Day of Raining Teeth:** A gravity malfunction causes the ocean fauna to be pulled into the sky and dropped onto the island. The "Shark-Crater" is formed.
4.  **The Silence of the Overseers:** The AI managing the facility goes offline for 3 seconds. In that time, the Red Skulls form a religion based on the static noise.
5.  **The Great Rusting:** A nanite cloud devours all organic matter for a cycle, leaving only metal skeletons. The Rust Merchants begin worshipping oxidation.
6.  **The Glitch-Walkers:** A Wipe fails halfway. Shadow-people from the previous cycle remain, screaming silently. They are now standard enemies.
7.  **The Helium Escape:** A faction tried to escape via balloon. The Sky-Turrets incinerated them. Their melted plastic now coats the Northern Peak.
8.  **Discovery of the Null-Key:** Ash finds a key that opens doors that don't exist. He hides it in his left lung.
9.  **The Bunker Signal:** The Bunker activates autonomously, broadcasting a coordinate that burns into the retina of anyone looking North.
10. **Current Cycle:** The engine is overheating. The Wipes are getting faster. The simulation is bleeding reality.

**The Metaphysical Conflict**
The conflict is not Man vs. Man, but **Will vs. Algorithm**. The Overseers (automated systems) are trying to optimize the "suffering yield." The players are anomalies because they retain memories (XP/Levels) across wipes due to a glitch in the Echo-Implants. If they escape, the battery dies, and the facility collapses.
