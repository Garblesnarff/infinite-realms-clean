## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Wheel of Dharma
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Hindu Mythology Epic / Cosmic Balance / Dharmic Quest
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16–22 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **16–18**
**Tone (keywords):** epic mythology, cosmic cycles, dharma vs adharma, divine avatars, karmic balance, duty over desire, cyclical time
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The balance between dharma (cosmic order) and adharma (chaos) tips toward darkness as a demon-king secures divine boons making him nearly invincible, threatening to end the current cosmic age in destruction rather than natural transformation. The party, revealed to be avatars or blessed heroes from past cycles, must journey across mystical India encountering gods, demons, and legendary heroes while fulfilling their dharma and understanding their karmic debts across lifetimes. They'll witness or participate in events echoing the great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, discovering that maintaining cosmic balance sometimes requires tragic choices where duty conflicts with desire, and that the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth serves purposes beyond mortal understanding.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–22 sessions)

A five-act epic following dharmic duty across cosmic scales.

*   **Act I — The Demon's Boon (Sessions 1–4):** A demon-king performs terrible austerities earning Brahma's boon of near-invincibility. He begins conquering the three worlds—earth, heaven, and underworld. The party discovers they're connected to past heroes through karma and must prevent dharma's collapse.
*   **Act II — The Avatar's Path (Sessions 5–9):** They seek guidance from Vishnu's avatars—meeting Krishna, encountering sites from Rama's exile, learning from past heroes. They gather divine weapons and allies while fulfilling dharmic duties that prepare them for the conflict.
*   **Act III — The Mahabharata's Echo (Sessions 10-14):** Events mirror the great war—family against family, dharma versus adharma in complex grays, warriors bound by duty to fight those they love. They face moral dilemmas where all choices carry sin, where righteousness requires terrible sacrifice.
*   **Act IV — The Demon War (Sessions 15–18):** They lead armies of gods, humans, and allied demons against the demon-king's forces. Epic battles rage across the three worlds. They must find the loophole in his invincibility boon while maintaining dharma even in war.
*   **Act V — The Cosmic Cycle (Sessions 19–22):** They confront the demon-king and restore balance, but discover the current age (Kali Yuga) must still decline before renewal. They determine their role in the next cycle—rebirth, moksha (liberation), or continued service as eternal guardians. Their karma across all lifetimes is finally balanced or transcended.

## Central Conflict

Dharma versus adharma, but neither is simple good or evil. The demon-king earned his power through legitimate austerities—gods must honor their promises even when consequences are terrible. Maintaining dharma sometimes requires actions that seem evil—killing enemies, accepting suffering, choosing duty over love. The party must understand that cosmic order transcends individual desire, that karma ensures justice across lifetimes, and that the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction serves necessary purpose. They determine whether dharma is rigid law or flexible wisdom, and whether they seek moksha (liberation from the cycle) or continued participation in cosmic maintenance.
