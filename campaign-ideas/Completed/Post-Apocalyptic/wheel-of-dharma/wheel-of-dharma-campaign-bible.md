## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth
In the beginning, there was only the sound of *Om*, vibrating in the void. Vishnu slept upon the coils of the serpent Ananta, dreaming the universe into existence. However, in this current Kalpa (cosmic cycle), a singular anomaly occurred: during Brahma’s exhale of creation, a drop of amrita (nectar of immortality) fell not into the mouths of gods or demons, but into the gears of Time itself. This created a "Karmic Glitch"—a vibration that allows certain beings to retain memories across samsara (rebirth), threatening the dissolution of the illusion (Maya) that holds reality together. The universe is not just declining; it is becoming lucid, and if the Dreamer wakes too soon, existence evaporates.

### Timeline of the Current Yuga
1.  **The Celestial Fracture:** Indra, King of Devas, strikes a mountain with his Vajra, accidentally revealing a vein of "Solidified Time."
2.  **The Rishi’s Silence:** The Seven Sages abruptly stop speaking for 100 years to prevent a prophecy from leaking out of their mouths.
3.  **Birth of the Demon-King Mahabali:** Born with the mark of the Glitch, he remembers every previous death he suffered in past cycles.
4.  **The Rain of Fish:** *[Surreal]* Over the city of Ayodhya, it rains silver fish for three days; the fish whisper the secrets of the citizens before dying.
5.  **The Penance of the One-Legged Crane:** Mahabali stands on one toe for a millennium; his heat (tapas) begins to boil the oceans of the Underworld.
6.  **Brahma’s Boon:** Bound by cosmic law, Brahma grants Mahabali the boon: "No being born of a womb may kill you."
7.  **The Theft of the Moon’s Reflection:** *[Surreal]* The Asuras steal the reflection of the moon from Lake Manasarovar, plunging the night into absolute darkness, though the physical moon remains in the sky.
8.  **The Conquest of Svarga:** Mahabali marches on Heaven; the gods flee, hiding in the disguise of clouds.
9.  **The Weeping of the Idols:** *[Surreal]* Every stone idol in the subcontinent sheds real human tears, flooding the temple sanctums with salt water.
10. **The Awakening of the Avatars:** The Karmic Glitch resonates, waking the dormant divine essence within the player characters.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The conflict is not Good vs. Evil, but **Stasis vs. Acceleration**. The Devas want to maintain the slow, orderly decline of the Kali Yuga. The Demon-King, traumatized by the memory of infinite deaths, wants to break the Wheel entirely—forcing a "Hard Reset" of the universe by conquering the Three Worlds and rewriting the laws of Karma so that nothing ever dies again, leading to a stagnant, cancerous immortality for all.
