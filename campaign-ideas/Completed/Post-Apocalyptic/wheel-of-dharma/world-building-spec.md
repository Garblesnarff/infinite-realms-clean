### **World-Building Specification Brief: Wheel of Dharma**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When a demon-king's divine boon grants him near-invincibility, threatening to overthrow cosmic order during the declining Kali Yuga, the party—revealed through karmic visions to be connected to legendary heroes across past lives—must journey across the three worlds fulfilling their dharma, gathering divine weapons, and restoring balance by finding the loophole in invincibility while accepting that duty sometimes demands choices that transcend simple morality.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Hindu cosmology—the three worlds (earth, heaven, underworld), Mount Meru, cosmic cycles
    *   Explain the Trimurti—Brahma (creator), Vishnu (preserver), Shiva (destroyer)—and their roles
    *   Describe Vishnu's avatars (Rama, Krishna, etc.) and why gods take mortal form
    *   Write about dharma and adharma—cosmic order versus chaos, righteous duty
    *   Detail karma and samsara—the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth until moksha is achieved
    *   Explain the four Yugas—ages declining from golden to iron, and how they cycle
    *   Describe the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics and their dharmic lessons
    *   Detail how demons (asuras) aren't purely evil but opposed to gods (devas) in cosmic balance
    *   Explain divine boons earned through tapas (austerities) and why gods must honor them
    *   Describe sacred weapons (astras) requiring mantras and authority to wield

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **The Devas** (Major) - Gods led by Indra, goal: maintain cosmic order and dharma
    *   **The Asuras** (Major) - Demons led by the Demon-King, goal: overthrow divine order for their rule
    *   **Vishnu's Avatars** (Major) - Divine manifestations, goal: restore balance when dharma fails
    *   **The Enlightened Ones** (Minor) - Rishis and sages, goal: guide seekers toward moksha
    *   **Mortal Kingdoms** (Minor) - Human rulers and warriors, goal: fulfill dharmic duties in governance
    *   **The Nagas** (Minor) - Serpent beings of underworld, goal: maintain their realm's sovereignty
    *   **Shiva's Ascetics** (Minor) - Devotees of destruction/transformation, goal: understand cosmic cycles
    *   **Kali's Warriors** (Minor) - Servants of the goddess, goal: destroy adharmic forces
    *   **The Dharma Guardians** (Major) - Party and allies, goal: restore cosmic balance

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Vishnu/Krishna, Shiva, Brahma, The Demon-King, Hanuman, Durga/Kali, Indra

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Mystical India** - Diverse terrestrial realm from Himalayas to coasts, sacred sites everywhere
*   **Mount Meru** - Cosmic axis at universe's center, connecting all worlds
*   **Svarga (Heaven)** - Paradise realm ruled by Indra where gods dwell and heroes feast
*   **Patala (Underworld)** - Multi-layered realm below earth, home to nagas and some asuras
*   **Kurukshetra** - Legendary battlefield where dharma and adharma clashed in great war
*   **Ayodhya** - Ideal dharmic kingdom, Rama's capital representing righteous rule
*   **The Ganges** - Sacred river flowing from heaven through earth, grants purification
*   **The Burning Grounds** - Where Shiva dances cosmic destruction, transformation through fire
*   Each location represents different aspects of Hindu cosmology and dharmic principles

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the Demon-King's boon isn't countered THEN he overthrows the gods and ends the age early
*   IF dharma is maintained in all choices THEN cosmic balance strengthens and aids manifest
*   IF adharma is chosen for expedience THEN karma accumulates causing future suffering
*   IF divine weapons are wielded properly THEN they grant overwhelming power
*   IF astras are misused THEN terrible consequences and curses follow
*   IF the party discovers past-life connections THEN they unlock karmic powers and debts
*   IF they serve as avatars THEN divine essence grants power but demands dharmic perfection
*   IF meditation and austerities are performed THEN divine boons can be earned
*   IF promises to gods or demons are broken THEN cosmic law turns against them
*   IF family duty conflicts with righteousness THEN Mahabharata-like tragedy may result
*   IF they fight the demon-king directly THEN his invincibility boon makes him unbeatable
*   IF they find the loophole in his boon THEN victory becomes possible through cleverness
*   IF moksha is chosen THEN they escape the cycle of rebirth into eternal peace
*   IF continued service is chosen THEN they return in future cycles as guardians
*   IF cosmic balance is restored THEN the Yuga continues its natural decline toward renewal
