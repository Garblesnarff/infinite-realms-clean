**The Forest Giant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Deep in the ancient redwood forests, logging operations have stirred something massive and elusive—witnesses report encounters with an enormous, ape-like creature standing over ten feet tall. Known as the Forest Giant, the creature has been leaving territorial warnings and destroying logging equipment, but has not harmed any humans. The players must track the creature, determine if it's truly the legendary Bigfoot, uncover what it's protecting, and broker peace between the loggers, environmentalists, and the creature itself.
