# The Drowning World
*The waters rise. The land vanishes. Nowhere left but up.*

## Campaign Overview

It started with coastal flooding, unseasonable high tides, strange currents. Within a month, sea levels had risen twenty feet. Now, three months into the crisis, the ocean has risen 200 feet and continues climbing 10 feet per week. Coastal cities are submerged. Island nations vanished. Rivers flow backward as the ocean invades inland. Millions are fleeing to higher ground, but there's only so much mountain left.

The cause: The Leviathan Throne, an ancient prison deep in the ocean trench, has been damaged. The Tidal Sovereign—a primordial water entity imprisoned for eons—is escaping. With each movement, its power raises global sea levels. If it breaks completely free, it will flood the entire world, transforming the planet into an endless ocean. The party has 80 days before the highest mountains go underwater.

They must navigate a drowning world, rescue refugees from sinking cities, explore newly-submerged ruins, dive to impossible ocean depths, discover the truth about the Tidal Sovereign, and find a way to stop the flood before there's no land left at all.

## Core Themes

- **Rising Waters**: Constant threat of drowning, losing ground
- **Reversed World**: Cities becoming underwater ruins, ocean the new surface
- **Limited Space**: Mountains crowded, territory shrinking
- **Aquatic Adaptation**: Those who adapt survive, others drown
- **Lost Civilization**: Everything humanity built now underwater
- **Water as Unstoppable**: Can't fight ocean, can only flee or adapt

## Session Breakdown (28-36 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Coastal Collapse (Sessions 1-7)
**Sessions 1-2**: Campaign opens in coastal city of Wavecrest during "minor" flooding. Suddenly massive surge—tsunami-like wave. City flooding rapidly. Buildings become islands. Party must rescue trapped civilians, navigate rising water. Introduction to drowning hazards, swimming mechanics.

**Sessions 3-4**: Evacuation by boat as city sinks behind them. Thousands on overcrowded vessels. Storm hits, boats capsizing. Rescue operations in rough seas. Reach mainland, find it's flooding too. Rivers overflowing, lowlands becoming lakes.

**Sessions 5-7**: Journey inland with refugee column. Walking through knee-deep, then waist-deep water. Reach mountain city of Highpeak—supposedly safe elevation. Already overcrowded. Introduction to Dr. Marina Deepwater (oceanographer) who explains: Waters rising globally, won't stop. Ancient magic detected from deep ocean.

### Arc 2: The Sinking World (Sessions 8-16)
**Sessions 8-10**: Highpeak swelling to 5 million (originally 100,000). Resources critical. Party recruited to explore submerged cities for supplies. Diving missions into recently drowned towns—eerie, supplies underwater. Encounter drowned undead, aggressive sea creatures.

**Sessions 11-13**: Dr. Deepwater's research reveals pattern: Source is Leviathan Throne deep in ocean trench. Ancient prison failing. Party must journey to newly-submerged wizard's tower for ancient texts. Underwater dungeon exploration, water breathing magic required.

**Sessions 14-16**: Waters reach Highpeak (rose 300 feet total). Mass panic, nowhere left to run. Cult of the Tidal Sovereign emerges, worshipping flood as divine. Led by Prophet Wavecaller. Believes flood will create "pure water world." Sabotaging evacuation efforts, sinking relief ships.

### Arc 3: Beneath the Waves (Sessions 17-25)
**Sessions 17-19**: To save world, must journey to Leviathan Throne in deepest ocean. Acquire submarine (magical or mechanical), assemble crew. Descend through ocean zones: Sunlight → Twilight → Midnight → Abyssal → Hadal. Each deeper zone more dangerous, alien creatures.

**Sessions 20-22**: Discover sunken ancient civilizations, perfectly preserved underwater. Entire cultures lost millennia ago. Find texts explaining: Tidal Sovereign was imprisoned because it wanted to drown previous world. Nearly succeeded. Learn prison mechanics, possible solutions.

**Sessions 23-25**: Reach Leviathan Throne—massive structure in ocean trench, 7 miles deep. Prison cracked (earthquake or sabotage?). See Tidal Sovereign partially emerged—incomprehensibly vast water elemental. Each movement displaces billions of gallons. Must enter prison to repair it or confront entity.

### Arc 4: The Endless Ocean (Sessions 26-36)
**Sessions 26-28**: Return to surface to find only mountain peaks remain above water. Highpeak now island. 100 million people crowded onto shrinking landmasses. Social collapse, violence over space. Cult attempting to sink mountains, military attempting to control peaks. Party caught in conflict.

**Sessions 29-31**: Prepare for final mission. Multiple options proposed: 1) Repair prison (requires powerful magic, sacrifices), 2) Kill Tidal Sovereign (nearly impossible, might make flooding worse), 3) Negotiate (alien entity, hard to communicate), 4) Adapt (accept oceanic world, save who you can). Gather resources, allies, make choice.

**Sessions 32-34**: Final descent to Leviathan Throne during absolute chaos. Waters rising hourly now. Fighting through cult, military, water elementals. Environmental hazards extreme. Reach Sovereign's chamber—direct confrontation with primordial water.

**Sessions 35-36**: Resolution based on party's choice. Multiple endings possible. If successful: Waters recede slowly, world saved but changed. If failed: Total oceanic world, scattered island survivors. Epilogue: Rebuilding or adapting to new aquatic reality.

## Key NPCs

**Dr. Marina Deepwater** (Triton Oceanographer) - Expert on ocean magic, party's guide, lost family to flood
**Admiral Stormwind** (Human Naval Commander) - Organizes evacuations by sea, pragmatic leader
**Prophet Wavecaller** (Water Genasi Cleric) - Cult leader, believes flood is divine will, in contact with Sovereign
**General Highlands** (Dwarf Commander) - Controls mountain access, authoritarian, hoarding space
**The Tidal Sovereign** (Primordial Water Entity) - Not evil, represents ocean's power, incomprehensible scale
**King Pelagius** (Merfolk Ruler) - Ocean natives, divided on whether to help surface dwellers
**Captain Mercy** (Human Sailor) - Rescue ship captain, saves countless lives, heroic figure

## Major Locations

**Wavecrest** (Drowned City) - First underwater location, exploration site, eerie and beautiful
**Highpeak** (Last Mountain) - Refugee haven, eventually flooded, represents futile safety
**The Sunken Kingdoms** (Ancient Ruins) - Previous civilizations drowned by earlier floods, lore source
**Leviathan Throne** (Deep Ocean Prison) - 7 miles deep, alien environment, final dungeon
**The Abyssal Zone** (Deep Ocean) - Nightmare creatures, crushing pressure, darkness absolute
**The Peaks** (Final Landmasses) - Overcrowded mountain tops, last refuge, shrinking daily

## Unique Mechanics

**Water Level Tracking**: Rises 10 feet/week, eventually everything underwater
**Swimming/Drowning**: Constitution saves, exhaustion, water breathing spells critical
**Pressure Damage**: Deeper water = crushing pressure without protection
**Underwater Combat**: Different mechanics, movement restricted
**Submarine Travel**: Vehicle-based exploration of deep ocean
**Resource Scarcity**: Crowded mountains, food running out, violence
**Adaptation Choice**: Accept aquatic life vs. fight for land

## Plot Twists

- **The Prison Was Sabotaged** by cult who found it decades ago
- **The Tidal Sovereign** was imprisoned unjustly, previous civilizations were wrong
- **Merfolk Divided**: Some want surface dwellers to drown, others help
- **The Flood Reveals** ancient magical artifacts underwater, power struggles
- **Dr. Deepwater's Secret**: Her research accidentally weakened prison
- **The True Solution**: Work with Sovereign to create balanced water world

## Victory Conditions

**Optimal Victory**: Negotiate with Sovereign, create new balance, partial flood permanent but manageable
**Heroic Victory**: Repair prison, Sovereign contained, waters recede slowly
**Adaptive Victory**: Accept oceanic world, create floating/underwater cities, new civilization
**Sacrifice Victory**: Party member becomes eternal warden of prison, waters controlled forever

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: Complete oceanic world, all land underwater, scattered survivors
**Partial Defeat**: Only highest mountains remain, billions dead
**Cult Victory**: Sovereign freed completely, eternal ocean
**Military Defeat**: Authoritarian control of remaining land, tyranny
