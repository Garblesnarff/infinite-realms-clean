# The Drowning World - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Waterworld meets The Poseidon Adventure** - Emphasis on rising water, submerged cities, desperate evacuations. Aesthetic of beautiful terror: Clear blue water covering everything. Underwater ruins bathed in filtered sunlight. Deep ocean darkness and alien creatures.

## Color Palettes
- **Surface World**: Blues and greens, water everywhere, sky reflecting in floods
- **Underwater Ruins**: Filtered sunlight, aqua blue, ghost-city grey
- **Deep Ocean**: Darkness, bioluminescent blues/greens, abyssal black
- **The Throne**: Ancient architecture, coral growth, primordial water colors
- **The Peaks**: Desperate brown/grey, overcrowded, nowhere left

## Music and Sound Design
**Main Theme**: "The Waters Rise" - Starts calm like ocean, builds to overwhelming waves, features water sounds as instruments. **Location Themes**: Wavecrest (mournful underwater echoes), The Descent (pressure increasing, darkness), Leviathan Throne (primordial power, deep whale songs). **Voice Direction**: Dr. Deepwater (scientific urgency, grief), Prophet Wavecaller (serene fanatic), Tidal Sovereign (ocean speaking, waves as language).

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 2**: Wide shot of city sinking, water pouring through streets, buildings becoming islands
- **Session 19**: Submarine descending through ocean zones, light fading to total darkness
- **Session 25**: First view of Tidal Sovereign—entity so vast it IS the ocean
- **Session 36**: Waters receding time-lapse or final shot of oceanic world with floating cities
