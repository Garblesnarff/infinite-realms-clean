**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** scrappy underdogs, found family, frontier justice, corporate oppression, secrets and trauma, folk hero outlaws
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is the crew of the Serenity—a small transport ship operating on the edge of civilized space. They take odd jobs (legal and illegal) to keep flying, but when they rescue a traumatized girl with psychic powers, they become targets of the Alliance—a totalitarian government that will kill anyone to keep her secrets buried. As Independents who lost the Unification War, they must navigate Alliance tyranny, corporate greed, and their own fractured pasts while protecting their found family.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is dangerous but avoidable through planning, negotiation, or creative escapes. Ship-to-ship combat is rare but deadly.
*   **Investigation:** Heavy emphasis on reading people, gathering intelligence, and understanding political machinations.
*   **Consequences:** Reputation matters. Every job affects how the 'Verse sees you—folk heroes or dangerous criminals.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc about found family versus the Alliance.

*   **Act I — The Crew Forms (Sessions 1–3):** The party is hired as crew on the Serenity, a Firefly-class transport ship. They take jobs (smuggling, transport, heists) while learning to trust each other. They rescue River, a traumatized girl fleeing the Alliance.
*   **Act II — Running from the Alliance (Sessions 4–7):** The Alliance sends operatives to retrieve River, who was experimented on in a secret facility. The crew learns she's a psychic weapon. They must stay ahead of Alliance agents while uncovering what was done to her.
*   **Act III — The Miranda Secret (Sessions 8–11):** River's fragmented mind holds the coordinates to Miranda—a planet the Alliance claims was lost. The crew discovers Miranda was a failed social experiment where an entire population died or became savage Reavers. The Alliance will kill to keep this secret.
*   **Act IV — Broadcasting the Truth (Sessions 12–15):** The party must broadcast the Miranda recording across the 'Verse, exposing the Alliance's atrocity. This makes them heroes to Independents and most-wanted criminals to the Alliance. They face the Operative, a zealot who believes in Alliance perfection, in a final confrontation.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Planet: The crew lands on Miranda—a terraformed world that's completely silent. No people, no ships, nothing.
    *   The Bodies: Millions of corpses lie where they fell—they simply stopped living. The terraforming chemical G-32 Paxilon Hydrochlorate (the Pax) made them so calm they stopped eating, moving, breathing.
    *   The Reavers: 0.1% of the population had the opposite reaction—hyper-aggression. They became the Reavers. The Alliance created the nightmare of the black.

### Session 10 — "No Power in the 'Verse"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Choice: The crew debates—broadcast the recording and become legends, or hide and survive? They vote. Democracy wins.
    *   The Plan: To broadcast, they need to reach the main hub on Osiris—the most heavily defended planet in the Alliance core.

    *   The Victory: The signal transmits. Everyone in the Alliance worlds now knows what was done on Miranda.

**Escalation:** The Operative watches the broadcast. He realizes he's been serving a lie. He withdraws, but warns—"They'll never stop hunting you."

    *   The Alliance: Despite the scandal, the Alliance remains in power—weakened but not broken. They still hunt the crew.

### Session 14 — "Keep Flying"

*   **Focus:** New Mission / Old Enemies

    *   The Job: The crew takes a job that seems simple—transport supplies to a colony world—but it's a trap by remnants of Niska's organization.
    *   The Ambush: The crew must fight their way out, proving they're still the same scrappy survivors.
    *   The Decision: Do they keep running, or do they embrace their role as symbols of resistance?

**Escalation:** River's psychic abilities are stabilizing. She's becoming a protector rather than a burden—a warrior when the crew needs one.

### Session 15 — "You Can't Take the Sky From Me"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / New Beginning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Choice: The crew decides their future—keep smuggling as outlaws, become leaders of a resistance, or find a place to settle and stop running.
    *   The Moment: The Serenity flies into the black as the crew shares a meal together—found family stronger than blood.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Serenity:** Firefly-class transport ship—cramped, worn, home. Cargo bay, common area, engine room, crew quarters, hidden smuggling compartments.
2.  **The Black:** Empty space between worlds—beautiful, isolating, dangerous. Where Reavers hunt.
3.  **Miranda:** Dead planet in Reaver space. Millions of corpses, the truth of the Alliance's greatest failure.
4.  **Osiris:** Core world, wealthy and civilized, site of the broadcast tower and Alliance military headquarters.
5.  **The Rim Worlds:** Frontier planets—dusty, lawless, full of independent settlers and those who lost the war.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **freedom versus control**. The Alliance offers stability through tyranny. Independents want freedom but live in poverty and chaos. The crew represents those who refuse to bow, who choose the hard freedom of the black over the comfortable cage of Alliance rule. It's about found family proving stronger than blood, and ordinary people doing extraordinary things because no one else will.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Reputation System**

*   Actions affect reputation on Core worlds (Alliance) and Rim worlds (Independents).
*   **Folk Heroes:** High Rim reputation grants discounts, shelter, and local support. High Core reputation brings law enforcement.

### 2. **The Ship is Home**

*   The Serenity has a damage tracker. Repairs cost money and time.
*   **Crew Morale:** Shared meals, downtime scenes, and personal conversations grant bonuses to rolls.

### 3. **Jobs and Credits**

*   The crew must take jobs to afford fuel, food, and repairs.
*   **Moral Choices:** Higher-paying jobs are often morally questionable. Principled choices cost credits.

### 4. **Space Combat**

*   Ship-to-ship combat uses simplified tactical rules—piloting, weapons, engineering, and comms all matter.
*   **Boarding Actions:** Close-quarters combat inside ships or stations.

### 5. **River's Psychic Triggers**

*   River can be triggered by certain stimuli (subliminal messages, key phrases) to become a combat savant.
*   **Unstable:** When triggered, she fights with deadly precision but may hurt allies.
