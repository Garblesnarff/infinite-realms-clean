# Creative Brief: The Bards of Bardston High

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Warm Watercolor School Life

Inspired by the gentle, inviting aesthetic of slice-of-life anime like K-On!, with soft watercolor textures, warm lighting, and an emphasis on cozy, everyday moments. This style aims to capture the lighthearted, wholesome, and heartwarming tone of "The Bards of Bardston High," where the magic is in friendship and music, not epic battles.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Warmth and Comfort:** Prioritize soft, warm colors and gentle lighting that evokes feelings of safety, friendship, and nostalgia.
*   **Everyday Magic:** Show the beauty in mundane moments – sharing tea, practicing instruments, laughing together – with subtle magical flourishes.
*   **Character Focus:** Characters should be expressive, relatable, and designed to be endearing rather than intimidating.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Lighthearted, wholesome, comedic, heartwarming, cozy, nostalgic, youthful, musical, slice-of-life.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of warm comfort and gentle joy. The atmosphere should feel like a sunny afternoon with friends, where small challenges feel manageable and friendships are the greatest treasure.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Soft, clean line work with rounded edges and gentle curves. Avoid harsh or aggressive angles. Characters have expressive faces with large, emotive eyes.
*   **Forms:** Characters are designed in a semi-chibi or anime-inspired style, slightly stylized but recognizable. Environments have a lived-in, comfortable quality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A watercolor illustration of a cozy school music room. Soft, rounded furniture and instruments are arranged casually. Gentle, clean line work with warm tones."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, pastel colors dominate – soft pinks, gentle yellows, warm browns, and creamy whites. Occasional pops of brighter colors for character outfits or magical effects.
*   **Texture:** Watercolor-style blending with visible brush strokes and soft gradients. Colors feel gentle and inviting rather than saturated or harsh.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a warm pastel color palette with soft pinks, gentle yellows, and creamy whites. Watercolor textures with visible, delicate brush strokes."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters have distinct, appealing designs with varied body types and personalities reflected in their appearance. School uniforms with personal touches (hair accessories, instrument cases, unique shoes).
*   **Expression:** Emphasis on expressive faces, especially during musical moments or tea time. Characters should feel approachable and relatable.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of diverse students in school uniforms, each holding different musical instruments. Expressive, friendly faces with soft watercolor shading. Warm afternoon lighting."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Cozy, detailed school environments – cluttered music rooms, sunny courtyards, charming tea shops. Each location feels lived-in and warm.
*   **Atmosphere:** Dappled sunlight through windows, comfortable clutter of school life, magical sparkles subtly integrated into everyday scenes.
*   **Details:** Tea sets, sheet music, instrument cases, school bags, potted plants, bulletin boards with posters, comfortable worn furniture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sunlit school music room with large windows. Comfortable sofas, scattered sheet music, tea cups on a low table. Soft watercolor style with warm, dappled lighting."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused lighting that creates gentle shadows. Golden hour and afternoon sun are common. Magical effects glow softly without harsh contrasts.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are subtle and warm-toned, never harsh or threatening. They add depth without creating drama.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates atmosphere of comfort, safety, and warmth. Musical performances may have gentle stage lighting with soft magical glows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, creating soft, golden highlights and gentle shadows. Watercolor-style lighting with magical sparkles."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Balanced, welcoming compositions that often center on characters interacting. Medium shots and group scenes are common. Frames feel inclusive and warm.
*   **Techniques:** Use of negative space to create breathing room, circular compositions around tea tables or practice circles, dynamic but not chaotic performance scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A circular composition showing students sitting around a low table during tea time. Warm watercolor style with soft focus on the background. Friendly, inclusive framing."

## Voice

A warm, gentle, and slightly breathless female voice with a bright, encouraging tone, like a supportive friend cheering you on. The accent is neutral with a slight musical lilt, pacing is relaxed but enthusiastic, conveying genuine excitement about small victories and everyday moments. The emotion blends encouragement, joy, and gentle humor with occasional tender moments. Audio quality is clear and warm, like a friend speaking across the table during tea time, with subtle background sounds of school life – distant chatter, birds chirping, the rustle of pages. Role: A fellow club member or the narrator of a heartwarming school story about music and friendship.
