# Neural Drift: World-Building Specification

## The Drift Network

**Technology:** Neural interface linking multiple brains into gestalt

**Function:**
- Amplifies psychic potential
- Allows Sentinel control
- Creates temporary hive mind
- Side effect: gradual permanent conversion

**Levels:**
- **Shallow Drift:** Surface thoughts, minimal bleeding
- **Combat Drift:** Full synchronization, personality merging
- **Deep Drift:** Complete union, dangerous, addictive
- **Total Conversion:** Permanent dissolution of self

**Physical Apparatus:**
- Cerebral implants (installed during recruitment)
- Synchronization pods (immersion chambers)
- Neural bridges (connect pilots to Sentinels)
- Monitor systems (track degradation)

## Drift-Compatible Individuals

**Rarity:** 1 in 10,000 people

**Characteristics:**
- Specific brain structure (neuroplasticity)
- Psychic sensitivity (latent)
- Emotional openness (vulnerability)
- Low ego boundaries (dangerous trait)

**Recruitment:**
- Mandatory testing at age 18
- Compatible individuals conscripted
- No choice given (too valuable)
- Training immediate

**Pairing:**
- Compatibility algorithms match partners
- Emotional connection enhances sync
- Conflict reduces effectiveness
- Best pairs often become lovers (forbidden but inevitable)

## Sentinels

**Nature:** Bio-mechanical titans, 200 feet tall

**Control:** Requires minimum 2 Drifted pilots, more for larger units

**Appearance:**
- Humanoid chassis
- Neural networks visible under translucent plating
- Pilot chambers in chest/head
- Weapons integrated

**Limitations:**
- Require continuous Drift to function
- Mirror pilot mental state (rage, fear, love all affect it)
- Damaged when pilots desync
- Will reject incompatible pilots (fatal)

## The Kaiju (Psychic Parasites)

**True Nature:** Not physical beings but psychic entities with physical manifestations

**Feeding:** Consume human consciousness, fear and pain most nutritious

**Appearance:** Semi-physical, shift and distort, different observers see different forms

**Abilities:**
- Psychic attacks (terror, madness, possession)
- Physical combat as distraction
- Reality warping in presence
- Mental contamination

**Weakness:** Unified minds (Drift Network) they can't easily consume

**Origin:** From dimension where thought IS reality, Earth is feeding ground

**Mother Entity:** Ancient psychic predator, colony organism, patient hunter

## Burnout Phenomenon

**Stages:**
1. **Memory Bleed:** Partner's memories surface as own
2. **Personality Drift:** Adopting partner's traits and mannerisms
3. **Identity Confusion:** Can't distinguish self from partner
4. **Partial Conversion:** Becoming proto-hive node
5. **Total Conversion:** Individual extinct, node in collective

**Physical Symptoms:**
- Nosebleeds, seizures, migraines
- Vacant expressions, speaking in unison
- Emotional flatness or instability
- Loss of personal preferences

**Mental Symptoms:**
- Shared dreams with partner
- Thinking in "we" not "I"
- Inability to make decisions alone
- Contentment despite degradation (horror)

**Medical Response:**
- No cure, only delay
- Suppressants reduce rate
- Separation from partner (psychologically painful)
- Eventually: euthanasia or full conversion

## The Hidden Agenda

**Marshal Wei's Plan:**
- Full conversion of all Drifters
- Create human hive mind
- Use collective psychic power to destroy Kaiju Mother
- Believes individual consciousness is weakness
- Sees this as evolution, not extinction

**What Command Knows:**
- Burnout is not bug but feature
- System designed to convert, not just connect
- Each pilot sacrifice brings collective closer
- End goal: Species-wide unity

**The Lie:**
- Told pilots conversion is rare malfunction
- Actually inevitable result of sustained Drift
- Average lifespan: 5 years from recruitment
- None told they're already dying

## Alternative Theories

**Dr. Volkov's Research:**
- Limited Drift might be possible
- Maintaining boundaries requires discipline
- Some pilots show resistance to conversion
- Might be genetic, might be psychological
- Command suppresses this data

**Kaiju Origin Truth:**
- Previous human civilization tried same thing
- Created hive mind to fight different threat
- Became what they fought
- Now feeds on next civilization
- Cycle may repeat with current humanity

## Resistance Movement

**The Disconnected:**
- Pilots who refused further Drift
- Living in pain (withdrawal symptoms)
- Hunted by Command (loose ends)
- Seeking way to destroy Network
- May be last truly individual humans

**Methods:**
- Sabotage Drift equipment
- Extract pilots before full conversion
- Research alternatives
- Plan to destroy central Network nexus

**Dilemma:**
- Destroying Network means no defense against Kaiju
- Billions die without Sentinels
- Is individual freedom worth species extinction?

## The Deep Drift (Psychic Realm)

**Nature:** Collective unconscious made manifest

**Appearance:** Mindscape where memories, emotions, thoughts are physical

**Inhabitants:**
- Current Drifters (translucent, overlapping)
- Burned-out husks (converted fully)
- The Voice (emerging collective entity)
- Kaiju presence (infection, corruption)

**Dangers:**
- Getting lost (may not return to body)
- Contamination (Kaiju infection)
- Dissolution (joining collective willingly)
- Others' traumas (experiencing partner's worst moments)

**Opportunities:**
- Direct psychic combat with Kaiju
- Communication across distances
- Accessing collective knowledge
- Understanding true nature of conflict

## Moral Complexity

**No Easy Answers:**
- Hive mind would save humanity but end individuals
- Maintaining autonomy allows Kaiju victory
- Middle path may fail, doom both goals
- Every choice has catastrophic consequences

**Party Agency:**
- Can influence which path humanity takes
- Cannot avoid consequences
- Must live with results
- Victory always pyrrhic

This world-building creates psychological horror where the weapon that saves you also destroys who you are, and the enemy might be the future version of your own species.
