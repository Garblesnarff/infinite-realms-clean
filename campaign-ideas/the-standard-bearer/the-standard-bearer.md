### Core Premise
The player character is chosen by the White Chronicle - a time-traveling book - to prevent the world's desertification. Two nations, Alistel and Granorg, wage war while the desert slowly consumes all life. The player can travel between two timeline branches - Standard History (where they're a military officer) and Alternate History (where they're an intelligence agent). Each timeline has unique quests, NPCs, and consequences. By jumping between timelines, gathering information from one to solve problems in another, and preventing key tragedies, the player must discover the true cause of desertification and find the sacrifice needed to save the world. However, some people exist in only one timeline - saving the world means erasing one branch, condemning those people to non-existence.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Split (Sessions 1-8)**
- The player receives the White Chronicle and learns they can travel between timelines. In Standard History, they serve as a special forces officer fighting Granorg. In Alternate History, they defect to Granorg as an intelligence agent. Each timeline presents different perspectives on the war. Players learn to use Node jumps - specific decision points where timelines diverge. Early jumps establish the mechanic while building relationships in both timelines, creating emotional investment before the terrible choice ahead.

**Act 2: The Desert's Cause (Sessions 9-18)**
- Through timeline jumping, the player uncovers the truth: the desert spreads because of Sacrifice - when someone dies without purpose, their "mana" is lost, accelerating desertification. Meaningless war deaths feed the desert. But deeper conspiracy exists - a time-traveler named Hugo manipulates events to gather sacrificial power. Certain NPCs exist in only one timeline. The player grows attached to people in both branches, knowing eventually one timeline must be erased.

**Act 3: The True History (Sessions 19-25)**
- The player discovers a third timeline - True History - where they must prevent the original catastrophe that caused the split. Hugo's plan is revealed: he seeks to become god by controlling all timelines. The player must gather allies from both timelines, make impossible choices about who to save, and ultimately sacrifice one timeline entirely. The final sequence requires preventing key deaths, exposing conspiracies in both timelines, and making the terrible choice of which world - and which beloved NPCs - will continue to exist. Victory saves the world but at tremendous emotional cost.

### Major NPCs

- **Stocke**: The player character archetype - chosen by the Chronicle, duty-bound, stoic. **Role:** Protagonist. **Personality:** Professional, tactical, hides emotion. **Flaw/Secret:** His devotion to duty makes him willing to sacrifice anything, even himself.
- **Rosch**: Stocke's friend and superior in Standard History. **Role:** Best Friend / Leader. **Personality:** Charismatic, noble, inspiring. **Flaw/Secret:** Dies in Alternate History, exists only in Standard timeline.
- **Marco & Raynie**: Stocke's subordinates in Standard History. **Role:** Loyal Companions. **Personality:** Devoted, protective. **Flaw/Secret:** Only exist in Standard History - choosing Alternate erases them.
- **Kiel & Gafka**: Stocke's partners in Alternate History. **Role:** Intelligence Allies. **Personality:** Cunning, pragmatic. **Flaw/Secret:** Only exist in Alternate History - choosing Standard erases them.
- **Hugo**: Time-traveling manipulator. **Role:** Primary Antagonist. **Personality:** Brilliant, obsessed with changing history. **Flaw/Secret:** His interference created the timeline split and accelerated desertification.
- **Eruca**: Princess seeking to end the war. **Role:** Deuteragonist / Peace Seeker. **Personality:** Idealistic, brave, royal. **Flaw/Secret:** In one timeline she's an ally, in another an obstacle.
- **Teo & Lippti**: Guardians of the White Chronicle. **Role:** Mentors / Observers. **Personality:** Mysterious, bound by rules about time. **Flaw/Secret:** Know the terrible choice coming but cannot interfere directly.

### Key Locations

- **Alistel**: Player's nation, technologically advanced, democratic but corrupt.
- **Granorg**: Enemy nation, traditional monarchy, portrayed as villains in Standard History but more nuanced in Alternate.
- **The Desert**: Ever-expanding wasteland consuming both nations, physical manifestation of lost Sacrifice.
- **Historia**: The realm where the White Chronicle exists, outside normal time.
- **The True Timeline**: Original history before the split, where the inciting catastrophe must be prevented.

### Central Conflict
The player must prevent desertification by ending a meaningless war, but doing so requires choosing which of two timeline branches - and which beloved NPCs - will continue to exist. The conflict is external (war between nations, Hugo's manipulations) and internal (impossible choices, sacrificing people you care about). Themes include the cost of peace, the nature of sacrifice, whether ends justify means, time paradoxes, and choosing the lesser evil when there are no good options.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Timeline Jumping**: The player can jump between Standard and Alternate History at specific Node points - moments where major decisions diverge timelines. Use a visual diagram or flowchart tracking which timeline the player is currently in and which Nodes they've accessed. Jumping reveals different information, NPCs, and quests.
- **Node System**: Key decision points appear as glowing Nodes the player can return to, making different choices to access alternate paths. Some Nodes only unlock after gaining information from another timeline. This creates a puzzle element - gather intel in Timeline A to solve problem in Timeline B.
- **Sacrifice Meter**: Track meaningless deaths (war casualties, murders without purpose). As this increases, the desert expands, affecting available regions and NPC survival. Preventing deaths or giving them meaning (dying for a cause) slows desertification.
- **Timeline-Exclusive NPCs**: Certain NPCs only exist in one timeline. Make sure the player builds relationships with timeline-specific characters so the final choice hurts. Have NPCs from different timelines serve similar narrative roles so players must choose between equivalent beloved characters.
- **Grid Combat Positioning**: Battles use a grid system where positioning matters for abilities. Players can knock enemies around the grid, setting up combos. Some abilities only work from specific positions or against grouped enemies.
- **The White Chronicle**: A physical prop (if possible) showing the timeline map. Players physically mark which Nodes they've visited and which choices they made. This makes the branching paths tangible and the final choice more weighted.
- **Information Asymmetry**: Each timeline provides partial information. Standard History shows Alistel's perspective and secrets, Alternate shows Granorg's truth. Only by combining knowledge from both can the player see the full picture and access True History.
- **The Final Choice**: Unlike most campaigns, there is no "best" ending where everyone lives. The player must choose which timeline becomes "real," erasing the other. Provide a session before this choice where players can jump between timelines one last time, saying goodbye to NPCs who will cease to exist.
