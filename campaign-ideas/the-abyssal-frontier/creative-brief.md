# The Abyssal Frontier - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
**Alien Ocean Wonder**
- Primary inspiration: Subnautica's otherworldly beauty meets naturalistic alien biology
- Vibrant colors in shallow zones transitioning to dark horror in depths
- Bioluminescence as primary lighting in deeper areas
- Sense of scale—creatures and environment dwarf the players
- Hard sci-fi grounded in plausible xenobiology

### Visual Tone Progression
**Early Game: Wonder and Beauty**
- Crystal clear turquoise water, abundant sunlight
- Colorful coral formations and diverse small creatures
- Sense of being in alien paradise
- Emphasize the beauty before revealing danger

**Mid Game: Depths and Danger**
- Transition to darker, more oppressive environments
- Bioluminescence becomes necessary for navigation
- Creature designs become more threatening and alien
- Beauty remains but edged with menace

**Late Game: Primordial Terror**
- Volcanic landscapes, extreme environments
- Massive creatures that inspire awe and fear
- Ancient Precursor architecture contrasts organic nature
- Climactic reveals of imprisoned leviathan
