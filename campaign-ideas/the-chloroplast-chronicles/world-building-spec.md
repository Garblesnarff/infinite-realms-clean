# World-Building Specification: The Chloroplast Chronicles

## Plant Cell Biology

### Scale
- Party size: 5 micrometers
- Plant cell: 10-100 micrometers
- Chloroplast: 5-10 micrometers
- Cell wall thickness: 0.1-1 micrometer

### Plant Cell Structure
- **Cell Wall:** Rigid cellulose exterior, protection and structure
- **Cell Membrane:** Inside wall, selective barrier
- **Cytoplasm:** Fluid medium filling cell
- **Central Vacuole:** Large water-filled sac (70-90% of cell volume)
- **Chloroplasts:** 20-100 per cell, photosynthesis sites
- **Nucleus:** Genetic control center
- **Mitochondria:** Energy production (non-photosynthetic)
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:** Protein and lipid synthesis
- **Golgi Apparatus:** Packaging and distribution

### Chloroplast Anatomy
- **Outer/Inner Membrane:** Double boundary
- **Thylakoids:** Membrane sacs containing chlorophyll
- **Grana:** Stacks of thylakoids
- **Stroma:** Fluid surrounding thylakoids
- **Own DNA:** Separate genetic material
- **Ribosomes:** Own protein synthesis

## Photosynthesis Mechanics

### Light Reactions (In Thylakoids)
1. Light hits chlorophyll
2. Electrons excited
3. Water split (produces O2)
4. Energy stored in ATP and NADPH

### Dark Reactions/Calvin Cycle (In Stroma)
1. CO2 captured
2. Fixed using ATP and NADPH
3. Glucose produced
4. Cycle continues

### Campaign Integration
- Light reactions as solar temples generating power
- Calvin Cycle as marketplace producing goods
- Stopping either halts photosynthesis entirely

## Vascular System

### Xylem (Water Transport)
- Dead hollow cells
- One-way flow: Roots to leaves
- Transpiration pull creates suction
- Carries water and dissolved minerals
- Highway system for upward travel

### Phloem (Sugar Transport)
- Living cells
- Two-way flow
- Distributes glucose from photosynthesis
- More complex, requires energy
- Trade routes throughout plant

## Symbiosis vs. Exploitation

### Historical Endosymbiosis
- Chloroplasts evolved from cyanobacteria
- Engulfed ~1 billion years ago
- Retained own DNA and membranes
- Mutual benefit: Cell provides protection, chloroplast provides energy

### Philosophical Question
- Are chloroplasts slaves or partners?
- Do they have autonomy rights?
- Plant survival requires their function
- But they're partially independent

### Campaign Answer
- Symbiosis is cooperation, not slavery
- Both sides benefit
- Communication and respect needed
- Modern chloroplasts can't survive independently anyway

## Fungal Pathogen

### Biology
- Hyphae penetrate cell walls
- Extract nutrients
- Block light
- Inject toxins
- Can spread rapidly

### Magical Corruption
- Dark mage enhanced natural pathogen
- Gave it intelligence and philosophy
- Made it charismatic to recruit cells
- Goal: Kill World Tree for political/magical reasons

### Defeat Requirements
- Physical removal of hyphae
- Magical purification
- Cellular immune activation
- Ideological counter-argument

## The World Tree

### Significance
- Ancient oak of immense size
- Roots and branches touch ley lines
- Stabilizes continental magic
- Death would cause magical catastrophe

### Scale
- Millions of cells
- Campaign focuses on single leaf cell
- But actions affect whole tree
- Success in one cell model for all

## DM Customization

### Difficulty
- Number of corrupted chloroplasts
- Fungal invasion severity
- Time before tree death
- Complexity of ideological debate

### Educational Value
- Accurate plant biology
- Photosynthesis explained
- Symbiosis concepts
- Can be learning opportunity

### Expansion
- Other plant cells (root, stem, flower)
- Other trees under attack
- Seasonal changes affecting plant
- Long-term plant protection campaign
