# Sky Metal Kings - World-Building Specification

## The Thunderplains

**Geography**: Wasteland where constant electrical storms created electromagnetic anomalies. Floating islands appeared 100 years ago when first Storm King performed legendary trick.

**The Floating Islands**: Chunks of earth held aloft by electromagnetic fields generated by storm-metal deposits. Range from house-sized to mountain-sized. Seven major islands host Circuit events.

**Lightning Roads**: Temporary bridges of solidified electricity. Form spontaneously during storms or can be summoned by skilled riders performing tricks at correct frequency. Dissipate after ~30 seconds.

**Ground**: Iron Dominion controls surface—harsh industrial society, stratified classes, authoritarian but stable.

**Sky**: Storm Riders live on floating islands—anarchic freedom, dangerous but exhilarating, egalitarian meritocracy based on skill.

## Storm Metal

**Properties**: Crystallized lightning in mineral form. Conducts electricity perfectly, amplifies electromagnetic fields, responds to kinetic energy (tricks).

**Uses**:
- Bike frames (structural + magical)
- Engine mods (performance enhancement)
- Weapons (electrical discharge)
- Armor (lightning redirection)
- Tools (everything from cooking to construction)

**Rarity**: Only found on floating islands, making them valuable to Dominion (reason for conflict).

**Attunement**: Storm-metal bonds with riders, becoming more responsive over time.

## The Storm King

**Legend**: Mythical figure who controls all weather, lives in permanent superstorm, challenges worthy riders

**Reality**: Title, not individual. Rider who masters all seven Circuit events can challenge current King. Winner either becomes new King or abolishes position.

**Power**: Storm King can:
- Control weather worldwide
- Create new floating islands
- Summon lightning roads at will
- Perform impossible tricks
- Live indefinitely (merged with storm)

**Cost**: Gradually lose humanity, become more storm than person, eternal but isolated

**History**: Seven Kings total. First created the islands. Most recent (Magnus) abdicated rather than lose himself completely.

## The Sky Circuit

Seven legendary competitions testing different aspects of riding:

1. **Cloudbreak Challenge**: Basic freestyle, introduction level
2. **Thunder Canyon**: Speed through narrow passages
3. **Typhoon Spiral**: Tricks on rotating island (constant momentum shift)
4. **Gale Gate**: Massive jump between islands
5. **Voltage Valley**: Navigate electrical hazards
6. **Hurricane Heights**: Thin air, extreme wind, endurance
7. **Storm King's Arena**: All previous challenges combined

Winning all seven grants right to challenge Storm King.

## Iron Dominion

**Government**: Military dictatorship (benevolent but authoritarian)
**Society**: Stratified—elites, military, workers, outcasts
**Philosophy**: "Order prevents chaos. Ground is safety. Sky is madness."
**Economy**: Industrial, resource extraction, manufacturing
**Military**: Advanced weapons, anti-air platforms, grounded tech

**Legitimate Concerns**:
- Floating islands DO destabilize ground weather
- Storm Riders' recklessness HAS caused casualties
- Storm-metal extraction creates sinkholes
- Previous Storm Kings abused power

**Illegitimate Methods**:
- Genocide against Sky Riders
- Destroying islands (killing innocents)
- Weapons of mass destruction
- No negotiation attempts

## Storm Rider Culture

**Values**: Freedom, skill, courage, innovation, community
**Structure**: Anarchist—no formal government, respect earned through ability
**Economy**: Barter and reputation, storm-metal as currency
**Justice**: Trial by riding—disputes settled via competition

**Traditions**:
- Bike naming ceremony
- Memorial rides for fallen riders
- Trick invention honored (tricks named after creators)
- Elder respect (skill transcends age)
- Welcome all who can ride

**Coming of Age**: First lightning road summon = adult status

**Death Rites**: Riderless bike sent off lightning road into storm (symbolic return to sky)

## Trick Magic

**Theory**: Electromagnetic fields respond to specific kinetic patterns. Tricks performed at precise angles/speeds channel storm energy.

**Categories**:
- **Flips**: Thunder-based (sound/shock attacks)
- **Whips**: Lightning redirect
- **Grabs**: Stability/control
- **Combos**: Multiply effects

**Advanced Techniques**:
- **Triple Backflip**: Summon lightning road
- **Volt Combination**: Chain lightning between multiple riders
- **Storm Call**: Intensify or calm weather
- **King's Signature**: Unique to each rider, master-level trick

**Limitations**:
- Requires functional bike
- Drains rider stamina
- Only works in storm-active areas
- Overuse attracts lightning strikes (dangerous)

## Bikes

**Standard Components**: Engine, frame, wheels, suspension, exhaust

**Storm-Metal Upgrades**:
- **Tier 1**: Enhanced conductivity
- **Tier 2**: Self-repair, basic trick amplification
- **Tier 3**: Personality development, advanced tricks
- **Tier 4**: Semi-sentient, merged with rider
- **Tier 5** (King level): Independent intelligence, ultimate power

**Customization**: Paint schemes, decals, personal modifications reflecting rider's style

**Bonding**: The more a rider and bike work together, the more attuned they become (mechanical + spiritual relationship)

## Weather Lore

**Storm Types**:
- **Thunderstorms**: Most common, supportive of riders
- **Hurricanes**: Dangerous but powerful if mastered
- **Tornadoes**: Chaotic, impossible to predict
- **Electrical Tempests**: Pure lightning, extremely dangerous but grant greatest power

**The Superstorm**: Permanent storm at center of Thunderplains where Storm King resides. Eye is Arena—only calm spot.

**Weather Manipulation**: Storm King can create/dismiss/alter weather. Previous Kings used this irresponsibly, causing ground catastrophes.

## The Choice

At campaign's climax, players must decide:

**Become Storm King**:
- Ultimate power over weather
- Protect floating islands forever
- Gradually lose humanity
- Eternal but isolated

**Abolish Position**:
- No central authority
- Risk of island collapse without King's stabilization
- True freedom but higher danger
- Community-based solutions required

**Reform Position**:
- Shared power among multiple riders
- Checks and balances
- Preserve benefits, minimize corruption
- Requires cooperation

## Mysteries

1. Who created the first floating island and how?
2. What happened to previous Storm Kings?
3. Can storm-metal be synthesized (ground-based)?
4. Are the islands alive/conscious?
5. What would happen if all islands fell?
6. Can Dominion and Riders coexist?
7. What lies in the Superstorm's deepest levels?
8. Are there other Storm King candidates?
9. What caused the first electromagnetic anomaly?
10. Can humanity survive without the islands?

These mysteries provide campaign depth and post-victory storytelling opportunities.
