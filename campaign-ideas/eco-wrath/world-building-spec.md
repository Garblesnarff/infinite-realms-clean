## Global Environmental Coalition (GEC)

**Founded:** 45 years ago as activist network

**Evolution:** Became emergency response during Awakening

**Resources:**
- Eco-mages (druids and nature clerics)
- Sustainable technology
- Rewilding expertise
- Communication specialists

**Philosophy:** "We can earn our place on Earth again"

**Challenges:**
- Underfunded compared to military
- Seen as naive by hardliners
- Infiltrated by extremists
- Racing against time

## Eco-Vanguard (Extremists)

**Origin:** Splinter from GEC, radicalized by inaction

**Belief:** Humanity must shrink to 10% current population or extinction justified

**Methods:**
- Sabotage industrial facilities
- Assist Titans in targeting
- Terrorist actions against corporate leaders
- Propaganda showing Titans as righteous

**Leadership:** Former environmentalists pushed too far

**Not Villains:** Motivation understandable, methods extreme

## Military Coalition

**Formation:** United global military response

**Strategy:**
- Conventional weapons (ineffective)
- Experimental bio-weapons (dangerous)
- Nuclear option (catastrophic)
- Fortified strongholds

**Leadership:** Desperate commanders facing impossible odds

**Tragedy:** Every victory creates worse long-term problems

## Pre-Awakening Timeline

**100 Years Ago:** Industrial revolution acceleration
**50 Years Ago:** Environmental movement begins
**30 Years Ago:** Climate change undeniable
**20 Years Ago:** Mass extinction event recognized
**10 Years Ago:** Tipping point passed
**5 Years Ago:** First stirrings (unexplained earthquakes, unusual growth)
**1 Year Ago:** Verdantus awakens
**Campaign Start:** Five Titans active, more emerging

## Post-Awakening World

**Collapsed Infrastructure:**
- Global trade ceased
- Internet sporadic
- Fuel supplies exhausted
- Electricity limited to solar/wind

**Population Movement:**
- Billions displaced
- Mega-cities overcrowded
- Rural areas dangerous (Titan territory)
- Constant refugee crisis

**New Technologies:**
- Magic-tech fusion out of necessity
- Sustainable by force, not choice
- Communal living mandatory
- Resource sharing or death

## Titan Communication Methods

**Methods Discovered:**
- Verdantus: Pollen spores create shared visions
- Aquaria: Whale-song patterns in water, emotional resonance
- Pyros: Smoke patterns form symbols (interpretable)
- Glacius: Ice crystals refract light into messages
- Toxicus: Suffering made manifest, pain communication

**What They Communicate:**
- Demands for change (specific, measurable)
- Pain from pollution (visceral, guilt-inducing)
- Memories of Earth before humans (perspective shift)
- Warnings about consequences (extinction previews)
- Hope if change happens (beautiful futures shown)

## Planetary Consciousness

**Revelation:** Earth is not passive, is aware

**Nature:**
- Not sentient in human way
- More like immune system
- Responds to damage
- Creates defenders as needed

**Communication:**
- Through Titans as avatars
- Directly to sensitive individuals
- Dreams and visions
- Undeniable once experienced

**Demands:**
- Reduce human footprint by 80%
- Restore extinct species (via magic/tech)
- Eliminate pollution within decades
- Accept place in ecosystem, not above it

## The Treaty Terms (If Negotiation Succeeds)

**Human Obligations:**
- Population cap at 2 billion (managed decline, no genocide)
- 80% of land rewilded
- All cities compact and sustainable
- Zero non-biodegradable pollution
- Species restoration programs
- Titan sacred sites inviolate

**Titan Obligations:**
- Cease attacks on compliant regions
- Assist in rewilding (accelerated growth)
- Protection from cosmic threats
- Teaching humans sustainable methods
- Creating smaller guardian Titans for regions

**Enforcement:**
- Titan monitors watch for violations
- Immediate response to breaches
- No exceptions for anyone
- Humanity on permanent probation

## Smaller Titans (Later Campaign)

Titans can spawn defenders, smaller (50-100 feet) specialized:
- **Reapers:** Harvest overgrown human structures
- **Shepherds:** Guide wildlife to restored areas
- **Wardens:** Punish human violations
- **Healers:** Purify polluted zones
- **Seeders:** Plant forests at accelerated rates

## Corporate Conspiracy

**Discovery:** Major corporations knew crisis coming

**Preparations:**
- Built colony ships secretly
- Plan to abandon Earth with elite clients
- Take resources, leave billions to die
- Preserve themselves, damn the species

**Party's Choice:** Expose and stop them, or let them go (reduces population toward Titan demand)

## Magic's Role

**Environmental Magic Surge:**
- Druid power increases dramatically
- Nature clerics gain new abilities
- Wild magic zones where nature strongest
- Ancient spirits awaken to help or hinder

**Titans and Magic:**
- Are living embodiments of nature magic
- Can grant boons to worthy humans
- Magic is communication method
- Corruption detectable via magic sense

This world-building creates moral complexity—Titans aren't villains, humans aren't heroes, survival requires admitting fault and changing fundamentally.
