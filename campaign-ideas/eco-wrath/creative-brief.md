# Eco-Wrath: Creative Brief

## Art Style: Natural Reclamation

**Titan Design:** Organic perfection, each embodying their biome, beautiful and terrible, flowing movement

**Verdantus:** Towering tree-being, flowering crown, vines as limbs, moss skin, wood and chlorophyll

**Aquaria:** Whale-kraken hybrid, bioluminescent, water itself given form, graceful apocalypse

**Reclaimed Cities:** Nature breaking through concrete, green overtaking gray, aggressive beautiful growth

## Color Palettes

**Primary:** Living Green (#228B22), Earth Brown (#8B4513), Ocean Blue (#006994), Sky Clear (#87CEEB)

**Titans:** Verdantus Forest Green, Aquaria Deep Blue, Pyros Volcanic Red, Glacius Ice White, Toxicus Sickly Yellow

**Human Zones:** Gray concrete, Rust orange decay, Warning Red, Artificial light

**Healing:** Vibrant greens replacing pollution grays, color returning to world

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme:** Orchestral with natural instruments, rainfall percussion, wind strings, earth drums

**Verdantus:** Creaking wood, rustling leaves at massive scale, growth sounds accelerated

**Aquaria:** Whale song, ocean depths, waves crashing, water flowing

**Reclamation:** Time-lapse growth sounds, roots breaking stone, life overwhelming artifice

**Human Resistance:** Industrial clanging, machinery, explosions—discordant against natural harmony

## Voice Direction

**Dr. Okoye:** Weary wisdom, maternal disappointment, hope despite evidence

**Commander Brass:** Military efficiency, suppressed fear, trying to protect despite knowing it's futile

**Zephyr:** Passionate extremism, true belief, tragic because they're not entirely wrong

**Titans:** No voices, communication through sensation, emotion, vision—alien but understandable

## Cinematic Moments

**Verdantus Emergence:** Amazon jungle standing up, becoming bipedal, every tree now part of titan

**City Reclamation:** São Paulo in time-lapse, vines overtaking skyscrapers in days

**First Communication:** Breathing Verdantus's pollen, shared vision, seeing through nature's eyes

**The Treaty:** Humans kneeling before Titans, offering seedlings, Titan accepting with flower bloom

**Mutual Destruction:** Nuclear fire vs. Titan fury, planet dying from both wounds
