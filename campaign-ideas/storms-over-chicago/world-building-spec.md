**Storms Over Chicago**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In modern Chicago, supernatural investigators navigate the hidden magical world where vampires, fae, wizards, and demons play deadly political games. Bound by the Laws of Magic but facing impossible choices, they must prevent a war between vampire courts and the White Council while stopping Outsiders from breaking through reality's walls. Magic has a price, and sometimes the cost is paid in souls.

    *   Describe the War between the White Council and the Red Court vampires, including the triggering diplomatic incident.
    *   Explain the Courts of the Sidhe—Summer and Winter's roles, their monarchs (Titania and Mab), and their eternal balance.
    *   Detail the Outer Gates and the Outsiders—reality-devouring entities that Winter holds back from consuming existence.
