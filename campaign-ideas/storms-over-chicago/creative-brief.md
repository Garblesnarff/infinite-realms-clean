# Creative Brief: Storms Over Chicago

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Urban Noir with Supernatural Elements (Dresden Files-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty urban fantasy of *The Dresden Files* with noir detective aesthetics meeting raw magical power. This style captures the contrast between mundane Chicago streets and the terrifying beauty of the supernatural world, blending hardboiled detective fiction with epic fantasy battles.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Urban Grit:** Dark alleyways, rain-slicked streets, neon signs, old brownstones, modern city contrasted with ancient magic
*   **Magic as Violent and Raw:** Fire, ice, and force manifesting as crude elemental power, not elegant spellwork
*   **Supernatural Noir:** Shadowy figures, trench coats, staff and blasting rod, detective investigating impossible crimes
*   **The Nevernever:** Otherworldly realms—frozen palaces, burning summer lands, gothic vampire courts

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, urban fantasy, hardboiled, supernatural detective, dark humor, power at a cost, Chicago
*   **Feeling:** The loneliness of knowing terrible truths mixed with sardonic humor. Magic is real but dangerous. The night has teeth. A lone wizard against impossible odds.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Urban Scenes:** Dark grays, blacks, blues with neon accent colors (red, green, yellow from signs)
*   **Magic Effects:** Bright, violent colors—orange-red fire, blue-white ice, purple-black entropy
*   **Nevernever:** Hyper-saturated—Winter is crystalline blues and whites, Summer is golden greens and amber
*   **Prompt Example:** "...Chicago street at night, rain reflecting neon signs in reds and blues against dark gray pavement. Orange flames erupt from a wizard's staff, illuminating the darkness. Shadows hide supernatural threats. Gritty noir atmosphere."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Wizards:** Long coats (dusters), staffs, blasting rods, pentacle amulets, somewhat shabby modern clothes
*   **Vampires:** Three courts—White Court (beautiful, seductive), Red Court (bat-like monsters beneath human masks), Black Court (rotting corpses)
*   **Fae:** Inhumanly beautiful, dangerous, elements in their design (ice, thorns, flowers, shadows)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tall wizard in a black leather duster coat, carrying a carved wooden staff seven feet tall. Pentacle amulet around his neck. Scruffy appearance, determined expression. One hand raised with orange fire gathering around his fingertips. Chicago street behind him."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Chicago:** Recognizable landmarks, old brownstones, lakefront, darker industrial areas, underground tunnels
*   **Mac's Pub:** Neutral ground bar, dim lighting, medieval simplicity, wooden beams
*   **Nevernever:** Impossible architecture—Arctis Tor (ice fortress), Summer's vibrant court, gothic vampire mansions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Chicago brownstone apartment, clearly lived-in but messy. Bookshelves overflowing with occult texts. Candles for lighting instead of electricity. A magic circle chalked on the floor, glowing faintly. Rain visible through the windows. Worn furniture. Cozy but poor."

**5. Magic and Combat:**
*   **Elemental Violence:** Fire bursts, ice walls, kinetic force shields, lightning bolts—all with raw, explosive visual impact
*   **Fae Magic:** More subtle—illusions, compulsions, manipulations of reality
*   **Dark Magic:** Entropy as black and purple decay, necromancy as sickly green, blood magic as crimson
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wizard thrusts his staff forward, unleashing a torrent of orange-red flames in a cone. The fire illuminates attacking vampires—grotesque bat-like creatures beneath peeling human disguises. The wizard's coat billows from the blast's force. Brick alley walls are scorched black."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Noir Lighting:** Strong contrasts, deep shadows, single light sources, rain creating reflections
*   **Magic Glow:** Spells provide harsh illumination in darkness, casting dramatic shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single streetlight, casting long shadows. Rain falls, creating halos around lights. The wizard glows with blue magical energy. Vampires lurk in shadows at the edge of light. Strong noir contrast between light and dark."

## Voice

A weary but determined voice, tinged with dark humor and sarcasm masking deep emotion. The pacing is quick and punchy with occasional slower moments for gravitas. The tone shifts between wise-cracking commentary ("Bite me, Twilight"), emotional resolve, and exhausted determination. There's an underlying theme of paying prices and owing debts. Slightly rough, like someone who's been beaten down but refuses to quit. Role: The voice of hardboiled supernatural heroism.
