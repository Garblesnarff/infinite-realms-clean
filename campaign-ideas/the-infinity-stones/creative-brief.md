# Creative Brief: The Infinity Stones

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cosmic Mythology (MCU Epic Style)

Inspired by the grand, cosmic scale of Marvel's *Infinity War/Endgame*. This style aims to capture overwhelming power, desperate heroism, and the clash between mortal heroes and godlike forces.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** Show cosmic vistas, planet-sized threats, and heroes dwarfed by cosmic forces.
*   **Power Made Visible:** The Infinity Stones glow with distinctive colors and warp reality around them.
*   **Heroism in the Face of Doom:** Characters stand defiant even when outmatched.
