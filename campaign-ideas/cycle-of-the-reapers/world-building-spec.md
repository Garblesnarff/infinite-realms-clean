**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party completes loyalty missions → **THEN:** Squadmates survive Suicide Mission, unlock special dialogue/abilities.
*   **IF:** Party cures the genophage → **THEN:** Gain krogan War Assets, lose some salarian support, Mordin likely dies heroically.
*   **IF:** Party brokers quarian-geth peace → **THEN:** Gain both as War Assets, requires high Paragon/Renegade and Legion/Tali alive.
*   **IF:** Total War Assets are high → **THEN:** All three ending choices available, better epilogue outcomes.
*   **IF:** Party chooses Destroy → **THEN:** Reapers/Geth/EDI destroyed, organics survive, Shepard may survive.
*   **IF:** Party chooses Control → **THEN:** Shepard becomes Reaper-controlling AI, all species saved but at cost of humanity.
*   **IF:** Party chooses Synthesis → **THEN:** All life merged organic-synthetic, controversial forced evolution.
