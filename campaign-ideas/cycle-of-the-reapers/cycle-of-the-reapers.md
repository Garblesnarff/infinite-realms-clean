They discover the Reapers: sentient starships from dark space who exterminate all advanced organic life every 50,000 years in an endless cycle. The party must unite a fractured galaxy of alien races—turians, asari, salarians, krogan, and more—build a superweapon called the Crucible, and make impossible choices about the fate of organic and synthetic life. Through squad loyalty missions, political negotiations, and desperate battles, they'll decide whether to destroy, control, or synthesize with the Reapers.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-40 sessions)

A three-act space opera spanning entire star systems and civilizations.

*   **Act I — The Reaper Threat Revealed (Sessions 1-12):** The party investigates human colonies vanishing without trace. They discover a rogue Spectre named Saren is working with a Reaper called Sovereign to open the Citadel—the galactic capital—to the Reapers waiting in dark space. They recruit a diverse squad: a turian soldier seeking redemption, an asari archaeologist, a krogan warrior, a quarian engineer, and others. Each has loyalty and trust issues. After proving the Reaper threat, they assault the Citadel, defeat Saren, and destroy Sovereign, but not before it sends a signal to the Reapers in dark space.
*   **Act II — Preparing for War (Sessions 13-28):** Two years later, human colonies are abducted by mysterious insect-like Collectors working for the Reapers. The party must assemble a new team and recruit specialists for a suicide mission through the Omega-4 relay into the galactic core. Each squad member has personal issues—loyalty missions that must be completed or they'll die in the final push. They upgrade their ship, the Normandy, and gather intelligence. The suicide mission through the Collector base reveals the Reapers are building a human Reaper. The party destroys or saves the base, but the Reapers are already arriving.
*   **Act III — The Reaper War (Sessions 29-40):** The Reapers invade in full force, devastating Earth and other homeworlds. The party must unite every species—even ancient enemies—to build the Crucible, a superweapon of unknown function left by previous cycles. This requires brokering peace between krogan and turians, saving the quarian homeworld, recruiting the mysterious Leviathans, and curing the genophage plague. In the final battle for Earth, the Crucible activates and reveals three choices: Destroy all synthetics (including the Reapers but also friendly AI), Control the Reapers (becoming an AI god), or Synthesize organic and synthetic life (forced evolution). Each choice has profound consequences.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of unity vs. tribalism, the price of survival, organic vs. synthetic life, and the weight of impossible choices. It asks: Can ancient enemies unite against extinction? Is forced evolution ethical if it saves everyone? Should you sacrifice the few to save the many? The central conflict pits the party's desire to save organic life against the Reapers' cold logic that harvesting prevents even worse outcomes.
