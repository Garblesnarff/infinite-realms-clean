**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14**
**Tone (keywords):** mercenary-pragmatism, dark-fantasy, chronicler-perspective, loyalty-to-company, morally-grey, ancient-evil
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are members of the Black Company, the last of the legendary Free Companies of Khatovar, now reduced to a mercenary band four centuries old and serving whoever pays. Their current employer is the Lady—a centuries-old sorceress-tyrant building an empire through conquest and dark magic—and they know she's evil, but she pays well and the Company keeps its contracts. Through the eyes of Croaker, the Company annalist who records their deeds, they march through endless campaigns, navigate the Company's anarchic camaraderie, and slowly discover their employer's true nature: she's one of the Ten Who Were Taken, immortal sorcerers enslaved to the Dominator, an ancient dark lord whose tomb they're inadvertently helping to locate. The players must decide whether mercenary honor—keeping contracts even with evil—matters more than stopping apocalypse, and whether they can find redemption in a company defined by damnation.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — Shadows Linger (Sessions 1–5):** The Black Company serves the Lady, conquering cities for her growing empire. Players experience mercenary life: dark humor, loyalty to squadmates, pragmatic violence, and the moral compromises of serving evil for pay. They witness the Lady's Taken (her eleven immortal sorcerer-generals) commit atrocities, but the Company stays neutral—they're tools, not judges. They begin recording events in the Annals (Company history), discover ancient prophecies about the Lady and Dominator, and encounter the Circle—rebels who claim the Lady plans to resurrect the Dominator. Players must choose sides in battles knowing both are morally grey: the Lady's tyranny or the Circle's terrorism.

*   **Act II — The White Rose (Sessions 6–11):** The Company discovers the White Rose—reincarnation of the hero who defeated the Dominator originally—is leading the rebellion. She offers them redemption: break contract with the Lady, join the fight against real evil. The Company fractures: some want to honor contract (Company law is sacred), others want to fight for something better. Players navigate this schism while battling Taken, uncovering the truth about Khatovar (their legendary homeland may not exist), and discovering the Lady is manipulating events to free herself from the Dominator's control—not to serve him, but to defeat him herself. The players become central to a conflict between three powers: the Dominator (ancient evil), the Lady (evil becoming something else), and the White Rose (good requiring terrible sacrifice).

*   **Act III — The Books of the South (Sessions 12–15+):** The Company's contract ends in betrayal and flight. They journey south toward legendary Khatovar, discovering the Company's true history: they were the Dominator's original soldiers, exiled after his fall, carrying guilt for serving ultimate evil. The Black Company is literally damned—founded in sin, four centuries fleeing redemption. Players must confront this legacy while the Dominator's return looms. Final choice: Die honorably fighting the Dominator (ending the Company's shame), survive by serving him again (ultimate betrayal but maintaining Company), or forge new purpose (breaking Company law but saving the world). The campaign ends knowing that even in victory, the Company's record is written in blood and dark deeds—but those deeds saved the world from something worse, and maybe that's the only redemption possible for the damned.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Annals**
*   One player is designated Annalist (or all players contribute).
*   After sessions, write/record what happened from Company perspective—dark humor, pragmatic observations, no heroes.
*   The Annals become campaign record and affect Company morale. Good recording grants minor benefits; poor recording hurts cohesion.

### 2. **Company Cohesion**
*   Track Company loyalty/morale. High cohesion grants combat bonuses and supports.
*   Breaks in Company law or betraying squadmates damages cohesion.
*   Cohesion mechanic represents: we're damned, but we're damned together.

### 3. **Mercenary Pragmatism**
*   Players can attempt to stay neutral in moral conflicts, serving whoever pays.
*   But: Personal relationships develop with both sides. Eventually neutrality becomes impossible.
*   Breaking neutrality has consequences—loss of contracts, Company reputation, but potential redemption.

### 4. **Asymmetric Power**
*   The Taken and Lady are vastly more powerful than players. Direct combat is suicidal.
*   Players win through cunning, exploiting weaknesses, and understanding Taken psychology.
*   Magic is rare and dangerous—Company wizards (One-Eye, Goblin) provide support but aren't overwhelmingly powerful.

### 5. **Dark Humor and Camaraderie**
*   Mechanically: Players can use dark humor/banter in tough situations to restore hope/remove fear effects.
*   Represents Company culture—laugh at horror because crying doesn't help.

## Central Conflict

Is keeping contracts sacred when you're serving evil? Does mercenary honor have meaning when you know you're on the wrong side? The Company's defining trait is loyalty to each other and their contracts—but what if that loyalty perpetuates evil? Can the damned find redemption, or are they defined by their past forever? The campaign explores whether doing terrible things for understandable reasons (survival, loyalty, keeping oaths) is forgivable, and whether soldiers can be held responsible for their commanders' atrocities when they chose to serve knowing those commanders were monsters.
