# Creative Brief: Chronicles of the Damned

Art Style: Gritty Medieval Dark Fantasy with Chronicler Aesthetics. Realistic medieval warfare, dark sorcery, the written word as witness. Inspired by medieval manuscripts, war art, and Glen Cook's unflinching perspective.

**Color Palette:** Steel grays, blood reds, earth browns of campaigns, black for the Company banner, sickly greens and purples for sorcery, parchment yellow for the Annals.

**Character Design:** Mercenaries in practical, worn armor and equipment. The Taken appear beautiful but wrong—perfect faces on bodies that move unnaturally. The Lady as terrible beauty. Company members scarred and weathered but with fierce loyalty visible.

**Backgrounds:** Medieval siege camps, conquered cities, ancient barrows, the Company standard (flaming spear) flying over morally grey battlefields, chronicle chambers where Annalists record.

**Mood:** Dark pragmatism, gallows humor, loyalty in damnation, the weight of writing history while making it, mercenary perspective on world-changing events.

Voice: A mercenary chronicler's voice, matter-of-fact about horror, darkly humorous, recording for future Company members. Pacing is campaign-steady with battle bursts. Emotion shows buried under pragmatism—we serve evil but we're honest about it. Role: The Annalist recording the Company's deeds so they won't be forgotten, for good or ill.
