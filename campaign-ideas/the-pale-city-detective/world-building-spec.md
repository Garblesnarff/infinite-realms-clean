As they uncover conspiracies involving unions, corporations, and political ideologies, they construct their own identity through the beliefs they embrace and actions they take.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the failed Communist Revolution in Revachol 50 years ago and the subsequent occupation.
    *   Write about the Pale—the space between realities that's consuming the world, causing amnesia and madness.
    *   Describe the Insulindian Phasmid—a cryptid myth the desperate city clings to as proof of wonder.
    *   Explain the Moralintern—the international coalition occupying Revachol after the revolution's failure.
    *   Detail the four major political ideologies and why each failed or succeeded historically.

*   **IF:** Party builds trust with Kim → **THEN:** He shares personal stories, saves them in critical moments, writes positive report.
*   **IF:** Party fails to prepare for the Tribunal → **THEN:** Many characters die, the party may die, the case fails catastrophically.
*   **IF:** Party embraces addiction (drugs, alcohol) → **THEN:** Electrochemistry dominates, gain temporary bonuses but long-term harm.
*   **IF:** Party finds the Phasmid → **THEN:** Proof that impossible, wonderful things exist despite the world's cynicism.
*   **IF:** Party solves the case with grace → **THEN:** Kim recommends them for Major Crimes, redemption is possible.
