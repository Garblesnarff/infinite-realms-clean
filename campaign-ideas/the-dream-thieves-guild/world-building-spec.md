### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Dream Thieves Guild**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party are psychic operatives who enter minds through shared-dreaming magic to steal information or plant ideas. Hired to perform inception—planting an idea so deep the target believes it originated from themselves—they must navigate nested dream layers where time dilates and reality blurs. As they descend through their target's mind, they discover the real target might be one of them, and determining what's real becomes the ultimate challenge.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the discovery of shared-dreaming magic and its application to mental espionage.
    *   Write the history of the Dream Thieves Guild—from academic research to corporate espionage network.
    *   Describe the phenomenon of Limbo—the deep subconscious where time barely moves and lost dreamers build eternal prisons.
    *   Explain time dilation across dream layers and the psychological toll of spending subjective years in minutes.
    *   Detail the Extractor profession—trained mental defenders who protect against dream thieves.
    *   Describe what happens to those who die in dreams or become lost in deep layers.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Dream Thieves Guild** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Execute extractions and inceptions for profit, protect trade secrets, maintain monopoly on shared-dreaming technology.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Cell-based structure with independent teams, coordinated by The Architect Council.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Legitimate research into dream psychology and therapeutic applications.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Industrial espionage, political manipulation, memory alteration for highest bidders.
        *   **Assets:** Shared-dreaming magic, trained specialists, chemical mixtures for sleep control, safe houses in Limbo.
        *   **Relationships:** Employed by corporations and nobles; opposed by Extractors; some members question the ethics.
    *   **The Extractor Corps** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Protect minds from intrusion, capture or kill dream thieves, develop counter-measures.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military-style organization with ranks and specializations.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Mental health security and dream-state protection services.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some Extractors are former dream thieves using insider knowledge; others seek to weaponize techniques.
        *   **Assets:** Combat training in dreams, intimate knowledge of thief tactics, support from wealthy targets.
        *   **Relationships:** Direct opposition to Dream Thieves Guild; some potential for infiltration both ways.
    *   **The Lost** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive in Limbo, build stable reality, occasionally escape.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None—collection of individuals trapped too deep to wake.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—most don't remember the waking world.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some have become so powerful in Limbo they don't want to leave; others seek revenge on those who trapped them.
        *   **Assets:** Decades or centuries of subjective experience in dream manipulation, control over their Limbo domains.
        *   **Relationships:** Dangerous to encounter; may be allies or enemies depending on their mental state; some were legendary architects or thieves.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Saito:** The mysterious employer with hidden agendas and possible Limbo experience.
    *   **Ariadne:** The brilliant architect addicted to building impossible worlds.
    *   **Mal:** The shadow manifestation from the leader's subconscious, possibly more than a projection.
    *   **The Extractor:** Elite defender who knows all the thieves' tricks because they invented them.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Shared Dreamer (Team member specializing in role: Architect, Forger, Chemist, Pointman)"
    *   "Subconscious Projection (Hostile manifestation from target's mind)"
    *   "Lost Dreamer (Trapped in Limbo, may be helpful or hostile)"
    *   "Corporate Target (Person whose mind is being infiltrated)"
    *   "Shadow Self (Manifestation of party member's regrets/fears)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Waking World:** Reality (or is it?) where planning and preparation occurs.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The safe house, the chemist's lab, meeting locations, the target's home.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The party, employers, targets, potential recruits.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Sleep magic preparation, equipment, information gathering.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Reality check revealing inconsistencies, encounter with Extractor agent, meeting with former team member who may be lost, totem behaving oddly, déjà vu moment.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "You can never remember the beginning of a dream." "Totems only work if no one else knows their secret." "The architect who built the safe house disappeared into Limbo."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Should feel perfectly real but allow for subtle inconsistencies), Sound (Pay attention to ambient sounds that might loop), Smell (Check if smells are as vivid as they should be).
    *   **Layer One - The City:** The target's conscious daily mind as a bustling metropolis.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Streets reflecting target's routine, buildings representing memories, crowds as subconscious projections.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Projections from target's mind, increasingly hostile as they detect intrusion.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Information from target's surface thoughts, opportunities to observe habits.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Peaceful projection becomes hostile, traffic patterns revealing target's anxiety, architecture shifting as target's attention wanders, familiar face from target's memory, time dilation glitch.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The target was trained against extraction." "Someone else is already in this dream." "The target's projections are too organized—military trained."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Bustling city but with surreal touches—repeated faces, impossible architecture), Sound (City ambience with odd echoes), Smell (Strangely generic—rarely specific enough to be real).
    *   **Limbo - The Raw Subconscious:** Unstable reality where time barely moves and lost dreamers build eternal prisons.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Ruins of failed dreams, cities built by the Lost, memories crystallized into architecture, the Edge (nothingness beyond constructed reality).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The Lost, shadow manifestations, fragments of destroyed identities.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Time to plan (subjective decades in seconds), ultimate creative control, but also ultimate danger.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Lost dreamer who's been here subjective centuries, architecture from party member's own subconscious, manifestation of deepest fear, discovery of another team's remains, reality degradation requiring constant mental reinforcement.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):" "Time here is so slow that waiting for rescue means aging decades." "Some of the Lost have become gods of their domains." "There's something below Limbo—the true subconscious multiverse."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Architecture constantly shifting unless focused on, impossible geometry, ruins of dreams), Sound (Whispers of other consciousnesses, echoes from other times), Smell (Nothing—must be consciously added or it defaults to emptiness).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A party member dies in a dream.
    *   **THEN:** They fall to Limbo. Generate a rescue mission where others must go deeper to retrieve them before they become Lost.
    *   **IF:** The party misses a synchronized kick.
    *   **THEN:** Generate scenarios where team members are split across layers, must communicate via timed events, and coordinate new kicks.
    *   **IF:** A party member's shadow self defeats them.
    *   **THEN:** That shadow takes over the party member's role in the dream, creating trust issues and potential betrayal scenarios.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers evidence they're still dreaming when they think they've woken.
    *   **THEN:** Generate escalating reality checks and paranoia. Provide subtle clues but never fully confirm the truth.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to complete the inception and attempts to wake.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences—the employer traps them deeper, kicks fail, or they wake to find themselves in another layer.
    *   **IF:** The Architect chooses to stay in Limbo.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a finale where the party must choose: leave them behind or stay and build an eternal dream together.
