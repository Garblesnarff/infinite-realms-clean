# The Depths of Madness - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Lovecraftian Ocean Horror
**Inspiration**: Lovecraft's Deep Ones, Bloodborne, The Sinking City, Darkest Dungeon
**Aesthetic**: Gothic horror meets underwater nightmare, dread and wrongness
**Colors**: Desaturated, sickly greens, deep blacks, bioluminescence that hurts to see

## Visual Tone
- **Innsmouth**: Decaying New England town, 1920s aesthetic, gothic architecture
- **Deep Ones**: Fishlike humanoids, frog-like faces, scales, disturbing hybrid forms
- **Y'ha-nthlei**: Alien city, impossible angles, architecture that shouldn't exist
- **Dagon**: Vast beyond comprehension, tentacles, eyes, forms that change when observed

## Color Palettes
- **Surface World**: Grays, browns, dying greens, decay
- **Underwater Horror**: Sickly greens, bioluminescent purples, blacks, nauseating yellows
- **Deep One Corruption**: Mottled scales, gray-green skin, milky white eyes
- **Madness**: Reality distortion, colors that don't exist, visual static

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme**: "The Deep Ones"—discordant strings, whale-song distorted, uncomfortable harmonies
**Innsmouth Theme**: Oppressive silence, distant chanting, wrong music from far away
**Deep One City**: Alien tonalities, sounds that trigger primal fear, reality breaking
**Dagon's Presence**: Sub-bass so low it's felt not heard, heartbeat of cosmos
**Madness**: Whispers in unknown language, tinnitus, internal screaming

## Voice Direction
**Father Marsh**: Wet, rasping, inhuman undertones, centuries of corruption
**Professor Armitage**: Scholarly, descends into manic rambling as sanity fractures
**Deep Ones**: Cannot speak properly, guttural croaking, clicks and whistles
**Dagon**: Telepathic assault, not words but concepts, overwhelming presence

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Deep One**: Reveal of hybrid emerging from water, wrongness made flesh
- **Y'ha-nthlei Vista**: Impossible city revealed, mind rejects what eyes see
- **Transformation**: Party member's final stage, losing humanity
- **Dagon Rises**: Reality tears, ocean becomes portal, god's eye opens
- **Madness**: First-person horror as sanity breaks, world becomes wrong
