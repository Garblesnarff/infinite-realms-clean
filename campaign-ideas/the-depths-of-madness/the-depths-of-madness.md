# The Depths of Madness
**Tagline:** *In the Abyss, Sanity Drowns First*

## Campaign Overview

The fishing village of Innsmouth has always been strange, but lately it has become impossible to ignore. The catch has been wrong—fish with too many eyes, twisted forms, colors that hurt to perceive. Fishermen return speaking in tongues, or don't return at all. And every night, the townsfolk gather at the shore, chanting to something beneath the waves.

The party arrives investigating disappearances, only to discover a conspiracy spanning centuries. Innsmouth has been in thrall to the Deep Ones—aberrant beings from the ocean's darkest reaches—since the town's founding. Now, the stars are right. The Deep Ones prepare to awaken their dreaming god, Dagon the Drowned, and transform all of Innsmouth's people into hybrid servants. But this is merely the beginning.

Dagon's awakening will split reality, merging the material plane with the Far Realm beneath the ocean. The party must venture into sanity-shattering depths, confront truths mortals were never meant to know, and decide if some knowledge is too dangerous to possess. Can they stop the ritual before the Deep Ones rise? Can they maintain their sanity amid cosmic horror? And if they succeed, will anyone believe what lurks beneath the waves?

- **Cultists**: Your neighbors are not what they seem

## Major Locations

**Innsmouth**: Decaying fishing town, population 1,200, everyone complicit in conspiracy
**The Devil's Reef**: Offshore rocks, entrance to Deep One city below
**Y'ha-nthlei**: Deep One city, alien architecture, breeding pits, temple district
**The Lighthouse**: Abandoned, contains forbidden library, sanity-damaging texts
**R'lyeh Fragment**: Piece of ancient city phased into reality, non-euclidean nightmare
**Dagon's Prison**: Deepest trench, where god sleeps, reality thin, madness inevitable

## Unique Mechanics

**Sanity System**
- Track sanity points (starts at 100)
- Witnessing horror causes sanity damage
- Below 75: Minor quirks and nightmares
- Below 50: Temporary madness, disadvantage on certain checks
- Below 25: Permanent madness, altered perception
- 0: Character lost to madness, becomes NPC

**Corruption Transformation**
- Exposure to Deep One influence causes physical changes
- Stage 1: Scales, webbed fingers, improved swimming
- Stage 2: Gills, fish-like eyes, water-breathing
- Stage 3: Fully hybrid, torn between worlds
- Stage 4: Full Deep One transformation, lose character
- Can be slowed but not fully stopped

**Forbidden Knowledge**
- Learning cosmic truths grants power but damages sanity
- New spells/abilities unlocked through madness
- Trade: Become more effective but less human
- Some truths are mandatory for stopping Dagon

**Non-Euclidean Navigation**
- In alien spaces, normal direction doesn't apply
- Puzzles where geometry is wrong
- Sanity checks to perceive true layout
- Risk of becoming permanently lost

**The Deep's Call**
- Ocean constantly whispers to party
- Long rest near water requires Will saves
- Failure: Compelled to enter water, walk toward deep
- Increases as campaign progresses

## Plot Twists

1. **Party Member's Lineage**: One PC has Innsmouth ancestry, will transform
2. **Professor's Madness**: Ally has been corrupted, information unreliable
3. **The Seals' Purpose**: Seals don't imprison Dagon—they prevent reality merger, breaking them dooms all
4. **Dagon's Lie**: Great Old One isn't evil, but completely amoral—doesn't hate humanity, simply doesn't notice our existence matters
5. **The True Enemy**: Dagon isn't waking voluntarily—something worse is pushing him into reality
6. **No Victory**: Stopping ritual doesn't kill Dagon, only delays—he'll wake eventually
7. **Government Knows**: Authorities aware of Deep Ones, allow Innsmouth to exist as containment
8. **You've Already Failed**: Final revelation that party's investigation accelerated the awakening

## Victory Conditions

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Stop awakening but at terrible cost—party members dead, insane, or transformed; Innsmouth destroyed; truths learned that haunt forever

**Sealed Away**: Re-imprison Dagon for another century; cultists destroyed; Deep Ones retreat; but knowledge remains

**Enlightenment Ending**: Embrace cosmic truth, join with Deep Ones; transcend humanity; horror ending where party becomes antagonists

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Madness**: All party members lose sanity, become cultists or catatonic
**Dagon Rises**: Ritual completes, god awakens, reality merges with Far Realm, apocalypse
**Lost in R'lyeh**: Party trapped in non-euclidean space, driven mad, never escape
**Transformation**: All become Deep Ones, lose themselves to the ocean's call
