# The Endless Theater
*Life is a Play Within a Play Within a Play*

## Campaign Overview

The party is hired to perform in an experimental theatrical production at the Grand Simulacrum Theater—a massive structure where reality and performance blur. The director, the enigmatic Caden Cotard, promises this will be the most important work of their lives. But as rehearsals continue, boundaries dissolve: where does the play end and life begin? Is their investigation of strange occurrences at the theater part of the performance or genuine crisis? Are they actors playing investigators, or investigators trapped in someone else's performance?

The theater grows larger inside than outside. New sets appear reflecting party members' lives. Actors playing them perform their memories. The director insists all of life is performance, that authenticity itself is the greatest role. Eventually they discover the truth: they've been inside the theater for years. What they remember as "real life" was just earlier acts of this eternal play. There is no outside. There has never been an outside. The only question is: Do you keep performing, or do you exit the stage?

## Core Themes

- **Life as Performance**: Everything is theater, even authenticity
- **Art Imitating Life Imitating Art**: Infinite recursive mirrors
- **The Director and the Directed**: Who controls your story?
- **Meaning Through Narrative**: Does structure give life significance?
- **The Fear of Ending**: What happens when the play concludes?

## Session Breakdown (29 Sessions)

### Act 1: Rehearsal (Sessions 1-6)
Party cast in experimental production. Odd occurrences—sets too accurate, other actors know things they shouldn't. Director cryptic about play's subject. "You're not playing characters. You're playing yourselves."

### Act 2: Performance Begins (Sessions 7-12)
Opening night but it never ends. Wake up to more rehearsal. Theater geography impossible—rooms from their past appearing. Realize they've been here longer than remember. Outside seems distant, maybe fictional.

### Act 3: The Play Within (Sessions 13-18)
Discover other actors are performing play-within-play of party's investigation. Performance of their performances. Infinite regression. Which level is real? Beginning to suspect none are.

### Act 4: The Director's Vision (Sessions 19-24)
Caden reveals truth: He's creating life-sized replica of entire world inside theater. Every person must be cast and performed. It's impossible, but he's trying anyway. The party's role is to help him understand how to perform authentic living. Their lives are research.

### Act 5: The Final Performance (Sessions 25-29)
Choice: Embrace theater-life (existence as eternal performance), escape theater (if outside even exists), become directors (take control of own narrative), or end play (accept conclusion, whatever that means). Final sessions are simultaneously performance and resolution—unable to distinguish.

## Key NPCs

### Caden Cotard (The Director)
Obsessive auteur creating life-replica in theater form. Believes theater is more real than life—at least performance admits its artifice. Wants to understand authentic existence by performing it perfectly. Sympathetic in desperation, monstrous in methods. Doesn't understand he's imprisoning people, sees it as collaboration.

### Millicent Weems (The Stage Manager)
Keeps theater running. Knows all secrets, never tells. Possibly most powerful person here—director directs, but stage manager makes it happen. May help party escape or may ensure play continues. Ambiguous loyalty.

### Your Understudies
Actors cast to replace party when tired. Learning your mannerisms, memories, relationships. Performing you so accurately that differences become invisible. Question: When they perform you perfectly, are they still acting?

### The Original Cast
Others trapped here longer. Some still resist, some accepted theater-life, some forgot there was ever outside. Various stages of integration into production. Show party's possible futures.

### The Audience
Do they exist? Sometimes party sees them watching from darkness. Sometimes seats are empty. Sometimes party IS audience watching themselves perform. The gaze that gives performance meaning—or creates it.

### Your Past Self
In play-within-play, actor performing you in earlier session. Talk to them. They're performing your memories. Do they know something you've forgotten? Are your memories also performance?

## Major Locations

### The Grand Simulacrum Theater
Impossible building. Larger inside than outside (much larger). Contains full-scale sets of everywhere party has been. New sets appear overnight. Eventually contains the world—or their memory of it.

### The Main Stage
Where "official" performance happens. When here, party knows they're performing. Or do they? Sometimes forget they're on stage until audience applauds.

### The Rehearsal Spaces
Infinite rooms practicing infinite scenes. Every possible version of every moment. Somewhere in these rooms, every choice is being rehearsed.

### The Set Design Workshop
Where world is built. Artists constructing party's memories in wood and paint. Impossibly accurate. How do they know? Director says he told them. He doesn't remember their lives—they're helping him remember.

### The Understudies' Rooms
Where actors playing party live. Studying photographs, journals, recordings of party members. Becoming them. Visit and watch yourself being learned.

### The Archives
Scripts of everything party has done. But also everything they might do. Possible futures written out. Are they predictions or instructions? If you read your script, does that change it or fulfill it?

### The Exit (Maybe)
Door marked EXIT. Locked. Unlocked. Doesn't exist. Leads outside. Leads to another theater. Leads to a brick wall. Depends when you try it. Millicent has key. Or claims to.

## Unique Mechanics

### Performance Level
Track immersion in theater (0-100):
- Low: Aware you're performing, maintain distinction
- Medium: Sometimes forget, slip into role
- High: Life and performance indistinguishable
- 100: You've become the character. Or were you always?

### Script Knowledge
Finding future scripts:
- Advantage: Know what's coming, can prepare
- Disadvantage: Hard to act against what's written
- Paradox: Does reading it make it happen or prevent it?
- Meta: Are you following script or creating it?

### The Director's Attention
When Caden watches:
- Everything feels more meaningful
- Actions become performance
- Authenticity becomes impossible
- But also: Protection from theater's dangers
- The artist's gaze that creates and constrains

### Audience Engagement
When audience present:
- Performance improves (mechanical bonus)
- But less control (doing what entertains)
- Feedback shapes behavior
- Question: Are you playing to them or for yourself?

## Plot Twists

1. **You Auditioned For This**: Recovered memory—you chose to join this production, knowing it was forever
2. **The Outside is the Theater**: Escape to find outside world is also stage. Theater is infinite
3. **Caden is a Role**: The director is himself being directed by someone else. It's directors all the way up
4. **You Are the Understudy**: You didn't join production—you replaced original party member and forgot
5. **The Play is Real Life**: What if theater is authentic and "real life" was the performance?
6. **Everyone Else is Actor**: Only party members are real. Everyone they ever knew was cast for this

## Victory Conditions

### Escape Victory
Find way out of theater to genuine outside. Free yourself from eternal performance. But what if outside is just bigger theater?

### Director Victory
Overthrow Caden, become directors of own story. Take control of narrative. But does controlling story make you less genuine?

### Integration Victory
Accept theater-life. Embrace performance as valid existence. Be in play willingly. Is it prison if you want to stay?

### Ending Victory
Bring play to conclusion. Let story finish. Face what comes after final curtain. Maybe nothing. Maybe that's okay.

## Defeat Conditions

### Total Integration
Forget you ever existed before theater. Become pure performance. Happy but hollow.

### Recursive Collapse
Discover you're in play within play within play infinitely. No bottom. No real you. Existential vertigo.

### Permanent Casting
Replaced by understudy. Watch yourself be performed while you fade. Become audience to own life.

### The Show Must Go On
Play never ends. Eternal performance with no conclusion. Immortality as imprisonment.
