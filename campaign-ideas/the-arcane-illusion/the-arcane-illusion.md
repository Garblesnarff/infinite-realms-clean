## Central Conflict

This campaign explores using spectacular performance and magical abilities for Robin Hood-style social justice through impossible heists. The central conflict is the crew's escalating spectacles that simultaneously entertain the public, baffle investigators, and redistribute wealth from corrupt elites to their victims. Players must balance the theatrical need for spectacular performances with the practical need for successful crimes, all while staying ahead of an investigator who represents the law but understands their cause. The campaign asks: Is theft justified when it punishes corruption? Can magic be used for social justice? What's the line between heroic performance and criminal deception? And how do you create lasting change through spectacular temporary acts? The answer: you make people believe in magic—and in the possibility that wrongs can be righted.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Performance-Heist Integration**
*   Each heist is designed as a spectacular magical performance where the crime happens hidden within the show.
*   Players design both the entertainment value (for public acclaim) and the criminal execution (for actual success).
*   Success requires balancing spectacular illusion with practical theft.

### 2. **Misdirection System**
*   Players can layer multiple deceptions—what the audience sees, what investigators think happened, and what actually occurred.
*   Perfect misdirection allows impossible crimes in plain sight.
*   The system rewards creativity and theatrical flair.

### 3. **The Eye's Tests**
*   Each heist serves as both crime and test of the crew's worthiness for the ancient order.
*   The Eye evaluates not just success but methods, motives, and magical creativity.
*   Passing tests reveals more about the order's history and purpose.

### 4. **Public Acclaim Tracker**
*   Shows how the public views the crew: heroes, criminals, or mythical figures.
*   High acclaim provides advantages (public cooperation, folk hero status) but increases investigator pressure.
*   The crew can manipulate their public image through how they perform and redistribute stolen wealth.

### 5. **Magical Synergy**
*   Different players' magical specialties combine for spectacular impossible effects.
*   Coordinated magical performances create effects no single mage could achieve.
*   Emphasizes teamwork through magical choreography.
