# Fires of the Deep - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Volcanic Disaster Cinema** - Emphasis on fire, lava, ash, and smoke. Color palette: Volcanic red/orange, ash grey, smoke black, desperate blue sky disappearing. Beautiful danger—lava flows are gorgeous and deadly. Pompeii aesthetic for buried cities.

## Color Palettes
- **Pre-Eruption**: Warm earth tones, mining town browns, mountain greens
- **Eruption**: Hellish reds, lava orange, ash black, pyroclastic grey
- **Aftermath**: Ash grey everywhere, muted colors, volcanic winter blues
- **Elemental Plane**: Pure fire colors, obsidian black, magma gold
- **Phoenix**: Impossible fire colors, white-hot, reality-burning

## Music and Sound Design
**Main Theme**: "Mountain's Fury" - Rumbling bass building to explosive crescendo, sounds of erupting volcano as instrumentation. **Location Themes**: Emberfall (mournful strings over crackling fire), Volcanic Chain (ominous drums), Fire Plane (alien fire-sounds as music), Phoenix Chamber (primordial power, overwhelming). **Voice Direction**: Dr. Stoneheart (urgent scientist, haunted), Pyralis (serene fanatic, fire-crackle voice), Ash Phoenix (roaring flames speaking words).

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 2**: Pyroclastic flow racing down mountain, civilians running, camera from above showing futility
- **Session 22**: First sight of Ash Phoenix forming—miles-wide firebird emerging from magma
- **Session 34**: Phoenix fully manifested, reality burning, party must choose
