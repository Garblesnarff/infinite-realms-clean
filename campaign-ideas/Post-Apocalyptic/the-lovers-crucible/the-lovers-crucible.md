# The Lovers' Crucible
## "Every Choice Divides Reality, Every Love Unites It"

### Campaign Overview

The Garden of Choices exists in perpetual romantic evening light, where the Angel of Union presides over souls making defining decisions. Here, every significant choice doesn't eliminate possibilities—it splits reality. Choose passion over duty? Both realities exist. Choose one partner over another? Both timelines continue. The party arrives seeking to reunite the Divided Lovers, two souls who chose differently and became trapped in separate but parallel realities, able to see each other but never touch.

But the Garden is fracturing. Too many splits. Too many choices creating too many parallel paths. Reality cannot sustain infinite division. The Angel of Union has gone silent, exhausted from trying to maintain all timelines. Someone must collapse the possibilities back into singular truth, but doing so will destroy all the "wrong" choices and everyone living in those branches. The party must decide which realities deserve to exist, make impossible choices about who gets to be real, and ultimately face their own defining moment: Which version of themselves will they choose to be?

This campaign explores love, choice, duality, and the roads not taken. Every session, choices split reality further. Every decision matters. Every path not chosen still exists somewhere. And in the end, the party must choose between unity and possibility, love and freedom, making one timeline real or letting all timelines end.
