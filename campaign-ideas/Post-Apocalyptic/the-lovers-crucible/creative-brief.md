# The Lovers' Crucible - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
- Romantic evening light permanently, golden hour forever
- Diverging paths everywhere, visual choice
- The Angel: Wings spread wide, exhausted posture, holding too much
- Divided Lovers: Visible to each other across timeline barrier, reaching, never touching
- Alternate selves: Slightly different appearances, uncanny valley effect
- Reality fractures: Visible cracks showing other timelines bleeding through

## Music and Sound
- Romantic but melancholy, love theme with longing
- Split harmonies: Same melody in two different keys simultaneously
- Unity moments: Harmonies resolve perfectly
- Reality bleed: Musical tracks from different timelines overlapping
- Choice moments: Silence, then divergence into two different themes

## Voice Acting
- **Divided Lovers**: Same actors doing slight variations, harmonizing when they speak together across timelines
- **Angel of Union**: Exhausted divinity, weight in every word, "I cannot hold much longer"
- **Alternate Selves**: Party members voicing their own variations, subtle differences
- **The Infinite**: Many voices speaking at once, all the same person, overwhelming

## Taglines
