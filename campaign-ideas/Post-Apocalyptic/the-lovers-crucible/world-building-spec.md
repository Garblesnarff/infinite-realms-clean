# The Lovers' Crucible - World-Building Specification

## How Choice Works Here

Major choices don't eliminate possibilities—they split reality into parallel timelines where all outcomes exist. The Garden of Choices is the nexus maintaining these branching paths. Every significant decision creates new world-branches.

## The Divided Lovers' Story

Once one soul, deeply in love. Faced choice: Follow passion (leave everything for love) or follow duty (let love go for greater good). Could not choose. The Garden split them into both realities. Now one Lover lives in passion-timeline, one in duty-timeline. They can see each other across the barrier but never touch. Both timelines are real. Both Lovers exist. Neither is complete.

## The Angel's Burden

The Angel of Union tries to maintain all timelines simultaneously, ensuring every choice remains valid. But there are too many. Too many choices, too many splits, too many parallel realities. The Angel is failing. When it fails, all timelines collapse randomly, destroying most of them.

## Timeline Mechanics

Timelines branch at major choices but can reconverge if people in both make the same subsequent choice. This is rare. Most timelines drift apart increasingly. The Garden tries to keep them close enough to potentially reunite. It's losing.

## The Unity Philosophy

True commitment means choosing one path and letting others go. Living fully in one timeline rather than half-living in many. The pain of roads not taken is necessary cost of depth in the road taken. You cannot dance at two weddings with one body.

## The Division Philosophy

All possibilities have value. Choosing eliminates potential. Better to live in quantum superposition, experiencing all paths, than to collapse into one narrow reality. Commitment is limitation. Freedom requires keeping all options open.

## The True Problem

Neither philosophy is completely right. Pure division creates the Infinite—fractured into so many versions they're barely conscious. Pure unity creates the Commitment—powerful but potentially wrong; what if you chose badly? The Garden seeks balance: Choose decisively but wisely, then honor that choice by living it fully.

## The Collapse

When timelines collapse, people living in "non-real" branches cease to exist. They were real while their timeline was real. But when reality consolidates, only one version survives. The others aren't dead—they never-were. Ontological erasure.

## Alternate Self Dynamics

Meeting your alternate selves is disturbing. They're you but made different choices. Some better off, some worse. All convinced they're the "real" you. If timelines collapse, only one survives. They all want it to be them.

## The Choice Merchant's Secret

Buys alternate timeline versions from people who want to consolidate. Collects them in a workshop. Attempting to create composite being from best parts of different choices. It's working but creating something inhuman—optimized but not coherent.

## The Commitment's Doubt

Chose decisively, lives fully in singular timeline. Happy, powerful, focused. But haunted by alternate selves in dreams. Did choose correctly? Is certainty worth the cost of possibility? Wonders but can't undo.

## The Infinite's Warning

Refused to ever choose definitively. Lives all possibilities simultaneously. Technically immortal across infinite timelines. Practically insane from fractured consciousness. Sees all outcomes, chooses none, exists in all, lives in none.

## Mysteries

- Do alternate timeline selves have souls?
- Is the "original" you more real than choice-created splits?
- Can you choose wrong if all choices are real somewhere?
- What if the Lovers actually chose correctly by splitting?
- Is commitment wisdom or just fear of possibility?
