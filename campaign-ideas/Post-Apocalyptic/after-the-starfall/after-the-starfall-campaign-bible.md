# Campaign Bible: After the Starfall - Embers of Hope

## Section 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Shattering of the Celestial Cage
Before the Starfall, the world was mundane, governed by rigid physics and devoid of magic. The "Stars" that fell were not celestial bodies, but the crystalline shards of the **Aetheric Cage**—a metaphysical barrier that had separated the Material Plane from the chaotic, creative energies of the Primordial Dream. When the Cage shattered five years ago, it didn't just impact the ground; it impacted reality. The shards, known as "Star-Shards," are solidified potentiality. Where they landed, physics became a suggestion. The corruption is not decay, but aggressive, unchecked evolution trying to rewrite the world into a dreamscape.

### Timeline of the New Era
1.  **Year 0 - The Night of Glass Rain:** The Cage shatters. Millions of glowing shards bombard the planet. The sky turns a violent violet for 72 hours.
2.  **Year 0 - The Great Silencing:** For one week after impact, no sound could be produced globally. Humanity communicated solely through writing and gesture.
3.  **Year 1 - The First Bloom:** The Impact Crater's radiation creates the Crystal Forest. The first "Crystal-Husk" zombies rise, not dead, but animated by aggressive mineral growth.
4.  **Year 1 - The Separation of Shadows:** In the Western Hemisphere, shadows detached from their owners for three days, acting out suppressed desires before reattaching. (Surreal Event)
5.  **Year 2 - The Rise of New Haven:** Captain Marcus Kane rallies survivors at an old stadium, establishing the first true defensive perimeter.
6.  **Year 2 - The Rain of Teeth:** A localized storm over the ruins of Metro-City drops millions of human teeth instead of water. Cults harvest them for divination. (Surreal Event)
7.  **Year 3 - Dr. Voss’s Broadcast:** A repeating radio signal confirms the Starfall was artificial. The signal loops for 4 months then abruptly cuts to static.
8.  **Year 4 - The Walking Mountain:** Mount Silas, infused with a massive Star-Shard, stood up, walked ten miles south, and sat back down, crushing two bandit clans. (Surreal Event)
9.  **Year 4 - The Formation of the Rebuilders:** The Alliance formally codifies the "Hope Protocols," establishing a currency based on labor and seeds.
10. **Year 5 (Present) - The Pulse:** Seismographs pick up a rhythmic "heartbeat" from the Impact Crater. The frequency matches that of a human heart, but amplified a billion times.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Conflict
The Starfall was a reset button pressed by the planet itself (or an entity within it) to escape a "stagnant timeline." The conflict is now between **Stasis** (the laws of the old world, represented by crumbling concrete and gravity) and **Flux** (the new magic, represented by mutation and crystal). The players are the fulcrum: they decide if the new world will be a chaotic dream or a stabilized paradise.

### 1. The Corruption Exposure Track
Characters have a **Corruption Score (0-10)**.
*   **Gain Corruption:** Walking in the Crater, eating mutant food, using Star-Shards.
*   **Effects:**
    *   **Tier 1 (1-3):** Visual mark (glowing eyes, skin patches). Gain Darkvision or +5 Speed.
    *   **Tier 2 (4-7):** Physical Mutation. Gain a Feat (e.g., Telepathy, Claws), but -2 Charisma.
    *   **Tier 3 (8-9):** Unstable. Roll Wild Magic on every spell cast/crit fail.
    *   **Tier 4 (10):** Total Transformation. Character becomes an NPC Monster.
*   **Reduction:** Rare medicines (Sun-Berries) or magical cleansing.

### 2. Settlement Management (Hope Economy)
*   **Hope Points (HP):** Collective currency.
*   **Gain HP:** Completing quests, saving survivors, building structures.
*   **Spend HP:**
    *   10 HP: Build a Wall (Defense +1).
    *   20 HP: Build a Clinic (Heals injuries for free).
    *   50 HP: Festival (Removes 1 Corruption from everyone).
*   **Consequence:** If HP drops to 0, the settlement riots or dissolves.

### 3. Scavenging System
Instead of gold, players find **"Scrap"** and **"Tech"**.
*   **10 Scrap** = 1 Ration.
*   **50 Scrap** = 1 Common Item.
*   **1 Tech** = Magic Item Component.
*   **Check:** INT (Investigation). Success = Roll on Loot Table. Fail = Encounter or Injury.
