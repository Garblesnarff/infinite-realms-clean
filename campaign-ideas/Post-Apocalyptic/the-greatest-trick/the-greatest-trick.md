**Campaign Type / Genre:** Mystery Thriller / Unreliable Narrator / Criminal Investigation
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 7-9 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **8**

The players are survivors of a heist gone catastrophically wrong, captured by investigators and interrogated about their mysterious employer known only as "the Archmage"—a legendary criminal mastermind who may or may not exist. As each player recounts the events that led to disaster, their stories contradict and overlap in strange ways, revealing that someone in the group has been lying all along. The investigation becomes a battle of wits as players realize one of them might actually be the Archmage, orchestrating everything from within. The greatest trick this devil ever pulled was convincing everyone—including the players—that they were just another crew member.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of truth when filtered through deception, unreliable narration, and hidden identity. The central conflict revolves around uncovering who the Archmage really is while navigating contradictory accounts, deliberate lies, and the possibility that one of the players themselves is the mastermind. Players must balance cooperation (to survive the interrogation) with suspicion (knowing one of them is lying). The campaign asks: How do you find truth when everyone is lying? Can you trust your own memories and perceptions? And what happens when the greatest deceiver is the one you least suspect? The title says it all: the greatest trick this devil ever pulled was convincing everyone they didn't exist—or that they were someone else entirely.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Unreliable Narrator System**
*   Different players narrate different flashback scenes, with creative control over certain details.
*   Players can contradict each other's versions, creating mysteries about what really happened.
*   The DM tracks what actually occurred versus what each player claims or remembers.

### 2. **The Suspicion Tracker**
*   Each player has a suspicion level based on inconsistencies in their story and suspicious knowledge.
*   High suspicion attracts investigator attention and makes other players wary.
*   The player with the highest suspicion at key moments faces increased pressure and consequences.

### 3. **Flashback Authority**
*   When narrating a flashback, a player can establish facts about the scene, but other players can challenge them.
*   Challenges are resolved through contested rolls or DM arbitration about what's plausible.
*   Creates a collaborative storytelling experience where truth is negotiated rather than fixed.

### 4. **The Identity Reveal Protocol**
*   One player (determined secretly by DM at campaign start or volunteered) actually is the Archmage.
*   That player has secret objectives and hidden information throughout the campaign.
*   Alternatively, the Archmage can be an NPC all along, with players working together to uncover the truth.
*   The campaign works either way, with the reveal reshaping all previous events.
