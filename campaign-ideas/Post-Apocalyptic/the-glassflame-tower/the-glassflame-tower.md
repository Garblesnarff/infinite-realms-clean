**Campaign Type / Genre:** Action / Survival / Heist
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **9–10**
**Tone (keywords):** tense, improvisation, trapped, outnumbered, resourceful, explosive
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
During a lavish gala at the luxurious Glassflame Tower—a 40-story magical skyscraper owned by a wealthy merchant lord—the party finds themselves trapped when the Crimson Hand mercenary company seizes the building. Led by the brilliant tactician Vorak Ironscale, the mercenaries have come for the ancient vault hidden in the tower's depths, and they've taken the gala's attendees hostage. Separated from their gear and outnumbered twenty-to-one, the party must use cunning, improvisation, and the tower's own magical infrastructure against the mercenaries to save the hostages and stop the heist before the tower's magical core explodes.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Resource Scarcity:** The party starts without most of their equipment and must improvise weapons, tools, and solutions from what they find in the tower.
*   **Overwhelming Odds:** The mercenaries outnumber the party significantly, making direct confrontation deadly. Stealth and tactics are essential.
*   **Time Pressure:** Multiple ticking clocks create urgency: hostages in danger, the vault being cracked, and the tower's destabilizing magical infrastructure.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** The tower itself becomes a deadly maze of traps, magical wards, and structural instability as the conflict escalates.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc that escalates from survival to action to explosive finale.

*   **Act I — Trapped and Outgunned (Sessions 1–2):** The gala is interrupted by the mercenary takeover. The party escapes the initial roundup, loses their equipment, and must navigate the occupied tower while learning the mercenaries' plan. They make contact with surviving staff and begin their improvised resistance.
*   **Act II — Fighting Back (Sessions 3–5):** The party executes daring guerrilla attacks, rescuing hostages, sabotaging mercenary operations, and slowly recovering resources. They discover Vorak's true target: the Shard of Eternity in the tower's vault, and that his cracking attempts are destabilizing the tower's magical foundation.
*   **Act III — The Final Stand (Sessions 6–8):** With the vault breached and the tower's core reaching critical instability, the party must stop Vorak from escaping with the Shard while evacuating remaining hostages. The climax involves a desperate race against time as floors collapse and magical energy tears through the building.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is about asymmetric warfare and resourcefulness. The party is outgunned, outmanned, and trapped, but they have advantages: knowledge of the terrain, ability to use the environment, and most importantly, the willingness to do whatever it takes. It's about turning disadvantages into advantages and proving that heroism isn't about having the best equipment—it's about having the will to fight back against impossible odds.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Improvised Equipment System**

*   The party starts with minimal gear and must craft improvised weapons and tools from materials found in the tower.
*   **Examples:** Using tower defense systems as weapons, creating explosives from maintenance chemicals, fashioning weapons from furniture and magical components.
*   **Mechanics:** Allow creative use of skills like Tinker's Tools, Arcana, and Investigation to create temporary but effective solutions.

### 2. **Tower Control System**

*   With access to the security center, the party can manipulate the tower's magical infrastructure.
*   **Options:** Lock/unlock doors remotely, activate fire suppression systems, trigger alarms, monitor enemy positions via scrying sensors, control elevators.
*   **Cost:** Each use might alert enemies to the party's location or draw power from the destabilizing core.

### 3. **Structural Instability Escalation**

*   Track the tower's stability from 10 (fully stable) to 0 (complete collapse).
*   **Triggers:** Each time the mercenaries damage the vault, use explosive magic, or the party causes major destruction, reduce stability.
*   **Effects:** At different thresholds, introduce new hazards: tremors, magical surges, collapsing floors, wild magic zones.
*   **Urgency:** When stability reaches 3 or below, start a countdown to complete collapse.

### 4. **Guerrilla Tactics**

*   Reward creative ambush tactics, hit-and-run strikes, and environmental combat.
*   **Advantage:** The party should almost always have advantage when attacking from surprise or from a prepared position.
*   **Consequence:** Direct confrontation with multiple enemies should be nearly suicidal, encouraging smart tactics over brute force.
