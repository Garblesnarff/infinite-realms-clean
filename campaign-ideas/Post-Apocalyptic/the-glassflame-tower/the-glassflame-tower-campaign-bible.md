# The Glassflame Tower [CAMPAIGN: Post-Apocalyptic]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
Centuries after the "Great Confluence" – a cataclysmic event that fused the very fabric of magic and technology – the world is a shattered, wondrous, and terrifying place. Landscapes are warped by crystalline growths, and the air crackles with residual arcane energy. Dominating the horizon is the enigmatic Glassflame Tower, a colossal structure of fused glass and metal that perpetually burns with an inner, magical fire. It is a beacon of power, a source of strange artifacts, and a magnet for those seeking to understand or exploit the new reality. The players are survivors navigating this warped world, drawn to the Tower's mysteries, its dangers, and the promise of unimaginable power.

## Setting [SETTING: Magic-Tech Wasteland]
The world is a surreal blend of shattered modernity and raw, untamed magic. Roads are cracked and overgrown with glowing flora, while skeletal remains of cities are encrusted with crystalline formations that hum with latent energy. The sky often displays aurora-like phenomena, and weather patterns are unpredictable, sometimes manifesting as localized arcane storms. The Glassflame Tower itself is a central landmark, its base surrounded by a chaotic "Scrap-Field" of fused debris, and its upper reaches shrouded in mystery and dangerous energy.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Scrap-Field:** [LOCATION: Junkyard] The vast, dangerous area surrounding the base of the Glassflame Tower, composed of fused pre-Confluence technology and crystalline growths. It's a rich source of salvage but also home to unstable energy pockets and mutated constructs.
*   **The Shimmering Wastes:** [LOCATION: Desert] Expanses of desert where the sand has been transmuted into fine, glittering glass shards. Travel is difficult, and mirages are common, often manifesting as visions of the pre-Confluence world.
*   **The Crystal Caves:** [LOCATION: Caverns] Natural cave systems where the Confluence's energy has caused massive, intricate crystal formations to grow, some of which possess unique magical properties or house strange, elemental creatures.
*   **The Arcane Outpost:** [LOCATION: Settlement] A small, fortified settlement built into the ruins of an old research facility, dedicated to studying the Confluence and the Tower. It's a hub for scholars and those seeking to understand the new physics.
*   **The Glassflame Tower (Lower Levels):** [LOCATION: Dungeon] The accessible lower levels of the Tower, a maze of fused corridors, glowing conduits, and automated defenses that have been warped by magic. It's a dangerous place, but holds valuable artifacts and clues.

## Factions [FACTION: Ideological]
*   **The Technomancers:** [FACTION: Scientific] A faction dedicated to understanding and mastering the fusion of magic and technology. They seek to reverse-engineer pre-Confluence tech using arcane principles and develop new, powerful magi-tech devices.
*   **The Arcane Purists:** [FACTION: Traditionalist] Believing the Confluence was a perversion, they seek to separate magic from technology, often attempting to "cleanse" areas of magi-tech influence. They are wary of the Tower's power.
*   **The Glass Cult:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A zealous group who worship the Glassflame Tower as a divine entity, believing it holds the key to humanity's ascension. They seek to enter its highest levels, often sacrificing themselves in the process.
*   **The Scavenger Guilds:** [FACTION: Economic] Loose confederations of independent scavengers and traders who brave the wastes for salvage. They are pragmatic and opportunistic, often caught between the ideological factions.
*   **The Confluence Born:** [FACTION: Mutated] Individuals and creatures whose bodies have been fundamentally altered by the Confluence, granting them strange powers but often ostracizing them from "pure" humanity.

## NPCs [NPC: Key]
