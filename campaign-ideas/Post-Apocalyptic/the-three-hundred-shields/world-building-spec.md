**Diversity:** Army includes Medes, Persians, Egyptians, Indians, Ethiopians, Scythians. Dozens of cultures.

## The Battle of Thermopylae (Historical)

**Strategic Importance:**
- Narrow pass: only route for Persian army to reach southern Greece
- 15 meters wide at narrowest
- Mountain on one side, sea on other
- Allows small force to hold large force

**The Forces:**
- **Greek:** 300 Spartans + 700 Thespians + 400 Thebans + others ≈ 7,000 total
- **Persian:** Modern estimates ~100,000-300,000 (ancient sources claimed millions)

**Duration:** Three days
- Days 1-2: Persians attack, shattered by phalanx
- Day 3: Betrayal reveals mountain path, Greeks surrounded

**The Phocian Wall:** Ancient wall rebuilt by Greeks, defensive position

**The Outcome:**
- All Spartans died (except wounded sent away)
- Thespians died to last man (often forgotten heroes)
- Thebans surrendered (historical dispute)
- Persians suffered ~20,000 casualties
- Greece bought time to prepare

## Spartan Military Tactics

**The Phalanx:**
- 8 rows deep
- Shields overlap (wall of bronze)
- Long spears (7-9 feet) project forward
- Back rows push forward
- Unbreakable formation
- Perfect coordination from agoge training

**Equipment:**
- **Aspis:** Round shield (3 feet diameter, 15-20 pounds)
- **Dory:** Spear (7-9 feet)
- **Xiphos:** Short sword (backup weapon)
- **Helmet:** Corinthian style (limited vision, iconic)
- **Cuirass:** Bronze breastplate
- **Greaves:** Bronze shin guards

**Training:** Lifetime of practice
- Can maintain formation in any terrain
- Synchronized like machine
- Shield protects man to your left (trust essential)
- Break formation = death

## Greek Politics (480 BCE)

**The Greek League:**
- Sparta: Military power
- Athens: Naval power
- Corinth: Economic power
- Other city-states: Various contributions

**Traditional Rivals:** Greeks constantly fight each other. Persian invasion unites them (temporarily).

**The Carneia:** Spartan religious festival forbidding full military deployment. Why Leonidas took only 300.

**The Olympics:** Being held during Persian invasion. Some city-states more concerned with games than war.

## The Oracle of Delphi

**Prophecy:** "Either Sparta falls, or one of her kings must die."

**Corruption:** Historical evidence suggests Ephors were bribed by Persians, influenced Oracle's advice.

**Leonidas's Choice:** Interpreted prophecy as requiring his death to save Sparta.

## The Greco-Persian Wars Context

**First Invasion (490 BCE):** Marathon
- Athenians defeated Persians
- Runner Pheidippides died bringing news (origin of marathon)

**Ten Year Gap:** Xerxes prepared massive second invasion

**After Thermopylae:**
- **Artemisium:** Naval battle (draw)
- **Athens Burned:** City evacuated first
- **Salamis (480 BCE):** Greek naval victory
- **Plataea (479 BCE):** Greek land victory, war won

## The 300 Selection

**Criteria:**
- Must have living sons (bloodline continues)
- Must be full Spartiate
- Among the best warriors (all Spartans elite)
- Volunteers knowing mission is suicide

**Why Only 300:**
- Carneia festival forbade full mobilization
- Leonidas's bodyguard (Hippeis)
- Token force to hold until reinforcements arrive
- Politically: show Sparta leads while not committing full army

## Thermopylae's Importance

**Strategic:** Bought time for:
- Athens to evacuate
- Greek fleet to gather
- Defensive strategies to form
- Coalition to solidify

**Morale:** Showed Persians could be beaten. Destroyed myth of Persian invincibility.

**Political:** Shamed other city-states into fighting. Can't let Sparta's sacrifice be meaningless.

**Cultural:** Created legendary example of courage and sacrifice. Inspired Western civilization for millennia.

## The Monument

**Inscription (Simonides):**
"Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by,
That here obedient to their laws we lie."

**Translation Notes:**
- "Obedient to their laws" = following orders/duty
- Not glorifying war, stating fact
- Spartan values in 2 lines: duty, law, understatement

## Cultural Clash

**Spartan Values:**
- Austerity (laconic speech, simple life)
- Equality among citizens (poverty, sacrifice shared)
- Duty over life
- Law is absolute
- Honor through deeds, not words

**Persian Values:**
- Display of wealth
- Hierarchy and submission
- Individual glory
- Imperial law
- Honor through dominance

**Incomprehension:** Xerxes cannot understand warriors who choose death over submission. Spartans cannot understand submission to mortal king.

## Historical vs. Mythic

**Historical Reality:**
- 7,000 Greeks total (not just 300)
- Persians numbered tens/hundreds of thousands (not millions)
- Persians used tactics, not just waves of bodies
- Betrayal was real (Ephialtes historical figure)

**Mythic Version:**
- 300 stand alone
- Millions of Persians
- Supernatural elements (gods watching, etc.)
- Heightened heroics

**Campaign Uses Both:** Historical tactics and logistics, mythic heroism and glory. Best of both.

## The Philosophy

**Question:** Why fight when death is certain?

**Spartan Answer:**
- Duty demands it
- Law requires it
- Glory justifies it
- Alternative (surrender/flight) is worse than death
- Your death protects others
- Honor outlives life

**Western Civilization Impact:** Thermopylae became symbol of free men fighting tyranny. Resonates through ages.

The campaign asks: **What's worth dying for? Can you serve something greater than yourself?**

Spartan answer: Yes. Country, law, duty, honor, brotherhood. These transcend individual survival. The 300 died and became immortal. They lost and won. Paradox of glorious defeat.
