# The Three Hundred Shields
**Tagline:** *When Persia brings a million men, Sparta sends three hundred—and the world watches*

## Campaign Overview

480 BCE: The Persian Empire, having conquered most of the known world, now turns its attention to Greece. King Xerxes leads the largest army ever assembled—over a million soldiers, thousands of ships, and the divine mandate of conquest. Standing against this apocalyptic force is the party: members of Sparta's elite 300, led by King Leonidas, chosen to defend the narrow pass at Thermopylae while Greece mobilizes.

This campaign combines historical military tactics with mythic heroism. The party knows they're doomed—the mission is not victory but buying time through glorious sacrifice. Political intrigue at home, elite warrior training, bonds of brotherhood, tactical defense against overwhelming odds, and ultimately choosing how to face certain death. This is 300: sparta-focused, honor-bound, and magnificent in its doomed defiance.

## Core Themes

- **The Sacrifice:** Knowing death is certain, choosing glory over survival
- **Sparta vs. the World:** Elite culture that produces ultimate warriors
- **Brotherhood:** The agoge creates unbreakable bonds
- **Duty Over Life:** The individual exists to serve Sparta
- **Against Impossible Odds:** 300 vs. millions
- **Historical Impact:** Buying time for Greece's survival

## Session Breakdown (20 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Spartan Way (Sessions 1-4)
**Session 1:** The party's childhood in the agoge (Spartan military training). Flashbacks showing brutal education, forming shield-brother bonds, becoming elite warriors. Establishing characters and relationships.

**Session 2:** Current day: Oracle consulted about Persian invasion. Cryptic prophecy: "Either Sparta falls, or a Spartan king must die." The Carneia (festival) forbids full military deployment. Political crisis.

**Session 3:** Leonidas selects the 300. Only those with living sons chosen (to continue bloodlines). The party is chosen—honor and doom simultaneously. Families say farewell knowing it's final.

**Session 4:** March to Thermopylae. Gathering allies along the way (Thespians, Thebans, other city-states contribute troops—total force ~7,000). Meeting the site: narrow pass between mountain and sea, perfect defensive terrain.

### Arc 2: The Hot Gates (Sessions 5-12)
**Session 5:** Fortifying Thermopylae. Rebuilding Phocian wall, studying terrain, assigning positions. Persian scouts arrive, amazed by Spartans doing gymnastics before battle (cultural clash).

**Session 6:** Xerxes's envoy demands submission. Famous exchange: "Lay down your weapons!" "Molon labe" (Come and take them). Diplomacy fails. War is certain.

**Session 7:** First Persian assault—Median and Cissian troops. The phalanx holds. Persians shattered against Spartan shields. Mass casualties for attackers, minimal for defenders. Military superiority demonstrated.

**Session 8:** Second day—Xerxes sends his Immortals (elite Persian guard). Harder fight but Spartans still dominant. Phalanx tactics in narrow pass nullify Persian numbers. Coordinated shield wall devastates enemies.

**Session 9:** Ephialtes the traitor reveals mountain path to Persians. Party learns they'll be surrounded. Some allies flee. Leonidas dismisses most Greek allies (save Thespians and Thebans). The 300 stay.

**Session 10:** Final night—knowing dawn brings death. Farewells, philosophizing, dark humor. Spartan culture on full display. "Tonight we dine in Hades!" Bonds deepened before final battle.

**Session 11:** Final battle: surrounded on both sides, Spartans fight in the open. Leonidas falls. Party fights over his body. Wave after wave of Persians. Spears break, switch to swords. Swords break, fight with fists and teeth.

**Session 12:** Last stand—final few survivors retreat to hill. Persian arrows blot out the sun. "Then we'll fight in the shade." Buried under arrow storm. The 300 die to the last man. Persian victory—but at staggering cost.

### Arc 3: The Vengeance (Sessions 13-20)
**Session 13:** Aftermath—players create new characters: Athenian sailors, Spartan reinforcements, Greek allies. The sacrifice at Thermopylae has bought time. Greece mobilizes.

**Session 14:** Battle of Artemisium (naval)—Athenian fleet stalls Persian navy. Pyrrhic victory but delays Persian advance.

**Session 15:** Athens evacuated—civilians fled to Salamis island. Persians burn empty city. Rage but hollow victory.

**Session 16:** Themistocles's gambit—fake message tricks Persians into fighting in narrow Salamis straits. Persian numerical advantage neutralized like at Thermopylae.

**Session 17:** Battle of Salamis—Greek triremes destroy Persian fleet. Ramming tactics, Greek seamanship superior. Persian invasion force crippled.

**Session 18:** Xerxes retreats—leaves general Mardonius with land force. Persian emperor returns to Persia having failed.

**Session 19:** Battle of Plataea (one year later)—Combined Greek army destroys remaining Persian land forces. Mardonius killed. Persian invasion ends.

**Session 20:** Epilogue—Monument raised at Thermopylae: "Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie." The 300's sacrifice validated. Greece saved. Western civilization continues. The party's original characters are honored as heroes. New characters celebrate victory bought with others' blood.

## Key NPCs

**Leonidas, King of Sparta** - Commander of the 300, exemplar of Spartan values. Knows mission is suicide, goes anyway. Strategic mind, warrior's body, king's duty.

**Queen Gorgo** - Leonidas's wife, politically astute, strong-willed. Advises husband, rules Sparta in his absence. Her farewell to Leonidas is heartbreaking.

**Xerxes, King of Kings** - Persian emperor, god-king. Arrogant, powerful, magnificently cruel. Cannot comprehend warriors who choose death over submission.

**Ephialtes** - Deformed Spartan wannabe, rejected from military. Betrays pass location to Persians for wealth. Tragic villain—wants acceptance, enables genocide.

**Dilios** - Spartan sent back to tell the tale (one-eyed warrior). Survives to fight at Plataea. The narrator—players realize he's been telling their story.

**The Immortals** - Persian elite guard, 10,000 strong. Highly trained, religiously devoted. Worthy opponents for Spartans.

**Themistocles** - Athenian admiral, brilliant strategist. Wins at Salamis using Thermopylae's lesson: narrow terrain beats numbers.

**The Council** - Spartan elders, some corrupt, some cowardly. Political antagonists who opposed full mobilization.

**Stelios** - Shield-brother to player characters, cocky young warrior. "This is madness!" "This is Sparta!" personified.

**Ephors** - Inbred religious leaders who consult Oracle. Corrupt, controlled by Theron (traitor). Political obstacles.

## Major Locations

**Sparta** - Militaristic city-state, brutal beauty. Agoge training grounds, council chambers, King's palace. What the party fights for.

**Thermopylae (The Hot Gates)** - Narrow coastal pass, mountains on one side, sea on other. Phocian wall across middle. Perfect defensive terrain, 15 meters wide at narrowest.

**The Phocian Wall** - Ancient defensive wall rebuilt by Leonidas. Final position during last stand.

**The Anopaea Path** - Mountain trail Ephialtes reveals. Allows Persians to flank Greek position.

**The Hill** - Small rise where final survivors make last stand, buried under arrows.

**Persian Camp** - Massive tent city, diverse peoples, overwhelming numbers. Cultural contrast to Spartan austerity.

**Athens** - Democratic city-state, wealthy, cultured. Burned by Persians, evacuated beforehand.

**Salamis Strait** - Narrow waters between Salamis island and mainland. Where Persian fleet destroyed.

**Plataea** - Plain where final land battle occurs. Greek phalanx destroys Persian army.

## Unique Mechanics

**Phalanx Formation:** Special combat formation. Unbreakable while maintained, devastating offensive capabilities. Breaking formation is death.

**Shield-Brother Bonds:** Paired players get mechanical bonuses fighting together. Death of shield-brother provides temporary rage bonus.

**Doomed Glory:** Players know they'll die. The question is how gloriously. Glory points for tactical kills, heroic moments, famous last words.

**Spartan Endurance:** Can fight far longer than normal humans. Agoge training provides superhuman pain tolerance.

**Molon Labe:** Defiance mechanics. Rejecting surrender/fear provides bonuses.

**The Narrow Pass:** Tactical advantage. Numbers don't matter when only few can engage at once.

**Final Narration:** Dilios tells the story (players discover they're flashback). Heroic moments become more mythic in retelling.

## Plot Twists

**The Ephors are Corrupt:** Taking Persian bribes, tried to prevent deployment. Political betrayal at home while heroes die abroad.

**Xerxes Respects Leonidas:** Offers wealth, power if he'll kneel. Genuinely puzzled by refusal. Can't comprehend values beyond submission.

**Some Allies Flee:** Thebans surrender during final battle. Not everyone shares Spartan death-wish. Complicated morality.

**The Oracle Was Right:** Prophecy comes true—Sparta doesn't fall, but Leonidas (Spartan king) must die. His sacrifice fulfills it.

**It Bought Enough Time:** Thermopylae's delay allows Athens to evacuate, fleet to gather, strategy to form. The sacrifice works.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Glorious Death:** Die defending the pass, taking thousands of Persians with you. Become immortal through song and memory. Ultimate Spartan victory.

**Buy Time Successfully:** Hold Thermopylae long enough for Greece to prepare. Even in death, mission succeeds.

**Fighting to Last Man:** No surrender, no retreat. All 300 die fighting. Spartan ideal fulfilled.

**Survival Through Dismissal:** Being sent back like Dilios to tell the tale. Survival through order, not cowardice.

**Greek Victory:** New characters witness Salamis and Plataea victories. The 300's sacrifice validated.

**Defeat:** Surrendering, fleeing, or failing to buy sufficient time. Dishonorable in Spartan eyes—worse than death.

**Historical Outcome:** Persians win battle but lose war. 300 die but Greece survives, Western civilization continues. Pyrrhic Persian victory, strategic Greek triumph.
