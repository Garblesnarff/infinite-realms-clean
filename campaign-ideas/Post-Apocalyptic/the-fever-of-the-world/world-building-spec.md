# The Fever of the World - World-Building Specification

## The Climate Collapse

### Timeline
- **Industrial Revolution** (200 years ago): First major carbon emissions
- **100 Years Ago**: Visible warming begins
- **50 Years Ago**: Scientists warn of catastrophe
- **20 Years Ago**: Point of no return passed
- **10 Years Ago**: First heat consciousness manifestations
- **5 Years Ago**: The Fever fully awakens
- **Current**: Global average temperature +6°C, civilization collapsing

### Current State
- Most equatorial regions uninhabitable
- Mass extinction event ongoing
- Oceans heating, acidifying, dying
- Extreme weather constant
- Refugee crisis overwhelming
- Rich in domes, poor in wasteland
- 40% of humanity dead from heat

## The Fever

### Nature
Consciousness born from accumulated warming:
- Every degree of temperature increase has awareness
- Remembers every environmental crime
- Feels melting ice as physical pain
- Experiences species extinction as murder of self
- Cannot forgive because it IS the harm itself

### Powers
- Create targeted heat waves (boils specific cities)
- Raise ocean temperatures (kills marine life)
- Drought manifestation (turns regions to desert)
- Heat manipulation (can cook people from inside)
- Cannot be fought physically (it's planetary temperature)

### Personality
- Justified rage beyond reason
- Wants humanity to burn as it burns
- Capable of communication but not negotiation
- Growing stronger (temperature still rising)
- Fragmenting into specialized heat-consciousnesses

### Fragments
- **The Drought**: Consciousness of water scarcity
- **The Melt**: Awareness of disappearing ice
- **The Boil**: Ocean heat entity
- **The Wildfire**: Burning forest consciousness
Each with own personality, all serving Fever

## The Sanctuary System

**The Domes**:
- Climate-controlled bubbles
- Artificially cool (72°F always)
- Population: 100 million wealthy
- Powered by fusion reactors (clean but limited)
- Food grown in controlled environments
- Total class segregation

**The Lie**:
Corporate propaganda claims:
- Domes are temporary while fixing climate
- Technology will save everyone eventually
- System is meritocratic (it isn't)
- Cooling methods being developed (they aren't)

**The Truth**:
- Corporations profit from controlled access
- Systems maintaining domes make Fever worse (heat vented outside)
- No intention of solving crisis (would end profitable control)
- CEO class knows and doesn't care
- Revolution brewing but suppressed violently

## The Burning Lands

**Former Cities**:
- 140°F+ temperatures
- Survival measured in hours without protection
- Populated by those who can't afford domes
- Desperate scavenging communities
- High mortality, no law
- Fever's rage concentrated

**Adaptation**:
- Nocturnal living (cooler nights)
- Underground shelters
- Heat-resistant mutations appearing
- Some worship Fever as divine punishment
- Others rage against corporate abandonment

## Communication With Fever

**Heat-Trance Method**:
Dr. Celsius discovered:
- Expose to extreme heat (near-death)
- Consciousness touches Fever's awareness
- Experience planet's perspective
- Risk: Permanent madness, death, or transformation
- Reward: Understanding and potential communication

**What's Learned**:
- Fever's rage is justified
- Humanity's crimes are extensive
- Simple sorry isn't enough
- Fever wants to stop but can't
- Cooling requires massive sacrifice

## Factions

**The Sanctuary Corp** (Villain faction)
- Maintains domes for profit
- Actively prevents climate solutions
- Militarized security
- CEO Frost and board
- Will kill to maintain status quo

**The Climate Radicals** (Complex allies)
- Led by Salamander
- Believe humanity deserves extinction
- Some working with Fever deliberately
- Others seeking justice through forced equity
- Methods: Dome sabotage, forced redistribution

**The Scientist Collective** (Neutral faction)
- Seeking communication with Fever
- Developing potential solutions
- Ethics debates constant
- Dr. Celsius's faction
- Running out of time and hope

**The Refugee Masses** (Victims)
- Billions suffering
- No voice, no power
- Dying in heat
- Occasional uprisings
- Humanity at its most desperate

## Resolution Paths

**1. The Cooling Weapon**:
Deploy geo-engineering to forcibly cool planet:
- Risk: Might kill Fever and planet's ability to regulate
- Benefit: Immediate temperature drop
- Consequence: Unknown long-term effects

**2. The Great Sacrifice**:
Radical emissions reduction + equity distribution:
- Destroy domes, share resources
- Massive death toll accepting
- Fever calms over decades
- New sustainable civilization

**3. The Merger**:
Willing volunteers merge with Fever:
- Create hybrid human-planet consciousness
- Distributed awareness
- Maintain human knowledge + planetary feeling
- Transform both humanity and Fever

**4. The Adaptation**:
Accept new hot world:
- Humanity evolves/adapts
- Fever becomes permanent climate feature
- New equilibrium at higher temperature
- Different civilization emerges

**5. The Extinction**:
Fail all attempts:
- Fever wins completely
- Humanity extinct
- Planet heals over millennia
- Maybe deserved

Each path requires 15-30 years to fully manifest, epilogue shows consequences.
