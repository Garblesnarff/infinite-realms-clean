# The Exodus of Ash and Ice [CAMPAIGN: Post-Apocalyptic]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
Two centuries after the twin cataclysms of the "Great Ashfall" (a global volcanic winter) and the "Long Winter" (nuclear fallout), humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. Small, scattered enclaves struggle to survive in a world perpetually shrouded in twilight, choked by ash, and gripped by an unnatural cold. A desperate rumor of a "Green Valley" – a fertile, untouched sanctuary far to the south – sparks a perilous exodus. The players are part of one such caravan, facing the brutal elements, mutated horrors, and the desperation of their fellow survivors on a journey across a frozen, ash-choked continent.

## Setting [SETTING: Frozen Wasteland]
The world is a vast, desolate expanse of snow, ice, and volcanic ash. The sun is a dim, distant orb, its light barely penetrating the perpetual cloud cover. Ancient cities are buried under drifts of ash and snow, their skeletal remains serving as landmarks or dangerous shelters. Rivers and lakes are frozen solid, and the few remaining forests are petrified, ghostly silhouettes against the grey sky. New, bizarre ecosystems have emerged, adapted to the extreme cold and toxic environment.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Ash-Choked Peaks:** [LOCATION: Mountain Range] A treacherous mountain range perpetually covered in volcanic ash and glacial ice. Home to dangerous mutated creatures and hidden, ancient bunkers. The air is thin and toxic.
*   **The Frozen Sea:** [LOCATION: Ocean/Ice Sheet] What was once a vast ocean is now a colossal, cracked sheet of ice, stretching for hundreds of miles. Beneath its surface lie sunken cities and strange, bioluminescent life forms. Travel across it is perilous due to shifting ice and deep fissures.
*   **The Petrified Forest:** [LOCATION: Forest] A vast expanse of trees turned to stone by the initial ashfall and subsequent freezing. It's a haunting, silent place, where the petrified wood is brittle and sharp, and strange, crystalline growths are common.
*   **The Sunken City of Glass:** [LOCATION: Ruin] A pre-Collapse city now partially submerged beneath the Frozen Sea, its glass skyscrapers glinting eerily through the ice. It's a treasure trove of technology but also a death trap of unstable structures and aquatic mutations.
*   **The Last Oasis:** [LOCATION: Settlement] A small, isolated settlement built around a geothermal vent, providing warmth and a limited source of fresh water. It's a vital waypoint for caravans but fiercely protected by its inhabitants.

## Factions [FACTION: Survivalist]
*   **The Exodus Collective:** [FACTION: Migratory] The main caravan of survivors, a diverse group of families, engineers, and scouts, united by the shared hope of reaching the Green Valley. They are often desperate, prone to internal conflicts, but also capable of great resilience.
*   **The Ash Raiders:** [FACTION: Marauders] Nomadic bands of scavengers and bandits who prey on the Exodus Collective and other weaker groups. They are ruthless, well-armed with scavenged weapons, and adapted to the harsh environment.
*   **The Ice Wardens:** [FACTION: Guardians] A mysterious, highly disciplined group of survivalists who patrol the Frozen Sea and Ash-Choked Peaks. They are formidable fighters and seem to possess advanced knowledge of the wasteland, but their motives are unclear.
*   **The Deep Dwellers:** [FACTION: Subterranean] A reclusive community living in the Sunken City of Glass, adapted to the underwater environment. They possess unique technologies and knowledge but are deeply suspicious of surface dwellers.
*   **The Cult of the White Sun:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A small, fanatical group who believe the Ashfall and Long Winter were divine punishment and that the only salvation lies in embracing the cold and ash. They sometimes attempt to sabotage the Exodus.

## Quests [QUEST: Primary]

*   **The Ice Warden's Test:** [QUEST: Trial] The Ice Wardens block a critical pass, demanding the players prove their worth by completing a dangerous trial in the Ash-Choked Peaks before allowing the caravan to proceed.
*   **The Green Valley's Guardian:** [QUEST: Confrontation] Upon reaching the rumored Green Valley, the players discover it is not uninhabited, but guarded by a powerful, ancient entity or a highly advanced, isolationist community that views outsiders as a threat.

## Threats [THREAT: Environmental]
*   **Blizzards and Ash Storms:** [THREAT: Environmental] Sudden, violent weather phenomena that can disorient, freeze, and bury the caravan, making travel impossible and exposing survivors to the elements.
