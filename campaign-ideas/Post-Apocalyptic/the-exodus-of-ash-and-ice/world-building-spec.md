# The Exodus of Ash and Ice - World-Building Specification

## The Weather War

### Origins
1,000 years ago, during great magical conflict, weather titans imprisoned as weapons:
- Ash Lords bound in volcanoes
- Frost Titans frozen in glaciers
- War ended, titans stayed imprisoned
- Became mythology, then forgotten

### The Awakening
Six months ago, Weather Warlord Theron discovered prison locations:
- Deliberately released Elder Smoke (Ash Lord)
- Freed Glacier Queen (Frost Titan)
- Manipulated them to fight each other
- Created perpetual refugee crisis
- Profits from desperation

### Current State
- Ash Lords claim southern continents (volcanic hellscape)
- Frost Titans dominate north (frozen wasteland)
- War zone between (uninhabitable)
- Habitable temperate bands shrinking
- 50+ million refugees displaced
- Civilization collapsing

## The Refugee Situation

**The Great Caravans** (Dozens moving)
- 5,000-20,000 refugees each
- Multi-cultural (disaster doesn't discriminate)
- Organized by strong leaders or chaos
- Targets for exploitation
- Dwindling supplies
- Impossible decisions daily

**Resources Critical**:
- Food (scarce, rationed)
- Water (contaminated by ash/ice)
- Medicine (disease rampant)
- Shelter (temperature protection)
- Hope (most valuable, most rare)

**Caravan Hierarchy**:
- Leadership council (decision makers)
- Protectors (scarce combat-capable)
- Healers (overwhelmed)
- Laborers (everyone else)
- Expendables (harsh reality)

## The Weather Titans

**Ash Lords** (Volcanic consciousnesses)
- Born from volcanic fury and ash
- Remember imprisonment as eternal torture
- Hate cold (Frost Titans) viscerally
- Indifferent to human suffering
- Can be negotiated with (carefully)
- Want: Warm world, frozen enemies destroyed

**Frost Titans** (Glacial beings)
- Ancient ice consciousness
- Remember ice ages as paradise
- See warmth as disease
- Equally indifferent to humans
- More patient but absolute
- Want: Frozen world, heat sources eliminated

**Neither Is Evil**:
- Both were imprisoned unjustly
- Both manipulated into conflict
- Both have legitimate grievances
- Neither understands human fragility
- War is tragedy, not villainy

## The Temperate Sanctuary

**Location**: Hidden valley, ancient magical wards

**Protection**: Wards create microclimate immune to extreme weather

**The Price**: Wards powered by life energy, require regular sacrifice (monthly offering of 100 lives)

**Current State**:
- Population: 50,000 (rotating)
- New refugees accepted if equal number "volunteer" for wards
- Lottery system for sacrifice (supposedly fair)
- Society built on necessary evil
- Acceptance vs. revolution brewing

**The Secret**: Wards could be powered by weather titan agreement instead of sacrifice, but that would require peace

## The Weather Warlord

**Theron the Profiteer**
- Mercenary-mage who discovered titan prisons
- Released them, manipulated into war
- Runs "waystation" camps (exploitative)
- Charges refugees everything for basics
- Harvests magical energy from mass suffering
- Becoming wealthy god-like power
- Secretly controls Sanctuary leadership
- Wants war to continue indefinitely

**His Network**:
- Waystation camps (refugee traps)
- Mercenary protectors (keep refugees desperate)
- Information control (hides Sanctuary truth)
- Corrupt caravan leaders (work for him)

## Resolution Paths

**1. Free the Titans**: Reveal manipulation, help them make peace, wards fall but war ends

**2. Sanctuary Reform**: Overthrow corrupt leadership, power wards with titan cooperation

**3. Destroy Titans**: Use ancient weapons, end threat but kill conscious beings

**4. Refugee Ascension**: Mass death creates new weather consciousness that mediates

**5. Status Quo**: Accept Sanctuary's price, survival at cost of souls

Each has detailed long-term consequences.
