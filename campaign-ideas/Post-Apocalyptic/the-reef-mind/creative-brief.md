# Creative Brief: The Reef Mind

## Visual Aesthetics

### Color Palette
- **Healthy Reef**: Vibrant coral rainbow (#FF6B35, #F7931E, #FFD23F, #4ECDC4, #006BA6, #8E44AD)
- **Bleached Sections**: Bone white (#FFFFF0), death gray (#B0B0B0), sickly yellow (#E8E8B0)
- **Deep Ocean**: Sapphire blue (#0A2463), turquoise (#2EC4B6), midnight (#011627)
- **Sub-Mind Signatures**: Navigator (geometric silver), Gardener (wild green), Dreamer (iridescent pearl), Fury (blood red coral)

### Visual Style
- Underwater Eden meets dying patient
- Contrast between vibrant life and spreading death
- Coral formations should look like brain tissue, neural networks
- Sub-minds visualized through coral growth patterns (mazes, explosions, spirals, spikes)
- Surface cities: Polynesian/Caribbean fusion with coral architecture

### Key Visuals
1. First dive: Rainbow reef teeming with life suddenly giving way to white bleached wasteland
2. Communion: Character surrounded by pulsing coral, bioluminescence syncing with heartbeat
3. Sub-minds: Four distinct reef sections, each with radically different architecture
4. The Sunheart: Glowing sphere embedded in massive brain coral
5. Reconciliation: Four colored lights merging into unified spectrum
6. The apocalypse wave (if defeat): Thousand-foot wall of water approaching coast

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Themes
- **Reef Mind Theme**: Gamelan orchestra meets whale song, representing collective consciousness
- **Bleaching Theme**: Beautiful melody slowly losing instruments, fading to silence
- **Sub-Mind Themes**: Each has own leitmotif that combines in harmony when unified
- **Surface World**: Tropical Caribbean steel drums, busy port sounds

### Ambient Soundscapes
- Healthy Reef: Shrimp clicking, fish calls, coral growth (subtle crackling), gentle current
- Bleached Reef: Eerie silence, occasional ghost sound of what used to be, hollow echoes
- Pearltide City: Waves, ship bells, market bustle, steel drum street music
- The Abyss: Deep drones, pressure sounds, ancient whale songs

### Key Scene Music
- First Communion: Gradual build from silence to full orchestral-oceanic fusion
- Each Sub-Mind: Distinct instrumentation (Navigator: precise percussion; Gardener: flourishing strings; Dreamer: ethereal vocals; Fury: aggressive drums)
- The Healing Ritual: All themes layered in progressive harmony

## Voice Acting Direction

### Magister Delphine
- Warm elderly woman, slight breathlessness (coral-lung), speaks in oceanic metaphors
- "The Reef does not ask, child. It offers. And in offering, teaches us to receive."

### The Navigator
- Multiple voices speaking in precise unison, robotic precision
- "Order. Pattern. Control. The current flows where WE direct. Chaos must be... eliminated."

### The Gardener
- Excited, overlapping voices, words tumbling over each other
- "Grow grow GROW! Death surrounds so we must CREATE more faster bigger LIFE!"

### The Dreamer
- Distant, echoing, speaking to people who aren't there
- "Once... we remember once... ten thousand years of sun through water... do you remember?"

### The Fury
- Screaming rage barely contained, waves crashing in voice
- "They POISON us! KILL us! And you ask for PEACE?! I will DROWN THEM ALL!"

### Prophet Ss'thakara
- Sahaugin accent (sibilant s sounds), zealot's certainty
- "The falsse god ssmotherss the ocean. We bring purification through holy heat."
