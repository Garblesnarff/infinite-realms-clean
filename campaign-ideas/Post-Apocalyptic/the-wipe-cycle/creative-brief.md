# Creative Brief: The Wipe Cycle

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Brutalism (Rust-inspired)

Inspired by the harsh, unforgiving aesthetic of *Rust*, blending realistic post-apocalyptic environments with improvised, ramshackle structures and brutal PvP combat. This style emphasizes the contrast between the natural beauty of the island and the ugly, desperate struggle for survival.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Realistic Decay:** Everything should look weathered, rusted, and improvised. Buildings are crude, weapons are makeshift, and nothing is pristine.
*   **Harsh Environment:** The island is beautiful but deadly—rocky shores, dense forests, and irradiated ruins.
*   **Desperation & Violence:** Show the brutality of PvP survival—raided bases, corpses, and the constant threat of betrayal.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Brutal, paranoid, competitive, ruthless, post-apocalyptic, zero-to-hero, desperate.
*   **Feeling:** Constant tension and mistrust. The mood is one of survival at any cost, with brief moments of triumph followed by crushing losses.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and gritty, with rough textures for metal, wood, and stone.
*   **Forms:** Structures are angular, crude, and haphazard. Weapons are improvised and functional, not elegant.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic digital painting of a post-apocalyptic island. Rough, weathered textures dominate—rusted metal, splintered wood, cracked stone."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated colors with harsh sunlight and deep shadows.
*   **Environment Colors:** Rocky grays, dusty browns, faded greens (forest), rusted oranges and reds (metal, radtowns).
*   **Human Elements:** Dull cloth wraps, makeshift leather armor, dark metal.
*   **Accent Colors:** The harsh orange of rust, the sickly green of radiation, the red of blood.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted, desaturated color palette dominated by rocky grays, dusty browns, and the harsh orange of rusted metal. The sunlight is bright and unforgiving."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers in improvised, post-apocalyptic gear—cloth wraps, scavenged armor, makeshift weapons.
*   **Progression:** Naked → Cloth wraps → Leather armor → Metal armor. Weapons: Rock → Spear → Bow → Firearms.
*   **Expression:** Hard, paranoid, and determined. Eyes constantly scan for threats.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer in crude leather armor and a metal chest plate, holding a makeshift rifle. Their face is scarred and weathered, eyes narrowed in suspicion."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, diverse environments—rocky beaches, dense forests, irradiated ruins, and ramshackle player-built bases.
*   **Atmosphere:** Beautiful but hostile. Nature is indifferent, and human structures are temporary and fragile.
*   **Details:** Rusted metal debris, splintered wood, bear traps, landmines, raided bases with broken walls, corpses looted for gear.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A post-apocalyptic island landscape: a rocky beach littered with rusted metal debris, a crude wooden base with stone walls, and a corpse lying nearby, already looted."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, naturalistic lighting. Bright sun creates deep shadows. Nighttime is pitch-black except for firelight or flashlights.
*   **Shadows:** Used to create hiding spots and emphasize the danger of darkness.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the harsh, unforgiving nature of the island.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...harshly lit by the bright, midday sun, casting deep, sharp shadows from a crude metal watchtower. The light is unforgiving, revealing every detail of the rusted, weathered metal."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic, action-oriented shots for PvP combat and raids. Wide, desolate shots to emphasize isolation.
*   **Techniques:** Use first-person perspectives for immersion. Show the scale of bases and the brutality of raiding (explosions, broken walls). Frame characters as small against the vast, uncaring landscape.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, first-person perspective shot of a D&D adventurer holding a makeshift rifle, aiming at a distant enemy base. Explosions light up the base as a raid is in progress."

## Voice

A gruff, weary male voice with a rough, lower-class American accent, pacing that is terse and direct, conveying exhaustion and constant vigilance. The emotion is a mix of bitter survival instinct and dark humor in the face of futility. Audio quality is raw and unpolished, with ambient sounds of wind, distant gunfire, and the crackle of fires. Role: A hardened survivor recounting the brutal reality of the Wipe Cycle, or a warning to newcomers about the island's dangers.
