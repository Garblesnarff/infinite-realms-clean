# When Stars Walk
**Tagline:** *The constellations have descended from the heavens and walk among mortals as gods*

## Campaign Overview

The zodiac constellations were never meant to leave the sky. For millennia, they've watched from above, distant and divine. But three months ago, something catastrophic happened: the Celestial Anchor - the magical tether holding constellations in the heavens - shattered. All twelve zodiac constellations fell to earth as physical beings of immense power. They didn't fall gracefully; they crashed, creating impact zones that reshaped the landscape.

Now the Starborn walk the mortal realm. Aries is a living god of war, carving a empire through conquest. Taurus has claimed fertile lands and refuses to share. Gemini split into two beings at constant war. Cancer built impenetrable fortress-cities. Leo declared himself divine emperor. Each constellation interprets their presence on Earth differently, and their godlike power backs their ambitions. Mortal kingdoms are being conquered, absorbed, or destroyed as cosmic beings impose their will.

The party are Anchor-Touched - mortals who were near the Anchor when it shattered, gaining fragments of celestial power. They can resist the Starborn's influence and channel zodiac magic. They must navigate a world ruled by walking gods, decide which Starborn to ally with or oppose, and discover what shattered the Anchor before the Starborn's presence on Earth causes the planet itself to collapse under the weight of embodied divinity.

## Core Themes

- **Gods Among Mortals:** What happens when the divine becomes physical?
- **Power Corrupts:** Absolute power of incarnated constellations
- **Mortality vs. Divinity:** The value of being human
- **Cosmic Weight:** Earth cannot sustain embodied constellations forever
- **Worship and Resistance:** Do you serve or oppose gods?

## Major Locations

**The Twelve Domains:** Each Starborn's territory, reflecting their nature
**The Shattering Site:** Where Celestial Anchor broke, now cosmic crater
**The Star Forge:** Where new Anchor can be created
**The Resistance Strongholds:** Pockets of mortal governance
**The Celestial Temples:** Where each Starborn holds court

## Unique Mechanics

### Anchor Fragments
- Party has pieces of shattered Anchor
- Grants resistance to Starborn compulsion
- Allows channeling zodiac powers
- Needed to forge new Anchor

### Starborn Influence
- Each Starborn passively affects their territory
- Mortals slowly transform to match Starborn's nature
- Party must resist or embrace changes
- Extended exposure has permanent effects

### Divine Encounters
- Fighting Starborn is nearly impossible
- Must use strategy, diplomacy, or trickery
- Other Starborn can be recruited as allies
- Some Starborn want to return to sky

### Coalition Building
- Track relationships with all twelve Starborn
- Need support of at least 6 to restore Anchor
- Incompatible Starborn cannot both be allied
- Final coalition determines ending

### Earth Stability
- Track planetary damage (0-100%)
- Starborn presence increases damage over time
- At 100%, Earth collapses
- Creates urgency countdown
- Current: 40% and rising

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **Earth is breaking:** Planet cannot sustain embodied constellations, will collapse in months
2. **Some Starborn want to stay:** Power is addictive, divinity hard to surrender
3. **Mortals are transforming:** Prolonged exposure turning humans into constellation-beings
4. **The Anchor was flawed:** Old system kept constellations prisoner
5. **One Starborn knows the truth:** Deliberately chose to fall, has hidden agenda
6. **Party is transforming:** Anchor fragments slowly making them part-constellation
