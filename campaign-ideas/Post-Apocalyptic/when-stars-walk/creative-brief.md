# Creative Brief: When Stars Walk

## Visual Art Direction
- Constellations as physical titan-sized beings
- Impact craters from their descent
- Territories warped by their presence
- Mortal champions wielding star fragments

**Starborn Design:** Each is 40-50 feet tall, made of celestial material matching their element and symbolism
- Aries: Living flame warrior
- Taurus: Stone and plant colossus
- Gemini: Two crystalline beings
- Cancer: Protective shell-entity
- Leo: Radiant golden king
- Virgo: Geometric crystal perfection
- Libra: Balanced black/white figure
- Scorpio: Living shadow
- Sagittarius: Starlight centaur
- Capricorn: Ancient mountain
- Aquarius: Lightning storm
- Pisces: Flowing water-dream

## Music Direction
- Each Starborn has divine theme (epic, overwhelming)
- Mortal themes are small, fragile by comparison
- Coalition music shows mortal-divine harmony
- Final restoration: Twelve themes ascending

## Voice Acting
- Starborn: God-like, powerful, inhuman
- Gradually showing mortality through campaign
- Mortal characters: Awe mixed with resistance

## Atmosphere
- Gods walking Earth: awe and terror
- Divine beings discovering mortality
- Mortals resisting or serving
- Race against planetary collapse

## Marketing Taglines
- "The stars have fallen. The gods walk among us."
- "When constellations become flesh, mortals become legends."
- "Twelve gods. One dying world. Your choice."
