# The Eternal Court War [CAMPAIGN: Post-Apocalyptic]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In a world scarred by an unknown cataclysm, humanity clings to survival within the ruins of a once-great metropolis. Society has fractured into numerous "Courts," each claiming direct lineage and divine right from pre-Collapse royalty. These Courts are locked in a perpetual, brutal struggle for control over dwindling resources, forgotten technologies, and the very definition of what it means to be civilized in a broken world. The players navigate this treacherous landscape, forced to choose allegiances or forge their own path amidst the endless conflict.

## Setting [SETTING: Urban Ruin]
The campaign unfolds within the sprawling, shattered remains of a vast city, now known only as the "Shattered Crown." Towering skyscrapers, half-collapsed and overgrown with mutated flora, pierce a perpetually hazy sky. Streets are choked with debris, forming labyrinthine alleys and treacherous canyons. Settlements are built within the shells of old buildings, fortified with scavenged metal and makeshift defenses. Beyond the immediate Court territories lie the "Dead Zones" – areas of extreme radiation, mutated creatures, or inexplicable phenomena, holding both immense danger and the promise of invaluable pre-Collapse relics.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Iron Throne District:** [LOCATION: District] The heavily fortified, central district controlled by the Iron Court. It boasts the most intact infrastructure, including a functional (though heavily modified) water purification plant and a few operational pre-Collapse generators. Its walls are made of reinforced concrete and scavenged vehicle plating.
*   **The Verdant Sprawl:** [LOCATION: Wilds] A vast, overgrown park and botanical garden district, now a dangerous jungle teeming with mutated plant life and predatory creatures. The Verdant Court claims this territory, utilizing its unique ecosystem for food and bio-engineered resources.
*   **The Ash Wastes:** [LOCATION: Wasteland] The industrial sector, now a desolate expanse of toxic dust and skeletal factories. The Ash Court, composed primarily of scavengers and mechanics, braves its dangers for rare metals and fuel.
*   **The Whispering Archives:** [LOCATION: Ruin] The remains of a grand library or data center, now a perilous maze of collapsed shelves and corrupted data banks. Rumored to hold vast amounts of pre-Collapse knowledge, it is a neutral (and highly contested) zone.
*   **The Gutter Market:** [LOCATION: Bazaar] A sprawling, chaotic black market operating in the sewers and lower levels of the city, where all Courts and independent factions trade goods, information, and secrets.

## Factions [FACTION: Political]
*   **The Iron Court:** [FACTION: Authoritarian] Descendants of military and industrial leaders, they believe in strict hierarchy, order, and the re-establishment of a powerful, centralized government. They are well-armed and disciplined, but often ruthless.
*   **The Verdant Court:** [FACTION: Ecological] Composed of those who adapted to the mutated environment, they prioritize ecological balance and sustainable living. They are skilled in bio-engineering and guerrilla warfare, often seen as radical by other Courts.
*   **The Ash Court:** [FACTION: Pragmatic] A loose confederation of engineers, mechanics, and scavengers. They value ingenuity, self-reliance, and the practical application of technology. They are less concerned with lineage and more with survival and progress.
*   **The Silent Watchers:** [FACTION: Mysterious] A secretive group of scholars and archivists who operate from hidden enclaves, attempting to piece together the true history of the Collapse and the pre-Collapse world. They rarely interfere directly but possess invaluable knowledge.
*   **The Free Folk:** [FACTION: Independent] Nomadic groups, independent traders, and small, unaligned settlements who try to survive outside the Court system, often caught in the crossfire.
