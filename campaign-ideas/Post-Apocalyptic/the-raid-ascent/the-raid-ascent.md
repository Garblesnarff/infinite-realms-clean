## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A relentless two-act arc of vertical siege warfare and desperate survival.

*   **Act I — The Breach (Sessions 1–3):** The party infiltrates the Crimson Tower with a full tactical team, clearing the first five floors silently. When a lookout escapes and alerts Tama, the entire building goes on lockdown. The party's backup is ambushed outside, and they must fight their way up alone, floor by floor, using Pencak Silat-inspired martial arts and tactical combat.
*   **Act II — The Ascent (Sessions 4–10):** Each floor presents unique combat challenges—drug labs with volatile chemicals, fighting pits with gladiatorial champions, trapped hallways, and finally Tama's elite enforcers: Mad Dog (a martial arts savant who fights for the joy of it) and Andi (a lieutenant with a shocking connection to one of the party members). The campaign culminates in a three-stage boss fight at the penthouse.

    *   Clearing floors 7-12: apartments turned into fortified positions

        *   Stage 2: Andi confronts Tama while the party holds off remaining enforcers
        *   Stage 3: Tama's secret escape route leads to the roof for a final confrontation
**Resolution:** The party must decide: capture Tama for justice (original mission), let Andi kill him (revenge), or kill Tama themselves (pragmatic). The building is in flames, and they must escape via rooftop extraction.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Tama Riyadi** — *The Architect of Violence*
    *   **Role:** Primary antagonist, crime lord controlling the Crimson Tower.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, calculating, views violence as a business tool. Watches the raid via security cameras like it's entertainment.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He's dying of a terminal illness, which is why he's become reckless. He'd rather die in a spectacular way than wither away.

2.  **Mad Dog** — *The Purist*
    *   **Role:** Tama's enforcer who lives only for the perfect fight.
    *   **Personality:** Gleeful, honorable in his own way, completely devoted to martial arts. He doesn't care about crime or money.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He refuses to use weapons because they make fights "boring." He will fight alone against multiple opponents because it's more challenging.

3.  **Andi** — *The Deep Cover Operative*
    *   **Role:** Tama's lieutenant, secretly connected to the party.
    *   **Personality:** Torn, hardened by years undercover, morally gray. He's done terrible things to maintain his cover.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His original mission was to gather evidence, but he's been inside so long that he's not sure who he really is anymore. He wants revenge on Tama for forcing him to become a monster.

4.  **Wahyu** — *The Corrupt Commander*
    *   **Role:** The watch captain who organized this raid.
    *   **Personality:** Appears professional but is actually corrupt.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He sent the party on a suicide mission to eliminate witnesses (Tama and Andi) who know about his own corruption. He sabotaged the extraction.

5.  **Rama** — *The Rookie (Party NPC Ally)*
    *   **Role:** If the party is small, Rama is an NPC ally—a skilled Pencak Silat practitioner on his first real operation.
    *   **Personality:** Determined, moral, protective of his pregnant wife waiting at home.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His brother is Andi—this is how the connection to the party is established if needed.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival, brotherhood, and the cost of violence. The central conflict is whether the party can maintain their morality and mission objectives when trapped in an environment designed to reduce them to mere killers. It asks whether following orders matters when those orders come from corrupt authorities.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Pencak Silat Combat System**
*   The campaign emphasizes unarmed martial arts with emphasis on grapples, throws, and strikes.
*   Monks and fighters gain bonus abilities reflecting Silat techniques: elbow strikes, knee attacks, wall-running, weapon disarms.
*   Combat is designed to be close-quarters with limited room for ranged attacks.
*   Enemies can be grappled and used as human shields or thrown into each other.

### 2. **Ammunition & Resource Depletion**
*   The party starts with limited ammunition and healing supplies.
*   After Session 2, ammo becomes scarce—they must scavenge weapons from defeated enemies.
*   This forces transition from ranged combat to brutal melee and unarmed fighting.
*   Resting is dangerous and rare—the party might only get 1-2 short rests total.

### 3. **Vertical Siege Warfare**
*   Each floor has unique tactical challenges: different enemy types, hazards, layouts.
*   Stairwells and elevators (when working) are chokepoints for combat.
*   The party can collapse floors or set fires, but this limits their own paths upward.
*   Environmental awareness is crucial: weak walls for breaching, gas pipes for explosions, furniture for barricades.

### 4. **Exhaustion & Injury System**
*   Extended combat without rest adds exhaustion levels faster than normal.
*   Injuries persist—if you take critical damage to an arm, attacks with that arm have disadvantage until properly healed.
*   This creates a desperate, deteriorating situation as the party climbs higher while growing weaker.

### 5. **The Mad Dog Duels**
*   Mad Dog appears three times, each time more impressed with the party's skills.
*   His first appearance is a "test" (he fights briefly then leaves).
*   His second appearance is an "evaluation" (longer fight, but he spares them if they impress him).
*   His final appearance is the "real fight" (to the death, one-on-one against the party's champion).
*   Defeating him without accepting his duel is possible but considered dishonorable by martial artist characters.

### 6. **Moral Exhaustion**
*   Track "Darkness Points" for morally questionable actions (killing surrendering enemies, abandoning civilians, excessive brutality).
*   High Darkness Points might affect the ending: do they become like the criminals they're fighting?
*   This is a narrative mechanic, not a punishment—it reflects the campaign's themes.
