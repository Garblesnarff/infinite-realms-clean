# Creative Brief: The Price of Steel

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grimdark Realism with Historical Grounding

Inspired by the aesthetics of 17th-18th century warfare and historical military art, combined with the mud-and-blood realism of grimdark fantasy. Think Goya's "Disasters of War" meets low-magic medieval brutality. This style captures the unglamorous reality of war, the moral degradation of characters, and the absence of heroic fantasy tropes.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Brutal Realism:** Show war as ugly—mud, blood, exhaustion, fear. No shining armor or heroic poses.
*   **Low Magic:** Magic is rare, disturbing, and costs dearly. When it appears, it should feel wrong and dangerous.
*   **Moral Greyness:** Characters should look worn, compromised, scarred. No clear visual distinction between "good" and "evil."
*   **Historical Grounding:** Base aesthetics on real historical periods—flintlock pistols, tricorn hats, realistic armor and weapons.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grimdark, cynical, morally-grey, war-torn, brutal-realism, low-magic, dark-humor, no-heroes.
*   **Feeling:** Exhaustion, resignation, dark humor in the face of horror. The sense that no one is winning, everyone is losing slowly. Beauty in small moments of humanity amidst cruelty.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, harsh, with emphasis on wear and damage. Lines show age, scars, broken equipment, weathered faces.
*   **Forms:** Practical clothing and armor—brigandines, leather coats, simple steel. Weapons are functional, often damaged. Architecture is utilitarian, built for function not beauty.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Sand dan Glokta, a crippled inquisitor in mud-stained Union uniform, leaning on his cane, scarred face twisted in a pained grimace. He stands in the House of Questions torture chamber, torches casting harsh shadows on stone walls. Grimdark low fantasy, realistic and brutal, in the style of historical war art."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated earth tones—mud browns, dried blood reds, steel grays, bruised purples. Occasional harsh colors (Union red, northern furs) stand out against drabness.
*   **Luminosity:** Lighting is generally dim—overcast skies, torch-lit dungeons, smoke from battlefields. Rarely bright or hopeful.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a desaturated color palette of mud-brown battlefield, steel-gray armor, and dried blood. The overcast sky provides flat, harsh lighting. Union soldiers in red coats are the only spot of color, but even that red is dulled by dirt and smoke."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters show the toll of their experiences—scars, missing fingers/teeth, limps, haunted eyes. Clothing is practical, worn, patched. No one looks heroic.
*   **Diversity:** Characters reflect the world—Union soldiers in uniforms, northern barbarians in furs and rough wool, Gurkish in turbans and curved swords.
*   **Expression:** Exhaustion, cynicism, pain, dark humor. No noble determination—just people trying to survive.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Logan Ninefingers, a large northern barbarian with a missing finger, scarred face, and tired eyes. He wears practical furs and leather, carries a battered longsword. His expression is haunted—trying to be gentle but knowing violence will find him. Grimdark low fantasy, realistic proportions, Joe Abercrombie's First Law aesthetic."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic historical settings with fantasy elements—siege camps in mud, stone dungeons lit by torches, ancient ruins crumbling and monster-infested.
*   **Atmosphere:** Generally bleak—rain, mud, smoke, overcast skies. Cities show poverty alongside wealth (slums near palaces).
*   **Details:** Evidence of war everywhere—damaged buildings, displaced refugees, gallows, torture equipment, mass graves.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The siege of Dagoska: a walled city on the coast, surrounded by massive Gurkish army camps. The walls are damaged from bombardment, smoke rises from fires inside. In the foreground, exhausted Union defenders in muddy trenches. The city is slowly dying under siege. Grimdark military fantasy, realistic historical warfare aesthetic."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, realistic lighting from torches, overcast sun, or campfires. Shadows are heavy and oppressive.
*   **Shadows:** Long shadows from low sun, deep darkness in dungeons, smoke obscuring vision in battle.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes exhaustion, moral darkness, and the oppressive atmosphere of constant war.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh torchlight creating deep shadows in the stone torture chamber. The light catches the glint of torture implements and Glokta's twisted smile, but leaves most of the room in oppressive darkness. The lighting makes everything look sickly and cruel."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Realistic, often asymmetrical. Wide shots of muddy battlefields with tiny figures. Close-ups on scarred faces and broken equipment. No heroic framing—characters are often in unflattering, vulnerable positions.
*   **Techniques:** Use mud, smoke, and rain to create oppressive atmosphere. Frame characters against harsh environments. Show aftermath as much as action.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the battlefield after combat: bodies in the mud, broken weapons, vultures circling. In the foreground, Logan sits exhausted, covered in blood (not all his own), staring at nothing. The composition emphasizes the futility and waste of war. Grimdark realism, First Law aesthetic."

## Voice

A weary, cynical voice with dark humor threading through. The accent is working-class with educated vocabulary—like a soldier who reads. Pacing is measured and deliberate, occasionally punctuated by bitter sarcasm. The tone conveys exhaustion mixed with resignation—someone who has seen too much to believe in heroes but keeps going anyway. Emotion shows wry acceptance of horror, dark amusement at the absurdity, and underneath it all, deep weariness. Audio quality is clear but slightly rough, as if the speaker is hoarse from shouting orders or screaming. Role: The survivor who records the truth that heroic histories will gloss over.
