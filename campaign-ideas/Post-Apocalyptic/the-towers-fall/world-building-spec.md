# The Tower's Fall - World-Building Specification

## The Tower's Structure and History

### Physical Architecture
The Tower is not one structure but a composite of thousands of years of construction, built upon itself in layers of increasing desperation. It extends 10,000 levels high and an unknown depth below ground. The architecture is mathematically impossible—contains more internal space than external dimensions suggest, with rooms existing in multiple locations simultaneously.

**Vertical Zones**:
- **Foundation (Levels -??? to 0)**: Ancient, crushing, where the Cornerstone exists
- **The Cellblocks (Levels 1-7000)**: Primary prison areas, organized by alleged crime
- **The Administrative Levels (Levels 7001-8500)**: Warden quarters, records, armory
- **The Impossible Floors (Levels 8501-9500)**: Reality-breaking architecture
- **The Crown (Levels 9501-10000)**: Lightning-struck peak, Architect's domain

### The Cornerstone's Nature
At the Tower's foundation lies the Cornerstone—a person transformed into living architecture. Their name was Verity, the first truth-teller imprisoned here. To create a foundation strong enough to support the Tower's impossible weight, the Architects performed a horrific ritual: they transformed a living being into stone, binding them permanently into the structure. Verity has been conscious, suffering, supporting the Tower's weight for over 3,000 years.

The Cornerstone is not just structural but metaphysical—it embodies the original lie that justified the Tower's existence: "Some truths are too dangerous to be spoken." As long as this lie holds, the Cornerstone endures. But lies cannot support truth forever, and Verity's strength is finally failing.

### Historical Timeline

**Age of Truth (Pre-Tower)**
- Realms existed in honest chaos
- Truth-tellers wandered freely
- Information spread without control
- Some truths caused damage
- Leaders feared losing power

**The First Silence (3000 years ago)**
- Council of Architects formed
- Decided some truths must be suppressed
- Began imprisoning truth-tellers
- Needed permanent solution
- Built the Tower

**The Cornerstone Ritual (2975 years ago)**
- Verity captured and transformed
- First levels constructed on their body
- Original lie established
- System of suppression formalized
- Tower became multiverse's prison

**Centuries of Expansion (2975-500 years ago)**
- Tower grew as more truths needed suppressing
- Cellblocks multiplied
- Categories of prisoners expanded
- What started as "dangerous truths" became "inconvenient truths"
- Then "uncomfortable truths"
- Finally "any truth we dislike"

**The First Cracks (500 years ago)**

- Died knowing Tower would fall
- Lightning began striking more frequently
- Kaldera became Chief Warden

**The Accelerating Collapse (Last 50 years)**
- Cracks spreading from Foundation
- Lightning strikes intensifying
- Entire wings collapsing
- Prisoner unrest increasing
- Cover-ups becoming impossible

**Present Day**
- Party arrives as new Wardens

- Choice point: save or let fall

## The Prison Population

### Categories of Prisoners

- Imprisoned for evidence
- Continue research in cells
- Understand Tower's structure

**Block Thirty-One: The Whistleblowers**
- Exposed corruption
- Revealed official lies
- Betrayed conspiracies
- Most recently imprisoned

### Prisoner Society
Despite imprisonment, a complex society has developed:
- Underground economy trading favors
- Informal courts settling disputes
- Education systems teaching new prisoners
- Resistance cells planning escape
- Collaborators working with Wardens
- Religions of the Fall (belief Tower will collapse and free them)

## The Warden System

### Hierarchy
**Chief Warden**: Ultimate authority, centuries-old Kaldera
**Block Masters**: Control entire cellblocks, includes Thorne
**Senior Wardens**: Experienced guards, includes Corvus
**Wardens**: Standard guards, where party starts
**Initiates**: Trainees, recent recruits

### Warden Culture
- Strict discipline and loyalty expected
- Keys as symbol of authority (more keys = higher rank)
- Code of silence about Tower's instability
- Forbidden to question the system
- High turnover due to "accidents"
- Many Wardens become prisoners themselves for asking wrong questions

### The Secret
All senior Wardens know the Tower is collapsing. They maintain the lie to prevent panic. New Wardens (like the party) are kept ignorant until "ready" (compliant enough). Those who discover the truth face a choice: join the cover-up or become prisoners themselves.

## The Lightning's Nature

### What It Is
The Lightning is concentrated revelation energy—truth made tangible. When lies accumulate, truth pressure builds until it must be released explosively. The Tower, built on lies, naturally attracts lightning strikes as truth seeks to shatter falsehood.

### What It Wants
The Lightning is semi-sentient, possessing a will toward revelation. It doesn't hate the Tower personally but must destroy it because that's what truth does to lies. It strikes more frequently as the foundational lie weakens.

### How It Strikes
Not random—each lightning bolt targets a specific lie:
- Personal false beliefs in individuals
- Structural lies in the architecture
- Historical lies in records
- Institutional lies in policies
- The ultimate target: the Cornerstone (the original lie)

### Can It Be Reasoned With?
Yes, but it's like negotiating with physics. The Lightning follows laws: lies attract strikes, truth grounds them. Party can redirect strikes by offering their own false beliefs as targets, or shield lies they want to preserve. But ultimately, lightning must strike somewhere.

## Magic and Powers

### Warden Authority Magic
Wardens wield the Tower's power:
- **Key Magic**: Keys unlock anything, not just cells
- **Architecture Control**: Reshape Tower's interior
- **Prisoner Suppression**: Dampen abilities and rebellion
- **Lightning Rods**: Limited redirection of strikes
- **Stability Maintenance**: Temporarily reinforce structure

Costs: Using Warden magic supports the foundational lie, making user more invested in the system. Overuse makes one unable to leave—becoming part of the Tower like Kaldera.

### Prisoner Liberation Magic
Prisoners develop opposing powers:
- **Truth-Speaking**: Force revelations, attract lightning
- **Structure Weakening**: Break what Wardens build
- **Key Breaking**: Counter Warden authority
- **Unity**: Combine strength through solidarity
- **The Fall Hastening**: Accelerate collapse

Costs: Using prisoner magic damages stability, bringing collapse closer. Can free individuals but endangers everyone.

### Revelation Magic (Lightning-Touched)
Those struck by lightning and surviving gain:
- **Truth-Sight**: See through lies and illusions
- **Lightning Calling**: Summon strikes on falsehoods
- **Revelation Resistance**: Protect truths from exposure
- **Prophetic Flashes**: See consequences of lies
- **Disintegration Touch**: Unmake false structures

Costs: Each use attracts more lightning. Becoming too truth-aligned makes one a target. Ultimate cost: cannot maintain social lies, making society impossible.

### Architect's Legacy Magic
The original builders left behind:
- **Blueprint Reading**: Understand Tower's design
- **Structural Prediction**: Know what will collapse when
- **Ozymandias Communion**: Speak with Architect's ghost
- **Foundation Access**: Reach Cornerstone
- **Rebuild Capacity**: Reconstruct fallen sections

Costs: Understanding the Architects means understanding their crime. Knowledge of how to save the Tower requires accepting the need for its fall.

## The Suppressed Truth

### What Was the Original Lie?
(DM chooses based on campaign needs, options include:)

**Option 1: The Nature of Reality**
- The multiverse is a prison itself
- Tower exists in a Tower exists in a Tower
- Infinite regression
- Breaking free is impossible
- Truth causes existential horror

**Option 2: The Gods Are Dead**
- Deities died millennia ago
- Everything since is automated
- No cosmic justice
- Prayer is speaking to nothing
- Meaning must be self-created

**Option 3: The Architects Were Right**
- Some truths genuinely destroy
- The suppressed knowledge ends civilizations
- Tower prevented apocalypse
- But also prevented growth
- Impossible moral calculus

**Option 4: Everyone Is Guilty**
- All beings have committed Tower-worthy crimes
- Prisoners just got caught
- Wardens are criminals with keys
- System is mass hypocrisy
- No innocents exist

**Option 5: The Tower Creates Truth**
- Reality is consensus-based
- Suppressing ideas unmakes them
- Tower doesn't hide truth, it prevents it from being true
- Revelation doesn't expose, it creates
- Ontological warfare

### Why It Was Suppressed
Whatever the truth, revealing it has massive consequences:
- Societal collapse
- Or liberation
- Or both
- Depends on how revealed
- And who's ready to hear it

- Would it still be the Tower?

### Should the Tower Be Saved?
- Moral question, not practical
- Some prisoners deserve confinement
- But system is corrupted
- Good ends through evil means?
- Or let chaos come?

### What Happens to Kaldera?
- Has maintained lie for centuries

- Or must fall with Tower?
- Choice: villain or tragic figure

### Is Ozymandias a Hero?
- Built Tower knowing it would fall
