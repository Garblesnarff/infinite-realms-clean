# The Tower's Fall
## "When the Lightning Strikes, What Will You Become?"

### Campaign Overview

The Tower is the multiverse's prison, a reality-plane where the guilty, the proud, and the delusional are sent to have their false beliefs shattered. Built impossibly high, its architecture defies physics and reason—inverted spires, rooms that exist in multiple locations simultaneously, stairs that lead to their own beginnings. For millennia, the Tower has stood as the ultimate symbol of authority and punishment, its lightning-crowned peak visible from every other realm in the Arcana.

But something is catastrophically wrong. The Tower is destabilizing. Lightning strikes grow more frequent, more violent. Entire floors collapse into void. Prisoners are escaping into other realms. Reality itself cracks around the Tower's foundation. The party arrives as newly appointed Wardens, tasked with investigating the disturbances and restoring order. What they discover is that the Tower was never meant to stand forever—it was designed to fall.

At the Tower's core lies a terrible truth: every false structure must eventually collapse, including this prison-realm itself. The Tower's architect, the Mad King Ozymandias, built his masterpiece on a foundation of hubris, and that foundation is finally crumbling. As Wardens investigate deeper, they uncover that the collapse is both catastrophe and revelation—the Tower must fall so truth can emerge from the rubble. The party must choose: try to hold together a structure built on lies, or embrace the devastating revelation and let everything come crashing down.

### Core Themes

- **Pride Before the Fall**: Hubris and its inevitable consequences
- **False Structures**: Systems built on lies must eventually collapse
- **Revelation Through Destruction**: Truth often requires shattering illusions
- **Order vs. Chaos**: When rigid control finally breaks
- **The Weight of the Past**: How history's mistakes catch up
- **Transformation Through Catastrophe**: Growth from devastation
