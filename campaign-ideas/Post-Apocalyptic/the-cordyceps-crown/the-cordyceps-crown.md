**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 20-25 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **12-15**
**Tone (keywords):** post-fungal apocalypse, survival, moral darkness, surrogate parent-child, infected, Fireflies, immunity, cure vs. sacrifice
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
Twenty years after a mutant Cordyceps fungus turned most of humanity into violent infected, the party are smugglers surviving in a quarantine zone. They're hired by the Fireflies—a rebel group—to escort a teenage girl named Ellie across the ruined country. Ellie is immune to the infection, and the Fireflies believe they can create a cure from her. What starts as a simple smuggling job becomes a surrogate father-daughter relationship, culminating in an impossible choice: let the Fireflies kill Ellie to maybe save humanity, or doom the world to save one girl you've come to love.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A cross-country journey through infected wastelands and morally bankrupt survivors.

*   **Act I — The Journey Begins (Sessions 1-8):** The party, hardened smugglers in the Boston QZ (Quarantine Zone), agree to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies for supplies. At first, she's just cargo—a sarcastic, tough teenager who's never seen the world outside. As they travel through fungus-choked cities and encounter both infected and desperate human survivors, the party slowly bonds with Ellie. They discover she's immune after being bitten but not turning. Infected aren't the real threat—humans are. Cannibals, military fascists, and bandits are more dangerous than Clickers. The party makes brutal choices to survive, showing Ellie the cost of living in this world.
*   **Act II — The Descent (Sessions 9-16):** The journey takes them west through Pittsburgh (hunter territory), the University (abandoned Firefly post), and finally to Colorado where the Fireflies should be. Each location shows humanity's moral collapse—cannibals, child soldiers, torture. The party and Ellie grow closer despite the darkness. They save each other repeatedly. When they reach the Fireflies, they're gone. Evidence suggests they moved to Salt Lake City. Winter hits, separating the party from Ellie. She survives alone, forced to kill to protect a friend. When reunited, she's changed—harder. The bond is now unbreakable, but the cost is visible.
*   **Act III — The Choice (Sessions 17-25):** They finally reach Salt Lake City and find the Fireflies. Medical tests reveal the truth: Ellie's immunity comes from a mutant strain of Cordyceps in her brain. Creating a vaccine requires removing it—killing her. The Fireflies won't let her choose; they're doing it for "the greater good." The party faces the ultimate decision: let Ellie die to possibly save humanity (the vaccine might not even work), or fight through the Fireflies and doom the world to save her. Most parties choose to save Ellie, massacring the Fireflies in a morally dark rampage. Epilogue: They lie to Ellie about why the cure failed, and she knows they're lying but accepts it because she's also chosen them over the world.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival vs. morality, found family, the cost of love, and whether one person is worth more than humanity. It asks: Would you doom the world to save someone you love? Is there such a thing as "the greater good" when it requires murdering a child? Can you maintain your humanity in an inhumane world? The central conflict pits the party's growing love for Ellie against the possibility of saving humanity through her death.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Resource Scarcity**
*   Ammunition, healing items, and crafting materials are extremely limited
*   Must choose: use resources now or save for later?
*   Crafting system: combine items to make health kits, Molotovs, shivs
*   Scavenging is mandatory—search every building

### 2. **Stealth Emphasis**
*   Direct combat is often fatal—stealth is preferred
*   Listening mode: detect enemies through walls by sound
*   Strangling/silent takedowns to conserve ammo
*   Clickers kill in one hit if they grab you
*   Creating noise attracts infected

### 3. **Infected Types**
*   **Runners:** Recently infected, fast, aggressive, can see
*   **Stalkers:** Hide and ambush, terrifying and smart
*   **Clickers:** Blind, echolocate, one-hit kill, extremely tough
*   **Bloaters:** Tank-like, throw spore bombs, bullet sponges
*   Infection spreads through spores in enclosed areas—gas masks required

### 4. **Human Combat**
*   Humans are smarter than infected—flank, use cover, throw grenades
*   Can be stealthed or talked down (sometimes)
*   Killing humans is narratively weighted—these are desperate people
*   Different factions: Military (disciplined), Hunters (brutal), Cannibals (horrifying)

### 5. **Bonding System**
*   Ellie's trust in the party grows through actions and dialogue
*   Protecting her, teaching her skills, having conversations builds bond
*   Bond affects final choice's emotional weight
*   High bond makes saving Ellie feel inevitable

### 6. **Moral Choice Tracking**
*   No morality meter, but choices affect tone
*   Brutal vs. merciful kills, honesty vs. lies, hope vs. cynicism
*   Affects Ellie's worldview and party's self-perception
*   The final choice is always present: Ellie or humanity

### 7. **Companion AI**
*   Ellie assists in combat—throws bricks, stabs enemies, alerts to danger
*   She's vulnerable—protecting her is a priority
*   NPCs can permanently die if not protected
*   Winter section: play as Ellie with different abilities

### 8. **Environmental Storytelling**
*   Ruins tell stories of the apocalypse—abandoned cars, skeletons, notes
*   Comic books scattered for Ellie to collect (moments of innocence)
*   Graffiti and notes reveal human atrocities and desperate hopes
*   The world building is shown, not told
