# The Crimson Games
**Tagline:** *May the dice be ever in your favor*

## Campaign Overview

In the authoritarian empire of Vermillion, the annual Crimson Games serve as both punishment for the rebellious districts and entertainment for the decadent capital. Twenty-four tributes—two from each of the twelve subjugated territories—are thrust into a magically-constructed arena to fight to the death while the entire realm watches through enchanted scrying orbs. The Games are a brutal reminder of the empire's power after crushing a great rebellion fifty years ago.

The players are tributes selected from their home districts, thrust into a deadly spectacle where survival depends on combat prowess, cunning alliances, clever use of sponsor gifts, and the ability to win favor from the watching audience. As they navigate the shifting dangers of the arena, they'll uncover dark secrets about the empire's magical control systems and discover that the true enemy may not be their fellow tributes, but the rulers who orchestrate this annual bloodbath.

Beyond mere survival, the tributes have the opportunity to become symbols of hope for the oppressed districts, potentially sparking a new rebellion that could burn down the Vermillion Empire from within.

## Core Themes

- **Survival vs. Humanity:** Maintaining moral integrity while forced to kill to survive
- **Spectacle and Exploitation:** The weaponization of entertainment and propaganda
- **Class Warfare:** The stark divide between the privileged elite and oppressed districts
- **Rebellion and Hope:** One person's defiance can inspire revolution
- **Alliance and Betrayal:** Choosing when to trust and when to turn on allies
- **Identity Under Surveillance:** Performing for the cameras while plotting resistance

## Unique Mechanics

**Sponsor System**
- Tributes earn favor through personality, skill displays, and dramatic moments
- Sponsors (wealthy Capital citizens) send gifts via silver parachutes
- Players can actively court sponsors through interview performances
- Gifts cost more as Games progress and tributes dwindle
- Essential items: medicine, food, water, weapons, tools
- Mentors negotiate with sponsors on tributes' behalf
- Clever sponsorship can include intelligence about arena or other tributes

**Audience Favor Mechanic**
- Characters have a Favor score (0-100) tracking audience love
- Cool moments, clever tactics, romance, defiance increase Favor
- Boring play, cowardice, or brutality decreases Favor
- High Favor = more sponsor gifts, better quality items
- Gamemakers manipulate arena to create drama for high-Favor tributes
- "Camera awareness" - players can perform for the watching realm

**Arena Hazards and Gamemaker Interference**
- Random hourly roll for environmental hazards
- Gamemakers create obstacles when Games get boring
- Fire walls, floods, monster releases, supply drops
- Can target specific tributes who displease the Capital
- Arena sections can be destroyed or transformed
- Natural disasters on demand: earthquakes, lightning, wildfire

**Alliance Dynamics**
- Formal alliances give bonuses (shared watch = better rest, combined skills)
- Betrayal opportunities at key moments
- Career Pack (Districts 1, 2, 4) typically forms immediately

- Must eventually turn on allies to win
- Joint victory only possible through rebellion/rule-breaking

- Each year features new horrors designed by Gamemakers

**Death and Revival**
- Fallen tributes are truly dead (resurrection extremely rare)
- Characters should create backup tributes or become mentors/rebels
- Death is permanent and meaningful - raises campaign stakes
- Alternatively: "What-if" scenarios where players see different outcomes

**Skills Training Montage**
- Condensed training sessions with skill check opportunities
- Tributes can learn new proficiencies or improve existing ones
- Performance determines training score (1-12)
