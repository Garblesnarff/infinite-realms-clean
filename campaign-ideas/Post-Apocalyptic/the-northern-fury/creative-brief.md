# Creative Brief: The Northern Fury

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Historical Realism meets Norse Saga

Inspired by Vinland Saga's detailed historical approach, this style combines authentic 11th-century Viking and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics with dramatic storytelling. The world is grounded, gritty, and real—no fantasy flourishes, just the harsh beauty of the North and the brutality of medieval warfare.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Historical Accuracy:** Authentic Viking longships, period-accurate armor and weapons, realistic Norse and Anglo-Saxon architecture.
*   **Natural Beauty:** The stark beauty of Icelandic landscapes, North Sea storms, English countryside—nature as character.
*   **Grounded Violence:** Combat is brutal but realistic—shield walls, axes, blood in the snow—not glorified.
*   **Expressive Faces:** Emotions are raw—rage, grief, determination, the weight of deeds—shown through detailed facial expressions.
*   **Weathered Textures:** Everything is worn—leather cracked, wood weathered, faces scarred by wind and war.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Vikings, historical warfare, revenge quest, moral ambiguity, redemption, Norse culture, raids, pacifism, building vs. destroying.
*   **Feeling:** The cold beauty of the North contrasted with the heat of battle. Quiet moments of reflection after brutal raids. The weight of violence on the soul. Characters wrestling with who they are versus who they want to be.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Characters:** Realistic human proportions and anatomy. Vikings are muscular but not superhuman—functional builds.
*   **Detail:** High detail on period clothing—furs, leather, chainmail, tunics, woolen cloaks.
*   **Weapons:** Historically accurate—bearded axes, seaxes, spears, round shields with simple designs, no over-ornamentation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Norse warrior in authentic 11th-century Viking attire: fur-lined cloak, leather tunic, chainmail shirt, bearded axe and round wooden shield with simple red and white design. Face is weathered and scarred, eyes showing both determination and weariness. Snow falls around them. Realistic historical art style."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant:** Grays, whites, and blues of northern winters; browns and greens of forests and fields; the gray-brown of mud and blood.
*   **Accents:** Deep reds of blood and cloaks, the warm orange of fires, the cold steel of weapons.
*   **Seasonal:** White winters (Iceland), green summers (England), gray seas.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Color palette of cold grays, whites, and blues with accents of blood red and fire orange. A Viking longship on storm-tossed North Sea waves. The ship is brown wood with red and white striped sail. Gray-black storm clouds overhead. Warriors in furs and mail hold axes and shields."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Vikings:** Fur cloaks, leather and mail armor, beards (or clean-shaven), long hair (often braided), practical clothing for cold. Weapons: axes, spears, swords (status symbol).
*   **Anglo-Saxons:** Similar armor but different styles—more helmets, kite shields (later period), different tunic patterns.
*   **Askeladd:** Distinctive—clean-shaven or short beard, intelligent eyes, practical armor, carries himself like a leader.
*   **Canute:** Starts delicate, almost feminine features; later becomes more hardened and regal.
*   **Berserkers (like Bjorn):** Wild appearance, tattoos or war paint, dual axes, feral expressions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Askeladd, a Viking war leader: mid-40s, short dark hair with gray, sharp intelligent eyes, wearing practical leather and mail armor, fur-lined cloak, holding a longsword. His expression is calculating and cynical. He stands on a battlefield with burning village in background. Realistic historical art style."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Iceland:** Volcanic landscapes, snow-covered villages, geysers, stark beauty, wooden longhouses with turf roofs.
*   **The North Sea:** Gray stormy waters, longships with square sails, foam and waves, dramatic skies.
*   **England (1013):** Thatched-roof villages, wooden palisades, stone churches, muddy roads, farmland.
*   **Battlefields:** Shield walls clashing, mud and blood, wounded crawling, burning buildings, realistic medieval combat.
*   **Vinland:** Pristine forests, clear waters, untouched wilderness, hope for new beginning.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Viking raid on an English village: wooden buildings with thatched roofs burning, warriors in shield wall formation clashing with defenders, muddy ground churned by combat, bodies fallen, smoke rising. Realistic, gritty medieval warfare. Overcast sky, late afternoon light."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural lighting—overcast northern skies, low-angle winter sun, firelight at night.
*   **Combat:** Dramatic shadows from fire and sunset; blood stands out against snow or mud.
*   **Emotion:** Lighting reflects mood—cold and distant during violence, warm during moments of humanity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A lone Viking warrior sitting by a campfire at night, removing their helmet. The warm fire light illuminates half their face, showing exhaustion and grief, while the other half remains in shadow. In the background, dark silhouettes of other warriors. Cold stars visible overhead. Intimate, reflective lighting."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Scale of Nature:** Often show humans small against vast landscapes—emphasizing journey and isolation.
*   **Shield Wall Formations:** Wide shots showing organized combat—lines of shields, spears overhead.
*   **Close Character Moments:** Tight shots on faces during emotional beats—showing inner conflict.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Wide-angle shot of an Icelandic landscape: a small Viking longship beached on a black sand shore, snow-covered mountains in background, gray sea and sky. Tiny figures of warriors walking inland. The composition emphasizes the vastness of nature and human insignificance. Realistic, painterly style."

## Voice

A weathered, mature Nordic voice—deep and resonant but capable of quiet introspection. Tone shifts between the hard voice of a veteran warrior (when describing raids and combat) and a softer, reflective tone (when discussing choices and consequences). Pacing is deliberate, like a saga being told around a fire. Environmental sounds include: waves against longship hulls, wind across ice fields, the clash of shields and axes, fires crackling in longhouses, the creak of oars in rowlocks. Underlying everything is the question: "You have no enemies. No one has enemies." The voice carries the weight of deeds done and the possibility of redemption.
