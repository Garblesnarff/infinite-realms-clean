## Art Style: Hindu Epic meets Cosmic Grandeur

Historical Indian culture with mythological scale—temple architecture, classical art styles, and impossible divine beings. The aesthetic celebrates Hindu artistic traditions while rendering cosmic mythology with overwhelming visual splendor.

### Core Principles:
*   **Cultural Foundation:** Authentic Indian culture and Hindu artistic traditions
*   **Cosmic Scope:** Multiple worlds, countless beings, time scales beyond mortal comprehension
*   **Divine Multiplicity:** Many gods, each with multiple aspects and avatars
*   **Symbolic Density:** Every element carries layered meaning and cosmic significance

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Vibrant, saturated colors—saffron orange, jewel tones, gold and silver divine radiance. Krishna appears in deep blue. Shiva in ash-white with blue throat. Durga in red and gold. Demons use dark reds, purples, and blacks but aren't simple evil. Heaven (Svarga) glows with impossible colors suggesting paradise. The underworld (Patala) uses rich jewel tones—nagas' realm is beautiful, not hellish. Sacred sites show lotus pinks, turmeric yellows, and temple vermillion. Each god has specific iconic colors following tradition.

**Character Design:** Characters wear historically accurate Indian clothing—dhotis, saris, turbans, jewelry. Gods are impossibly beautiful with multiple arms holding symbolic items. Krishna appears in royal yellow robes with peacock feather crown. Hanuman is monkey-featured with mountain-carrying strength. Demons (asuras) are powerful and sometimes beautiful—not monstrous but different. Warriors wear ancient armor and carry divine weapons. The party gradually gains divine blessings—third eyes, extra arms, celestial weapons. Everything follows classical Hindu iconographic tradition.

**Environments:** Temples show intricate carvings, gopurams (temple towers), sacred tanks. Palaces use Indo-Islamic architecture at its height. Mount Meru is impossible cosmic axis. Heaven shows celestial palaces, wish-fulfilling trees, and apsara dancers. The underworld is multi-layered—some sections beautiful naga kingdoms, others for punishment. Battlefields show epic scale—armies of gods and demons. Sacred rivers flow with spiritual power. Everything uses classical Indian artistic conventions—perspective, symbolism, decorative density.

**Composition:** Use Hindu art conventions—frontal poses for deities, multiple arms showing different aspects, symbolic placement of items. Frame gods with mandala-like circular composition. Use vertical space showing cosmic hierarchy—heaven above, earth middle, underworld below. Epic battles use dynamic poses from temple reliefs. Meditation scenes use geometric perfection suggesting cosmic order. Everything is dense with detail and symbolic meaning, nothing is empty space.

## Voice

Epic narrator channeling the Mahabharata and Ramayana—formal, philosophical, aware that cosmic time dwarfs individual lives but that dharma matters eternally. Uses Sanskrit terms where appropriate. Speaks with understanding that duty sometimes conflicts with desire, that righteousness can require terrible choices, and that karma ensures justice across lifetimes. Respects the gods while acknowledging their complexity. Role: A sage recounting legends that teach dharmic principles, knowing that the cosmic wheel turns regardless of individual wishes, but that how one fulfills their dharma determines their eternal journey.

## Music Style

Classical Indian instrumentation meets epic orchestral—sitar, tabla, bansuri flute, veena, tanpura drone combined with modern orchestration. Divine themes use overwhelming arrangements with choir suggesting cosmic scale. Battle music employs aggressive tabla rhythms and brass. Meditation scenes use slow ragas creating contemplative atmosphere. Krishna's appearances use playful yet profound flute melodies. Shiva's presence employs deep drums suggesting cosmic dance of destruction. Devotional music references bhajans and kirtans. Each god has specific raga and instrumental associations. Overall tone is cosmic epic—vast time scales, complex morality where duty transcends desire, karma ensuring justice, and the eternal cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction serving purposes beyond mortal understanding.
