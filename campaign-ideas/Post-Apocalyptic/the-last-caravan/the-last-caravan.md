**Campaign Type / Genre:** Viking Exodus / Survival Journey / Choices Matter / Permadeath Caravan
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 20-25 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14-16**

**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
When the sun stops in the sky and the world begins dying, the party leads a caravan of hundreds fleeing south seeking refuge from the creeping Darkness consuming the world. They make agonizing choices: allocate scarce supplies, decide who fights and who rests, choose between saving strangers or protecting their own, and navigate political tensions within the caravan. Every decision has permanent consequences—beloved NPCs can die in battles or from starvation, morale affects loyalty, and the caravan's size changes based on choices. The journey culminates at the mythical city of Arberrang where they must decide whether to fight the Darkness, flee further south, or sacrifice everything to save what remains of civilization.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A three-act arc of exodus, survival, and final stand.

*   **Act I — The Exodus Begins (Sessions 1-8):** The sun freezes in sky; eternal twilight falls. The Darkness—a living shadow consuming all life—spreads from the north. The party leads their clan's caravan south with hundreds of refugees. Daily challenges: ration food, treat wounded, maintain morale. Early encounters with Dredge—ancient stone warriors awakening as world dies. Moral choices: rescue strangers and strain supplies or leave them? First major character dies based on party choice. They reach first major city; political intrigue as locals fear refugees.
*   **Act II — The Long Road (Sessions 9-16):** The journey continues through frozen wasteland. The caravan faces: Dredge ambushes, starvation, disease, internal conflicts, rival caravans competing for resources. Major branching choices: ally with or betray other caravans, sacrifice few to save many, execute accused murderers or risk division. Permadeath is constant—NPCs die in battles or from circumstances. The party discovers Bellower—a massive Dredge leader hunting them. Political maneuvering as caravan factions struggle for control. Betrayal is possible.
*   **Act III — Arberrang & The Final Stand (Sessions 17-25):** Caravan reaches Arberrang—last great city. But it's already under siege by Dredge and the Darkness itself. Final choices: Fight to defend city (heroic last stand), help evacuate and flee (survival), or attempt ancient ritual to stop Darkness (risky sacrifice). Major battles against overwhelming Dredge forces. The Bellower arrives for climactic confrontation. Final choice: Sacrifice beloved character to complete ritual, or accept world's end. Multiple endings based on cumulative choices—from pyrrhic victory to total annihilation.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of leadership under impossible odds, trolley problem choices, permadeath consequences, and sacrifice for the greater good. It asks: Who deserves to be saved? Is sacrificing few for many justified? How much of yourself do you lose making impossible choices? The central conflict pits the party's desire to save everyone against brutal reality that some must die for others to live.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Caravan Management**
*   Track caravan population: starts at 200+, changes based on choices
*   Three resources: Supplies (food), Morale (loyalty), Renown (reputation)
*   Daily decisions: Ration supplies (affects morale), rest vs. push on (affects health), recruit vs. conserve
*   Caravan size affects: combat strength, supply consumption, political power
*   Can grow or shrink dramatically—from 500 to 50 based on campaign

### 2. **Permadeath System**
*   All named NPCs can die permanently
*   Death sources: combat, starvation, disease, execution, sacrifice
*   Certain choices guarantee specific NPC deaths
*   No resurrection—death is final and mourned
*   Surviving NPCs reference the dead; emotional weight accumulates

### 3. **Difficult Choice System**
*   Regular branching choices with no "correct" answer
*   Examples: Save child but lose supplies, or leave child to preserve caravan? Execute accused murderer or risk caravan unity? Ally with raiders or fight them?
*   Choices have cascading consequences sessions later
*   Some choices are on timers—must decide quickly
*   Party may disagree; consensus or leadership decision required

### 4. **Morale & Loyalty**
*   Morale tracks caravan's hope and loyalty to party
*   Affected by: supply rations, victories vs. defeats, leadership choices
*   Low morale causes: desertion, rebellion, betrayal, reduced combat effectiveness
*   High morale grants: bonuses in combat, better recruitment, political influence
*   Can lose leadership if morale drops too low

### 5. **Turn-Based Tactical Combat**
*   Grid-based combat similar to chess
*   Different unit types: Varl (giant tanky warriors), humans (versatile), Dredge (stone enemies)
*   Strength = both HP and damage (wounded units hit weaker)
*   Armor must be broken before dealing health damage
*   Permadeath possible—wounded units who fall in battle may die permanently

### 6. **Supply Scarcity**
*   Supplies deplete daily based on caravan size
*   Must find supplies: hunt (risky), trade (expensive), raid (immoral), find caches (rare)
*   Rationing choices: Full rations (morale boost, fast depletion), Half rations (neutral), Quarter rations (morale drop, slow starvation)
*   Starvation causes: morale loss, weakness, eventually death
*   Impossible math: never enough supplies for everyone

### 7. **The Darkness**
*   World-ending phenomenon spreading from north
*   Consumes everything: land turns to ash, living things wither
*   Cannot be fought conventionally—must be stopped through ritual or fled
*   Pressure: forces caravan south on timeline; cannot rest indefinitely
*   Possibly caused by gods' death or ancient magic failure
