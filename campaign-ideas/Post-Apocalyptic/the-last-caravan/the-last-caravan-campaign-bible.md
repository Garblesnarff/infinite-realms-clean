# Campaign Bible: The Last Caravan

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Thirsting God
The world was once a lush, vibrant water-world, watched over by a single, benevolent ocean deity. A civilization of powerful sun-worshipping mages, believing the ocean was a blight that blocked the sun's true glory, devised a grand ritual. They did not intend to destroy the world, but to "evaporate" the ocean into the heavens, creating a world of endless, cloudless sun. The ritual succeeded too well. The ocean deity was boiled away, its divine essence turned into a vapor of pure salt and sorrow. This "Salt-God's Ghost" now haunts the endless desert, an invisible, thirsty entity that drains the moisture from any living thing it passes over. The "Great Evaporation" was not an apocalypse; it was a failed terraforming project. The Last Caravan is not just a group of survivors; it is a pilgrimage, a mobile monastery carrying the last remaining sample of "True Water" from the original ocean, seeking the mythical, sub-aquatic "Well of Origin" to resurrect the dead god.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-1000 Y (The Sun-King's Reign):** The Sun-King Theron unites the coastal empires and declares the ocean an enemy of progress.
2.  **-500 Y (The Great Ritual):** The sun-mages begin the century-long ritual to evaporate the seas.
3.  **-400 Y (The Great Evaporation):** The ritual completes. The ocean boils away in a single, catastrophic day. The Salt-God's Ghost is born. 99% of all life perishes.
4.  **-399 Y (The First Caravan):** The survivors, led by a repentant sun-mage, gather the last drops of True Water and form the first caravan.
5.  **-350 Y (The Rise of the Wreckers):** Descendants of those who hid underground during the Evaporation emerge. They see the surface dwellers as fools and begin a culture of raiding.
6.  **-200 Y (The Sand-Ship Revolution):** The invention of the sand-ship allows for faster travel and the formation of larger, mobile cities.
7.  **-100 Y (The Mirage Wars):** A powerful psychic, the first Mirage-Eater, learns to control the desert's mirages, creating phantom armies and illusory oases, leading to a generation of warfare based on deception.
8.  **-50 Y (The Day of Red Sand):** A massive, unnatural sandstorm, believed to be the Salt-God's wrath, scours an entire Wrecker empire from the map.
9.  **-10 Y (The Schism):** The Last Caravan splits in two over a disagreement on the path to Eden. The splinter group, the "Sun-Seekers," travels east and is never heard from again.
10. **Present Day:** The Last Caravan's Water-Witch has a vision of Eden's location. The Road-Captain declares a final, desperate journey into the uncharted "Glass Sea."

### The "Why": Atonement vs. Survival
The central conflict is a struggle between the caravan's two founding principles. The **Path of Atonement**, followed by the mystics and priests, dictates that their true purpose is to find Eden and restore the ocean, atoning for their ancestors' sins. The **Path of Survival**, followed by the engineers and warriors, argues that their priority is to find a safe haven for humanity, and that the quest for Eden is a suicide mission. This internal conflict is at the heart of every decision the caravan makes: do they risk everything for a chance at redemption, or do they secure their own future at the cost of the world's soul?

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Vehicular Combat
*   **Vehicles:** Each vehicle has its own stat block: HP, AC, Speed, and "Hardpoint" slots for weapons or upgrades.
*   **Roles:** Players take on roles in their vehicle: The **Driver** makes skill checks to maneuver. The **Gunner(s)** operate the weapons. The **Mechanic** can make repairs mid-combat. The **Lookout** spots hazards and targets.
*   **Actions:** Combat is fast and narrative. Instead of a grid, it's based on relative positions (e.g., "side-by-side," "in pursuit"). Actions include "Ram," "Board," "Harpoon," and "Sideswipe."

### Subsystem: Thirst & Resources
*   **Water is Life:** Water is the most valuable resource, more so than gold. It's tracked for the whole caravan.
*   **Thirst:** Every day spent in the deep desert requires a CON save. Failure results in a level of exhaustion. This DC increases in the Salt Flats.
*   **Fuel & Scrap:** The caravan's two other main resources. Fuel determines how far the caravan can travel. Scrap is used by the Gear-Heads to make repairs and upgrades. Players' actions on missions directly impact these resource pools.
