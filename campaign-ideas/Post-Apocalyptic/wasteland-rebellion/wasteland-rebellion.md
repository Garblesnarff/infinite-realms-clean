## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A high-octane rebellion against corporate control through tank warfare and punk attitude.

*   **Act I — Welcome to the Wasteland (Sessions 1-7):** The party starts as prisoners or low-level rebels when Water & Power raids their settlement, killing innocents and stealing water reserves. They're rescued by Tank Girl, an anarchic warrior who fights the corporation from her weaponized tank. Joining her crew and meeting the Rippers (bioengineered kangaroo soldiers), they learn about the vast conspiracy—Water & Power created the drought, killed the world, and now controls survival itself. Their first raids are chaotic successes building toward liberating a water pipeline.
*   **Act II — Ripper Revolution (Sessions 8-13):** The party discovers Ripper City, where kangaroo mutants were created and then abandoned by Water & Power. Forming alliances with Ripper warriors, they expand their rebellion, liberating water slaves and destroying W&P infrastructure. The megalomaniacal Kesslee (W&P's enforcer) becomes obsessed with destroying Tank Girl specifically. The party acquires bigger tanks, more weapons, and stranger allies while the war escalates from raids to full battles.
*   **Act III — Aqua Armageddon (Sessions 14-20):** Water & Power's ultimate weapon is revealed—they're draining the last aquifer to power a doomsday device. The party must assault W&P's fortress headquarters, battling through armies of corporate soldiers and Kesslee's elite forces. The final battle involves tank warfare, infiltration, explosive sabotage, and punk rock triumph. Victory destroys the monopoly, freeing water for everyone, and establishes Tank Girl's philosophy: chaos is better than control.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of resource monopoly, corporate tyranny vs. anarchic freedom, bioengineering ethics, and punk rebellion against authority. It asks: Can chaos be better than oppressive order? Who owns resources everyone needs to survive? Can creatures made as weapons choose their own purpose? The central conflict pits the party's desire for freedom and justice against Water & Power's total control, with the question of whether violent rebellion is justified when survival is at stake.
