### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Wasteland Sovereign**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party is summoned to be heroes by the vain Goddess of Beauty, but she's horrified by their "ugly" appearances and banishes them to the monster-filled Wasteland expecting them to die. Instead, they discover they're absurdly overpowered, the "monsters" are intelligent refugees desperate for leadership, and they have a talent for building civilization in impossible conditions. The campaign follows their creation of a thriving outcast nation, becoming more successful than the goddess ever imagined, and deciding whether to forgive or repay her cruelty.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the rise of Goddess Aristia and her cult of beauty, how she gained divine power through worship and maintains it through hero summoning.
    *   Write the history of the Wasteland, once a thriving ancient civilization destroyed in a divine war, now considered uninhabitable.
    *   Describe the "monster" races—orcs, dragons, arachne, and others—and their persecution by human kingdoms.
    *   Explain the hero summoning system: Aristia brings people from other worlds, grants blessings based on her arbitrary judgment, and uses them as champions.
    *   Detail the kingdoms of beauty: human nations that practice appearance-based discrimination as religious doctrine.
    *   Write about the demon lord and the actual history of demon-human conflict (very different from Aristia's propaganda).
    *   Describe the Wasteland's unique magic that amplifies power in those who survive there, explaining why the party becomes so strong.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Asora - The Sovereign's Nation** (Major)

        *   **Public Agenda:** Accept all refugees regardless of species, build prosperous society, maintain independence.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Prove that merit-based society is superior to appearance-based judgment. Many citizens want revenge on the kingdoms that persecuted them.
        *   **Assets:** Wasteland empowerment, diverse population with unique skills, advanced magic-technology, overpowered leaders, strategic location.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with demon lord (pragmatic peace), hostile to kingdoms initially, secret trade with moderate merchants, feared and admired by refugees everywhere.
