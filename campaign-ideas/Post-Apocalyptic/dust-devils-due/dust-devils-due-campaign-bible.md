## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Weeping Sun
History books claim the "Great Scouring" was a climate shift or a war, but the truth is far stranger. A century ago, the **Aether-Barons of Aeridor** attempted to "drill" into the sun to harvest raw fusion-thaumaturgy. They didn't just break the atmosphere; they cracked the metaphysical barrier between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire. The sun didn't just get hot; it *woke up*. It "wept" tears of plasmatic sorrow upon the earth, boiling the oceans instantly and turning the soil into glass and ash. The "Weather-Engine" was not built to control rain—it was a desperate, failed muzzle built to gag a screaming star.

### Timeline of the Scoured Century
1.  **-100 B.S. (Before Scouring):** Aeridor finishes the "Solar Siphon."
2.  **0 A.S. (The Scouring):** The Siphon activates. The oceans boil away in 48 hours. The "Drowning Air" suffocates 80% of life.
3.  **05 A.S. (The Glass Age):** Survivors dwell in caves; the surface is molten glass.
4.  **22 A.S. (The Cooling):** The glass shatters into sand. The first "Dust-Runners" emerge using wind-sails.
5.  **30 A.S. (The Year of Raining Teeth):** A surreal atmospheric anomaly drops millions of calcified molars from the sky. Origin unknown. Cults form.
6.  **45 A.S. (Rust-Rock Founded):** "Iron-Jaw" Miller finds the Eternal Spring inside a crashed orbital station.
7.  **67 A.S. (The Clockwork Plague):** Nanites from the ruins infect humans, turning skin into brass gears. The infected are exiled to the "Gear-Wastes."
8.  **88 A.S. (The Silence):** The Maelstrom forms in the West. All radio contact with the Western Continent ceases.
9.  **99 A.S. (The Mirage War):** Two oasis towns fight a war over a lake that turned out to be a mass hallucination caused by heat-psychosis.
10. **100 A.S. (Current Day):** Professor Finch hires the party.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The world is dying because the **Spirit of the Earth** has retreated into the core to hide from the **Weeping Sun**. Magic is erratic because it is now "Solar-Tainted"—spells burn the caster. The conflict exists because the Children of the Scouring believe the Earth *wants* to die to escape the Sun's gaze, while the Scholars believe they can build a "Mirror-Shield" to blind the Sun.
