# The Virgin Queen's Legacy - World-Building Specification

## Tudor England (1533-1603)
Religious turmoil (Catholic/Protestant), European power struggles, New World exploration, Renaissance culture.

## Factions
- **Elizabethan Court**: Privy Council, favorites, factions
- **Protestant Militants**: Want harsher anti-Catholic measures
- **Catholics**: Hidden recusants, foreign plots
- **Spain**: Major enemy, Catholic champion
- **France**: Sometimes enemy, sometimes ally (complicated)
- **Parliament**: Growing power, marriage pressure

## Religious Context
**Henry VIII**: Broke with Rome (personal, not theological)
**Edward VI**: Protestant reforms
**Mary I**: Catholic restoration, persecution
**Elizabeth I**: Protestant settlement, middle way
- Via Media: Neither Catholic nor Puritan extreme

## Major Events
- **Spanish Armada** (1588): Decisive naval victory
- **Mary's Execution** (1587): Removes rival, provokes Spain
- **Essex Rebellion** (1601): Former favorite turns traitor
- **Exploration**: Drake circumnavigates, Raleigh colonizes

## Elizabethan Culture
- **Theatre**: Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson—public playhouses
- **Poetry**: Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare's sonnets
- **Music**: Madrigals, Byrd, Tallis
- **Architecture**: Great houses, E-shaped buildings
- **Fashion**: Ruffs, jewels, sumptuary laws

## Intelligence
**Walsingham's Network**: Spies across Europe, cipher-breaking, plot detection
**Catholic Plots**: Ridolfi, Throckmorton, Babington—all uncovered

## Gender Dynamics
Elizabeth ruled successfully despite being woman. Strategies:
- "Virgin Queen" identity: Married to England
- Used marriage negotiations politically
- Surrounded by male advisors but made own decisions
- Balanced feminine imagery (virgin, weak) with masculine (king's heart)

## Succession
Tudor dynasty ends with Elizabeth (no children). Stuart dynasty (James VI & I) begins. English Civil War (1640s) decades later.

## Causality Chains
1. **Mary's Execution**: Triggers Spanish Armada
2. **Marriage Refusal**: No heir, but political independence
3. **Armada Victory**: England ascendant vs. Spain declining
4. **Essex Rebellion**: Tests Elizabeth's resolve in old age
5. **Smooth Succession**: James prevents civil war

## Legacy
- Golden Age of English culture
- Protestant settlement lasts
- Naval power foundation
- Strong monarchy model
- Woman ruler who succeeded absolutely
