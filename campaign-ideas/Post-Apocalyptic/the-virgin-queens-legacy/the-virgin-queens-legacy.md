# The Virgin Queen's Legacy
*Navigate court intrigue, religious conflict, and European power politics to forge England's Golden Age*

## Campaign Overview

Elizabeth I (1533-1603) ruled England for 45 years, transforming a divided, threatened island into a global power and cultural force. Born a bastard princess, surviving religious purges and sibling rivalry, she ruled alone—never marrying despite constant pressure—and defeated the Spanish Armada, sponsored Shakespeare and Drake, and established Protestantism permanently. This campaign explores political survival, religious warfare, gender and power, cultural flowering, and building legacy through careful statecraft.

The party serves as Elizabeth's Privy Council—advisors, spies, diplomats, and fixers. Navigate court factions, Catholic/Protestant conflicts, marriage negotiations (constant), assassination plots, naval warfare, colonial expansion, and the question: Can a woman rule successfully in a man's world? (She proved yes.)

## Core Themes
- **Gender and Power**: Woman ruler in patriarchal age
- **Political Survival**: Staying alive and crowned in dangerous times
- **Religious Compromise**: Protestant settlement, tolerance (for era)
- **Marriage Politics**: Refusing to marry as strategic choice
- **Naval Power**: From threatened island to sea power
- **Cultural Renaissance**: Shakespeare, Marlowe, Spenser—Elizabethan Age
