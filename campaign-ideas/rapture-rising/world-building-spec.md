# Rapture Rising - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

**1946**: Andrew Ryan builds Rapture after fleeing Soviet Russia, rejecting both communism and Western regulation. "No gods or kings, only man."

**1946-1958**: Golden age. Scientists, artists, industrialists create underwater paradise. Genetic research without ethics committees leads to ADAM discovery.

**1958**: Fontaine Futuristics introduces Plasmids. ADAM addiction spreads. Class divisions emerge between ADAM-haves and have-nots.

**New Year's Eve 1958-1959**: Civil war erupts. Atlas (Fontaine) leads "revolution." Splicers created en masse. Rapture collapses into chaos.

**1960-Present**: Sealed city ruled by madmen. Surface world believes Rapture myth. Party's arrival disturbs balance.

## Factions

### Ryan Loyalists
Believe in Objectivist principles despite everything. Hold key facilities. Led by Andrew Ryan from Hephaestus. Paranoid, desperate, idealistic.

### Atlas's Army
Supposedly working-class rebellion, actually Fontaine's pawns. Control Neptune's Bounty and slums. Fighting Ryan but following another tyrant.

### Splicers (Independents)
ADAM-addicted insane. No unified goals beyond survival and next fix. Various types based on Plasmid abuse: Thuggish (melee), Leadhead (guns), Spider (walls/ceilings), Houdini (teleport).

### Little Sisters & Big Daddies
Symbiotic pairs. Girls harvest ADAM, protectors destroy threats. Not aligned with factions—purely instinctual. Most dangerous when Sister threatened.

### Remaining Scientists
Tenenbaum seeking redemption, Sinclair pursuing profit, various others hiding in laboratories. Information brokers and quest-givers.

## Locations Detail

**Welcome Center**: Andrew Ryan's vision preserved. "I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question..." Audio-visual presentation of Rapture's founding. Evidence of first riots.

**Kashmir Restaurant**: Frozen celebration. Bodies at tables mid-toast. Champagne and blood. Splicer ambush location.

**Medical Pavilion**: Surgery theaters running automated. Dr. Steinman's "beautiful" victims. Aesthetic horror—vanity transformed into nightmare.

**Neptune's Bounty**: Smuggling operation. Flooded sections. Evidence of Fontaine's criminal empire before "death." Shark-Splicers in flooded areas.

**Arcadia**: Glass-domed forest. Druids worship trees. Poisoned oxygen supply must be restored or entire city suffocates. Peaceful respite turned desperate.

**Fort Frolic**: Sander Cohen's murder-art gallery. Frozen victims as sculptures. Theater with corpse audience. Musical boss fight.

**Hephaestus**: Volcanic core. Geothermal power. Ryan's fortress. "A man chooses, a slave obeys" confrontation room.

**Proving Grounds**: Where party becomes Big Daddy. Surgical horror. Bonding process to Little Sister. Point of no return physically.

**Fontaine Futuristics**: Final dungeon. ADAM processing, genetics lab, Fontaine's penthouse. Reveals entire conspiracy.

## ADAM System

**Discovery**: Sea slugs produce genetic stem cells allowing instant biological modification. Found only near Rapture.

**Plasmids**: Injectable genetic modifications granting superpowers. Limited by biology—too many cause insanity.

**Little Sisters**: Orphans implanted with slug, harvest ADAM from corpses (reclaiming genetic material from dead Splicers).

**Big Daddies**: Humans stripped of humanity, surgically fused with diving suits, bonded to protect Little Sisters. Various types: Rosie (rivet gun), Bouncer (drill), Rumbler (missiles).

**Addiction Mechanics**: Using Plasmids requires ADAM. Getting ADAM requires harvesting or finding corpses. Moral economy of power.

**Mutation Tracking**: Physical corruption from overuse. Glowing veins, deformities, eventually Splicer transformation.

## Technology

**Architecture**: Impossible underwater city held together by advanced materials and sheer will.

**Security**: Automated turrets, cameras, bots (all hackable). Security Chief Sullivan's systems still partially functional.

**Vita-Chambers**: Respawn technology using genetic backup. Explains why death isn't permanent. Can be turned against party.

**Bathyspheres**: Transport between districts. Sabotaged ones crash, functional ones are lifelines.

**Plasmid-Enhanced Tools**: Wrench conducting electricity, chemical thrower, crossbow, grenade launcher, shotgun, machine gun, all enhanced by powers.

## Audio Diaries (Key Revelations)

Scattered recordings reveal Rapture's history through first-person accounts. Major discoveries:
- Fontaine faked death in Department Store explosion
- Jasmine Jolene was Fontaine's lover, murdered by Ryan
- Little Sisters are kidnapped orphans (Yi Suchong's creation)
- "Would you kindly" trigger phrase created by Suchong for Fontaine
- Party's existence as genetically programmed sleeper agent
- Ryan knew he'd lose but chose death over compromise

## Moral Philosophy

**Objectivism Critique**: Ryan's "no altruism" paradise becomes hell when no one helps anyone. "Parasite" vs. "producer" rhetoric destroys community.

**Collectivism Corruption**: Atlas preaches equality while pursuing power. Working-class hero is con man.

**Free Will Question**: If party was programmed to obey "would you kindly," were choices ever real? Breaking conditioning is triumph.

**Power's Cost**: Every Plasmid upgrade, every harvested Little Sister increases power and decreases humanity. Mechanical representation of moral decay.

## Endings Detailed

**Good Ending**: Rescue all 21 Little Sisters. Eleanor and children escape to surface with party. Sacrifice power for humanity. Hopeful.

**Neutral Ending**: Mix of harvest/rescue. Some children saved, some killed. Party escapes but haunted. Bittersweet.

**Evil Ending**: Harvest all Sisters. Party becomes powerful monster. Either rules Rapture's ruins or invades surface. Dark victory.

**Sacrifice Ending**: Destroy Rapture to prevent ADAM reaching surface. Party dies heroically ensuring horrors stay buried.

**New Rapture Ending**: Kill both Ryan and Fontaine. Attempt to rebuild. Becomes new tyrant or idealist—unclear which. Ambiguous.

## NPC Roster Extended

**Yi Suchong**: Dead scientist whose recordings reveal Little Sister creation and mind control. Killed by Big Daddy protecting his daughter.

**Sofia Lamb**: Collectivist psychologist, Eleanor's mother. Imprisoned by Ryan. Can be released—becomes ally or new threat.

**Peach Wilkins**: Crime boss loyal to Fontaine. Controls Pauper's Drop. Can be bargained with or eliminated.

**Security Chief Sullivan**: Maintains automated defenses. Audio diaries show descent from lawman to paranoid killer.

**Grace Holloway**: Jazz singer operating underground railroad for Little Sisters. Tenenbaum's ally.

**Stanley Poole**: Journalist who destroyed Arcadia through investigation that was actually sabotage. Coward seeking redemption.

## Campaign Customization

**Party Integration**: Adapt based on party composition. Scientists understand tech faster. Criminals identify with Fontaine. Idealists sympathize with Ryan's original vision.

**Moral Alignment**: Track individual member choices with Little Sisters. Same party can have mixed alignments by end.

**Power Temptation**: Offer specific Plasmids matching character concepts. Fire mage equivalent = Incinerate. Rogue = Hypnosis. Warrior = Armored Shell.

**Connection to Surface**: Who sent party? Government black ops? Rival corporation? Ryan's secret call for help? Changes context of everything.
