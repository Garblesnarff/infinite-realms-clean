# Rapture Rising - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

Art Deco underwater dystopia. 1940s-60s retro-futurism meets body horror. Emphasis on decay—beauty corrupted, paradise drowned, ideals rotted. Contrast between pristine architecture and grotesque inhabitants.

**Visual Identity**: Gold and brass Art Deco + pools of blood + water everywhere + bioluminescent glow from ADAM.

## Color Palettes

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme**: 1940s big band music corrupted by underwater echoes, vinyl scratches, distortion. Jazz standards playing while Splicers hunt.

**Environmental Audio**: Constant water dripping, metal groaning, pressure warnings, distant screaming, Little Sister singing nursery rhymes.

**Combat Music**: Period music intensifying with industrial percussion and synthesized horror.

**Character Themes**:
- **Ryan**: Pipe organ, grandiose and hollow
- **Fontaine/Atlas**: Irish folk twisted sinister
- **Little Sisters**: Music box, childlike and haunting
- **Big Daddy**: Deep brass, mechanical breathing

## Voice Direction

**Andrew Ryan**: Armin Shimerman's articulate menace, measured cadence, philosophical even while murderous.

**Atlas/Fontaine**: Irish charm shifting to Brooklyn gangster, revealing deception through vocal shift.

**Little Sisters**: Child voices too sweet, uncanny valley innocence asking "Are you an angel?"

**Splicers**: Incoherent rambling, 1940s slang, sudden screaming, talking to hallucinations.

## Player Experience Goals

Atmospheric horror meets moral philosophy. Every choice has weight. Power tempts but corrupts. Wonder mixed with revulsion.
