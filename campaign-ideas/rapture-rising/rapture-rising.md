# Rapture Rising
*No gods or kings, only man... and monsters*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers a mysterious lighthouse on a remote island leading to a bathysphere descent into Rapture—an underwater utopia built in 1946 by industrialist Andrew Ryan as a refuge from government control. What was meant to be an Objectivist paradise has descended into chaos: the genetic modification drug ADAM has transformed citizens into insane Splicers, genetically engineered Little Sisters harvest genetic material from corpses, and hulking Big Daddies protect them.

The party must navigate this Art Deco nightmare, choosing between harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters, uncovering the conspiracy that destroyed Rapture, and deciding whether the underwater city should be saved, abandoned, or destroyed. They'll confront Ryan's failed philosophy, the mysterious Atlas leading survivors, and the terrible truth about their own connection to this sunken hell.

## Core Themes

- **Objectivism vs. Collectivism**: Ayn Rand's philosophy taken to dystopian extreme
- **Free Will vs. Control**: "Would you kindly" question if choices are truly ours
- **Scientific Ethics**: Genetic modification without moral restraints
- **Class Warfare**: Paradise that promised equality, delivered hierarchy
- **Addiction and Degradation**: ADAM as metaphor for power's corruption

## Unique Mechanics

**Plasmid Powers (Genetic Abilities)**:
- **Electro Bolt**: Lightning attacks, hack machines
- **Incinerate**: Flame projection, melt ice
- **Telekinesis**: Move objects, throw projectiles
- **Winter Blast**: Freeze enemies solid
- **Insect Swarm**: Summon aggressive bees
- **Enrage**: Turn enemies against each other
- **Hypnotize**: Temporary mind control

**ADAM Economy**:
- Harvest Little Sisters: 160 ADAM each (they die)
- Rescue Little Sisters: 80 ADAM each (they survive)
- Spend ADAM on Plasmid upgrades and new powers
- More ADAM = more power but more corruption

**Physical Mutations**:
Track ADAM corruption. High use causes:
- Visible veins glowing under skin
- Deformities and scarring
- Mental instability
- Risk becoming Splicer (losing character to DM control)

**Hacking Mini-Game**:
Security systems, vending machines, turrets can be hacked for advantage. Risk of triggering alarms or shocks.

**Environmental Combat**:
- Electrify water to shock enemies
- Ignite oil spills
- Shoot explosive canisters
- Use security systems against foes

**Audio Diary Collection**:
Finding recordings unlocks backstory and grants XP. Completionists get full picture of Rapture's fall.

**Moral Choice System**:
Every Little Sister is choice. Save all for good ending. Harvest some for neutral. Harvest all for dark ending with most power.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Mind Control Revelation**: Party has been controlled by "would you kindly" triggers all along. Decisions weren't truly theirs.

**Atlas is Fontaine**: The Irish revolutionary is actually crime boss using fake accent and philosophy to manipulate.

**Party's Origin**: May be genetically engineered to infiltrate Rapture, making them products of the very system they fight.

**Ryan's Sacrifice**: Andrew Ryan allows party to kill him rather than submit, proving his philosophy while showing its bankruptcy.

**The Little Sister Truth**: They're orphans kidnapped and mutated. "Saving" them doesn't restore their humanity entirely.

**Rapture's Inevitable Doom**: City is failing structurally. Saving it requires becoming new Andrew Ryan—replacing one tyrant with another.

**The Surface Conspiracy**: Rapture's location was never truly secret. Surface governments want its technology.

**ADAM Addiction**: Party members using Plasmids heavily begin hearing voices and seeing hallucinations.

## Victory Conditions

**Savior Ending**: Rescue all Little Sisters, defeat Fontaine, escape with Eleanor and children to surface. Humanity intact, power limited.

**Pragmatic Ending**: Mix of harvesting and saving. Defeat Fontaine, escape with some power and some guilt. Balanced outcome.

**Power Ending**: Harvest all Sisters, maximize ADAM. Become superhuman but lose humanity. Escape as monster or rule Rapture's ruins.

**Sacrifice Ending**: Destroy Rapture to prevent its horrors spreading to surface. Party dies ensuring no ADAM technology escapes.

**New Rapture Ending**: Overthrow both Ryan and Fontaine. Establish party as new leaders attempting to fix broken paradise.

## Defeat Conditions

**Spliced**: Too much ADAM use transforms party into Splicers. Become NPCs in Rapture's nightmare.

**Fontaine Ascendant**: Crime boss wins, kills party, uses their bodies to harvest ADAM. Uses power to take over surface world.

**Structural Collapse**: Rapture floods, party drowns in Art Deco tomb. Their investigation doomed the city.

**Surface Intervention**: Military destroys Rapture with party inside to prevent ADAM technology proliferation.

**Lost to Madness**: Even without Splicing, Rapture's horrors break party's minds. They join Splicers voluntarily.
