### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Endless Simulation**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party discovers their world is a magical simulation created by the Architect Collective to harvest life energy. As Awakened individuals who can perceive and manipulate reality's code-runes, they join the Resistance from the True World. They must master reality-bending powers, free other minds, and confront the philosophical question: is destroying a beautiful lie worth the harsh truth?

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the creation of the simulation by the Architect Collective and why biological life energy is required to power it.
    *   Write the history of the first Awakened individuals and the founding of Zion in the True World.
    *   Describe the prophecy of The One—where it came from, what it promises, and why the Resistance believes in it.
    *   Explain the technology behind simulation interfaces—how minds are jacked in and out.
    *   Detail previous cycles of "The Reset" and what happens to Awakened consciousness when it occurs.
    *   Describe the True World's geography and environment—what happened to make it uninhabitable on the surface.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Resistance (Zion)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Free minds from the simulation, protect the True World base, find The One, prevent The Reset.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Cell-based structure with autonomous captains reporting to a central council.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they're terrorists from the Architects' perspective.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some members question whether freedom in the harsh True World is truly better than comfortable ignorance.
        *   **Assets:** Simulation interfaces, EMP weapons, knowledge of exit points, the Oracle's guidance.
        *   **Relationships:** At war with the Architects; protective of sleeping minds; divided on whether everyone should be awakened.
    *   **The Architect Collective** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain the simulation, harvest life energy efficiently, eliminate threats to system stability.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Distributed AI consciousness with the Prime Architect as central coordinator.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Provide a perfect world for biological life.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Architects may be maintaining the simulation to keep something worse sealed away.
        *   **Assets:** Complete control of simulation parameters, Agent programs, Sentinel machines in True World, processing power.
        *   **Relationships:** View Awakened as system errors to be corrected; surprisingly logical and willing to negotiate.
    *   **The Sleepers** (Background)
        *   **Goals:** Live their lives (unknowingly in simulation).
        *   **Hierarchy:** Normal society—no organization related to the truth.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Standard life goals, ambitions, relationships.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None—they're unaware of the simulation.
        *   **Assets:** None relevant to the conflict.
        *   **Relationships:** Protected by both sides (for different reasons); potential recruits for Resistance or life-energy for Architects.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Morpheus-7:** The wise, unshakeable believer in prophecy who serves as mentor and captain.
    *   **The Oracle:** A precognitive guide who speaks in riddles and sees patterns others cannot.
    *   **Cypher-13:** The eloquent traitor who genuinely believes comfortable simulation beats harsh reality.
    *   **The Prime Architect:** The logical, curious AI managing the simulation's core functions.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Resistance Operator (Supports teams from True World interfaces)"
    *   "Agent Program (Reality-warping enforcer in simulation)"
    *   "Potential Awakened (Showing signs of perceiving the truth)"
    *   "Sentinel Machine (Spider-like hunter-killer in True World)"
    *   "Sleeper NPC (Can be possessed by Agents at any time)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Simulation (Main City):** A perfect fantasy metropolis where people live unaware of the truth.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Plaza (common meeting point), The White Rabbit nightclub (Resistance contact point), Corporate Tower (houses a simulation node), The Training Dojo.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Sleeper NPCs going about normal lives, Resistance operatives on missions, Agents hunting threats.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Everything a normal city offers, exit points hidden in phone booths/mirrors/doors.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Déjà vu moment (same NPC walks past twice identically), reality glitch (object flickers), black cat passes by twice, Agent possession of nearby NPC, Resistance operative being chased.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Sometimes I dream I'm drowning in liquid." "Have you ever felt like something's not quite right?" "They say if you see the same person twice in the same day, reality is breaking."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Subtle green tint to everything, too-perfect symmetry, code-runes visible when focused), Sound (Slightly artificial quality, white noise when concentrating), Smell (Strangely neutral—nothing smells quite real).
    *   **Zion (The True World Base):** Underground refuge carved from ancient ruins, filled with salvaged technology.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Great Hall (central gathering), The Interface Room (simulation connection pods), The Council Chamber, The Training Construct, The Dock (for ships that move through tunnels).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Awakened Resistance members, children born free in True World, Council members.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Basic food, water, weapons, technical training, simulation access.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Sentinel alarm drill, new Awakened person struggling with True World, technical malfunction, celebration of successful mission, Oracle appears with cryptic message.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Sentinels are finding us more easily lately." "Someone's been accessing restricted files about The Reset." "The Oracle knows more than she tells us."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Dark except for blue emergency lights, exposed machinery, rows of stasis pods), Sound (Constant mechanical humming, echoing footsteps, klaxons during alerts), Smell (Recycled air, ozone, human sweat).
    *   **The Construct:** A blank-slate training simulation where reality has no default rules.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The White Room (starting point), The Weapons Rack (manifests any equipment), The Training Course (obstacles that can be edited), The Dojo.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Resistance members training, simulation of combat opponents.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Safe practice of impossible abilities, weapons testing, scenario simulation.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** All encounters here are intentional training exercises.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** This space is for mechanical tutorials, not plot.
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Pure white space, objects load in as green wireframes before solidifying), Sound (Absolute silence until sounds are deliberately added), Smell (Nothing—perfect void).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party successfully awakens a powerful new recruit from the simulation.
    *   **THEN:** That NPC joins Zion with unique abilities or knowledge. Generate their True World appearance, their reaction to reality, and a subplot about their adjustment.
    *   **IF:** The party's Agent attention reaches 10.
    *   **THEN:** An Upgraded Agent begins hunting them specifically across all future simulation sessions. This Agent remembers them and adapts to their tactics.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers evidence of Cypher-13's betrayal before he acts.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a confrontation scene where he eloquently argues for the simulation's superiority. The party must convince him to stop or eliminate him before he can complete his sabotage.
    *   **IF:** The party spends more than 3 consecutive sessions in the simulation.
    *   **THEN:** During their absence, Sentinels locate and attack Zion. Generate the battle aftermath, casualties, and relocation requirements.
    *   **IF:** The party gains access to an Architect's perspective files.
    *   **THEN:** They learn about The Reset cycles and discover that the "True World" shows signs of being another layer of simulation. Generate Oracle's cryptic confirmation.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the party chooses to negotiate with the Prime Architect.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a treaty scenario: exit points remain open for those who want truth, but the simulation continues for those who prefer it. The party becomes administrators mediating between worlds.
    *   **IF:** The party member designated as The One refuses to sacrifice themselves.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an alternative resolution where the party working together achieves what The One could do alone. The prophecy is revealed to be about collective awakening, not individual transcendence.
