**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
One party member has been living a quiet life as a merchant in the city of Rubicon, built inside massive mining tunnels on the hostile plane of Rust. But when they visit a memory-modification parlor called Rekall for a fantasy vacation, something goes terribly wrong—the implantation triggers hidden memories of a past life as a secret agent for the resistance against the tyrannical Administrator Cohaagen. Now hunted by corporate forces and unsure what's real, the party must travel deep into the Rust Wastes to find the truth, discover an ancient alien reactor that could free the plane's oppressed miners, and decide who they really are.

## What "Medium-High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Paranoid cat-and-mouse chases, combat against corporate mercenaries, harsh environmental hazards, and psychological warfare.
*   **Investigation:** Determining what memories are real, what's been implanted, and what's a false identity requires careful detective work.
*   **Consequences:** The party's identity is in question. Reality itself may be a lie. Their choices determine whether an entire world gains freedom or remains enslaved.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act journey from false life to true purpose.

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1–4):** The party member's memory implantation goes wrong, triggering hidden memories. They're immediately attacked by corporate forces and go on the run. They begin to uncover evidence of a past life they don't remember.
*   **Act II — The Resistance (Sessions 5–8):** The party makes contact with the resistance and learns about Cohaagen's tyranny and the ancient reactor. They execute missions to weaken corporate control while searching for more truth about their identity.
*   **Act III — The Reactor (Sessions 9–12):** The party travels to the forbidden alien ruins to activate the reactor, which will make the plane's atmosphere breathable and end corporate control. They face betrayal, identity revelations, and a final confrontation with Cohaagen.

## Key Locations

1.  **Rubicon:** A massive city built inside mining tunnels, where air is rationed and freedom is an illusion.
2.  **The Rust Wastes:** A deadly desert of red sand and toxic atmosphere, dotted with mining colonies.
3.  **Venusville:** A squalid settlement where miners barely survive, paying for every breath.
4.  **The Alien Ruins:** Ancient structures containing the reactor that could terraform the entire plane.

---

## Central Conflict

The external conflict is a resistance against tyranny—freeing an enslaved population from corporate control. The internal conflict is identity—who is the party member really? Are their memories real? Can you be someone new, or are you trapped by who you were? The campaign explores questions of identity, free will, and whether reality matters if you can't tell what's true.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Memory Reliability**

*   Throughout the campaign, the party member experiences conflicting memories—some implanted, some real, some uncertain.
*   **Mechanics:** Players must decide which memories to trust. DM uses unreliable narrator techniques.

### 2. **Reality Checks**

*   At key moments, the party must make Wisdom saving throws to determine if what they're experiencing is real or an illusion/implanted dream.
*   **Effects:** Failure means they experience a false reality temporarily. Success pierces illusions.

### 3. **Identity Choice**

*   The party member can choose which identity to embrace—their current self, their forgotten past, or forge something new.
*   **Effects:** This choice affects their abilities, relationships, and the campaign's ending.

### 4. **Breathable Air Scarcity**

*   In the Rust Wastes, air is a resource that must be managed.
*   **Mechanics:** Track air supply. Running out causes exhaustion. This emphasizes the tyranny of controlled atmosphere.
