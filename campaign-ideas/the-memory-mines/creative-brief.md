# Creative Brief: The Memory Mines

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Retro-Futuristic Mars Noir (Total Recall-inspired)

Inspired by the aesthetic of *Total Recall*, this style blends 1980s-90s sci-fi design with Martian landscapes, industrial brutalism, and paranoid thriller elements. It aims to capture a world of corporate tyranny, mind-bending reality questions, and the harsh beauty of a red desert world.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Red and Industrial:** The plane of Rust is dominated by red sand, rock, and rust. Industrial mining equipment is everywhere.
*   **Detail the Retrofuturism:** Technology looks advanced but with a retro 80s/90s aesthetic—chunky monitors, physical switches, visible machinery.
*   **Create Paranoia:** Use shadows, reflections, and doubling to suggest uncertain reality and hidden surveillance.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Retro-futuristic, Martian, industrial, paranoid, gritty, red-dominated, mining, oppressive, mind-bending.
*   **Feeling:** The sense that reality itself can't be trusted. Corporate oppression made visible through controlled air and constant surveillance. The harsh beauty of a red desert hiding ancient secrets.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Bold, industrial forms. Chunky retro-futuristic technology. Brutalist architecture carved into red rock.
*   **Textures:** Rusted metal, red sand, rough rock, worn plastic, grimy glass, visible circuitry.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A retro-futuristic industrial interior with chunky 1980s-style technology. Red light filters through dusty windows. Everything feels solid and mechanical."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by reds, oranges, and browns from the Martian environment. Contrasted with institutional grays, whites, and the occasional harsh fluorescent light.
*   **Accent Colors:** Toxic green from faulty tech, deep black shadows, the blue of breathable air indicators.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Red ambient light from the Rust atmosphere, harsh industrial lighting, flickering screens.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...with a color palette dominated by Mars-red and rust-orange, contrasted with institutional gray. Harsh industrial lighting creates deep shadows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical, working-class aesthetics. Miners in rough clothing, corporate agents in crisp uniforms, resistance fighters in scavenged gear.
*   **Breathing Apparatus:** Many characters wear air masks or have visible breathing equipment.
*   **The Protagonist:** Starts looking ordinary (merchant) but gear and weapons from their hidden past gradually emerge.
*   **Mutants:** Some resistance members show mutations from atmospheric exposure.
*   **Expression:** Paranoia, desperation, determination, or cold corporate efficiency.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tough resistance fighter in scavenged armor, wearing a worn breathing mask. Their expression is determined but weary. The red desert stretches behind them."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Industrial mining complexes carved into red rock. Ancient alien ruins half-buried in sand. Squalid settlements where the poor live.
*   **Rubicon:** Massive underground city with visible mining infrastructure, pipes carrying air, corporate propaganda posters.
*   **Rust Wastes:** Endless red desert with massive rock formations, mining equipment, toxic atmosphere.
*   **Alien Ruins:** Smooth, incomprehensible architecture in contrast to human industrial brutalism.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast underground mining city carved into red rock. Massive pipes carry breathable air. Industrial machinery dominates. Corporate propaganda screens glow in the gloom."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast with deep shadows. Red ambient light creating an oppressive atmosphere. Harsh spotlights creating paranoid film noir shadows.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and black, suggesting surveillance and hidden threats.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates paranoia, emphasizes corporate control, and makes viewers question what's hidden in shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by red ambient light from the Martian atmosphere filtering through dust. Harsh spotlights create film noir shadows. The lighting suggests constant surveillance."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Film noir angles, paranoid compositions with reflections and mirrors, low angles showing oppressive architecture.
*   **Techniques:** Use reflections to suggest dual identities, frame characters against corporate propaganda, show the scale of industrial oppression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot of a corporate building carved into red rock, towering over a character in the foreground. The composition emphasizes the oppressive scale of corporate power."

## Voice

A gritty, working-class male voice with a slight Austrian or Eastern European accent—gruff and determined. The pacing is urgent and paranoid, with the cadence of someone who's been running too long and trusts no one. The emotion balances confused desperation (Who am I?) with growing revolutionary fervor (We deserve to breathe free). Audio quality has a slight radio/transmission distortion, suggesting this is being broadcast or recorded. Role: A resistance fighter narrating propaganda for the free air movement, or the protagonist recording their thoughts as they struggle with identity.
