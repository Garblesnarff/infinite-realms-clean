*A Time-Dilation War / PTSD Drama campaign — Long Campaign (12–16 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Lost Battalion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time-Dilation War / PTSD Drama / Anti-War Sci-Fi
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–15**
**Tone (keywords):** alienation, time dilation, PTSD, futile war, changing humanity, lost soldiers, tragic homecoming
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of soldiers in the United Nations Exploratory Force fighting the Taurans, an alien species humanity barely understands, across interstellar distances. Due to relativistic time dilation from near-light-speed travel, every military deployment means returning home decades or centuries later—the party ages months while Earth ages generations. Through brutal combat, the party experiences the horror of endless war while becoming increasingly alienated from a humanity that evolves beyond recognition, eventually discovering the war was started by miscommunication and perpetuated by military-industrial inertia long after both sides wanted peace.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Sessions 1-3 — "Conscription and First Blood"
*   Party drafted (2024 Earth), trained, first combat deployment, return to find Earth changed (now 2050).

### Sessions 4-7 — "The Middle Campaigns"
*   Multiple deployments, each jump forward decades—Earth 2100, 2200, 2350. Society becomes unrecognizable. Relationships impossible.

### Sessions 8-11 — "The Endless War"
*   Party returns to Earth after 1,000 subjective years of service—homosexuality is now universal, heterosexuality extinct, old values meaningless.

### Sessions 12-14 — "The Final Battle"
*   Discover war ended centuries ago by diplomacy, but military kept sending soldiers. Party makes final stand or joins peace.

### Sessions 15-16 — "The Stranger's Return"
*   Party retires to a human colony world, forever displaced from their birth era, reconciling with loss and PTSD.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Time Dilation Tracker**
*   Every interstellar journey advances Earth's calendar by decades/centuries while party ages days/months.
*   **Alienation:** Social interactions with "modern" humans become harder as cultural drift increases.

### 2. **PTSD and Combat Fatigue**
*   Characters accumulate trauma from endless war, affecting mental saves and social interactions.

### 3. **Evolving Technology**
*   Equipment and tactics change each time the party returns—what was cutting-edge is now obsolete.

### 4. **The Forever War Economy**
*   Earth's economy depends on the war continuing, creating political pressure against peace.
