## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20–25 sessions)

A five-act tragedy of ambition, consequence, and the corruption of good intentions.

*   **Act I — The Diagnosis (Sessions 1–5):** The alchemist, Walden, receives a terminal diagnosis from healers who can't cure his magical wasting disease. He meets Jessep, a former student turned petty criminal, and together they begin cooking Blue Crystal in secret. Their first batch is a success, but they attract unwanted attention from local gangs.
*   **Act II — Building the Empire (Sessions 6–10):** Walden and Jessep establish their operation, recruiting allies and eliminating competition. They develop a distribution network and create a front business to launder gold. However, Walden's brother-in-law, a city guard captain, begins investigating the Blue Crystal trade.
*   **Act III — The Cost of Power (Sessions 11–15):** The operation grows too large to hide. Walden's family life crumbles as his lies compound. A rival drug lord, Gus, offers to buy them out or destroy them. Tensions rise as Walden becomes more ruthless, willing to sacrifice anyone to protect his empire and family.
*   **Act IV — The Breaking Point (Sessions 16–20):** Walden's actions lead to tragic consequences—innocent deaths, betrayals, and the destruction of relationships. His partner Jessep tries to escape the life, but is pulled back in. The city guard closes in, and Walden must make impossible choices.
*   **Act V — The Reckoning (Sessions 21–25):** All debts come due. Walden's empire collapses under the weight of his crimes. The final confrontation sees him choosing between saving his family, saving himself, or going down fighting. No ending is happy—only varying degrees of tragedy.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a moral tragedy that explores how good people become monsters through incremental choices. The central question: "How far will you go to protect those you love, and when does protection become selfishness?" Players must navigate not just external threats, but their own complicity in the destruction they cause. Every choice has consequences, and there is no clean path forward—only compromises with increasingly terrible costs.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Morality Descent Track**
*   Characters have a "Breaking Point" meter that increases with morally questionable actions.
*   As the meter rises, characters gain bonuses to Intimidation and Deception but penalties to Insight and Persuasion with good-aligned NPCs.
*   At certain thresholds, characters must make Wisdom saving throws or gain temporary personality shifts (more paranoid, more willing to use violence, etc.).
*   The mechanic is transparent to players—they see themselves changing.

### 2. **The Empire Management System**
*   Players manage their criminal operation between sessions using a simple resource system (Product Quality, Distribution Network, Heat from Law Enforcement, Liquid Assets).
*   Decisions made in management affect what opportunities and threats appear in future sessions.
*   Success isn't just measured in gold, but in how long they can keep their empire running before it inevitably collapses.

### 3. **The Lying Game**
*   When characters lie to important NPCs (family, allies, authorities), they make Deception checks. Success is tracked.
*   The more successful lies to a specific NPC, the harder it becomes to tell them the truth later.
*   Eventually, the truth will emerge—players choose only when and how, not if.

### 4. **The Alchemical Cook**
*   Creating Blue Crystal involves skill challenges combining Arcana, Alchemist's Supplies, and sometimes Performance (to improvise when things go wrong).
*   Higher quality product opens better opportunities but attracts more dangerous attention.
*   Contamination or poor batches create complications and angry customers.
