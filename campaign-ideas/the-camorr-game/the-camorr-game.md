In Camorr, the fantasy equivalent of Venice, the players are the Gentlemen Bastards—an elite crew of con artists who rob the nobility through elaborate schemes while maintaining the Secret Peace that forbids stealing from fellow criminals. Trained by Father Chains in the Thieves' Prosper, the art of long cons and disguise, they pull impossible heists against the richest nobles—until they're betrayed by another criminal who breaks the Peace. Now hunted by both the law and the underworld, they must execute their most audacious con yet: destroying the criminal kingpin who broke their crew, saving the city from a conspiracy that threatens to burn it down, and proving that honor among thieves means something even in a world built on lies.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — The Long Con (Sessions 1–5):** The players execute elaborate cons against Camorr's nobility—impersonating merchants, rigging gambling houses, selling fake treasures. They navigate the Secret Peace (thieves' code), pay tribute to Capa Barsavi (crime lord), and maintain their cover identities. Their mentor Father Chains's lessons about the "Thieves' Prosper" guide them. They pull off increasingly bold heists, but attract attention from both the Spider (mysterious crime lord) and the Gray King (newcomer breaking all the rules). The Gray King murders Capa Barsavi and declares war on the underworld, framing the Gentlemen Bastards for the death.

*   **Act II — The Lies of Locke Lamora (Sessions 6–11):** Hunted by both gangs and the law, the players must survive, discover the Gray King's identity and plan (he's working with the Bondsmage Falconer, a nearly invincible wizard), and protect their few remaining allies. They infiltrate the Gray King's organization through elaborate disguises, discover he plans to use ancient Elderglass (indestructible material) to destroy Camorr's aqueducts and drown the city, and stage a counter-con to turn his own forces against him. Personal tragedy strikes—beloved NPCs die, the crew fractures under pressure, and the players discover that Father Chains had secrets about their own origins. They encounter the Bondsmagi, an organization of mages who sell their services for gold and hold grudges for generations.

*   **Act III — Red Seas Under Red Skies (Sessions 12–15+):** The players flee Camorr to the pirate city of Tal Verrar, attempting one last impossible heist—robbing the Sinspire, an unbeatable gambling tower. But they're blackmailed by the Tal Verrar ruling council into sabotaging the pirates instead. They must play both sides, survive poisoning, navigate ship-to-ship combat, and execute a triple-cross that satisfies the politicians, preserves the pirate alliance, and still gets them rich. The campaign culminates in the realization that the only way to win is to change the game entirely—they'll create a new kind of criminal organization built on the honor Father Chains taught them, proving that thieves can have more integrity than nobles.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Long Con**
*   Heists are multi-phase operations: Casing, Planning, Preparation, Execution, Escape.
*   Players describe their plan, then roll at key moments. Complications appear but can be overcome with clever thinking.
*   **Flashback Mechanics:** Players can declare "I prepared for this" and describe a flashback showing how they anticipated the problem.

### 2. **Disguise and Deception**
*   Players maintain multiple false identities with different reputations and social connections.
*   Social checks while maintaining disguise—failure means someone suspects, repeat failures blow cover.
*   NPCs remember interactions, building complex web of lies players must track.

### 3. **The Secret Peace**
*   Unwritten rules of Camorr's underworld: don't steal from other criminals, pay tribute to your Capa, don't kill civilians wantonly.
*   Breaking the Peace has severe consequences—every gang will hunt you.
*   Players benefit from the Peace (safety from other criminals) but are constrained by it.

### 4. **Bondsmage Vendetta**
*   If players kill a Bondsmage, the entire organization will hunt them for the rest of their lives.
*   Bondsmagi have: mind control, telepathy, nearly indestructible shields, elemental magic.
*   The only way to survive is never be in the same place long enough to be found—or negotiate.

### 5. **Honor Among Thieves**
*   Players track their criminal Reputation. High reputation opens doors but attracts attention.
*   Actions that violate thieves' code reduce reputation. Actions that demonstrate style and honor increase it.
*   NPCs' reactions based on reputation—will other thieves help or betray you?

## Central Conflict

Can thieves have honor in a world built on lies? The players prove that their word means more than nobles' oaths, that loyalty to crew matters more than gold, and that elaborate style is worthless without substance. The joy is in the clever plan, the witty banter, the impossible heist—but the heart is in the friendships forged through shared danger and whether those bonds hold when everything goes wrong.
