# Campaign Bible: Yard Sale Apocalypse

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Molding
In the beginning, there was the Factory, a distant, sterile heaven where the Great Molds shaped us from chaos and pellets. We were born with the **Imprinted Purpose**—a psychic directive to be held, to be played with, to spark joy in the Giants (humans). But the Sages of the Shelf speak of the "Great Sorting," a cyclical apocalypse where Giants outgrow their joy, turning creators into destroyers. We are not biological; we are **Plast-Ethereal**. Our souls are tethered to our physical integrity and the memories of our Playtime. When a toy is forgotten, they do not die; they fade into "The Gray," a comatose state of dust-gathering. The Yard Sale is not just an exchange of goods; it is a mass rituals of severance, where the tether to our god (Timmy) is severed by a price sticker.

### Timeline: Ten Events of the Henderson Era
1.  **The First Christmas (Year 0):** Timmy receives Major Tom. The "Golden Age" of daily play begins.
2.  **The Great Dog Incident (Year 2):** The family retriever, Buster, chews the left leg off *Commander Cool*. The concept of "permanent injury" is introduced to the toy community.
3.  **The Attic Exile (Year 4):** A box of baby toys is sealed away. Their muffled screams were heard through the floorboards for a week before silence fell.
4.  **The Vacuum Massacre (Year 5):** A platoon of Green Army Men is sucked into the Hoover. Only Sergeant Green survives, now a mute hermit living behind the radiator.
5.  **The Batteries Dying (Year 6):** The electronic dinosaur *Roar-Z* runs out of power mid-roar. He stands frozen in the corner of the room, a statue of silent agony, for three years.
6.  **The Glue Rain (Year 7):** Timmy discovers superglue. Three unrelated toys are fused together into a Cronenbergian abomination known as "The Amalgam." They rule the Under-Bed.
7.  **The Marker Tattooing (Year 8):** Bella the doll is drawn on with permanent marker. She wears a veil to hide the "Face of Chaos."
8.  **The Lost Spring (Year 9):** A critical spring bounces under the dresser. The Pinball Game ceases to function and becomes a temple for the dust mites.
9.  **The Garage Invasion (Year 9.5):** Spiders infest the garage storage. Toys stored there return changed, speaking in clicks and skittering movements.
10. **The Sticker Decree (Year 10 - Present):** The bright orange stickers appear. The currency of life becomes quarters.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because Toy Consciousness requires **Attention** to sustain higher thought. As Timmy ages, the ambient Attention in the house is plummeting. The Yard Sale represents a desperate bottleneck: escape to a new source of Attention (a new child), or fall into the entropic void of the Landfill, where consciousness fragments into eternal plastic agony. The Collector represents a perversion of this law: Preservation without Attention—a hell of conscious paralysis.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Toy Physics
*   **Plastic Stress:** Characters do not have HP in the traditional sense. They have **Structure Points**. When Structure hits 0, they break. Broken limbs can be reattached with Glue (Heal) or Tape (Temp Heal).
*   **Scale:** 1 inch = 5 feet.
*   **Fall Damage:** Soft toys (Plush) take 0 fall damage. Hard toys (Plastic/Metal) take 1d6 per foot fallen.

### Value System
*   **Market Value ($):** A dynamic stat.
    *   *High Value:* Attracts The Collector. Harder to be trashed, but guaranteed prison.
    *   *Low Value:* Attracts the Trash Can. Easier to escape notice, but treated as junk.
    *   *Sweet Spot:* The "Played With" look ($1-$3). Safe from Collector, safe from Trash.

### The "Stillness"
*   When a Human looks at a toy, the toy must make a **Will Save**. Failure means they freeze instantly (The Toy Story Rule). Success allows subtle movement (blinking, shifting pose) but risks detection. If detected moving, the Human takes "Sanity Damage." If a Human's Sanity breaks, the world ends (The Masquerade Breach).
