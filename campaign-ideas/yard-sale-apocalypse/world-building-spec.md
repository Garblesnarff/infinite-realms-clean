# Yard Sale Apocalypse - World Building Specification

## The Countdown (Session = Day)

**Thursday Evening**: Announcement made, 72 hours begin
**Friday**: Sorting begins, decisions made
**Friday Night**: Last night together as community
**Saturday Morning**: The sale, 8 AM start
**Saturday Afternoon**: Aftermath, new reality

## The Sorting System

**Keep Pile**: Going in moving truck, saved
**Sale Pile**: Front lawn, priced, sold to strangers
**Donate Pile**: Charity shop, unknown fate
**Trash Pile**: Garbage, true death

**Criteria**:
- Sentimental value (Timmy's favorites kept)
- Condition (broken toys trashed)
- Age-appropriateness (baby toys sold, kept pre-teen stuff)
- Space (can't take everything)

## Price Tags = Death Sentences

**$5-10**: "Valuable," Collector territory
**$1-3**: Normal sale items
**$0.25-0.50**: Cheap, desperate to sell
**Free Box**: Worthless, take me please
**No Tag**: Trash pile

Price determines:
- Who might buy you
- Your perceived worth
- Desperation level of "saving" you

**Profile**: Martin Ashford, 45, toy collector
**MO**: Arrives at yard sales early, buys vintage toys
**Collection**: 500+ toys in sealed cases, pristine
**Horror**: Toys never played with again, preserved forever
**Offer**: Will buy entire lot, "save" toys from strangers

**Dilemma**: Is preserved oblivion better than unknown futures?

## Escape Routes

**The Moving Truck**: Stowaway, risky (might get caught)
**The Neighbor's Yard**: Hide, wait out sale, return after
**The Donation Box**: Choose your charity, slightly more control
**The Wild**: Literal escape to toy-free life (harsh)

## New Homes (If Sold)

**The Reseller**: Bought to resell online, limbo
**The Collector**: Museum prison, living death
**The Gift**: Bought as gift, unknown recipient
**The Hoarder**: Bought but never used, dusty shelf

## Saturday Morning Timeline

**7:30 AM**: Early birds (Collector) arrive
**8:00 AM**: Sale officially starts, crowd arrives
**9:00 AM**: Main rush, many toys sold
**10:00 AM**: Lull, leftovers picked over
**11:00 AM**: Price reductions, desperate selling
**12:00 PM**: Sale ends, unsold fate decided (donate or trash)

## Survival Strategies

**Hide and Seek**: Hide in keep pile, avoid detection
**Make Essential**: Remind Timmy why you matter (risky, might not work)
**Swap Tags**: Change price tags, control who might buy
**Sabotage Sale**: Make weather bad, scare customers (group effort)

**Dad**: Practical, "they're just toys"
**Mom**: Sympathetic, helps Timmy choose keepsakes
**Timmy**: Heartbroken, can only keep 5 toys
**Baby Sister**: Too young to care, but her toys are safe (staying)

Toys Timmy keeps = Survivors' ultimate victory

**Collector Foiled**: Prevent him from buying anyone
**Bittersweet**: Some survive, all remember each other

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Separation**: All players sent to different fates
**The Collector**: All bought, sealed in cases forever
**Trash Pile**: Some or all discarded as worthless
**Lost in Sale**: Sold to terrible homes
