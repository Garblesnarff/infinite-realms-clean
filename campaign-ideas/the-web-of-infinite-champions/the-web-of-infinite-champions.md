## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A desperate flight through infinite realities, hunted by immortal predators.

*   **Act I — The Hunt Begins (Sessions 1–5):** The players experience strange visions and dreams of themselves in other forms. When an Inheritor attacks their world, hunting a legendary "Webbound" hero, the players witness the hero's brutal death and realize with horror that they too are Webbound. They meet the Guide, a survivor from a dead reality, who pulls them into the Web of Worlds. They must learn to reality-jump while being hunted by relentless predators who can follow them anywhere.
*   **Act II — The Scattered Alliance (Sessions 6–11):** The players travel through bizarre alternate realities, meeting other Webbound champions—alternate versions of themselves and other heroes, each with unique powers and stories. They discover they are part of a prophecy: the Webbound are destined to either save the multiverse or be consumed trying. The party must unite fractious heroes, gather intelligence on the Inheritors' weaknesses, and seek the fabled Source Crystal that might end the hunt forever.
*   **Act III — The Final Stand (Sessions 12–15+):** The players discover the location of the Source Crystal in a reality called the Web Nexus. The Inheritors converge for a final hunt, bringing their full family—immortal, experienced, and ruthless. The united Webbound make their stand, holding off the predators while a chosen few attempt to claim the Source Crystal. In doing so, they learn the truth: the Webbound exist because the multiverse itself is alive—and the Inheritors are trying to kill it.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Threads of Fate"
*   **Focus:** Mystery / Introduction
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players experience recurring dreams of themselves as different people: a knight, a thief, a wizard, each feeling somehow familiar.
    *   They meet a mysterious hero called the Webspinner who claims to be "like them"—Webbound.
    *   An Inheritor attacks, a towering figure of terrible power, hunting the Webspinner. The players witness them brutally kill and consume the hero.
**Escalation:** The Inheritor turns their attention to the players, recognizing them as Webbound. They barely escape through a portal opened by the dying Webspinner.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Welcome to the Web"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Meeting Allies
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players emerge in the Hub—a neutral reality where Webbound refugees gather.
    *   They meet the Guide, a cynical survivor who explains: they are Webbound, connected to infinite versions of themselves, and the Inheritors hunt them to consume their essence.
    *   The players must learn to "web-jump"—travel between realities by following their destiny threads.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Guide** — *Cynical Survivor*
    *   **Role:** A Webbound hero from a dead reality, one of the few who has evaded the Inheritors for years.
    *   **Personality:** Cynical, pragmatic, and haunted by survivor's guilt. She's seen countless allies die and struggles to allow herself to hope.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She knows the location of the Source Crystal but fears leading the Inheritors there will doom everyone.

2.  **Morlun, First Inheritor** — *The Perfect Hunter*
    *   **Role:** The eldest and most dangerous of the Inheritor family, a being who has hunted Webbound for millennia.
    *   **Personality:** Refined, cultured, and utterly remorseless. He speaks of the hunt as art and sees Webbound as delicious prey.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is addicted to consuming Webbound essence and fears what will happen if he runs out of prey.

3.  **The Prime Weaver** — *The Source*

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of destiny versus choice, identity across infinite possibilities, and unity through diversity. The central conflict is survival against implacable hunters, but also the question of what connects the Webbound—are they truly the same person, or unique individuals bound by fate? Can they unite despite their differences and the trauma of being hunted?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Web-Jumping**
*   Players can spend an action and make an Arcana check to jump to an adjacent reality, following their destiny threads.
*   Higher rolls allow for more precise targeting (jumping to specific types of realities). Lower rolls result in random destinations.
*   Inheritors can track web-jumps, so frequent jumping leaves a trail.

### 2. **Alternate Self Abilities**
*   When players meet and bond with alternate versions of themselves, they can gain "Echo Abilities"—temporary powers from that version.
*   Example: A fighter meets their wizard alternate and gains the ability to cast *Shield* once per day.
*   These abilities last until the campaign ends or that alternate self dies.

### 3. **The Hunt Track**
*   The DM tracks an "Inheritor Proximity" meter. Staying in one reality too long, making noise, or leaving obvious trails increases it.
*   When the meter fills, an Inheritor attack occurs. Players must balance the need to rest and prepare with the danger of being found.
*   Smart tactics (covering tracks, using decoys, misdirection) can reduce the meter.
