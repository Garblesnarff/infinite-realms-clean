# The Refracted Realm

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Impressionist Fantasy / Perceptual Mystery / Light Magic
- **Estimated Length**: 12-16 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 4-12
- **Tone**: Ethereal, Beautiful, Uncertain, Meditative, Ever-Changing

### Core Premise
The Refracted Realm is a dimension where perception is reality and light creates truth. Nothing has fixed form - objects, creatures, and landscapes shift based on the observer's perspective, emotional state, and quality of light. Colors blend and separate, edges blur, and "reality" is determined by consensus. The party arrives seeking the Prism of Absolute Truth, an artifact capable of fixing perception into unchanging reality. However, they discover that the Realm's fluid nature isn't a curse but its fundamental beauty, maintained by the Light-Weavers who believe that fixed reality is death. The party must choose between crystallizing the Realm into permanence or embracing the philosophy that truth is always shifting with the light.

### Core Themes
- **Perception Creates Reality**: What you see depends on how you look; observation changes the observed
- **Light as Truth**: Different light reveals different truths; all are valid
- **Emotion Colors Experience**: Feelings literally alter colors and forms in the environment
- **The Beauty of Impermanence**: Nothing is fixed, everything flows like water or light
- **Collective Reality**: Truth is consensus; multiple perceptions create layered realities

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Blurred Arrival (Sessions 1-4)**
The party enters the Refracted Realm in pursuit of the Prism of Absolute Truth, needed to solve a crisis in their home world (petrifying plague, crystallized time, etc.). They immediately struggle with the physics: objects change based on viewing angle, paths appear/disappear with light quality, even their own bodies seem different in different illumination. They meet the Impression Guild, a group of natives who've learned to navigate perceptual reality. The Guild's leader, Monet's Echo, explains the Prism was shattered centuries ago by the Light-Weavers who believed fixed truth would kill the Realm.

**Act 2: The Scattered Spectrum (Sessions 5-10)**
The party learns the Prism was broken into seven fragments, each held by a Light-Weaver representing a color of the spectrum. They must journey through seven regions, each dominated by a different color-emotion: Red Fields of Passion, Orange Harbors of Transition, Yellow Gardens of Clarity, Green Forests of Growth, Blue Waters of Melancholy, Indigo Caves of Intuition, and Violet Spires of Transcendence. Each region challenges their perception and asks them to question whether they truly want to impose fixed reality on a world that celebrates change.

**Act 3: The Dawning Question (Sessions 11-14)**
Having collected the Prism fragments (or most of them), the party reaches the Convergence - the place where all light meets and truth is most mutable. They discover the crisis they're trying to solve in their home world might actually be caused by too much fixed reality, not too little. The Refracted Realm's philosophy might be the cure, not the problem. They must choose: reassemble the Prism and crystallize reality (saving their world but destroying the Realm), destroy the fragments forever (saving the Realm but abandoning their mission), or find a third path that balances permanence and change.

**Act 4: Resolution in Shifting Light (Sessions 15-16)**
The final choice is made not through combat but through consensus. Each party member shares their perception of what truth should be. The Light-Weavers, the Impression Guild, and the party debate philosophy while reality itself fluctuates around them. The outcome depends on what kind of truth the players want to create - and whether they can accept that all truths are partial, all perceptions valid, all realities temporary.

### Major NPCs

**Monet's Echo**
- **Role**: Guide / Mentor / Philosophical Ally
- **Appearance**: Shifts with lighting - in bright sun appears as an elderly man, in shade as a young woman, at dawn/dusk somewhere between
- **Personality**: Meditative, accepting of contradiction, speaks in metaphors of light and color. Values experience over definition.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Is actually a fragment of the original creator of the Prism, who regretted making it and shattered themselves into echoes across the Realm

**The Fire-Heart Keeper (Red Light-Weaver)**

- **Personality**: Cold, certain, believes chaos must be ordered. Sees the Refracted Realm as broken and wants to fix it.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Was once a native who crystallized herself to escape the uncertainty. Now she's trapped in one moment forever, unable to change or grow.

### Key Locations

**The Impression City**
A settlement where buildings shift architecture based on time of day, weather, and observer mood. Streets are suggestions rather than fixed paths. The Impression Guild's headquarters.

**The Red Fields of Passion**
Endless crimson grasslands under a burning sky. Emotions run hot - anger flares into actual fire, love manifests as warm light. All perception is intense and unreliable.

**The Orange Harbors of Transition**
Coastal region in eternal sunset. Boats arrive and depart simultaneously. Everything exists in in-between states. The Twilight Sailor's domain.

**The Yellow Gardens of Clarity**
Sunlit gardens at permanent noon. Everything appears obvious and simple, but this clarity is deceptive - complexity is washed out by too much light.

**The Green Forests of Growth**
Dense woods where plants, animals, and even stones seem to grow and change moment to moment. Life proliferates in overlapping, blurred forms.

**The Blue Waters of Melancholy**
Lakes, rivers, and rain-soaked landscapes where everything is tinged with beautiful sadness. Water refracts all light to blue. Grief lives here.

**The Indigo Caves of Intuition**
Underground caverns lit by bioluminescent fungi. In darkness, different truths emerge. Logic fails; instinct guides.

**The Violet Spires of Transcendence**
Towers reaching beyond visible sky where physical form becomes optional. The boundaries between observer and observed dissolve.

**The Convergence**
The place where all seven colors of light meet. Reality is at its most mutable here. A cathedral of pure light where the final choice must be made.

### Central Conflict
The party needs the Prism of Absolute Truth to save their world, but assembling it would destroy the Refracted Realm by imposing fixed reality on a world that celebrates perceptual fluidity. The conflict is philosophical: Is unchanging truth worth preserving at the cost of beauty, growth, and possibility? Can multiple truths coexist?

### Unique Mechanics

**Clarity Points (CP)**
Every character has Clarity (starts at 10, max 20, min 0). This represents how fixed/certain their perception is.

- **High Clarity (15-20)**: See things clearly and consistently, advantage on Investigation/Perception, but environment seems dull, lose ability to see magical auras and emotional colors
- **Medium Clarity (6-14)**: Balanced. Normal perception. Can see both physical and perceptual reality.
- **Low Clarity (0-5)**: Perception becomes highly subjective, disadvantage on Perception/Investigation, but can see emotional colors, light magic, and hidden perceptual truths. Can reshape minor reality through belief.
- **Spending CP**: 1 CP = force one object to appear clearly for 1 minute (remove blur/shift)
- **Gaining CP**: Exposure to fixed light sources, crystalline objects, logical thinking
- **Losing CP**: Exposure to shifting light, emotional experiences, accepting contradictory truths

**Perception Checks vs. Reality**
In the Refracted Realm, Perception checks don't reveal objective truth - they create truth.

- Roll Perception: The result determines what you see, and what you see becomes real for you
- DC 15+: See clearly, object has defined form
- DC 10-14: See vaguely, object is blurred but identifiable
- DC 9 or below: See impressionistically, object is suggestion of shape and color
- Other players rolling Perception of same object may get different results = multiple simultaneous realities

**Light-Based Physics**
Environmental lighting changes reality:

- **Dawn/Dusk**: Transitions are easy, forms are fluid, magic is enhanced
- **Noon**: Clarity is high, shadows are harsh, truth seems obvious (but oversimplified)
- **Midnight**: Darkness allows intuition, hidden things visible, physical reality loosens
- **Overcast**: Everything blurs, boundaries dissolve, emotions affect perception more strongly
- **Prismatic Light**: When all colors present, reality fragments into multiple valid versions

**Emotion-Color Resonance**
Emotional state affects visual perception and environmental interaction:

- **Anger**: See everything in reds, gain fire affinity, heat appears as color
- **Sadness**: Blue tint to vision, water affinity, beauty in melancholy visible
- **Joy**: Yellows and oranges, light dances, clarity can be blinding
- **Fear**: Indigos and purples, shadows deeper, intuition heightened
- **Love**: Rose and gold tones, connections between things visible as light threads
- **Calm**: Greens, growth patterns visible, natural order apparent

**Consensus Reality**
When party members perceive same thing differently, they can attempt to create consensus:

- Each player describes what they see
- Group makes Charisma (Persuasion) check to agree on one version
- Success: Object takes the agreed form for all
- Failure: Object exists in superposition, different for each observer, can cause problems

**Perceptual Combat**
Combat works on perception - enemies appear different to different players:

- DM describes enemy impressionistically: "A blur of crimson and shadow, suggestion of claws, feeling of rage"
- Players roll Perception to determine what they're fighting
- High roll: Clear view, normal combat
- Medium: Blurred view, attacks at disadvantage
- Low: Fight based on impressions - describe attacks based on feeling rather than precise targeting
- Damage dealt based on how convinced you are you hit: Persuasion check can increase damage

**The Fragment Collection**
Each Prism Fragment grants a power but also a drawback:

- **Red**: Cast fire spells as bonus action, but anger becomes harder to control
- **Orange**: Gain ability to exist in two states simultaneously, but commitment becomes difficult
- **Yellow**: Advantage on all Intelligence checks, but lose ability to see nuance
- **Green**: Speak with plants/animals, but identity becomes fluid
- **Blue**: Immunity to fear, but experience all sadness more deeply
- **Indigo**: Gain truesight in darkness, but sunlight becomes painful
- **Violet**: Can briefly become incorporeal, but risk losing connection to physical form

### Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Prism Created the Crisis**: The artifact the party needs to "fix" their world is actually what caused the crystallization plague. Using it would make things worse.

2. **A Party Member Crystallizes**: One PC might embrace clarity too much, reaching 20 Clarity Points, and begin to crystallize like the Queen. The party must save them by helping them let go of certainty.

3. **The Light-Weavers Aren't Guardians**: They're prisoners, each trapped by their fragment in one emotional spectrum, unable to experience the full range of perception.

4. **Monet's Echo's True Nature**: They're not just a guide - they're the fragmented consciousness of the Prism's creator, scattered across the Realm, trying to prevent their mistake from being repeated.

5. **The Home World Doesn't Want Saving**: Messages from home suggest the crystallization isn't a plague but an evolution. People are choosing to become fixed rather than dealing with uncertainty.

6. **The Realm Is a Painting**: The entire dimension might be a work of art created by a long-dead god-artist. The party are characters in a living impressionist painting.

7. **All Seven Light-Weavers Must Agree**: Can't just take the fragments - must convince all seven to willingly give them up, which means reconciling opposite philosophies (passion vs. calm, clarity vs. mystery).

8. **The Party Becomes Art**: Low Clarity might result in players actually becoming impressionist paintings - 2D beings of light and color, losing physical form but gaining perception-bending powers.

9. **The Crystalline Queen Is the Villain**: She's gathering her own forces to reassemble the Prism and freeze the entire Realm in one perfect, unchanging moment.

10. **Multiple Valid Endings**: The DM should prepare for the fact that different players might perceive different endings, all of which are true.

### Victory Conditions

**Harmony Ending**: Find a way to balance change and permanence. Create a partial Prism that allows for core truths while permitting perceptual variation. Both worlds saved, neither sacrificed. Requires convincing all seven Light-Weavers to combine fragments in new configuration.

**Sacrifice the Realm**: Assemble full Prism, crystallize the Refracted Realm into fixed reality, save home world. All natives become static. The Light-Weavers die. Party carries guilt but their world is saved. Moral weight.

**Embrace Change**: Destroy all fragments, abandon home world mission, stay in Refracted Realm and learn its philosophy. Home world must solve its own crisis. Party becomes Light-Weavers themselves, embracing perceptual reality.

**Convert Home World**: Bring the philosophy back without the Prism. Teach home world to embrace uncertainty rather than crystallizing. Harder path, requires skill challenges and roleplay, but saves both worlds through wisdom rather than magic.

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Crystallization**: Party reaches 20 Clarity collectively. They become like the Crystalline Queen - frozen in one moment, one perception, unable to grow or change. Campaign ends with them as living statues.

**Complete Dissolution**: Party reaches 0 Clarity collectively. They blur into the environment, becoming indistinguishable from the landscape. They become the realm itself - conscious but without form or identity.

**The Queen's Victory**: If the party takes too long, the Crystalline Queen assembles her own Prism and freezes the entire Realm. Everything becomes fixed, beautiful but dead, an eternal museum.

**Fragmentation**: If party members can't achieve consensus and their perceptions diverge too far, reality splits. Each player ends up in their own version of the Realm, isolated, unable to interact. Campaign ends in solipsism.

**Home World Falls**: If party takes too long in Refracted Realm, their home world completely crystallizes. Everyone there becomes statues. Party's mission fails, and they must live with the knowledge that while they debated philosophy, their world died.
