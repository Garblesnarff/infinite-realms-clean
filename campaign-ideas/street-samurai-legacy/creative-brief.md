# Street Samurai Legacy - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic

**Cyberpunk Meets Samurai Films**:
- Neon-lit streets with traditional Japanese elements
- Cherry blossoms and holographic advertisements
- Katanas reflecting neon lights
- Urban decay meets ancient tradition
- John Wick color grading (dark, stylized, neon accents)

## Color Palette
- **Watson District**: Warm oranges and reds (home, community, humanity)
- **Arasaka**: Cold blues and corporate whites (inhuman, sterile)
- **Combat**: High contrast, dramatic lighting
- **The Dojo**: Traditional Japanese colors (natural wood, paper screens, warm lighting)
- **Blood**: Vibrant red stands out (violence has weight)

## Music Direction
- **Main Theme**: Taiko drums meets electronic bass
- **Combat**: Aggressive traditional Japanese instruments with industrial beats
- **Emotional Scenes**: Solo shakuhachi or shamisen, melancholic
- **Gang Meetings**: Hip-hop beats with Asian influences
- **Duel Sequences**: Silence before strike, explosive sound during clash
- **Victory/Death**: Ceremonial music, honoring fallen

## Voice Acting
- **Saburo Hayashi** (flashbacks): Wise elder, Japanese accent, commanding yet kind
- **Hanzo**: Cold professional, hints of pain beneath, eventually cracks
- **Rosa Valentino**: Maternal strength, Spanish accent, warm yet dangerous
- **Viktor**: Working-class mentor, gruff exterior hiding care
- **AI Master**: Ancient wisdom, slightly digital quality, omniscient
- **Yorinobu**: Corporate heir trying to be human, conflicted, British-educated Japanese

## Environmental Design

## Action Choreography Guidance

**Sword Combat** (Honor Duels):
- Based on actual kenjutsu principles
- Economy of motion, every move counts
- Slow buildup, explosive resolution
- One strike can decide
- Show skill through restraint, not flash

**Gun Combat** (Gang Wars):
- John Wick style: Practical, efficient, brutal
- Use environment tactically
- Protect civilians mid-combat
- Gun-fu mixed with martial arts
- Consequences shown (wounds, exhaustion)

**Mixed Combat** (Versatile Samurai):
- Switch between weapons seamlessly
- Sword against melee, guns against range
- Environment as weapon
- Team coordination in squad fights
- Stylish but grounded

## Emotional Tone

Unlike pure action, this campaign has HEART:
- Found family dynamics
- Mentor relationships
- Community worth protecting
- Personal honor tested
- Meaningful sacrifices
- Legacy considerations

Should feel:
- **Exciting**: Action sequences are thrilling
- **Emotional**: Care about people and place
- **Honorable**: Code matters, provides structure
- **Tragic**: Good people die for principles
- **Triumphant**: Small victories against odds
- **Meaningful**: Actions have lasting impact

Players should feel like warriors, protectors, and teachers simultaneously. Every fight matters because people depend on them. Every choice reflects on their honor. Every sacrifice adds to their legacy.

## Visual Motifs

**Cherry Blossoms**:
- Symbol of beautiful transience
- Life is short, make it meaningful
- Falling petals during significant moments

**Swords**:
- Katana as soul of samurai
- Cleaning/maintaining blade = meditation
- Each sword has story/history
- Broken blade = broken honor
- Reforged blade = redemption

**Neon Reflections**:
- Traditional values in modern world
- Katana reflecting neon lights
- Old and new coexisting
- Beauty in synthesis

**Blood**:
