**Campaign Type / Genre:** Generational Drama / Moral Crisis / Dark Superhero Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **9** → Finish **16**

The legendary heroes of the old generation—Guardian, Wonder Knight, Flash—have retired after failing to prevent tragedy and losing the public's trust. In their absence, a new generation of "metahumans" has risen: powerful but reckless, caring more for victory than morality, and settling conflicts with increasing brutality. When Guardian emerges from retirement and forms the Justice Alliance to restore heroic ideals, the players must choose a side: join Guardian's authoritarian restoration, support the new generation's freedom, or find a middle path before the conflict ignites a war that will destroy the realm.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

Old heroes return to a world that no longer wants them.

*   **Act I — The New Generation (Sessions 1–5):** The players are part of the new generation of heroes—powerful, effective, but morally gray. They witness the chaos caused by brutal, unrestrained metahumans who kill villains and devastate cities in their battles. When a catastrophic fight destroys a city district, killing thousands, Guardian emerges from retirement, gathering the old heroes. Guardian proposes forming a new Justice Alliance to enforce a code of honor and stop the violence—by force if necessary.
*   **Act II — The Divide (Sessions 6–11):** The old heroes begin arresting or subduing new generation metahumans who refuse to follow their code. The players must choose: join Guardian's crusade for traditional heroism, resist as part of the new generation, or try to mediate between generations. They discover Guardian is becoming increasingly authoritarian, building a orbital satellite weapon to enforce compliance. Meanwhile, extremists on both sides push toward open war.
*   **Act III — The Apocalypse (Sessions 12–15+):** A manipulative villain has orchestrated the entire conflict, planning to trigger a metahuman war that will devastate the realm. As both sides prepare for battle, the players must unite the generations, expose the manipulation, and prevent the cataclysm. Guardian faces a moral crisis: enforce peace through fear or trust the new generation to be better. The players' choices determine whether the realm finds peace, descends into tyranny, or destroys itself.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of generational change, idealism versus pragmatism, and the cost of enforcing peace. The central conflict is between two visions of heroism: traditional values versus modern effectiveness. Can the old and new generations find common ground? Or will their conflict destroy everything both sides claim to protect?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Generational Reputation**
*   Players have reputation with Old Heroes and New Generation factions.
*   Actions affect both scores inversely. Helping old heroes lowers new generation reputation.
*   At certain thresholds, factions offer support or send enemies.

### 2. **Code of Honor Violations**
*   Players can choose to follow Guardian's Code (no killing, protect all life, accountability).
*   Each violation lowers Old Hero reputation but may be necessary to win fights.
*   Accumulating violations changes how NPCs perceive and react to the party.

### 3. **The Escalation Clock**
*   A DM-tracked clock representing how close both sides are to full war.
*   Player actions and inactions advance the clock.
*   At maximum, the climactic battle begins—potentially with catastrophic consequences.
