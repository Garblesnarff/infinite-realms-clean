# Creative Brief: Kingdom of Tomorrow

Inspired by the painted, mythic aesthetic of *Kingdom Come* by Alex Ross. This style captures the clash between classic heroism and modern brutality, the weight of legend, and apocalyptic consequences.

## Art Style: Painted Realism (Alex Ross Style)

### Core Principles:
*   **Heroic Realism:** Characters look like real people in realistic costumes, showing age, weight, and wear.
*   **Mythic Iconography:** Old heroes shown with almost religious reverence—halos of light, larger-than-life presence.
*   **Apocalyptic Stakes:** Show the consequences—destroyed cities, gathered armies, the threat of annihilation.

### Color Palette:
Rich, painted colors with dramatic lighting. Old heroes in classic bright colors; new generation in darker, muted tones.

## Voice

An aged, weary voice speaking of legends failing, generations clashing, and the potential end of everything. Carries the weight of prophecy and tragedy. Role: A survivor or witness chronicling the twilight of heroes.
