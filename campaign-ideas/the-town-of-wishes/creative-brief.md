## Art Style: Emotional Family Drama (Clannad-inspired)

Inspired by the deeply emotional and beautiful art style of Clannad, this aesthetic captures both the warmth of family and friendship and the profound sadness of loss, all while maintaining hope for miracles.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Emotion:** Faces and body language convey deep, complex emotions—joy, sorrow, love, despair, hope.
*   **Warmth and Light:** Even sad scenes carry underlying warmth, suggesting hope.
*   **The Supernatural Subtle:** The illusionary world and light orbs are ethereal and dreamlike.

### Detailed Style Guide:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:** Emotional, hopeful, heartbreaking, uplifting, familial, warm, bittersweet.

**2. Color Palette:** Warm, gentle colors. Cherry blossom pinks, warm sunset oranges, soft blues. The illusionary world is stark white and cold blue.

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Nagisa:** Delicate, warm expression, often in school uniform or simple dresses, ahoge (antenna hair) as distinctive feature.
*   **Tomoya:** Initially slouched and aimless, gradually stands taller. Casual delinquent style.
*   **Ushio:** Small, adorable, resembles Nagisa, carries a stuffed toy.

**4. Backgrounds:** School, family bakery (warm and welcoming), the town (living and breathing), the illusionary world (stark white planes under gray sky).

**5. Lighting:** Warm, natural lighting for family scenes. Golden hour lighting for emotional moments. Cold, harsh light for tragedy. Ethereal glowing light for miracles and light orbs.

## Voice

**Narrator Voice:** Deeply emotional, paternal, and wise. The voice of someone recounting a story of profound loss and miraculous hope. Tender during family moments, quietly devastated during tragedy, warmly hopeful at the miracle. Studio-quality with the gravitas of a life-changing tale.
