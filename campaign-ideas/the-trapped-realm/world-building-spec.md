### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Trapped Realm**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Thousands of MMORPG players find themselves trapped in the game world "Eternal Realms" with no logout function. Game mechanics are real but function differently—NPCs are sentient, crafting requires skill, death causes trauma and memory loss. The party must help build functioning civilization while discovering the truth: this was never a game but a real parallel world that Earth players accessed dimensionally. The campaign focuses on adaptation, society building, and choosing between pursuing a way home or accepting a new reality.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the actual history of the "Eternal Realms" world—it existed long before the "game" launched.
    *   Explain how the dimensional connection was established 30 years ago when the game launched on Earth.
    *   Describe the People of the Land's perspective on "adventurers" appearing and treating their world as a game.
    *   Chronicle the ancient civilizations and sealed evils that were game lore but are actually real history.
    *   Detail what the "expansion update" actually did—why did it make the connection permanent?
    *   Explain the Cathedral of Rebirth and why it can resurrect adventurers but not People of the Land.
    *   Describe the magic system of this world and how it differs from/relates to game skills.

    *   **IF:** Party allows chaos: Competing factions battle, resources scarce, People of the Land become hostile.

    *   **IF:** Party alienates People of the Land: Settlements become hostile, critical resources cut off, potential war.

**7. Game Mechanics Made Real**
*   **Directive:** Define how game systems work in reality.
*   **Interface System:** Mental UI accessible through focused thought. Inventory, stats, menus all accessible but require concentration.
*   **Skills & Abilities:** Listed skills exist but require real understanding to use effectively. Can't just press a button—must comprehend the technique.
*   **Crafting Revolution:** Game crafting was menus. Real crafting requires skill checks and genuine technique. Innovation possible by combining skills creatively.
*   **Death System:** Dying causes respawn at cathedral but inflicts memory loss (past 24 hours) and psychological trauma. Permanent death possible in specific conditions.
*   **Leveling:** Experience and levels exist and affect capabilities, but skill matters more than raw stats.
*   **Magic:** Spells exist from the game but casting requires understanding magical principles, not just clicking a skill.

**8. Society Building Mechanics**
*   **Directive:** Define how civilization emerges.
*   **Economic Systems:** Market emerges based on supply and demand. Crafters have value. Resources must be managed.
*   **Governance:** Player factions must establish laws and enforcement. The party influences this structure.
*   **Guild System:** Guilds become organizations with real resources, members, and influence.
*   **Diplomacy:** Relations with People of the Land settlements matter. Trade, alliances, and conflicts all possible.
*   **Innovation:** Players discovering how things really work creates technological and magical advancement.

**9. The People of the Land**
*   **Directive:** NPCs are real, with full agency.
*   **Sentience:** Always were sentient and aware. The "game" was players inhabiting bodies dimensionally.
*   **Perspective:** Remember adventurers appearing 30 years ago. View them as strange, powerful, immortal beings.
*   **Fear:** Terrified of adventurers who can't truly die and sometimes treat the world as a game.
*   **Potential:** Can teach skills that never existed in the game. Have real history and culture to share.
*   **Rights:** The party must decide whether People of the Land have equal rights or are treated as NPCs.

**10. The Dimensional Truth**
*   **Directive:** The ultimate revelation.
*   **Reality:** This world always existed. The "game" was a dimensional window allowing Earth consciousness to inhabit local bodies.
*   **The Connection:** Established by ancient magic or forgotten technology 30 years ago.
*   **The Expansion:** Broke something, making the connection permanent rather than temporary.
*   **The Bodies:** Players aren't their Earth bodies but native inhabitants of this world their consciousness inhabits.
*   **The Choice:** Return means abandoning these bodies and the People of the Land. Stay means accepting Earth is lost.

**11. Timeline (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Chaos reigns, resources depleted, violence erupts.
*   **Session 2:** Duke Malves establishes dictatorship, oppresses People of the Land.
*   **Session 3:** Frontier collapses without trade routes, settlements fall.
*   **Session 4:** Without crafting revolution, quality of life plummets, despair grows.
*   **Session 5:** Goblin crisis becomes massacre, ancient evils ignored.
*   **Session 6:** People of the Land declare war on adventurers.
*   **Session 7:** Ancient evil awakens unopposed.
*   **Session 8:** Civilization collapses, world falls to chaos and darkness.

This specification creates a world where game mechanics are made real, requiring players to think beyond min-maxing into genuine leadership, innovation, and moral choice between returning home or building a new future.
