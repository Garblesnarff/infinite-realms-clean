# Creative Brief: The Trapped Realm

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: LitRPG Fantasy with UI Integration

Inspired by *Log Horizon*, *Sword Art Online*, MMO game aesthetics, and LitRPG visual novels. This style combines high fantasy world design with visible game interface elements, creating a world that's simultaneously fantastical and systematized, real yet retaining game-like visual elements.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Interface Integration**: UI elements (health bars, status windows, menu screens) are visible and integrated into the world naturally.
*   **High Fantasy Realism**: The world itself is detailed, realistic fantasy. NPCs and environments are fully realized, not simplistic game assets.
*   **Strategic Visualization**: Show tactical thinking—battle formations, terrain usage, coordination between multiple groups.
*   **Society Building**: Visualize organization and civilization—functioning markets, guild structures, diplomatic meetings.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** LitRPG, strategic, organized, hopeful determination, MMO aesthetics, civilization building, tactical fantasy, interface elements, cooperation, discovery.
*   **Feeling:** The thoughtful strategy of chess combined with the wonder of exploring a real fantasy world. The satisfaction of solving problems through cooperation and innovation.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, detailed linework suitable for both character focus and complex environmental scenes. Semi-realistic with slight stylization toward anime aesthetics.
*   **Form:** Characters have realistic proportions with slight idealization. Architecture is detailed and functional. Interface elements have crisp, digital precision.
*   **Tactical Diagrams**: Sometimes include overhead tactical views showing positioning and strategy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed digital illustration combining realistic fantasy art with game UI elements. The scene shows multiple adventurers in formation with visible health bars and status indicators above their heads. The linework is clean and precise, emphasizing both character detail and tactical positioning..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant fantasy colors with digital UI accents.
*   **Akihabara**: Urban fantasy—stone grays, magical blues, market vibrants, evening oranges
*   **Wilderness**: Rich fantasy colors—forest greens, mountain blues, dungeon darks
*   **UI Elements**: Digital colors—health bars (green/yellow/red), mana bars (blue), interface windows (semi-transparent blue-tinted), menu buttons (gray with highlights)
*   **People of the Land**: More muted, realistic medieval colors contrasting with vibrant player gear
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich fantasy color palette with stone grays of medieval buildings contrasted against vibrant player equipment in game-bright colors. Floating UI windows appear in semi-transparent blue, displaying character stats. Health bars above characters glow in green. The overall effect balances realistic medieval fantasy with digital game aesthetics..."

**4. Character & Creature Design:**
*   **Players**: Fantasy adventurer designs (warriors, mages, rogues, etc.) with slight exaggeration typical of MMO character design. Equipment is elaborate and colorful. Each has visible UI elements (health bar, level indicator, name tag).
*   **People of the Land**: More realistic medieval fantasy designs. Subdued colors, practical clothing, no UI elements. This contrast shows they're NPCs made real.
*   **Monsters**: Traditional fantasy monsters but with realistic detail and intelligent behavior shown through posture and eyes.
*   **Equipment**: Starts game-like (glowing, elaborate) and becomes more realistic as players adapt, showing progression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An adventurer in elaborate MMO-style armor—ornate plate mail with glowing enchantments and impractical but cool design elements. Above them floats a health bar (90% full), mana bar (blue), and name tag showing 'Lv.8 Guardian.' Next to them stands a People of the Land soldier in practical medieval armor with no UI elements, emphasizing the contrast between player and NPC..."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Akihabara**: Medieval fantasy city that feels like an MMO hub—too-perfect architecture mixed with player modifications, market stalls, guild halls with banners, cathedral that glows with respawn magic.
*   **Wilderness**: Fully realized fantasy landscapes, more detailed and realistic than game environments, showing this world is real.
*   **Dungeons**: Complex architecture with tactical features. Show multiple levels, cover positions, environmental hazards.
*   **Meeting Rooms**: Visualize strategy sessions—maps on tables, floating UI windows showing stats and plans, multiple guild leaders coordinating.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The guild hall's strategy room—a large medieval chamber with a massive table covered in maps. Floating semi-transparent UI windows display resource counts, faction relationships, and quest information. Multiple guild leaders (with visible health bars and levels) lean over tactical diagrams. The room combines medieval fantasy (stone walls, torches) with game elements (floating interfaces, magical displays)..."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style**: Clear, visible lighting that allows tactical assessment. Less atmospheric mystery, more strategic clarity.
*   **UI Glow**: Interface elements emit soft light—health bars glow, menu windows shine, quest markers sparkle.
*   **Day/Night Cycle**: Clearly depicted. Players can see the time (visible clock UI).
*   **Magical Effects**: Spell casting produces elaborate but comprehensible effects. Others can see what's being cast.
*   **Tactical Lighting**: Combat scenes lit to show positioning, formations, and terrain clearly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by afternoon sunlight streaming through cathedral windows, creating clear visibility of the scene. Floating UI windows glow with soft blue light. Character health bars emit gentle green illumination. The lighting is strategic and clear, allowing viewers to assess the tactical situation while maintaining fantasy atmosphere..."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Tactical Overhead**: Occasionally use isometric or overhead views showing battle formations and positioning like tactical RPG games.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Wide shots of war rooms, meetings, coordination efforts. Show multiple characters and their relationships.
*   **Interface Integration**: Always include relevant UI elements naturally in the composition—don't hide the game-like aspects.
*   **Scale**: Show both individual character moments and large-scale coordination of dozens or hundreds.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An isometric tactical view of a battle. Multiple adventurer parties (12 characters total) engage goblin forces in a forest clearing. Each character has a visible health bar, class icon, and level indicator. Overhead, a mini-map shows the strategic situation. The composition allows clear reading of tactics—tanks in front, healers in back, DPS flanking. The scene combines tactical game visualization with detailed character art..."

**8. UI & Interface Elements:**
*   **Health/Mana Bars**: Floating above characters. Green for health, blue for mana. Show depletion realistically.
*   **Status Windows**: Semi-transparent panels displaying character stats, inventory, abilities.
*   **Menu Commands**: Occasionally show characters mentally accessing menus—floating options appearing before them.
*   **Quest Markers**: Subtle glowing indicators for objectives.
*   **Friend Lists**: When using telepathy, show UI element displaying the communication.
*   **Raid Frames**: During large battles, show simplified UI tracking multiple parties.
*   **Map Overlays**: Mini-maps or full map interfaces when relevant.
