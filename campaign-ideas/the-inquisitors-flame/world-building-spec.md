    *   Describe Inquisition methods: denunciation, investigation, torture, property seizure, auto-da-fé.
    *   Explain the theological justification: saving souls through punishment, purifying Spain's faith.
    *   Detail the auto-da-fé ritual: religious ceremony, public spectacle, execution theater.
    *   Write about resistance: secret practices, fleeing Spain, maintaining hidden identities for generations.
