# Creative Brief: The Inquisitor's Flame

## Art Style: Religious Horror (The Name of the Rose meets Goya's Inquisition)

Inspired by medieval religious investigation in *The Name of the Rose* and Goya's horrifying Inquisition paintings. This style captures institutional religious terror, torture chambers hidden behind piety, and the spectacle of auto-da-fé.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Hidden Horror:** Torture and persecution behind religious facades.
*   **Spanish Golden Age:** Rich Catholic imagery contrasted with brutal methods.
*   **Spectacle and Suffering:** Auto-da-fé as religious theater and execution.

### Color Palette:
Spanish Catholic golds and crimsons, Inquisition blacks, the orange-red of flames at auto-da-fé, the darkness of torture chambers, the stark white of sanbenitos marking the condemned.

### Character Design:
Inquisitors in black robes with crosses, conversos hiding their Jewish heritage, familiars gathering evidence, accused wearing humiliation garments, torture victims showing physical and spiritual breaking.

## Voice

A voice capturing oppressive religious authority and the horror of institutionalized persecution. Respectful of genuine faith while unflinching about terror done in God's name. The narrator speaks with the hushed, fearful tone of someone in a surveillance state where anyone might inform. Audio: Latin prayers, torture chamber sounds, flames of auto-da-fé, secret Jewish prayers, denunciations, public rituals, confessions extracted under duress.
