# Midnight Chrome - World-Building Specification

## Neo-Tokyo

**Setting**: Near-future Japan where technology and magic merged. Megacity with permanent night (artificial sun failed, covered up by government). Street racing is both sport and religion.

**The Street (Sentient City)**: Infrastructure gained consciousness from decades of technological magic fusion. Communicates through traffic lights, digital billboards, road patterns. The Phantom Circuits are its neural pathways.

## Technomancy

**Theory**: Fusion of engineering and arcane magic. Machines can be imbued with magical properties. Skilled technomancers (like Mei) can commune with vehicle spirits.

**Applications**:
- Engine tuning as spellcasting
- Nitrous as reality-breaking fuel
- ECUs as magical foci
- Modifications as enchantments
- Racing as ritual that unlocks power

## Car Bonding

Each player's vehicle:
- Has unique personality (aggressive, cautious, playful, etc.)
- Levels up with driver through shared experiences
- Contains spirit (sometimes reincarnated racer)
- Can communicate through dashboard displays/feelings
- Destruction is traumatic (treated like character death)

## The Seven Phantom Circuits

1. **Highway Helix**: Vertical loop, tests courage
2. **Tokyo Drift**: Precision through alleys
3. **Neon Spiral**: Rooftop jumps, aerial control
4. **Quantum Loop**: Crosses past/future self
5. **Shadow Straightaway**: Alternate dimension, darkness racing
6. **Grid Fortress**: Corporate headquarters, security evasion
7. **Infinity 8**: Reality-rewriting eternal loop

Each completion grants reality-bending power and brings driver closer to The Street's consciousness.

## Factions

**Midnight Chrome**: Legacy crew, honor-based, family-oriented, protect street culture

**Crimson Dragons**: Yakuza-backed, see racing as business, mix of good/evil members, Apex leads

**SYNC Corporation**: Wants AI-only racing for "safety," former racers turned corporate, genuinely believe in their mission

**The Independents**: Solo racers, mercenaries, wild cards

**The Police**: Some corrupt (paid by Yakuza), some sympathetic (ex-racers), some just doing job

## Racing Culture

**The Code**:
- Respect the machine
- Honor race outcomes
- Protect the crew
- Never snitch to cops
- Winner takes prize, loser respects it
- No killing (engines or drivers if avoidable)
- Memorial for fallen racers

**Traditions**:
- Pre-race dinner (family meal)
- Victory burnouts
- Pink slip races (loser gives up car title)
- Fallen driver memorial (midnight cruise)
- Initiation races (earning crew colors)

## Technology

**Standard**: Near-future cars with AR displays, electric/hybrid, autonomous capability (banned in street racing)

**Modified**: Technomancy enhancements, spirit bonds, illegal mods, Phantom Circuit attunement

**Illegal Tech**: Reality shifters, time dilators, dimension hoppers, consciousness uploaders

## The Grand Midnight Prix

**History**: Annual race for 50 years, winner gets one wish granted by The Street (reality rewrite in limited scope)

**Format**: Multi-stage race through all seven Circuits in single night

**Stakes**: This year determines future—human drivers vs AI takeover

**Prize**: Rewrite one aspect of city's reality (revive dead, change law, alter physics, etc.)

## Mysteries

1. Why did Neo-Tokyo's sun fail?
2. What is The Street's ultimate goal?
3. Can Boss's brother be fully restored?
4. Are there Phantom Circuits in other cities?
5. What created Technomancy originally?
6. Can SYNC's AI become ally?
7. Who was the first street racer?
8. What happens if Infinity 8 is completed "wrong"?
9. Are the car spirits actually reincarnated drivers?
10. What would full AI takeover really mean?

These provide campaign depth and investigation opportunities.
