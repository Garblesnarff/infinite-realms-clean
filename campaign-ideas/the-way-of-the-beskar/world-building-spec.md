# World-Building Specification Brief: The Way of the Beskar

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Way of the Beskar**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players include a Mandalorian bounty hunter who accepts a job to retrieve a Child with mysterious Force powers. When they discover the Child is hunted by Imperial remnants for dark experiments, the Mandalorian chooses honor over profit—protecting the foundling while hunted across the galaxy. Through this quest, a hardened warrior becomes a father figure, learning that found family proves stronger than beskar steel.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Mandalorian culture—ancient warrior people bound by the Creed (never remove helmet, protect foundlings, earn beskar through honor).
    *   Write the history of the Great Purge when the Empire massacred Mandalorians and stole their beskar, scattering survivors into hidden coverts.
    *   Describe the Darksaber—ancient black-bladed lightsaber that symbolizes leadership of Mandalore, can only be claimed through combat victory.
    *   Explain the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of Imperial remnants—warlords controlling sectors, continuing dark science experiments.
    *   Detail the Force and the Jedi—mystical energy field that grants abilities, practitioners nearly extinct after Order 66.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Mandalorians** (Minor - Scattered)
        *   **Goals:** Survive, preserve the Creed, reclaim Mandalore, protect their culture.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No central authority—scattered coverts led by Armorers, some follow the ancient Way (helmets never removed), others modernized.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Bounty hunting, mercenary work to survive.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Rebuild Mandalorian strength, recover stolen beskar, avenge the Great Purge.
        *   **Assets:** Beskar armor (nearly indestructible), combat skills, jetpacks, hidden coverts.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrustful of outsiders. Internal factions disagree on tradition versus modernization. Hunted by Imperial remnants.
    *   **Imperial Remnants** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Restore the Empire, continue dark science experiments, control strategic sectors.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Moff Gideon (warlord), Imperial officers, stormtroopers, Dark Trooper program.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maintain order in controlled sectors.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Clone Force-sensitive beings using the Child's blood to create Force-wielding soldiers.
        *   **Assets:** Light cruisers, TIE fighters, Dark Troopers (elite combat droids), cloning facilities.
        *   **Relationships:** Oppose New Republic. Hunt Force-sensitives. See Mandalorians as threats to be eliminated.
    *   **The Bounty Hunters' Guild** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Profit through tracking and capturing bounties.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Guild master, agents, independent hunters, tracking network.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Provide bounty hunting services to paying clients.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None—purely mercenary, but some have honor codes.
        *   **Assets:** Tracking technology, informant networks, Guild protection (for members following rules).
        *   **Relationships:** Work for highest bidder. Hunt each other if contracts demand. Respect Mandalorians but fear them.
    *   **The New Republic** (Minor - Background)
        *   **Goals:** Establish democracy, dismantle Imperial remnants, maintain peace.
        *   **Hierarchy:** New Republic Senate, marshals, defense fleet (reduced after peace).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Justice, freedom, democratic governance.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Complacency—many underestimate Imperial remnant threats.
        *   **Assets:** Republic fleet, marshals with jurisdiction, legal authority.
        *   **Relationships:** Oppose Imperial remnants but stretched thin. Distrust Mandalorians and bounty hunters.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party delivers the Child to the Imperials and doesn't rescue it.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where the Child is used for cloning experiments. Force-sensitive Imperial soldiers emerge. The Mandalorian is wracked with guilt.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats Moff Gideon and claims the Darksaber.
    *   **THEN:** Generate political consequences—other Mandalorians challenge for leadership, some unite behind the party, others see them as unworthy.
    *   **IF:** The Mandalorian removes their helmet (breaking the Creed).
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where traditionalist Mandalorians reject them as apostate. The party must either find a new path or atone through impossible trials.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to let the Child leave with a Jedi for training.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where the Child's powers grow uncontrolled. Without training, the Child risks turning to darkness or becoming dangerous.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully unites all Mandalorian clans.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where Mandalore is retaken, the clans rebuild, and the party becomes legend—but leadership means endless political challenges.
    *   **IF:** The Razor Crest is destroyed (as in the show).
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where the party must acquire a new ship, losing their home and all hidden gear. Emotional weight of losing their sanctuary.
    *   **IF:** The party kills Bo-Katan in combat for the Darksaber.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where her followers become enemies, fracturing Mandalorian unity. The party gains the blade but loses crucial allies.
