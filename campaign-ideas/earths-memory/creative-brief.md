# Creative Brief: Earth's Memory

## Visual Aesthetics

### Color Palette
- **Geological Layers**: Sedimentary browns/reds (#8B4513, #CD853F), limestone cream (#F5DEB3), granite gray (#708090), basalt black (#2F4F4F)
- **Temporal Glow**: Ancient amber (#FFBF00), primordial blue (#4682B4), extinction red (#8B0000)
- **Stratum Mind**: Stone-gray with glowing veins of gold light, shifting fractal patterns
- **Time Periods**: Each era has signature color (Cambrian blue-green, Permian dark red, Cretaceous tropical, etc.)

### Visual Style
- Grand Canyon aesthetics meets geological cross-section diagrams
- Layered reality—past visible through cracks in present
- Petroglyphs that write themselves, glowing with inner light
- Stone that breathes, trembles with thought
- Visions overlaid on physical world (dinosaurs walking transparent through canyon)

### Key Visuals
1. The Living Wall: Massive cliff face with all layers exposed, each glowing different color
2. Temporal Echo: Character touching stone, surrounded by vision of ancient world
3. The Great Dying: Chamber filled with fossils, overwhelming atmosphere of loss
4. The Sealed Chamber: Memory crystal showing holographic city of advanced civilization
5. The Primordial Core: Molten rock cooling into first stone, birth of consciousness
6. The Full Dream: All eras visible simultaneously, layered like translucent paintings

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Themes
- **Stratum Mind Theme**: Deep bass drones, sounds of stone grinding (like tectonic plates), echoing across vast time
- **Descent Motif**: Progressively lower notes as party travels deeper/backward in time
- **Memory Vision Theme**: Each era has distinct instrumentation (Cambrian: aquatic sounds; Mesozoic: primal percussion; etc.)
- **Warning Theme**: Dissonant, urgent, building to crescendo

### Ambient Soundscapes
- **Surface**: Wind through canyon, distant tremors (bass rumble), falling rocks, echo
- **Memory Visions**: Period-appropriate sounds (ancient oceans, dinosaur calls, ice cracking)
- **Deep Time**: Crushing silence punctuated by slow heartbeat of Earth itself
- **Earthquake**: Building rumble, cracking stone, avalanche roar

## Voice Acting

### Stoneguard Thrain
- Deep, gravelly, speaks with pauses between words (thinks in stone-time)
- "The stone... speaks... but we must have patience... to hear."

### The Stratum Mind
- Multiple voices speaking in slow unison, sound of grinding stone underlying words
- "We... remember... the first breath of life... the last breath of species... we remember... all."

### Echo of the Builders
- Desperate, distorted by time, cutting in and out like bad recording
- "Don't—*static*—like we did—*stone grinding*—the dream becomes—*crack*—real if you believe too—*silence*"

### The Timekeeper
- Timeless, neither young nor old, perfectly calm
- "A moment. An eon. What difference, to stone?"
