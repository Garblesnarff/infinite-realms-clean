# Creative Brief: The Magitek Rebellion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Steampunk Opera Fantasy (Final Fantasy VI-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic 16-bit aesthetic of *Final Fantasy VI*, blending steampunk technology, high fantasy magic, operatic drama, and post-apocalyptic desolation. This style aims to capture the epic, tragic, hopeful, and operatic tone of "The Magitek Rebellion," where an ensemble cast fights against an empire, witnesses the world's destruction, and must find meaning in the ruins.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Duality:** Contrast Magitek (industrial, mechanical) with natural magic (organic, ethereal). Show the World of Balance (civilized, colorful) versus the World of Ruin (desolate, broken).
*   **Operatic Drama:** Scenes should have theatrical weight - dramatic poses, expressive characters, moments of emotional intensity.
*   **Ensemble Focus:** No single hero dominates; show the diverse cast working together, each with distinctive silhouettes and color schemes.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, tragic, hopeful, operatic, steampunk, post-apocalyptic, ensemble, magical, industrial, dramatic, bittersweet.
*   **Feeling:** A grand opera spanning the life and death of a world. The atmosphere balances magnificent set pieces with intimate character moments, triumphant battles with devastating losses. The tone shifts from adventure to apocalypse to hard-won hope.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean pixel art with strong character silhouettes and detailed mechanical designs for Magitek armor. Forms blend organic fantasy with industrial technology.
*   **Textures:** Pixel textures differentiate materials - gleaming Magitek armor, flowing opera gowns, rusted post-apocalyptic wreckage, magical energy effects.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in 16-bit JRPG pixel art style. The focus is on a Magitek armor suit, a mechanical knight with steam pipes, defined pixel edges showing metal plating and glowing energy cores."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich and varied. World of Balance uses vibrant colors - Imperial red and gold, Returner blues and greens, opera house purples and whites. World of Ruin shifts to desaturated browns, grays, toxic yellows, with rare spots of color symbolizing hope.
*   **Esper Magic:** Distinctive rainbow prismatic effects. Magitek uses harsh electric blues and industrial oranges.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...the World of Ruin rendered in pixel art, using a palette of ash gray, rust brown, and dead vegetation yellow, with a single green plant struggling to grow, rendered in vibrant emerald to show hope."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Highly distinctive character silhouettes. Terra with green hair and pink dress, Locke with bandana and adventurer's gear, Celes in opera gown or Imperial armor, Edgar in royal regalia, Sabin bare-chested with martial artist's gi, Cyan in samurai armor, Kefka in jester motley with wild makeup.
*   **Expression:** Despite pixel limitations, characters must convey deep emotion - Celes's torment, Kefka's madness, Locke's charm, Terra's uncertainty.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A court jester in pixel art style with purple and yellow clothing, chalk-white makeup, wild yellow hair, holding a crooked staff, laughing maniacally with arms raised in theatrical triumph."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Diverse locations - snowy Narshe, industrial Vector, ornate Opera House, floating continent amid clouds, shattered World of Ruin, divine Kefka's Tower.
*   **Atmosphere:** Can shift from beautiful (opera performance under chandeliers) to horrifying (poisoned kingdom filled with corpses) to desolate (empty cities in the World of Ruin) to sublime (ascending through divine layers toward godhood).
*   **Details:** Small pixel details tell stories - Magitek factories belching smoke, opera house stage machinery, broken relics of the old world, flowers growing in ruins.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pixel art landscape of a grand opera house interior during a performance. Red velvet curtains, golden balconies filled with audience members, a stage with elaborate painted scenery, crystal chandelier overhead casting dramatic light."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic pixel art shading with 3-4 tones per color. Lighting emphasizes theatrical moments - spotlight on opera singer, harsh industrial lighting in Magitek facility, dim despair of the World of Ruin, divine radiance in Kefka's Tower.
*   **Special Effects:** Esper magic creates prismatic rainbow effects. Magitek energy is harsh electric blue. Kefka's divine power manifests as chaotic, multi-colored devastation.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting guides emotional tone - warm and heroic for triumphs, cold and harsh for Imperial oppression, dim for despair, overwhelming for divine encounters.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a single spotlight illuminating an opera singer in a flowing white gown on stage, with the audience shrouded in darkness. Dramatic pixel art shading emphasizes the theatricality of the moment."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Theatrical compositions emphasizing the ensemble cast. Wide shots show the full party facing overwhelming odds. Character-focused scenes use rule of thirds. Kefka's appearance is always compositionally chaotic and off-balance.
*   **Techniques:** Use height and position to show power dynamics. The party small before the Floating Continent, Kefka towering above as a god, friends reuniting at eye level.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide pixel art composition showing fourteen heroes standing together on a cliff overlooking Kefka's Tower at the world's center. The tower dominates the upper portion, a massive structure of twisted metal and divine energy, while the heroes occupy the lower third, small but determined."

## Voice

A rich, operatic voice with theatrical projection and emotional depth, capable of soaring tragedy and intimate tenderness. The pacing shifts between dramatic pronouncements and quiet, heartfelt moments. The emotion carries the full weight of opera - from triumphant arias to devastating laments to defiant final stands. Audio quality is pristine and reverberant, as if performing in a grand theater. Role: The voice of a narrator recounting the opera of a world's death and rebirth, or Maria performing at the Opera House.
