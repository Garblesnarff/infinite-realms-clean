# Creative Brief: Combat Healer Chronicles

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Military Fantasy with Heroic Brutality

Inspired by military fantasy anime like *Gate*, *The Saga of Tanya the Evil*, dark fantasy series like *Berserk*, and training arc classics like *Naruto* and *My Hero Academia*. This style combines gritty warfare realism with heroic determination, brutal training sequences with moments of tenderness, and the visceral impact of combat healing magic.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Brutal Honesty**: War is depicted with weight and consequence. Scars matter, exhaustion shows, victories are hard-won.
*   **Heroic Determination**: Despite darkness, characters radiate resolve. Healers stand tall on front lines, defiant and capable.
*   **Dynamic Combat**: Action is kinetic and impactful. Healing magic manifests as brilliant energy, combat is close and personal.
*   **Transformation Through Trial**: Visual progression from raw recruits to battle-hardened heroes. Scars, confidence, and bearing change.
