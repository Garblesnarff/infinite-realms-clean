### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Infinite Horizon**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The Prime Material Plane is dying from a planar blight, and within a generation, all life will end. The party joins the Horizon Initiative, traveling through a dimensional wormhole to explore distant demiplanes as potential new homes. Time flows differently in each demiplane—days there could mean years back home. The party must find salvation while grappling with the knowledge that everyone they love ages without them, and that love might be the force that transcends time itself.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the discovery of the planar blight and humanity's realization that extinction is inevitable without intervention.
    *   Write the story of the discovery of the wormhole and the early, failed expeditions through it.
    *   Describe the formation of the Horizon Initiative and the selection criteria for its crews.
    *   Explain the physics of time dilation in different demiplanes and how it's caused by proximity to gravitational anomalies.
    *   Detail the theory that higher-dimensional beings created the wormhole to help lower-dimensional civilizations.
    *   Describe the science behind the tesseract—a higher-dimensional space where all time exists simultaneously.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Horizon Initiative (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Find a habitable demiplane for mass colonization, save civilization from extinction.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Mission Commander, pilot, scientists, engineers (the party members).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Heroic explorers saving humanity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each member carries personal motivations—loved ones, redemption, legacy, duty.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced starship, scientific equipment, wormhole access, mission control support.
        *   **Relationships:** Supported by the world government; racing against time; isolated from normal society.
    *   **Mission Control** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Support the Horizon Initiative, coordinate rescue efforts if possible, maintain morale.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Director, scientists, communications specialists, support staff.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Running the mission.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Struggling with the knowledge that even if the party succeeds, it may be too late.
        *   **Assets:** Ground-based facilities, computational power, communication relay.
        *   **Relationships:** Supporting the party; aging rapidly due to time dilation; watching the world die.
    *   **Previous Expeditions (Failed)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Varied—some sought glory, some survival, some went mad.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Each expedition was independent.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Exploring potential new homes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Dr. Mann's expedition lied about findings to justify rescue; others simply vanished.
        *   **Assets:** Ruins of outposts, data logs, cautionary tales.
        *   **Relationships:** Dead, missing, or encountered as obstacles; warnings of what can go wrong.
    *   **The Dying World's Population** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Survive as long as possible, maintain hope, support the Initiative.
        *   **Hierarchy:** World government, civilians, scientists working on the blight.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Daily survival.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many have given up hope and are simply living out their final years.
        *   **Assets:** What remains of civilization, historical knowledge, love for the explorers.
        *   **Relationships:** The party's loved ones; aging rapidly; either hopeful or despairing.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party spends time in a time-dilated demiplane.
    *   **THEN:** Calculate time passage at home (use specific ratios). Generate aged messages from loved ones. NPCs back home age, die, or move on with their lives.
    *   **IF:** The party encounters Dr. Mann.
    *   **THEN:** He initially appears helpful but generates scenes of escalating desperation, culminating in attempted murder when they discover his lies.
    *   **IF:** The party enters the tesseract.
    *   **THEN:** Generate surreal scenes of perceiving all time simultaneously. Allow communication with past/future. Reveal the equation to prevent the blight.
    *   **IF:** The party transmits the solution backward through time.
    *   **THEN:** Generate scenes of their aged daughter receiving the data and saving the world. Reality shifts—when they return, the blight is prevented.
    *   **IF:** The party returns home after decades/centuries have passed.
    *   **THEN:** Generate emotional reunion scenes with elderly or deceased loved ones. The world is changed. They're strangers in a time they helped create.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to settle in one of the demiplanes instead of returning.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where they build a new civilization, knowing they'll never see home again but carrying its legacy forward.
