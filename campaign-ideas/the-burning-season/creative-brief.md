# The Burning Season - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Wildfire Apocalypse Cinema** - Emphasis on fire walls, smoke clouds, ash fall, scorched earth. Orange/red glow everywhere. Silhouettes against flames. Beauty in destruction—fire is gorgeous and horrifying.

## Color Palettes
- **The Burning**: Orange flame, red ember, yellow heat, white-hot core
- **The Smoke**: Grey clouds, brown haze, black soot, obscured sun
- **The Ash**: Grey wasteland, white ash-snow, dead black, colorless world
- **The Tyrant**: Pure white flame, reality-burning heat, primordial orange

## Music & Sound
**Main Theme**: "Everything Burns" - Crackling fire as percussion, roaring flames as bass, screaming winds feeding flames, builds to inferno. **Sound**: Constant roar of fire, crackling, trees exploding from heat, animals fleeing, wind howling.

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 2**: Wall of fire approaching, towering hundreds of feet, consuming everything
- **Session 20**: Ember Tyrant revealed—miles-tall being of pure flame, beautiful terror
- **Session 30**: Fire stopped—rain finally falling, steam rising, silence after inferno
