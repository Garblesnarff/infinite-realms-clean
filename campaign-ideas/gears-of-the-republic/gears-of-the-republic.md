# Gears of the Republic
*Where progress and tradition collide in clouds of smoke and magic*

## Campaign Overview

The Republic stands divided between two sister cities: **Piltover**, the gleaming City of Progress where hextech innovation fuels an age of enlightenment, and **Zaun**, the underground Undercity where toxic fumes mingle with desperate ingenuity. For generations, Piltover has thrived on the backs of Zaun's labor, mining the rare crystals that power their wondrous machines while Zaunites choke on industrial runoff and broken dreams.

The party begins as unlikely allies—some from Piltover's gilded academies, others from Zaun's chemical-stained streets—brought together when a series of mysterious explosions rocks both cities. What seems like terrorist attacks soon reveals a deeper conspiracy: someone is weaponizing hextech in ways that could shatter the fragile peace and transform both cities into a war zone. As the party investigates, they'll navigate corrupt councils, revolutionary cells, gang warfare, and the moral complexities of progress built on exploitation.

The campaign explores themes of inequality, technological ethics, and whether reform or revolution offers the true path to justice. Can the party unite the divided cities, or will they choose a side and watch the Republic burn?

## Core Themes

- **Class Warfare & Inequality**: The stark divide between Piltover's prosperity and Zaun's poverty
- **Progress vs. Tradition**: Hextech innovation threatening established magical orders
- **Moral Complexity**: No clear villains, only people fighting for their vision of the future
- **Found Family**: Unlikely allies becoming brothers-in-arms across class lines
- **The Cost of Power**: What sacrifices are acceptable for technological advancement?

## Session Breakdown (30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Smoke and Mirrors (Sessions 1-6)
**Session 1-2**: The party meets during a hextech exhibition in Piltover when an explosion destroys the main pavilion. They're hired by Councilor Kiramman to investigate, leading them into Zaun's depths for the first time.

**Session 3-4**: Investigation reveals the explosives used hextech combined with Shimmer, a dangerous Zaunite alchemical enhancement. The trail leads to The Last Drop tavern and an encounter with Vander's gang.

**Session 5-6**: A raid on a Shimmer lab goes wrong, revealing that someone in Piltover's Council is secretly funding the production. First major moral choice: expose the conspiracy and risk civil war, or leverage it for reform.

### Arc 2: The Undercity Rises (Sessions 7-12)
**Session 7-8**: Zaun erupts in riots after Piltover enforcers kill a child during a raid. The party must navigate the chaos while tracking down Silco, a revolutionary leader orchestrating the unrest.

**Session 9-10**: Infiltration of Silco's headquarters in the Sump reveals his plan: create enough chaos to force Zaun's independence. The party discovers he's building a massive hextech weapon.

**Session 11-12**: The party must choose: help Silco's revolution, defend Piltover's status quo, or find a third path. A major battle erupts at the Bridge of Progress, with the party's choices determining casualties and political fallout.

### Arc 3: Hextech Ascendance (Sessions 13-18)
**Session 13-14**: Piltover responds by accelerating their own hextech weapons program. The party is recruited by Jayce Talis and Viktor to help perfect hextech augmentation for law enforcement.

**Session 15-16**: Viktor's secret experiments with self-augmentation go wrong, creating the first "Glorious Evolved"—people transformed into magical automatons. The party must decide his fate.

**Session 17-18**: A splinter group of Piltover inventors, believing hextech is too dangerous, attempts to destroy all hextech research. The party must stop them while questioning if they're right.

### Arc 4: The Chembarons' Gambit (Sessions 19-24)
**Session 19-20**: With both cities destabilized, Zaun's criminal Chembarons see opportunity. They begin a gang war for control of Shimmer production and hextech smuggling routes.

**Session 21-22**: The party must broker a truce or eliminate the Chembarons while dealing with their own moral corruption—hextech and Shimmer's temptations.

**Session 23-24**: Discovery that one Chembaron has been the puppet master all along, secretly playing both cities against each other to create a third power: a criminal empire built on hextech-enhanced enforcers.

### Arc 5: The Republic Fractures (Sessions 25-30)
**Session 25-26**: Full-scale war erupts. Piltover deploys hextech war machines while Zaun unleashes chemtech monstrosities. The party must pick their battles and save who they can.

**Session 27-28**: The ultimate conspiracy revealed: Councilor Medarda has been orchestrating everything to create a weapons market for Noxian interests. The party must expose her while cities burn.

**Session 29**: Climactic battle at Piltover's Hextech Tower. The party faces three factions simultaneously: Medarda's forces, Silco's revolutionaries, and the Chembarons' army.

**Session 30**: Resolution. Depending on party choices throughout the campaign, possible endings include: unified republic with equal representation, independent city-states with tense peace, complete destruction requiring rebuilding from scratch, or a new technocratic oligarchy.

## Key NPCs

**Councilor Cassandra Kiramman** (Lawful Neutral)
A reform-minded Piltover aristocrat who genuinely wants to help Zaun but struggles with her own privilege and blind spots. Stern, elegant, and pragmatic. Can become a powerful ally if the party earns her trust.

**Silco** (Neutral Evil with Chaotic tendencies)
Revolutionary leader of Zaun who believes in independence by any means necessary. Scarred from a past betrayal, he's ruthlessly pragmatic but genuinely cares for Zaun's future. Complex antagonist who may be justified in his methods.

**Jayce Talis** (Neutral Good)
The "Man of Progress," a charismatic inventor who created hextech. Idealistic but naive about politics. His relationship with the party determines whether he becomes a hero or falls to corruption.

**Viktor** (True Neutral)
Jayce's partner from Zaun, dying from industrial pollution. His quest to transcend flesh through hextech augmentation makes him either humanity's savior or its doom. Philosophical and detached, yet deeply passionate.

**Ekko** (Chaotic Good)
Young Zaunite genius who invented a time-manipulation device. Leads the Firelights, a resistance group trying to help common people. Represents hope and optimism despite overwhelming odds.

**Sevika** (Lawful Evil)
Silco's enforcer with a chemtech-augmented arm. Loyal to Zaun above all else. Respect-based relationship with party—will fight them or alongside them depending on their commitment to Zaun.

**Corina Veraza, The Chembaron** (Neutral Evil)
The mastermind secretly manipulating both cities. Uses poison gas and corrupted plants as weapons. Elegant, sophisticated, and utterly amoral. Final boss material.

**Mel Medarda** (Lawful Evil)
Piltover Councilor with Noxian heritage. Schemes to create a weapons market by destabilizing the Republic. Brilliant, charming, and dangerously connected to foreign powers.

## Major Locations

**Piltover - The City of Progress**
Gleaming spires of white stone and brass, powered by blue-glowing hextech crystals. Golden Age architecture meets magical innovation. Key locations: Council Chambers, Hextech Workshop, Academy District, The Promenade (shopping district), Kiramman Estate.

**Zaun - The Undercity**
Built in the caverns beneath Piltover, illuminated by green chemtech lights and neon signs. Industrial Gothic aesthetic with pipes, catwalks, and toxic rivers. Key locations: The Last Drop (tavern), The Sump (lowest level), Shimmer factories, The Lanes (residential district), Silco's headquarters.

**The Bridge of Progress**
The main connection between cities, heavily guarded by Piltover enforcers. Site of multiple major battles and protests. Symbol of both connection and division.

**The Hexgates**
Massive portals allowing instant trade ship teleportation, powered by enormous hextech crystals. Engineering marvel that made Piltover rich but required devastating mining in Zaun's depths.

**The Grey District**
The border zone between cities, perpetually shrouded in toxic fog from Zaun's industries. Home to refugees, criminals, and those caught between worlds.

**Viktor's Lab**
Hidden beneath Zaun, this is where the Glorious Evolution experiments occur. Filled with augmented beings in various stages of transformation. Creepy body-horror aesthetic.

**The Greenhouse**
Corina's secret lair, where she cultivates poisonous plants fed with hextech-infused chemicals. Beautiful but deadly, filled with carnivorous flora.

## Unique Mechanics

**Hextech Items**
Players can craft or acquire hextech-enhanced equipment using rare crystals. Each item requires attunement and has a chance of catastrophic failure. Examples:
- Hextech Gauntlets (Atlas Gauntlets): Devastating melee strikes, risk of overload
- Hexclaw Grappling Hook: Mobility tool with elemental additions
- Hex Rifle: Long-range magical weapon with various ammunition types

**Shimmer Enhancement**
Alchemical substance granting temporary superhuman abilities but risking addiction and mutation. Players must track Shimmer corruption. Benefits include: enhanced strength (+4 STR), regeneration (5 HP per turn), resistance to damage. Risks: addiction, permanent mutations, mental instability.

**Augmentation System**
Players can replace limbs with chemtech or hextech prosthetics, trading humanity for power. Each augmentation provides mechanical benefits but risks identity loss. Track "Humanity Score"—drop too low and risk losing character to NPC status.

**Faction Reputation**
Track reputation with Piltover Council, Zaun Revolutionaries, Chembarons, and Enforcers. High reputation unlocks unique benefits, missions, and equipment. Conflicting allegiances create narrative tension.

**Environmental Hazards**
Zaun's toxic atmosphere requires Constitution saves or suffer exhaustion. Hextech explosions create wild magic surges. Industrial machinery creates dynamic battlefields with moving parts and hazards.

**Invention Mini-Game**
Players can invent their own hextech or chemtech devices using an invention point system. Successes create useful tools; failures create catastrophes. Encourages creative problem-solving.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**The Origin of Hextech**: The crystals powering hextech are actually trapped souls of an ancient civilization. Using them may be fundamentally evil.

**Viktor's Ascension**: Viktor's Glorious Evolution actually works—his augmented followers are happier, healthier, and more efficient. Is transcending humanity actually the answer?

**Silco's Sacrifice**: Silco is dying from the same pollution that killed Viktor's lungs. His revolution is a desperate attempt to save his people before he dies.

**The Kiramman Secret**: The Kiramman family wealth was built on exploiting Zaun. Cassandra's reform attempts are atonement for inherited guilt.

**Ekko's Device**: The time-travel device allows limited do-overs of failed missions, but each use fractures reality further. Too many uses could collapse both cities.

**The True Enemy**: A third faction—Noxian infiltrators—have been manipulating both sides to weaken the Republic for invasion.

**Shimmer Revelation**: Shimmer is derived from rare purple flowers that only grow where hextech crystals were mined. It's literally Zaun's poisoned land fighting back.

**The Traitor**: One party member is secretly working for a faction (determined by player backstory hooks and choices). Revelation creates major trust crisis.

## Victory Conditions

**United Republic**: Expose corruption, broker peace between cities, establish equal representation. Requires maintaining good reputation with both Piltover and Zaun factions while defeating extremists on both sides.

**Zaunite Independence**: Help Silco's revolution succeed while minimizing casualties. Requires siding against Piltover power structures and accepting moral compromises.

**Technological Renaissance**: Side with Viktor and create the Glorious Evolution, transcending human limitations and inequality through hextech augmentation. Transhumanist ending.

**Return to Tradition**: Destroy hextech technology entirely, exposing its corrupting influence. Requires alliance with anti-tech factions and acceptance of lower standard of living.

**Criminal Empire**: Side with the Chembarons, establishing the party as the new powers behind both cities. Dark ending requiring ruthless pragmatism.

## Defeat Conditions

**Total War**: Both cities destroy each other in hextech/chemtech warfare. Thousands die, the Republic becomes a smoking crater. Failure to stop the escalation cycle.

**Noxian Conquest**: Take too long and Noxian forces invade the weakened Republic. Both cities become occupied territories.

**Hextech Apocalypse**: Reckless hextech experimentation causes a cataclysmic explosion that levels both cities. Wild magic surge on continental scale.

**Shimmer Plague**: Uncontrolled Shimmer production causes a mutation epidemic that transforms the population into monsters. Zombie apocalypse with alchemical twist.

**Lost to Corruption**: The party itself becomes irredeemably corrupted by power, becoming new oppressors worse than those they fought. Tragic fall from grace.

## Campaign Hooks for Different Party Compositions

**All-Piltover Party**: Investigation starts as defending their home but gradually reveals uncomfortable truths about their privilege and city's exploitation.

**All-Zaun Party**: Revenge quest against Piltover oppression evolves into choosing between violent revolution and difficult compromise.

**Mixed Party**: Built-in conflict and tension as party members' loyalties are tested. Personal relationships versus political allegiances.

**Criminal Background**: Working for Chembarons leads to discovering deeper conspiracy and choosing between profit and principles.

**Inventor Focus**: Party of artificers and tinkers becomes ground zero for the hextech ethics debate, shaping technology's future.
