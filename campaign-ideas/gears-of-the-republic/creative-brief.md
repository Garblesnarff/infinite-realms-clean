# Gears of the Republic - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
Arcane-inspired contrast between Art Nouveau elegance (Piltover) and Industrial Gothic grit (Zaun). Emphasize the vertical stratification—wealth rises, poverty sinks. Visual storytelling through environmental details: clean lines versus organic chaos, natural light versus artificial glow.

### Piltover Visual Identity
- **Architecture**: White marble, brass fixtures, geometric patterns, Art Nouveau curves, stained glass windows with hextech blue light
- **Fashion**: Victorian-inspired formal wear with modern twists—tailored coats, waistcoats, goggles as accessories, subtle hextech jewelry
- **Lighting**: Natural sunlight, warm golden hour glow, crisp blue hextech illumination
- **Props**: Ornate clockwork devices, leather-bound journals, brass telescopes, crystal champagne flutes

### Zaun Visual Identity
- **Architecture**: Industrial pipes, rusty metal catwalks, layers of platforms, leaking steam vents, graffiti and neon signs
- **Fashion**: Practical workwear—leather aprons, gas masks, patched clothing, chemtech prosthetics, punk aesthetic with spikes and chains
- **Lighting**: Green chemtech glow, flickering neon, deep shadows with pools of harsh artificial light
- **Props**: Makeshift weapons, Shimmer vials (purple liquid in glass), respirators, improvised tools

### Character Design Philosophy
Every character's design tells their story. Wealthy Piltovans are clean and angular; Zaunites are weathered and asymmetric. Mixed-class characters show visual conflicts (fine coat with worn boots, or rough exterior with educated bearing).

## Color Palettes

### Piltover Palette
- **Primary**: Gold (#D4AF37), Cream (#F5F5DC), Sky Blue (#87CEEB)
- **Accent**: Hextech Blue (electric #00A3E0), Brass (#B5A642), White (#FFFFFF)

- **Use**: Council chambers, academies, wealthy districts

### Zaun Palette
- **Primary**: Industrial Grey (#4A4A4A), Rust Orange (#CD7F32), Toxic Green (#39FF14)
- **Accent**: Shimmer Purple (#9B30FF), Neon Pink (#FF10F0), Deep Shadow (#1C1C1C)
- **Mood**: Desperate, vibrant despite darkness, defiant

### Conflict Zones Palette

  - Warning Orange (#FF6600) for danger
  - Explosion Yellow (#FFFF00) for action
  - Blood Red (#8B0000) for violence
  - Smoke Grey (#808080) for ambiguity

### Emotional Scene Palettes
- **Hope**: Warm sunlight breaking through Zaun's smog, golden hour
- **Despair**: Desaturated, heavy shadows, only toxic green light
- **Revelation**: Sharp contrast, dramatic backlight, lens flares from hextech
- **Intimacy**: Soft focus, warm candlelight or bioluminescent plants

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Theme
Orchestral meets industrial percussion. String instruments for emotional depth, brass for heroism, mechanical sounds (gears, steam hissing, metal clanging) as percussion. Dual motifs: elegant waltz for Piltover, driving industrial rhythm for Zaun.

**Instrumentation**: Full orchestra, anvils, steam whistle samples, synthesized hextech hums, distorted electric guitar for action scenes.

### Piltover Musical Identity
- **Style**: Chamber music, orchestral arrangements, jazz age sophistication
- **Instruments**: Strings, piano, harpsichord, brass ensemble, music box
- **Tempo**: Measured, waltz time (3/4), sophisticated complexity
- **Reference Artists**: Vitamin String Quartet, Ramin Djawadi, Joe Hisaishi
- **Key Scenes**:
  - Council meetings: formal, slightly pompous
  - Hextech unveiling: wonder and triumph
  - Private moments: intimate chamber music

### Zaun Musical Identity
- **Style**: Industrial, punk rock, electronic with organic instruments
- **Instruments**: Distorted guitar, drums with metal percussion, bass, synthesizers, found object sounds
- **Tempo**: Driving, aggressive, syncopated rhythms
- **Reference Artists**: Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, Woodkid
- **Key Scenes**:
  - Gang battles: aggressive, chaotic
  - Revolutionary rallies: anthemic, defiant
  - Toxic atmosphere: eerie, oppressive soundscapes

### Character Themes

**Silco's Theme**: Minor key melody with clockwork precision, building intensity. Lone cello with industrial undertones.

**Viktor's Theme**: Ethereal synthesizers meeting organic instruments, representing flesh/machine duality. Phillip Glass-inspired minimalism.

**Ekko's Theme**: Hip-hop beats with orchestral strings, representing hope through chaos. Youthful energy with mature depth.

**Jayce's Theme**: Heroic brass fanfare slowly corrupted by discordant notes as his arc progresses.

### Combat Music Tiers
1. **Skirmish**: Single instrument leitmotifs with light percussion
2. **Battle**: Full instrumentation, driving rhythm, faction-appropriate style
3. **Boss Fight**: Combination of hero theme and villain theme in musical conflict
4. **Climax**: Full orchestra plus industrial percussion, both city themes colliding

### Ambient Soundscapes

**Piltover Ambience**:
- Distant clockwork mechanisms
- Polite conversation murmur
- Carriage wheels on cobblestone
- Hextech hum (subtle, constant)
- Wind through high towers

**Zaun Ambience**:
- Steam hissing from pipes
- Metal groaning and creaking
- Distant machinery churning
- Crowd noise (aggressive, desperate)
- Toxic liquid dripping

## Player Experience Goals

**Emotional Journey**:
Start with wonder at technological marvels → discomfort at inequality → anger at injustice → moral complexity → difficult choice → bittersweet resolution

**Sensory Immersion**:
Use music, sound effects, and visual descriptions to make players feel the environmental difference between cities. Piltover should feel aspirational; Zaun should feel suffocating.

**Memorable Moments**:
Every session should have at least one "screenshot" moment—a scene so visually striking or emotionally powerful it could be a poster.

**Tonal Balance**:
40% political intrigue, 30% action, 20% character drama, 10% philosophical debate. Adjust based on player preferences but maintain core identity.
