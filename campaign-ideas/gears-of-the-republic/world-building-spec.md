# Gears of the Republic - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

### Ancient Era (2000+ years ago)
The land where the Republic now stands was home to the **Brackern**, a race of crystal-scorpion beings whose consciousness resided in magical crystals. They lived in harmony with the earth, their crystals naturally absorbing and storing magical energy.

### The Founding (300 years ago)
Human settlers discovered the mineral-rich canyon and established two settlements: **Piltover** on the cliffs above, and **Zaun** (originally called Oshra Va'Zaun) in the fertile valley below. They were equal partner cities, sharing resources and governance.

### The Great Collapse (200 years ago)
An earthquake caused by excessive mining collapsed the valley floor, creating the massive chasm called **The Rift**. Zaun sank into the depths while Piltover remained high. This physical division became a social one—wealth rose, poverty fell.

### The Hextech Revolution (50 years ago)
Inventor **Stanwick Pididly** discovered how to harness Brackern crystals' power, creating the first hextech devices. He built his fortune on stolen research from underground inventors. The **Hexgates** were constructed, making Piltover a trade hub.

### The Shimmer Emergence (10 years ago)
Alchemist **Singed** invented Shimmer while trying to cure industrial diseases. Instead, he created an enhancement drug. The formula leaked to the Chembarons, triggering a new era of conflict.

### Current Era (Campaign Start)
Tensions at breaking point. Piltover's prosperity built on Zaun's exploitation. Revolutionary movements growing. Hextech advancing rapidly with unknown consequences.

## Causality Chains

### Economic Spiral

2. Zaun mines deeper, releases more toxins
3. Zaun citizens get sicker, become desperate

### Viktor's Ascension
1. Viktor's disease worsens
2. Desperate self-experimentation
3. Success creates temptation

## Magic and Technology Systems

### Hextech Mechanics
**Power Source**: Brackern crystals contain souls of ancient beings. Using them is essentially soul slavery, though users don't know this.

**Stabilization**: Crystals are inherently unstable. Must be cut precisely and mounted in runic matrices to safely channel power.

**Applications**:
- Energy weapons (rifles, gauntlets, explosives)
- Transportation (Hexgates, levitation, speed enhancement)
- Enhancement (strength, shields, healing acceleration)
- Utility (lights, tools, communications)

**Dangers**:
- Overuse causes wild magic surges
- Cracked crystals explode violently
- Prolonged exposure causes magical radiation sickness
- May attract attention of vengeful Brackern spirits

### Chemtech Mechanics
**Power Source**: Alchemical reactions between rare Zaun plants and minerals, accelerated by hextech catalysts.

**Characteristics**: Organic, toxic, unstable, powerful but with terrible side effects.

**Applications**:
- Shimmer (enhancement drug with purple glow)
- Poison gases (various colors indicate effects)
- Mutagens (temporary or permanent transformations)
- Prosthetics (chemtech-powered artificial limbs)
- Medicines (powerful but addictive)

**Dangers**:
- Addiction and dependency
- Mutations (often permanent and disfiguring)
- Environmental contamination
- Moral corruption (easy power at terrible cost)

### Augmentation System Details
**Levels of Augmentation**:
1. **Minor**: Single prosthetic limb (25% human/75% human)
2. **Moderate**: Multiple augmentations or one major (50/50)
3. **Major**: Mostly mechanical (25% human/75% machine)
4. **Complete**: Glorious Evolution (brain in machine)

**Mechanical Benefits by Level**:
- Minor: +2 to related ability score
- Moderate: +4, gain one special ability
- Major: +6, gain two special abilities, disadvantage on Charisma
- Complete: Become construct type, lose original identity

**Humanity Cost**:
Each augmentation level reduces Humanity score. At 0, character becomes NPC controlled by DM. Represents loss of self to the machine.

### Industrial Magic
Some Zaunites have developed intuitive magic through toxic exposure:
- **Poison Immunity**: Resistance or immunity to Zaun's toxins
- **Chemical Sense**: Detect alchemical substances
- **Adaptive Biology**: Minor shapeshifting to survive environment
- **Bioluminescence**: Generate light through chemical reaction

These powers mark carriers as "Zaun-touched" or "Gray-blessed" depending on perspective.
