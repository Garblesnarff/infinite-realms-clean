# Wheel of Fate
## "Fortune Rises, Fortune Falls, The Wheel Turns For All"

### Campaign Overview

The Carnival of Fate is eternal chaos made carnival. Massive wheels spin endlessly, determining outcomes for all who enter. The party arrives broke, desperate, and destined for greatness—or ruin, depending on the spin. Fortuna, the mad Wheel-Turner, presides over her realm where luck is literally visible, fate is gambleable, and probability itself is a game.

But the Wheel has been fixed. Someone is manipulating fate itself, ensuring certain outcomes while preventing others. The destined heroes never rise. The fated villains never fall. The cycle breaks. Fortuna, driven mad by the corruption, tasks the party with finding who's rigging the cosmic game. As they investigate, they discover that fate and free will aren't opposites—they're partners in a dance older than time. And the one fixing the Wheel believes they're saving reality by preventing chaos.

The party must navigate a realm where everything is random except when it isn't, where luck changes moment to moment, and where understanding the pattern beneath the chaos might be the greatest gamble of all.

### Core Themes

- **Rising and Falling**: Nothing stays up or down forever
- **Acceptance**: Embracing uncertainty and change
