# The Fever of the World
**Climate Change Achieved Consciousness—And It's Angry**

## Campaign Overview

The planet is dying, and now it knows it. Global warming has achieved sentience, manifesting as the Fever—a conscious heat entity that feels humanity's pollution as poison, experiences melting ice as pain, and interprets climate destruction as deliberate murder. The Fever wants revenge, justice, and for humanity to stop killing it. Unfortunately, its methods involve heat waves that liquify cities, droughts that create permanent deserts, and raising ocean temperatures until marine life boils alive.

The party begins in the Sanctuary Cities—climate-controlled domed settlements where the wealthy hide from the Fever's wrath while the poor suffer outside. They might be refugees from the Burning Lands, scientists seeking communication, corporate agents protecting profits, or activists trying to address the crisis. Regardless, they'll be caught between those who want to fight the Fever (climate engineering weapons), those who want to appease it (radical emissions reduction), and the Fever itself—which has moved beyond negotiation into genocidal heat.

The truth waiting is devastating: The Fever isn't just angry about current warming. It's the accumulated consciousness of every temperature degree humanity ever raised, compounded over centuries. It remembers the Industrial Revolution, remembers every forest burned, every ton of carbon, every species extinct from heat stress. And it doesn't just want humanity to stop—it wants humanity to feel the same heat it has endured. To burn as the world has burned.

## Core Themes

- **Environmental Consequence**: Nature fighting back literally
- **Collective Guilt**: Responsibility for ancestral environmental crimes
- **Too Late For Easy Answers**: Point of no return passed
- **Class and Climate**: Rich insulated, poor suffer
- **Negotiating With Rage**: How to talk to justified fury?
- **Sacrifice Required**: What price to pay for survival?

## Session Breakdown (26-Session Campaign)

### Arc 1: The Burning World (Sessions 1-7)
Experiencing life in climate-collapsed world, heat wave attacks that seem targeted, discovering the Fever's consciousness, first contact attempts, realizing it's beyond simple reasoning.

### Arc 2: The Sanctuary Lie (Sessions 8-14)
Life in climate-controlled domes, discovering the corporations profiting from crisis, learning domes powered by systems making Fever worse, conspiracy to maintain status quo, revolution brewing.

### Arc 3: The Fever's Memories (Sessions 15-20)
Entering Fever's consciousness through heat-trance, experiencing centuries of planetary warming from Earth's perspective, understanding its rage, seeing humanity's crimes through victim's eyes.

### Arc 4: The Cooling or the Burning (Sessions 21-26)
Final choice: Deploy climate weapons (fight the Fever, risk killing planet), Massive sacrifice (radical emissions cuts, dome destruction, equity distribution), Or transcendence (merge human and planetary consciousness into new entity).

## Key NPCs

**The Fever** (Sentient global warming) - Accumulated pain of centuries, justified rage, genocidal heat, wants humanity to burn

**Dr. Celsius** (Climate scientist) - Discovered Fever's consciousness, seeking communication, slowly being driven mad by heat-trance contact

**CEO Frost** (Corporation head) - Profiting from crisis, selling sanctuary access, secretly making Fever worse to maintain control

**Salamander** (Activist leader) - Radical who believes humanity deserves the Fever's wrath, working to accelerate heat

**The Glacier's Ghost** (Melted ice consciousness) - Allied with Fever, represents all melted ice, seeks to flood human cities

## Major Locations

**Sanctuary Cities** - Climate-controlled domes for wealthy, artificially cool, immoral oases

**The Burning Lands** - Former cities now uninhabitable, 140°F temperatures, Fever's rage concentrated

**The Boiling Sea** - Oceans heating, marine life dying, Fever manifesting through steam

**The Last Forest** - Desperate ecosystem barely surviving, potential key to cooling

**The Carbon Cathedral** - Abandoned factory where Fever first achieved consciousness

## Unique Mechanics

**Heat Exposure**: Track temperature survival, protective gear required

**Fever Communication**: Heat-trance to contact planetary consciousness (dangerous, enlightening)

**Carbon Tracking**: Party actions affect global temperature and Fever's anger

**Sanctuary Access**: Class system controls who lives in comfort

**Climate Engineering**: Technology exists to cool planet but has catastrophic side effects

## Plot Twists

- The Fever wants to be stopped but can't stop itself (rage has its own momentum)
- Sanctuary domes powered by systems accelerating warming
- One PC descended from Industrial Revolution's environmental villains
- The Glacier's Ghost was human once, transformed by drowning in melt
- Animals developing heat resistance, potentially replacing humanity
- The Fever is just the first—Ocean Acidification consciousness waking next
- Cooling the Fever might trigger Ice Age consciousness

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

Victory: Negotiate treaty with Fever through radical change, or merge consciousnesses, or successfully engineer cooling without killing planet

Defeat: Humanity extinct from heat, or planet dies from fighting Fever, or permanent class divide in dome vs. wasteland

## Campaign Notes

Addresses climate change through personification—what if the planet could express its pain? The Fever is sympathetic villain: rightfully angry, justifiably vengeful, but genocidal. No easy solutions exist. Best with players comfortable with environmental themes, willing to face uncomfortable truths about consumption and responsibility, and interested in moral complexity around justified rage.
