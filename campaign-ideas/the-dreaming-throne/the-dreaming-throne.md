**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **15–17**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Dreamweaver, one of the Endless Siblings who embody fundamental concepts of existence, has been captured and imprisoned for a century. In their absence, the Dreaming—the realm where all stories, myths, and dreams exist—has begun to collapse into nightmare. The party must navigate the surreal landscape of the Dreaming, encountering mythological figures, living stories, and impossible architecture as they seek to restore the realm and free its sovereign before reality and dream become fatally entangled.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Narrative Complexity:** The campaign features nested stories, unreliable narrators, and symbolic rather than straightforward challenges. Players must think creatively and narratively.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** There are no clear villains—even antagonists have sympathetic motivations. The Dreamweaver himself is not always benevolent.
*   **Reality-Bending:** Combat and challenges often operate on dream logic rather than physics. Solutions require lateral thinking.
*   **Character-Driven:** Each player's character will have their dreams and nightmares literalized, forcing them to confront personal themes.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions)

An epic journey through the architecture of stories themselves, structured like a collection of interconnected tales.

*   **Act I — The Sleepless World (Sessions 1–5):** The party discovers that sleep has become dangerous—people fall into comas, never wake, or wake screaming. They learn of the Dreamweaver's imprisonment and must find a way to enter the Dreaming realm.
*   **Act II — The Shattered Realm (Sessions 6–12):** Inside the Dreaming, the party must restore three broken kingdoms of stories—the Library of Unwritten Tales, the Gallery of Nightmares, and the Theater of Fables. Each holds a key to freeing the Dreamweaver.
*   **Act III — The Endless Game (Sessions 13–17):** The party confronts the captor—one of the Dreamweaver's own siblings, jealous and cruel. They must play the oldest game in existence for the Dreamweaver's freedom.
*   **Act IV — The Wake (Sessions 18–20):** With the Dreamweaver freed but fundamentally changed by imprisonment, the party must help restore the Dreaming while dealing with the consequences of a century of chaos.

### Session 3 — "The Gateway of Sleep"

*   **Focus:** Ritual / Transition
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Ritual: To enter the Dreaming while still alive, the party must undergo an ancient ritual involving symbolic deaths.
    *   Sacrifice: Each party member must give up something meaningful—a memory, a relationship, a dream—to pass through.
    *   The Crossing: They fall asleep and wake in the Dreaming, which appears as an impossible city of stories.

**Escalation:** The ritual goes partially wrong—one party member is split between waking and dreaming, existing in both realms.

### Session 4 — "The Shifting Streets"

*   **Focus:** Exploration / Surrealism
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Architecture: The party explores the Dreaming—streets that shift like sand, buildings that are alive, doors that open to other stories.
    *   The Residents: They meet dream-beings: characters from stories who have become real, embodied metaphors, and the dreams of sleeping mortals.
    *   The Nightmare Court: They learn the realm is now ruled by the Nightmare Court, led by the Corinthian—a nightmare given independence.

**Escalation:** They're arrested for being "waking dreamers" and brought before the Nightmare Court for judgment.

### Session 5 — "The Corinthian's Offer"

*   **Focus:** Social / Moral Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Nightmare: The Corinthian is a sophisticated horror, a nightmare who has become more than his purpose.
    *   The Proposal: He doesn't want to rule but had no choice when the Dreamweaver vanished. He offers to help them—if they help him escape his nature.
    *   The Keys: To free the Dreamweaver, they must restore three destroyed parts of the realm and retrieve three keys.

**Escalation:** The Corinthian warns that the Dreamweaver's sibling Despair is behind the imprisonment and won't let them succeed easily.

### Session 6 — "The Library of Unwritten Tales"

*   **Focus:** Mystery / Literary Adventure
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Infinite Stacks: They enter the Library where all unwritten stories exist as potential—books that were never finished, stories never told.
    *   The Caretaker: Lucien, the Dreamweaver's loyal librarian, has been desperately trying to maintain the Library alone.
    *   The Chaos: Stories are escaping their books, characters are rewriting themselves, genres are bleeding together.

    *   Inside the Story: The party becomes characters in an unfinished romance-tragedy set in a city under siege.
    *   The Author's Block: They discover the story stopped mid-sentence when the author died, leaving the characters in perpetual suffering.
    *   The Ending: They must improvise an ending that satisfies the story's needs, not their own desires.

### Session 8 — "The Gallery of Nightmares"

*   **Focus:** Horror / Psychological
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Dark Museum: They enter a gallery where all nightmares are preserved as art—paintings that move, sculptures that breathe, rooms that trap you in your fears.
    *   The Curator: They meet the Curator of Nightmares, who reveals that nightmares serve a purpose—they teach, warn, and help mortals confront fears.
    *   The Infection: A section of nightmares has gone "rabid," becoming pure terror without purpose, spreading like disease.

**Escalation:** Each party member must confront a painting that depicts their personal nightmare made manifest.

*   **Focus:** Character Development / Boss Fights
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Personal Hells: Each character faces their own nightmare in personalized encounters.
    *   The Revelations: Defeating these nightmares requires accepting or understanding their fears, not just fighting.
    *   The Second Key: Restoring balance to the Gallery yields the second key to the Dreamweaver's prison.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Eternal Stage: They arrive at a grand theater where mythological tales are performed for audiences of dreams.
    *   The Actors: Gods, heroes, and monsters from every mythology play their roles eternally—but the performances have become twisted.
    *   The Director: A character called the Puck-like Trickster has taken over, making tragedies into comedies and epics into farces.

**Escalation:** To set things right, the party must perform in a play before an audience of the Endless themselves.

### Session 11 — "A Midsummer Night's Nightmare"

*   **Focus:** Social / Performance
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Audition: Each party member is cast in a mythological role that reflects their character arc.
    *   The Performance: They must perform the tale correctly while the Trickster sabotages them and the audience judges harshly.
    *   The Reward: Successfully completing the performance earns respect from mythological figures and the third key.

**Escalation:** During the performance, one of the Endless in the audience—Destiny—reveals a prophecy about the party's fate.

### Session 12 — "The Fortress of Solitude"

*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Puzzle

    *   The Prison: With all three keys, they can access the fortress where the Dreamweaver is imprisoned—located in the heart of a dying star in the Dreaming.
    *   The Defenses: The fortress is protected by riddles, impossible architecture, and guardians made of solidified despair.
    *   The Final Lock: The last barrier requires each party member to answer a question about their deepest desire.

**Escalation:** They discover the Dreamweaver is imprisoned in their own realm—trapped by dream logic and self-doubt.

### Session 13 — "The Oldest Game"

*   **Focus:** Contest / Social Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Wager: To free the Dreamweaver, they must challenge Despair (the sibling who orchestrated this) to the oldest game—a battle of symbols and meanings.
    *   The Rules: Two players name increasingly powerful concepts, each countering the last, until one can't respond.
    *   The Stakes: If they lose, they remain in the Dreaming forever. If they win, the Dreamweaver is freed.

**Escalation:** Despair is a master of the game and knows every concept in existence.

### Session 14 — "The Game Continues"

*   **Focus:** Creative Challenge / Climax
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Match: The party takes turns playing the game, with each member contributing concepts based on their experiences.
    *   The Twist: Despair reveals she didn't imprison the Dreamweaver out of malice—she did it because the Dreamweaver was changing, becoming too detached from mortals.
    *   The Victory: The party wins by using concepts Despair doesn't understand—hope, friendship, the specific rather than the universal.

**Escalation:** Despair accepts defeat but warns that the Dreamweaver they free will not be the same one who was imprisoned.

### Session 15 — "The Changed Sovereign"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Character Study
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Awakening: They free the Dreamweaver, who has been fundamentally changed by a century of imprisonment and isolation.
    *   The Stranger: The Dreamweaver is cold, distant, and angry—no longer the detached but benevolent force they once were.
    *   The Task: The Dreamweaver demands the party help them reclaim the Dreaming from those who tried to rule in their absence.

**Escalation:** The Dreamweaver's first act is to brutally punish the Corinthian for daring to rule, despite his service to the realm.

### Session 16 — "The Reckoning"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Purge: The Dreamweaver begins reshaping the Dreaming, unmaking those who changed during their absence.
    *   The Resistance: Characters the party befriended—Lucien, the Corinthian, residents of the Dreaming—beg them to stop the Dreamweaver.
    *   The Choice: The party must decide whether to support the Dreamweaver's restoration or protect their friends in the Dreaming.

**Escalation:** The Dreamweaver offers the party anything they desire if they remain loyal—including making their personal dreams reality.

### Session 17 — "The Dream of a Thousand Cats"

*   **Focus:** Philosophical / Surreal
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Parable: A strange interlude where the party witnesses a gathering of dreaming cats who discuss changing reality through collective belief.
    *   The Lesson: They realize the Dreaming exists because mortals dream it—and mortals can change it if enough believe.
    *   The Plan: They conceive a radical idea: convince enough mortals to dream of a better Dreaming, forcing even the Dreamweaver to change.

**Escalation:** The Dreamweaver becomes aware of their plan and confronts them directly.

### Session 18 — "The Kindly Ones"

*   **Focus:** Consequences / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Furies: The party's interference has violated the rules of the Endless, summoning the Kindly Ones—ancient forces of vengeance.
    *   The Hunt: The Kindly Ones pursue anyone who has upset the cosmic order, including the party.
    *   The Sacrifice: To appease them, someone must pay the price—either the Dreamweaver accepts responsibility for changing, or the party faces punishment.

**Escalation:** The Dreamweaver, remembering their purpose, chooses to face the consequences rather than let the party suffer.

### Session 19 — "The Wake Begins"

*   **Focus:** Transformation / Bittersweet Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Price: The Dreamweaver cannot continue as they were—they must transform, essentially dying and being reborn.
    *   The Transition: The party witnesses the end of the old Dreamweaver and helps guide the birth of the new one.
    *   The New Dream: The new Dreamweaver is more connected to mortals, shaped partly by the party's influence.

    *   The Return: The party must choose whether to return to the waking world or remain in the Dreaming forever.
    *   The Gift: Each party member receives a gift from the Dreamweaver—a dream made real, a fear conquered, or a story given its ending.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Shifting City:** The heart of the Dreaming, where architecture follows dream logic and streets rearrange based on the thoughts of travelers.
2.  **The Library of Unwritten Tales:** An infinite library containing every story never told, every book never finished.
3.  **The Gallery of Nightmares:** A dark museum where all fears are preserved as twisted art.
4.  **The Theater of Fables:** A grand performance hall where mythological tales play eternally.
5.  **The Fortress of Solitude:** The prison at the heart of a dying star where the Dreamweaver is held.

---

## Central Conflict

The campaign explores the relationship between stories and reality, between creators and creations, and the question of whether beings of immense power can change or are trapped by their nature. The Dreamweaver represents the tyranny of narrative control—as both creator and prisoner of the Dreaming. The party must navigate the question of whether freeing the Dreamweaver means restoring the old order or creating something new, and whether stories exist to serve their tellers or have lives of their own.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dream Logic**

*   In the Dreaming, challenges don't follow normal rules. A locked door might open if you believe it will, a monster might be defeated by making it laugh, and distances are measured in narrative importance rather than miles.

### 2. **Stories Within Stories**

*   Sessions often feature nested narratives where the party enters a story, which contains another story. Players must track multiple layers of reality.

### 3. **Symbolic Combat**

*   Instead of traditional combat, many encounters use symbolic challenges—the Oldest Game, performances, riddles, or battles of meaning rather than swords.

### 4. **Personal Dream Arcs**

*   Each character has a "Dream Quest"—a personal story thread drawn from their backstory that manifests literally in the Dreaming, providing character development through surreal encounters.

### 5. **The Endless Influence**

*   Actions in the campaign attract the attention of other Endless siblings (Destiny, Death, Destruction, Desire, Delirium, Despair), who may help or hinder based on inscrutable cosmic logic.

### 6. **Reality Ripples**

*   What happens in the Dreaming affects the waking world. Fixing a story in the Library might cause an author in the real world to suddenly finish their book; defeating a nightmare might cure someone's phobia.
