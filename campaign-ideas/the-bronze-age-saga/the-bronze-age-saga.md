# The Bronze Age Saga
**Tagline:** *Where heroes are forged in the flames of war, and the gods gamble with mortal fates*

## Campaign Overview

The greatest coalition of heroes the world has ever seen has assembled at the gates of Ilios, the unconquerable city. For ten years, the siege has dragged on, with champions falling on both sides while the gods above play their deadly games. The party arrives as a mercenary band hired by the Achaean coalition, but they quickly become entangled in the web of divine politics, prophesied dooms, and the clash between legendary warriors whose names will echo through eternity.

As the campaign progresses, the party must navigate the complex politics of warring city-states, earn glory in single combat and on the battlefield, and ultimately choose which side of history they will stand on. But the gods have their own plans, and mortal heroes are merely pieces on their game board. Will the party become legends sung of for millennia, or will they be crushed beneath the wheels of fate? The climax approaches: the Trojan Horse stands ready, the city's doom is sealed, and the party must decide whether to embrace destiny or forge their own path.

The campaign blends tactical mass combat, divine intervention, epic duels, and political intrigue. Players will interact with legendary figures like Achilles, Hector, Odysseus, and Helen, while facing the direct interference of gods like Athena, Ares, and Apollo. Every choice has cosmic consequences, and glory is earned through valor, cunning, and sacrifice.

## Key NPCs

**Achilles, the Lion of Phthia** - The greatest warrior alive, defined by rage and grief. Prideful yet capable of deep love. His presence dominates the battlefield, and his absence creates desperate situations. He respects strength and honesty.

**Odysseus, the Cunning** - Master strategist and trickster hero. He values cleverness over brute force and sees the party as useful allies. He offers mentorship but may be manipulating them for his own ends.

**Hector, Defender of Troy** - The noble enemy. A family man fighting for his city. He embodies honor and duty, creating sympathy for the Trojan cause. His inevitable death is a tragic turning point.

**Helen of Sparta/Troy** - The face that launched a thousand ships. She is weary of being a prize and seeks agency in her own story. She may secretly aid the party, having her own agenda.

**Agamemnon, King of Kings** - The arrogant supreme commander whose hubris creates problems. He is an antagonist to the party, seeing them as upstarts threatening his authority.

**Athena, the Gray-Eyed Goddess** - Patron of heroes and wisdom. She recruits the party as her agents, offering divine boons. She is calculating and expects absolute loyalty.

**Priam, King of Troy** - The tragic father-king who watches his sons die one by one. His grief humanizes the enemy and creates emotional complexity.

**Paris, the Prince** - Cowardly yet divinely favored. His theft of Helen started everything. The party may be tasked with assassinating him or protecting him, depending on their alliances.

**Ajax the Greater** - A tower of a man and second only to Achilles. He becomes the party's battlefield commander and bonds with them through shared combat.

**Cassandra, the Doomed Prophet** - She sees the future but is cursed never to be believed. She seeks the party's help to save her family, offering them true prophecies they must interpret.

## Major Locations

**The Achaean Camp** - A massive military settlement of tens of thousands, divided into faction territories. The party's home base features training grounds, the assembly hall where kings debate, beaches where ships are drawn up, and the marketplace where warriors gamble and trade.

**The Plains of Scamander** - The battlefield where armies clash and champions duel. Sacred grounds where the gods walk among mortals. Features the river that runs red with blood and the barrows of fallen heroes.

**The Walls of Troy** - Impregnable fortifications built by gods. Towers where archers rain death, gates that have never been breached, and the ramparts where Hector rallies his troops. The party will fight both to assault and defend these walls.

**The Temples** - Sacred spaces where gods can be contacted. Each deity has a temple in both camps, and these become quest hubs for divine missions.

**Mount Ida** - Where the gods gather to watch the war like spectators at games. The party may ascend this holy mountain for pivotal supernatural encounters.

**The Palace of Priam** - The heart of Troy, filled with treasure and tragedy. The party infiltrates it during the heist and battles through it during the final sack.

**The Cave of the Oracle** - A mystical location where prophecies can be sought. Answers come with cryptic warnings and terrible prices.

**The Tomb of Heroes** - An ancient necropolis where the party can commune with shades of past champions, learning secret techniques and forgotten lore.

## Unique Mechanics

**Kleos (Glory) System:** Players earn Glory points through heroic deeds, winning duels, composing boasts, and surviving impossible odds. Glory can be spent for divine boons, to inspire allies, or to challenge fate itself. Death with high Glory means you become legend; death with low Glory means you are forgotten.

**Divine Favor:** Each god offers boons but demands loyalty. Players track their standing with each Olympian. High favor grants miraculous powers; low favor brings divine punishment. Gods are jealous and may punish those who serve their enemies.

**Aristeia (Heroic Frenzy):** Once per battle, a character can enter aristeia, becoming a one-person army for a limited time. They fight with supernatural prowess but risk hubris consequences.

**Prophecy and Fate:** The DM provides prophecies that seem inevitable. Players can spend Glory to reinterpret prophecies or challenge fate, but this angers the gods. Some destinies cannot be avoided.

**Mass Combat:** Battles involve commanding warbands while heroes engage in duels. The party's actions in skirmishes affect the overall war effort, tracked through a strategic layer.

**Epic Duels:** One-on-one combat between champions uses special rules emphasizing drama, boasts, and divine intervention. Winning builds reputation; losing may mean death or humiliation.

**Divine Manifestation:** Gods physically appear at dramatic moments. They cannot be fought directly but can be persuaded, tricked, or appeased. Their presence reshapes reality.

**The Moirai (Fates):** Three times in the campaign, players can consult the Fates to learn possible futures. Each consultation costs something precious and shows branching destinies.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**The True Cause:** The war isn't really about Helen. The gods orchestrated it to cull the heroes of the age, who were growing too powerful and numerous. The party discovers this conspiracy.

**Betrayal of Prophecy:** A trusted NPC is revealed to be working against the party's prophesied role. They believe the party will cause even greater catastrophe if they succeed.

**Divine Parentage:** One party member discovers they are a demigod, child of a major Olympian. This brings both power and dangerous attention from jealous gods and heroes.

**The Thirteenth God:** Eris, goddess of discord, is manipulating events from the shadows. She wants to escalate the war into a conflict that will destroy both camps and all heroes.

**Achilles' Choice:** The party learns they can save Achilles from his fated death, but doing so will cause the Greeks to lose the war. They must choose between their friend and victory.

**Helen's Secret:** Helen reveals she has been building an escape plan to free herself from being treated as property. She asks the party to help her disappear, which would undermine the war's purpose.

**The Artifact:** The true treasure of Troy is an artifact from the Titanomachy that could challenge Zeus himself. Multiple gods scheme to claim it through mortal agents.

**Cyclical War:** The party learns this war is one iteration of an eternal cycle. Troy has fallen and risen countless times, and the same souls are reincarnated to fight again and again.

## Victory Conditions

**Standard Victory:** Help the Greeks win through the Trojan Horse stratagem. Return home laden with glory and treasure, though many are cursed with difficult journeys.

**Perfect Victory:** Win the war while minimizing atrocities, saving key innocents, and earning the respect of both sides. Forge a peace that satisfies even the gods.

**Divine Ascension:** Accumulate enough Glory and divine favor to be invited to Olympus as minor deities or honored heroes who dwell in the Elysian Fields.

**Heroic Sacrifice:** Choose to die gloriously in a final stand that turns the tide of battle. Become eternal legends whose names are remembered forever, with your souls becoming guardian spirits.

## Defeat Conditions

**Ignoble Death:** Die without Glory, becoming nameless shades in the Underworld, forgotten by history.

**Divine Punishment:** Anger too many gods and be cursed like Tantalus or Sisyphus, suffering eternal torment for hubris.

**Betrayal:** Switch sides too often or break sacred oaths, becoming pariahs hated by both camps and hunted by the Furies.

**Cosmic Failure:** Fail to prevent Eris's ultimate plan, causing a war between the gods themselves that devastates the mortal world. The Age of Heroes ends in apocalypse rather than glory.

**Lost to Fate:** Become so entangled in prophecy that you lose all free will, becoming puppets acting out predetermined roles without agency or meaning.
