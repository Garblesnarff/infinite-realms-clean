# Creative Brief: The Pale Watcher

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Urban Creepypasta Horror

Inspired by internet horror fiction and home invasion thrillers, blending familiar domestic spaces with inhuman intrusion. This style captures the violation of safe spaces and primal fear of the bedroom predator.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Violated Intimacy:** Show familiar, safe spaces made horrifying.
*   **Contrast Pale and Dark:** The Rake's pale form against darkness creates maximum unease.
*   **Focus on Body Horror:** The creature's wrong proportions and inhuman movement.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Bedroom horror, pale, watching, invasion, psychic terror, humanoid predator, crawling, violation.
*   **Feeling:** Your bedroom is no longer safe. The constant awareness of being watched from the shadows.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted domestic colors (beiges, soft blues, whites) invaded by the stark paleness of the creature and the darkness it emerges from.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a typical bedroom in soft blues and beiges. The normalcy is shattered by a pale, hairless figure crouched in the shadows. Its skin is an unnatural, corpse-like white that seems to glow faintly in the darkness."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Rake:** A humanoid creature with pale, hairless skin, emaciated frame, elongated limbs, large black eyes, wide mouth with sharp teeth, moves in disturbing ways (crawling, contorting), approximately 6 feet long when crawling.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pale, hairless humanoid creature crouched at the foot of a bed. Its skin is sickly white and appears almost translucent. The body is emaciated with ribs showing, but the muscles are clearly powerful. Its limbs are elongated and end in long fingers with blackened nails. The head is hairless with large, hollow black eyes and a too-wide mouth. It crouches like an animal, ready to spring. The overall effect is deeply unsettling—almost human, but fundamentally wrong."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Modern urban bedrooms, apartments, suburban homes—ordinary spaces made horrifying by the presence of the intruder.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A typical modern bedroom at night. Moonlight streams through the window, casting shadows. The bedroom door is closed. At the foot of the bed, barely visible in the shadows, crouches a pale figure with hollow black eyes, watching the sleeping occupant. The scene is quiet and still, but deeply wrong."

## Voice

A strained, whispered voice barely audible, as if the speaker is terrified of being heard. The pacing is irregular with terrified pauses. The emotion is overwhelming fear with exhaustion from chronic terror. Audio quality is poor, recorded on a phone in hushed secrecy. Role: A victim who survived an encounter, now too afraid to sleep, warning others.
