**Campaign Type / Genre:** Home Invasion Horror / Psychological Terror / Urban Legend
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6-10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **8–10**
**Tone (keywords):** bedroom horror, pale, watching, invasion, psychic terror, humanoid predator
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A wave of nighttime home invasions terrorizes the city, but nothing is ever stolen—victims simply wake to find a pale, hairless humanoid crouching at the foot of their bed, watching them with hollow eyes. Those who encounter it report the same whispered phrase: "Take me." The players investigate and discover the creature, known as the Rake, is a psychic predator that feeds on fear and sanity, choosing victims by appearing in their dreams first. The only way to stop it is to confront it in its lair beneath the city before it claims more victims—including the players themselves.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6-10 sessions)

A claustrophobic descent into urban horror and psychic predation.

*   **Act I — The Bedroom Watcher (Sessions 1–3):** The players investigate home invasions with no clear point of entry. Victims describe a pale, humanoid creature that appears in their bedrooms. The players experience their first dream-encounter with the Rake and become marked as targets.
*   **Act II — The Hunted (Sessions 4–6):** The Rake begins stalking the players in their homes and dreams. They must find patterns in its behavior, protect victims, and discover its origin—a psychic predator that emerged from the city's abandoned subway tunnels.
*   **Act III — Into the Dark (Sessions 7–10):** The party descends into the forgotten tunnels beneath the city to find the Rake's nest. In its lair, they face not just the creature but manifestations of their own fears before confronting it in a psychic and physical battle.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Rake** — *The Pale Watcher*
    *   **Role:** A psychic predator that appears as a pale, hairless humanoid with elongated limbs and hollow black eyes.
    *   **Personality:** Alien and malicious. It derives sustenance from fear and the psychological breaking of its victims.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Rake must "mark" victims in dreams before it can physically approach them. Victims who overcome their fear become unpalatable to it.

    *   **Personality:** Rational, scientific, increasingly unnerved as evidence mounts that the nightmares are real.

3.  **Sarah Mills** — *The Survivor*
    *   **Role:** A previous victim who survived a direct encounter and is now traumatized but helpful.
    *   **Personality:** Terrified, insomniac, but determined to help stop the creature.

    *   **Role:** A homicide detective convinced there's a rational explanation for the disappearances.
    *   **Personality:** Professional, by-the-book, struggles with the supernatural evidence.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of violation of safe spaces, the terror of the familiar made hostile, and facing one's fears. The central conflict is both external (stopping the Rake) and internal (overcoming the psychological trauma it inflicts).

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dream Marking**
*   Characters exposed to the Rake must make **Wisdom saving throws** or be marked in their dreams.
*   Marked characters experience nightmares featuring the Rake. Each nightmare grants it more power over them.
*   After 3 nightmares, the Rake can physically manifest near the character at any time.

### 2. **Terror Level**
*   Each character tracks a **Terror Level** from 0-10.
*   Terror increases from:
    *   Encountering the Rake (physically or in dreams)
    *   Finding evidence of its presence
    *   Witnessing it harm others
    *   Sleeping alone
*   At high Terror levels, characters suffer disadvantage on saves, may flee involuntarily, or experience waking hallucinations.
*   Terror can be reduced through safety measures, companionship, and facing fears successfully.

### 3. **Safe Spaces**
*   The Rake cannot easily enter spaces where people feel truly safe and are not alone.
*   Players can create safe houses by:
    *   Never sleeping alone
    *   Using wards or protective symbols (if they discover what works)
    *   Maintaining well-lit, open spaces
    *   Having weapons and preparation ready
*   However, Terror Level can override these protections as the victim's belief in safety erodes.

### 4. **Psychic Combat**
*   In its lair, the Rake can create manifestations of the players' fears.
*   Players must pass **Wisdom or Charisma saving throws** to resist these illusions.
*   Overcoming personal fears grants advantage on attacks against the Rake.
