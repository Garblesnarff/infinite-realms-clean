**The Pale Watcher**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A wave of nighttime home invasions terrorizes the city, but nothing is ever stolen—victims simply wake to find a pale, hairless humanoid crouching at the foot of their bed, watching them with hollow eyes. Those who encounter it report the same whispered phrase: "Take me." The players investigate and discover the creature, known as the Rake, is a psychic predator that feeds on fear and sanity, choosing victims by appearing in their dreams first. The only way to stop it is to confront it in its lair beneath the city before it claims more victims.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the urban legend of the Rake and its spread through internet horror communities.
    *   Write the history of the creature's emergence from the forgotten subway tunnels.
    *   Describe the nature of the Rake as a psychic predator that feeds on fear and sanity.
    *   Explain the dream-marking process and why the creature must enter bedrooms.
    *   Detail previous encounters and disappeared victims.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Victims** (Minor): Those who have encountered the Rake and survived, traumatized and terrified.
    *   **The Police** (Minor): Investigating the home invasions conventionally, skeptical of supernatural explanations.
    *   **Sleep Researchers** (Minor): Led by Dr. Chen, documenting shared nightmare phenomenon.
    *   **The Taken** (Hidden): People who disappeared after prolonged exposure to the Rake, possibly held in its nest.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Rake, Dr. Victor Chen, Sarah Mills, Officer James Park
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Traumatized Victim," "Skeptical Detective," "Missing Person," "Sleep Disorder Patient"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The City:** Modern urban environment where locked doors provide false security
*   **Victim Homes:** Ordinary apartments and houses that become scenes of terror
*   **The Forgotten Tunnels:** Abandoned subway passages and sewer systems
*   **The Nest:** The Rake's lair underground, filled with remains and psychic echoes

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** A player accumulates maximum Terror → **THEN:** The Rake can manifest near them at will, attacks become personal and relentless
*   **IF:** Players create safe houses successfully → **THEN:** The Rake escalates tactics, trying to break their sense of security
*   **IF:** Players destroy the Rake in its nest → **THEN:** All victims are freed from nightmares, missing persons can be rescued, city returns to normal
