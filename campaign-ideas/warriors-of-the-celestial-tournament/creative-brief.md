# Creative Brief: Warriors of the Celestial Tournament

## Art Style: Dynamic Martial Arts with Energy Effects (Dragon Ball Z-inspired)

Inspired by *Dragon Ball Z*'s iconic energy battles, dramatic transformations, muscular character designs, and cosmic scale conflicts visualized through power auras and beam struggles.

### Core Principles:

*   **Power Auras:** Visible colored energy surrounding characters during power-ups
*   **Transformation Sequences:** Dramatic physical changes with energy explosions
*   **Beam Struggles:** Two energy attacks colliding and pushing against each other
*   **Scale Escalation:** Battles that crater planets and shake dimensions

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Ki Auras:** Gold for base, white-gold for super, blue for god, silver-white for ultra
*   **Energy Attacks:** Character-specific colors (blue Kamehameha, purple Galick Gun, orange Death Ball)
*   **Alien Worlds:** Vibrant other-worldly colors—green sky, purple grass, three suns

**Character Design:**
*   **Martial Artists:** Gi uniforms (orange, blue, purple with kanji), weighted training clothes
*   **Aliens:** Diverse designs—some humanoid, others monstrous, color-coded by race
*   **Transformations:** Hair changes color and stands up, muscle mass increases, eyes change color
*   **Gods:** Egyptian-themed designs, elegant robes, divine symbols

**Energy Effects:**
*   **Charging Up:** Aura expanding with ground cracking, rocks floating, wind blowing
*   **Beams:** Massive energy waves with trailing spirals
*   **Explosions:** Planet-scale detonations visible from space
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior powers up to their ultimate form. Golden energy erupts around them in a pillar reaching the sky. The ground beneath them cracks and craters. Rocks and debris float upward. Their hair turns golden and spikes up. Lightning crackles through their aura. Their eyes turn teal. The sheer pressure creates shockwaves."

**Combat Visualization:**
*   **Speed:** Motion blur and after-images during high-speed combat
*   **Impact:** Shockwaves radiating from punches, environments destroyed
*   **Beam Clashes:** Two massive energy beams meeting, creating energy sphere at intersection point
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two warriors fire their signature beams—one blue spiraling wave, one purple straight beam. The attacks meet mid-air creating a massive sphere of swirling energy. Both warriors push harder, their auras intensifying. The ground beneath them disintegrates from the pressure. Energy radiates outward destroying the landscape."

## Voice

A battle-hungry voice full of excitement and determination, shouting technique names and power levels. Builds in intensity during power-ups. Theme of "always getting stronger" and "surpassing limits." Role: The voice of escalating power made manifest.
