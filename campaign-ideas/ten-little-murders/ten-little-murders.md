Ten strangers are invited to a remote island estate under various pretenses, only to discover their mysterious host is absent. A magical recording accuses each guest of causing deaths they escaped justice for.

## What "Extreme" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Permadeath:** Characters can and will die. Players may need backup characters.
*   **Perfect Information Denial:** Clues are subtle, contradictory, and easily missed.
*   **Paranoia Mechanics:** Party members may suspect each other. PvP possible.
*   **Time Pressure:** Murders occur on schedule regardless of player actions.
*   **No Easy Answers:** Red herrings everywhere. The solution is complex.
*   **Moral Complexity:** Every character (including PCs) has guilty secrets.
*   **Isolation:** No outside help. No escape. No resurrection magic works on the island.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–10 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Gathering (Session 1):** Ten guests arrive at Raven's Nest Island for various reasons (job offers, reunions, vacations, inheritances—all lies). Discover their host "U.N. Owen" is absent. During dinner, a magical recording accuses each guest of causing unpunished deaths. Storm magic traps them on island. First victim dies that night.

*   **Act II — The Pattern Emerges (Sessions 2–4):** Murders continue, each matching the next verse of the nursery rhyme displayed in every room. "Ten little ravens sitting in a line, one choked on a fishbone and then there were nine..." Victims die from poison, drowning, axe blow, etc.—matching the rhyme exactly. Party discovers they can't trust memories (modify memory spells), mechanical traps, and careful planning.

*   **Act III — Paranoia and Accusation (Sessions 5–7):** As numbers dwindle, accusations fly. Some deaths appear to be suicide. Others require accomplices. The party must determine: Is the killer one of them? Multiple killers? Or is someone faking their own death? Red herrings point to various suspects. Trust collapses.

*   **Act IV — The Final Truth (Sessions 8–10):** The solution: Judge Wargrave (or equivalent), one of the ten, orchestrated everything. He was dying and wanted to punish the guilty (all ten guests) while indulging his own sadistic creativity. He faked his own death midway through and committed the later murders. His ultimate plan: kill all nine, then commit suicide to complete the rhyme. The final survivor(s) must outwit him in his endgame.

## Key Locations (All on Raven's Nest Island)

1.  **The Manor House:** Gothic estate where guests stay, contains the nursery rhyme in every room.
2.  **The Dining Room:** Where the accusation recording plays. Ten raven figurines on the table—one disappears after each death.
3.  **The Bedrooms:** Each guest's private space—potential murder scenes.
4.  **The Kitchen/Pantry:** Poison stored here, scene of first murder.
5.  **The Cliffs:** Dramatic location for "suicide" staging.
6.  **The Beach:** No boats remain—sabotaged. Arrival point.
7.  **The Weather-Witch Tower:** Source of the storm magic trapping them.

## The Nursery Rhyme

*Ten little ravens sitting in a line,*
*One choked on a fishbone and then there were nine.*

*Nine little ravens sitting up late,*
*One overslept himself and then there were eight.*

*Eight little ravens traveling through Devon,*
*One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.*

*Seven little ravens chopping up sticks,*
*One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.*

*Six little ravens playing with a hive,*
*A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.*

*Five little ravens going in for law,*
*One got in Chancery and then there were four.*

*Four little ravens going out to sea,*
*A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.*

*Three little ravens walking in the zoo,*
*A big bear hugged one and then there were two.*

*Two little ravens sitting in the sun,*
*One got frizzled up and then there was one.*

*One little raven left all alone,*
*He went and hanged himself and then there were none.*

Each murder matches the verse. "Fishbone" = poisoning at dinner. "Overslept" = sedative overdose. "Chopping sticks" = axe to head. And so on.

## Central Conflict

Survival versus Truth. The party must simultaneously:
*   Stay alive (defend against murders)
*   Discover the killer's identity (investigation)
*   Maintain/destroy trust (social deduction)
*   Confront their own guilt (moral reckoning)

The central question: Can justice be served by a murderer? All ten guests escaped legal punishment for causing deaths. Wargrave appoints himself executioner. Is he a monster or an avenging angel? (Answer: both.)

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Death Clock**
*   Murders occur at specific narrative beats, not random times.
*   DM pre-determines death order (following the original novel or adapting).
*   Players can delay but not prevent deaths without identifying the killer.

### 2. **Guilty Secrets System**
*   Each PC has a hidden guilt. Player and DM create this in private.
*   When accused (or confessing), reveal backstory. This provides motive for suspicion.
*   Mechanic: Players make Deception checks to hide reactions when their crime is mentioned.

### 3. **Suspicion Tracker**
*   Each character tracks who they suspect and why.
*   Players can make Insight checks to read others' suspicions of them.
*   High mutual suspicion prevents cooperation, helping the killer.

### 4. **Isolation Rules**
*   No teleportation magic works (island is warded).
*   No resurrection magic functions (ancient curse).
*   No sending messages off island (storm interference).
*   Divination magic returns cryptic, misleading answers (Wargrave prepared).

### 5. **The Raven Figurines**
*   Ten porcelain ravens on dining table. One vanishes after each death.
*   They don't just vanish—they're physically taken by the killer.
*   Finding who has access to the dining room between deaths is a clue.

### 6. **Staged Suicides**
*   Some victims appear to have killed themselves (guilt-driven).
*   Investigation reveals subtle evidence of murder made to look like suicide.
*   Medicine checks, forensics, timeline analysis required.

### 7. **The Fake Death**
*   Wargrave fakes his own death around the 5th or 6th murder.
*   Appears shot in the head. Doctor examines, confirms death.
*   Actually: makeup, fake blood, and the "doctor" is threatened into lying.
*   This is the key twist—the "dead" person is the killer.

### 8. **Memory Modification**
*   Wargrave uses modify memory spells strategically.
*   Players may "remember" things that didn't happen.
*   Cross-referencing accounts reveals inconsistencies.

### 9. **The Final Confession**
*   If Wargrave completes his plan, he leaves a written confession explaining everything.
*   This is his magnum opus—the perfect unsolvable crime explained posthumously.
*   Players find it only if they survive or his plan fails.

2.  **Mrs. Rogers (Servant):** Overdose of sedative — "overslept"

7.  **Dr. Armstrong:** Drowned in ocean — "red herring" (he's a red herring suspect)
8.  **Mr. Blore:** Pushed off cliff/crushed by object — "big bear hugged"

## Campaign Themes

*   **Inevitable Doom:** Death is coming; the only question is the order.
*   **Guilt and Punishment:** Who has the right to judge? Is vigilante justice valid?
*   **Paranoia:** When everyone is guilty, everyone is suspicious.
*   **Isolation:** No help is coming. You're alone with a killer.
*   **The Perfect Crime:** Wargrave wants to commit unstoppable, flawless murder.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The victims are also perpetrators. The killer has a twisted point.

---

## Victory Conditions

The campaign "succeeds" when:
*   The party identifies Wargrave as the killer before the final death
*   They escape the island alive (minimum 1 survivor)
*   They understand the complete truth of what happened
*   Wargrave's plan is stopped (he's killed or captured before completing it)

Alternative ending: All die, but the truth is discovered in Wargrave's confession (pyrrhic victory).

---

## Failure States

*   All party members die (total TPK)
*   Killer escapes unknown
*   Party kills the wrong suspect, enabling Wargrave to finish
*   Survivors escape without understanding truth (hollow victory)

---

## DM Preparation Tips

*   Pre-plan every death in detail: method, timing, clues left, red herrings.
*   Create detailed timeline of where each NPC was during each murder.
*   Develop Wargrave as sympathetic initially—kind old judge, seemingly frail.
*   Plant clues to his guilt early but subtly (medical knowledge, access, no alibi).
*   Prepare for players to die—have backup character introduction methods ready.
*   Study locked room mysteries and fair play mystery writing.
*   Ensure each murder has logical explanation players can deduce.
*   Balance red herrings (suspicious behavior) with real clues.
*   Create Wargrave's final confession document—his masterwork explanation.
*   Be ready for players to solve it early (have Wargrave respond dynamically).
*   Track what each player knows versus what their character knows.
*   Use environmental storytelling: scratches, moved furniture, missing items.
*   Consider splitting party perspective: some might see killer, others distracted.

## The Final Revelation

Wargrave's Motivation:
*   He's dying (terminal illness—wants grand finale).
*   He has a lifelong secret urge to kill but also a strong justice complex.
*   He satisfied this by becoming a judge, sending guilty to death legally.
*   Now, as death approaches, he wants one perfect, artistic murder spree.
*   He chose victims who escaped justice—making him executioner and murderer simultaneously.
*   His final suicide completes the aesthetic perfection: all ten dead, including himself, matching the rhyme exactly.

This is a campaign where the villain's twisted logic is almost compelling—which makes it more horrifying.

## Safety Considerations

*   Permadeath campaign: ensure players consent to losing characters.
*   Paranoia can create table tension: establish boundaries for PvP.
*   Some players may not enjoy constant suspicion: Session Zero discussion crucial.
*   Have X-Card or safety tools for when tension becomes unfun.
*   Debrief after campaign: distinguish character paranoia from player relationships.
