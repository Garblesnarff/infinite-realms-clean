### **World-Building Specification Brief: Ten Little Murders**

**1. Core Concept:**
Ten strangers with guilty pasts are lured to an isolated island and murdered one by one according to a nursery rhyme by one of their own number—a dying judge orchestrating the perfect crime as both executioner and artist.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Raven's Nest Island—isolated, rocky, accessible only by boat, ancient reputation for tragedy
*   Explain the manor's history—built by a wealthy recluse, passed through various owners, each ending badly
*   Write about the legend of the island being cursed (actually Wargrave's purchased magical wards)
*   Describe the nursery rhyme's origin—old children's verse about death (many versions across cultures)
*   Detail each guest's backstory and unpunished crime thoroughly
*   Explain Judge Wargrave's career—famous for harsh sentences, "The Hanging Judge"
*   Write about Wargrave's illness—terminal condition giving him perhaps a year, motivating the "grand finale"
*   Describe his psychological profile—brilliant, sadistic, justice-obsessed, artistic about murder

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Guilty Guests** (Major) - Ten people who escaped justice for causing deaths, now being punished
*   **U.N. Owen (The Host)** (Major) - Mysterious entity that invited them (actually Wargrave's alias)
*   **The Dead (Victims)** (Minor) - The people each guest killed or allowed to die, haunting the narrative
*   **The Outside World** (Minor) - Unreachable, waiting to discover the massacre later

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1 (The Ten Guests):** Judge Wargrave, Vera Claythorne, Captain Lombard, Dr. Armstrong, General Macarthur, Emily Brent, Anthony Marston, Mr. Blore, Mr. & Mrs. Rogers
*   **Tier 2 (The Absent):** "U.N. Owen" (various identities used to lure guests), Fred Narracott (boatman who dropped them off)
*   **Tier 3 (The Dead/Mentioned):** Each guest's victim from their past crime

**5. Locations:**
*   **Raven's Nest Island** - Rocky, isolated, storm-wracked, no escape
*   **The Manor House** - Gothic Revival, Art Deco interior, every room has nursery rhyme copy
*   **The Dining Room** - Long table, ten chairs, ten raven figurines (disappearing one by one)
*   **The Guest Bedrooms** - Ten rooms, each becoming potential murder scene
*   **The Kitchen/Pantry** - Where poison and food are stored, servant domain
*   **The Drawing Room** - Where the accusation recording plays, social gathering space
*   **The Cliffs** - Dramatic exterior location, site of "suicide" staging
*   **The Beach** - Where they arrived, where destroyed boats are found
*   **The Weather-Witch Tower** - Hidden location maintaining magical storm
*   **The Secret Chamber** - Behind moving bookcase, where Wargrave hides after faking death

**6. Causality:**
*   IF guests try to leave island THEN discover boats destroyed, magical storm prevents swimming
*   IF guests search house thoroughly THEN find weather-witch tower maintaining storm
*   IF guests hear accusation recording THEN each must confront their guilty past
*   IF guests try to work together THEN paranoia and suspicion undermine cooperation
*   IF a guest dies THEN corresponding raven figurine vanishes from dining table
*   IF guests investigate deaths carefully THEN discover patterns matching nursery rhyme
*   IF Dr. Armstrong is threatened THEN he helps Wargrave fake death (forced accomplice)
*   IF Wargrave's "body" is examined closely THEN might detect fake blood/makeup (difficult check)
*   IF guests destroy all weapons/poisons THEN Wargrave adapts (environmental kills, pushing, etc.)
*   IF party accuses wrong person THEN Wargrave allows them to kill innocent, adding guilt
*   IF party identifies Wargrave before his planned suicide THEN final confrontation where he tries to complete his masterpiece
*   IF all guests die per plan THEN Wargrave's confession is found by next visitors to island
*   IF Wargrave is caught THEN he admits everything proudly, sees it as his greatest achievement
*   IF any guest survives THEN they're haunted forever by the experience and their own guilt
