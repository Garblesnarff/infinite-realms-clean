# Creative Brief: Ten Little Murders

## Art Style: Gothic Isolation Horror (Classic Christie Mystery)

Inspired by Agatha Christie and classic locked room mysteries—isolated island Gothic architecture, Art Deco 1930s elegance, storm-wracked isolation, theatrical death scenes, psychological horror through suggestion rather than gore.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Muted, storm-darkened colors—grays, deep blues, blacks, with occasional stark reds (blood, ravens). Lightning flashes create dramatic shadows. Candlelight and firelight provide warm spots in cold spaces. The storm outside is always present—rain-streaked windows, wind howling.

**Character Design:** 1930s period fashion—guests in formal dinner wear (suits, evening gowns), servants in livery. Each character visually distinct and representing their archetype (military bearing, religious severity, adventurer's weathered look, etc.). Wargrave appears elderly, distinguished, with penetrating eyes. Raven motifs subtly incorporated into decor and design.

**Environments:**
- The Manor: Gothic Revival architecture, Art Deco interior design, elegant but isolated
- Dining Room: Long table with ten chairs, the raven figurines as centerpiece, nursery rhyme framed on wall
- Bedrooms: Each reflects guest's personality, becomes crime scene
- The Storm: Constant presence—wind, rain, thunder, lightning creating dramatic lighting
- The Island: Rocky cliffs, crashing waves, no escape visible

**Death Scenes:** Theatrical rather than gratuitous—bodies positioned to match nursery rhyme, almost artistic in their horror. The emphasis is on the cleverness and inevitability rather than gore.

## Voice

**Narrator Voice (DM):** Precise, British, in the style of classic mystery narration. Measured, observant, matter-of-fact about horror. Think the opening of classic BBC mystery adaptations. States terrible things in calm, analytical tones, which makes them more disturbing.

**Wargrave's Voice:** Elderly, cultured, with judge's authority and precision. Speaks in complete sentences, uses legal terminology casually. Sounds reasonable even when saying unreasonable things. In his final confession (if found), becomes almost poetic about his "masterpiece."

**General Atmosphere:** The voice of a ticking clock. The voice of inevitability. Suspenseful silence broken by thunder. Whispered accusations. Nervous laughter dying away.

## Music Style

Classic thriller orchestra in the style of Bernard Herrmann—strings creating sustained tension, sudden stabs for murder moments, ticking clock rhythms underneath scenes. Each character could have a subtle musical motif that plays during their scenes (military drums for General, religious hymn fragments for Emily, etc.). The nursery rhyme tune plays in various arrangements—innocent music box version, distorted horror version, final grand orchestral tragedy. Storm sounds are integrated into the score—thunder as percussion, wind as atmospheric drones. Moments of silence are crucial—the absence of music before a murder. As guests die, their motifs disappear from the score, creating increasing emptiness. Wargrave's theme is a judge's gavel—rhythmic, authoritative, inevitable—hidden in other themes throughout until the revelation.
