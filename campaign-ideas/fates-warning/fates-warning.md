## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Fate's Warning
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Divination Magic / Political Intrigue
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **11-13**
**Tone (keywords):** diviner mage, London magical politics, probability manipulation, dark mage past, no good choices
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In modern London, the party includes a diviner—a mage who sees probability paths and future outcomes—who runs a magic shop while avoiding the attention of both the Light Council (organized mages) and Dark mages seeking power. With the ability to see seconds to minutes ahead and navigate probability threads, they're drawn into conflicts between Light mages (who claim morality), Dark mages (who embrace power), and independents caught between. As they face impossible choices where every option leads to tragedy, they must navigate Council politics, avoid their former Dark master Richard Drakh who seeks to reclaim them, and prevent various apocalyptic scenarios while questioning whether the Light Council is truly better than the Dark. In this world, seeing the future doesn't mean you can change it, and sometimes all paths lead to pain.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of impossible choices, political manipulation, and questioning morality.

*   **Act I — Independent Survival (Sessions 1-6):** The party establishes their position as independent mages avoiding both Council and Dark affiliations. They investigate magical crimes, navigate London's hidden magical community, and try to stay neutral in Light-Dark conflicts. They're introduced to Council politics (Light mages claiming moral authority), Dark mages (pursuing power without Council restrictions), and adepts (non-combat magic users). The diviner's past with Dark mage Richard Drakh surfaces, and former apprentice-siblings begin appearing with their master's plans. They discover artifact hunts where all factions compete.
*   **Act II — Council Politics (Sessions 7-13):** The party is forced into Council attention when they cannot avoid major conflicts. They witness Council corruption—Light mages who use their authority for personal gain, unjust trials, and political maneuvering as bad as any Dark mage. Meanwhile, Richard Drakh's plans accelerate, using his former apprentices as pawns. They face impossible moral choices: break Council law to save innocents, cooperate with Dark mages for mutual benefit, or watch people die following Light rules. Luna (chance mage), Anne (life mage), and other allies complicate moral questions. Relationships are tested by conflicting loyalties.
*   **Act III — No Good Choices (Sessions 14-20):** Richard Drakh's endgame is revealed—he seeks a power that would make him untouchable, requiring all his former apprentices including the party diviner. The Council and Dark mages maneuver for advantage while ignoring larger threats. The party must navigate civil war within Light Council, Richard's machinations, and their own moral compromises. Final confrontations involve facing Richard directly, choosing between Light and Dark allegiances (or remaining independent at great cost), and accepting that some futures cannot be prevented—only survived. Some endings involve joining Council (and its corruption), others embracing necessary darkness, others remaining independent but isolated. The diviner learns that seeing all paths doesn't mean finding a good one.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of moral ambiguity, whether ends justify means, corruption of authority, and accepting that some tragedies cannot be prevented. It asks: Is organized "good" better than independent "evil"? Can you see disaster coming and be unable to stop it? What compromises are acceptable? The central conflict pits the party's desire to do right against a world where all choices lead to bad outcomes, forcing them to choose which evil they can live with.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Divination Magic**
*   See probability paths seconds to minutes ahead
*   Navigate through most likely futures
*   Cannot prevent all bad outcomes—only choose which to avoid
*   Overuse causes mental strain and temporal disorientation

### 2. **Probability Manipulation**
*   Some mages affect chance and likelihood
*   Combat becomes predicting opponent's moves
*   Can "see" attacks coming and avoid them
*   Futures constantly shift based on actions

### 3. **Light vs Dark Alignment**
*   Light Council claims moral authority but is often corrupt
*   Dark mages pursue power without Council restrictions
*   Independents caught between both sides
*   No clear "good" side—all have virtues and flaws

### 4. **Magical Specializations**
*   Diviners see futures, elementalists control forces, life mages heal/harm
*   Each type has strengths and weaknesses
*   Some magic types are feared by Council
*   Power level matters as much as type

### 5. **The Sight (Diviner's Perception)**
*   Constantly aware of immediate future paths
*   See how actions lead to outcomes
*   Combat time-sense—react before attacks land
*   Can be overwhelmed by too many possibilities

### 6. **Council Politics**
*   Light Council governs most mages
*   Politics as dangerous as Dark magic
*   Trials are often political theater
*   Laws serve those in power

### 7. **Fateweaving**
*   Advanced divination affecting probability directly
*   Can nudge futures toward preferred outcomes
*   Extremely rare ability
*   Using it draws dangerous attention

### 8. **Elsewhere Sanctums**
*   Pocket dimensions created by powerful mages
*   Safe from scrying and attack
*   Each reflects creator's nature
*   Can be prison or refuge
