### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Ancient Ones' Entertainment**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party is lured to a remote cabin as part of a global sacrificial system designed to appease slumbering cosmic entities called the Ancient Ones. A secret organization manipulates events from an underground facility, forcing the party into horror movie archetypes and orchestrating monster attacks that must follow a specific ritual pattern. The party must survive while discovering the truth and choosing whether to complete the ritual (sacrificing themselves to save the world), rebel (risking apocalypse), or embrace chaos (waking the Ancient Ones and ending everything).

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Ancient Ones: cosmic entities older than worlds who sleep beneath the earth, demanding ritualistic entertainment and suffering to remain dormant.
    *   Chronicle the global organization: facilities on every continent perform synchronized rituals annually, each using different cultural horror traditions (American slashers, Japanese ghosts, European vampires, etc.).
    *   Explain the ritual requirements: five archetypes must be present (Virgin, Athlete, Scholar, Fool, Whore) and must die in specific order for the ritual to succeed.
    *   Describe the facility's technology: mind-altering pheromones, environment controls, monster containment systems, surveillance networks.
    *   Detail the monster catalogue: hundreds of creatures from every horror tradition, kept in controlled environments, released according to ritual scripts.
    *   Chronicle past rituals: some succeeded, saving the world. Some failed partially, causing localized disasters. None have fully failed—until potentially now.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Sacrificial Five (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Initially, have a fun vacation/adventure. Then: survive. Finally: decide the fate of the world.
        *   **Hierarchy:** None. Equals until forced into archetypal roles.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Enjoy the cabin, explore, survive the horror.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each character has traits matching an archetype, making them targets for manipulation.
        *   **Assets:** Whatever gear they brought, weapons found in cabin, their wits, potential trope awareness.
        *   **Relationships:** Start as friends/allies; tested by manipulation; must decide if some should sacrifice for others.
    *   **The Organization** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Complete the ritual successfully to keep the Ancient Ones sleeping for another year.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The Director leads this facility; above him is a global council overseeing all sites; below are technicians, security, and support staff.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They're completely secret.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Manipulate the sacrifices into dying in the correct order through pheromones, monster deployment, and environmental control.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced technology, monster arsenal, complete facility control, global resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Control the party's environment; neutral toward monsters (they're tools); desperate to prevent apocalypse.
    *   **The Monsters** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Vary by type. Some want to kill. Others want to escape. Some are mindless.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No unified structure. Each monster type has its own behavior patterns.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They're imprisoned.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Survival, feeding, or following instinct depending on type.
        *   **Assets:** Diverse abilities based on horror archetype—zombies swarm, vampires are intelligent, werewolves are savage, etc.
        *   **Relationships:** Controlled by the organization; hostile to humans; may fight each other if released simultaneously.
    *   **The Ancient Ones** (Major - Cosmic)
        *   **Goals:** Be entertained and appeased through ritualized suffering, or wake and destroy everything.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Multiple entities of incomprehensible power, possibly including Great Old Ones from other campaigns.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They sleep.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They are utterly indifferent to humanity except as sources of entertainment/suffering. If not appeased, they'll wake and end the world casually.
        *   **Assets:** Cosmic power, immortality, incomprehensibility, the ability to end all life.
        *   **Relationships:** Humanity exists only to entertain them; the organization exists to maintain this arrangement; everything is insignificant to them.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Director:** Facility leader, pragmatic and tired, has orchestrated countless sacrifices.
    *   **Sitterson & Hadley:** Lead technicians, make bets on the sacrifices, represent banal evil.
    *   **Dana (if NPC):** Represents the Virgin archetype, moral center, must survive or die last.
    *   **Marty (if NPC):** The Fool archetype, genre-savvy, sees through manipulation.
    *   **The Ancient Ones:** Incomprehensible entities shown only partially—a hand the size of a mountain, an eye larger than the facility.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Zombie Horde" (classic shambling undead)
    *   "The Slasher" (masked killer with signature weapon)
    *   "Vampire Lord" (intelligent, aristocratic predator)
    *   "Werewolf" (savage, transformation horror)
    *   "Japanese Ghost" (pale, long hair, crawling horror)
    *   "Demonic Entity" (varied forms, possession, deals)
    *   "Alien Creature" (sci-fi horror, face-hugger style)
    *   "Facility Technician" (ordinary person doing extraordinary evil)
    *   "Security Guard" (tactical gear, follows orders, escalating force)

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Cabin:** Traditional horror movie setting above ground.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Main room with fireplace, bedrooms (setting up couple separation), basement with artifacts, cellar door to underground.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The party initially, then whatever monsters are released.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Weapons (bear traps, axes), cursed artifacts that trigger events, supplies.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Finding the one-way mirror, discovering cameras, basement artifacts activating, first monster attack, mysterious voice on radio.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The artifacts in the basement summon specific monsters." "Every choice is being watched and manipulated." "The cellar leads deeper than it should."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Rustic wood, mounted heads, fireplace), Sound (Creaking, wind, distant howls), Smell (Pine, dust, blood after attacks).
    *   **The Underground Facility:** High-tech control center.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Control room with monitors, monster containment cells, staff quarters, emergency systems, the elevator to ritual chamber.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Technicians, security, the Director.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Advanced technology, weapons, monster controls, information.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Technicians betting on party deaths, security patrols, monster breakouts, system malfunctions, finding the ritual script.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "This happens every year, globally." "The Ancient Ones demand specific death orders." "There's a button that releases everything."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Sterile white, monitors everywhere, glass cells), Sound (Computer beeps, alarms, intercom), Smell (Recycled air, coffee, antiseptic).
    *   **Monster Containment:** Vast vault of horrors.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Hundreds of cells, each designed for specific creature types, control boards, release mechanisms.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Every type of horror monster imaginable.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** If controls are accessed, party can release monsters strategically or create chaos.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Seeing the catalog of options, witnessing a controlled release, system breach releasing all monsters, finding unusual creatures, discovering the "novelty" section.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Each culture contributes different monsters." "Some creatures are unique, others are mass-produced." "The purge system releases everything simultaneously."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Glass cells, diverse horrors, clinical organization), Sound (Varied monster sounds contained, alarm systems), Smell (Varies by cell—decay, brimstone, nothing).
    *   **The Ritual Chamber:** Deepest level where Ancient Ones sleep.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Massive stone altar, channels for blood, viewing platform, the Abyss where the entities dwell.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The Ancient Ones (sleeping), ritual overseers.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** The truth, the final choice, potential bargaining.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Viewing the Ancient Ones, they begin to stir, offering sacrifice, the Director's final plea, pushing the purge button.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "If the ritual fails, they wake immediately." "The Ancient Ones can be bargained with, theoretically." "Waking them ends everything, but breaks the cycle."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Ancient stone, impossible proportions, glimpses of entities too vast to comprehend), Sound (Heartbeat of sleeping gods, stone grinding), Smell (Age, stone dust, ozone of immense power).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party kills monsters in the "wrong" order or archetypes die out of sequence.
    *   **THEN:** The facility escalates intervention. The Director contacts them directly, explaining the stakes. Security is deployed. The Ancient Ones begin to stir.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers the facility and attempts to breach it.
    *   **THEN:** Generate combat encounters with security. The facility may release additional monsters to force the party back to the cabin, or lockdown protocols activate.
    *   **IF:** A party member reads the ritual script and understands their role.
    *   **THEN:** They can choose to accept or reject their archetype. Acceptance gives benefits but locks them into the role. Rejection triggers facility countermeasures.
    *   **IF:** The party manages to release all monsters simultaneously (the purge).
    *   **THEN:** Generate absolute chaos. The facility is overrun. Every monster fights for survival. This likely leads to ritual failure and the Ancient Ones waking.
    *   **IF:** The party completes the ritual correctly (archetypes die in order).
    *   **THEN:** The Ancient Ones are appeased. The world is saved. Survivors (if any) are released but sworn to secrecy or eliminated. The system continues.
    *   **IF:** The party wakes the Ancient Ones (ritual failure or deliberate choice).
    *   **THEN:** Generate the apocalypse. Massive entities emerge from beneath the earth. Reality breaks down. The campaign ends with the world ending, but the party chose truth over comfortable lies.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts a third option (destroying the Ancient Ones, imprisoning them forever, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** Generate an extremely difficult final encounter where the party must use monsters against the Ancient Ones or find impossible magical solutions. Success means breaking the cycle entirely.
