## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A rescue mission that becomes a fight against both monsters and corruption.

*   **Act I — The Attack (Sessions 1–2):** The family's ordinary day is shattered when the River Beast—a massive, deformed amphibian—emerges from the water and snatches Nessa. The government immediately quarantines the riverside, declaring the area contaminated. Officials claim Nessa is dead, but the family finds evidence she's alive—trapped in the sewers. They resolve to rescue her, defying government orders.
*   **Act II — The Quarantine (Sessions 3–4):** The family sneaks into the quarantined zone, navigating checkpoints and propaganda. They explore the sewers, discovering nests of smaller mutant creatures and evidence of the alchemical dumping that created the River Beast. They learn that Nessa is being held in a mucus cocoon, kept alive by the Beast (which seeks companionship, not food). They also discover that the Council plans to exterminate the creatures—and anyone trapped with them.
*   **Act III — The Rescue (Sessions 5–6):** The family confronts the River Beast in its lair beneath the city. They must free Nessa from the cocoon and escape before the government floods the sewers with poison gas. The Beast, intelligent but monstrous, fights to keep Nessa. The family must choose: kill the Beast (the easy way), or find a way to communicate with it and prove it's not mindless. The campaign ends with the family exposing the conspiracy, rescuing Nessa, and reconciling—or fracturing forever.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Riverside"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Attack
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The family runs a food stall by the river. They bicker: father Tomas is a drunk, mother Lyra nags, eldest son Kael is bitter, daughter Mira is rebellious, and youngest Nessa is innocent.
    *   During a rush of customers, the River Beast—a 20-foot, grotesque amphibian with too many eyes—erupts from the water. It grabs Nessa and drags her into the sewers.
    *   The family rushes after her, but government officials seal the area within minutes, declaring it a quarantine zone. They claim Nessa is dead.
**Escalation:** Kael finds Nessa's dropped pendant near a sewer grate. It's warm—she's alive.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Into the Zone"
*   **Focus:** Infiltration / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The family defies government orders and sneaks into the quarantine zone. Checkpoints, patrols, and propaganda posters declare the area "unsafe due to alchemical contamination."
    *   They descend into the sewers, encountering smaller mutant creatures (rat-sized to dog-sized) spawned by the same pollution that created the Beast.
    *   They find evidence: barrels of illegal alchemical waste dumped by Councilor Varn's factory, hidden for years. The River Beast is a victim, not a villain.
    *   They discover Nessa's trail—she's alive, being carried deeper into the sewers.
**Escalation:** They overhear guards: "The Council has authorized gas flooding of the sewer system. Anything down there dies tomorrow."

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Lair"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The family reaches the Beast's lair—a vast, flooded chamber filled with bioluminescent fungi and the remains of the Beast's victims (mostly animals, some unfortunate people).
    *   They find Nessa, encased in a mucus cocoon, unconscious but alive. The Beast guards her protectively.
    *   A party member realizes the truth: the Beast is intelligent and lonely. It's been collecting "companions" because it's the last of its kind. It doesn't understand that humans can't survive in mucus cocoons.
    *   The family must decide: fight the Beast and risk Nessa's life, or try to communicate (using *Speak with Animals*, magic, or clever roleplaying).
**Escalation:** Guards seal the sewer exits. The gas will flood the tunnels in 1 hour.

### Session 6 — "The Escape"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Rescue
*   **Key Events:**
    *   If the family fights the Beast, it's a desperate battle while extracting Nessa. The Beast fights defensively, not wanting to kill but refusing to let her go.
    *   If the family communicates, they can convince the Beast to release Nessa by promising to stop the gas and expose the truth.
    *   The escape is a race against time: carry unconscious Nessa through flooded tunnels, avoid gas vents, and fight/evade guards at the exit.
    *   The final scene: the family emerges with Nessa and evidence of the conspiracy. They can expose Councilor Varn (destroying him but making enemies) or accept a bribe to stay silent (saving the family business but betraying justice).
**Resolution:** Nessa survives, traumatized but alive. The family is changed—closer or more fractured. The River Beast's fate depends on their choices.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of family dysfunction, environmentalism, government corruption, and the tragedy of misunderstood monsters. The central conflict is rescuing Nessa, but the deeper conflict is whether the family can overcome their issues and whether they choose justice or survival.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Family Dynamics**
*   Each family member (PC or NPC) has a **Relationship Score** with others (scale 1-10). Starts at 5.
*   During stressful moments, family members must make Charisma checks to avoid arguments (DC 12).
*   If Relationship Scores drop to 3 or below, that relationship is fractured—mechanical penalties to teamwork.
*   If Relationship Scores rise to 8+, the family gains bonuses (advantage on Help actions, shared inspiration).
*   Key moments (saving each other, honest conversations, shared success) can change Relationship Scores.

### 2. **The Beast's Intentions**
*   The River Beast is not trying to kill—it's trying to "collect" companions.
*   When it attacks, it uses grapple attacks to drag victims away, not killing blows.
*   PCs can attempt to communicate using *Speak with Animals*, Insight checks to read its body language, or creative roleplaying.
*   If the party kills the Beast, Nessa will be heartbroken, lowering all Relationship Scores.

### 3. **Quarantine Infiltration**
*   The quarantine zone is patrolled. Stealth checks (DC 13) or disguises are needed to avoid guards.
*   If caught, the party is arrested or forcibly removed—losing time Nessa doesn't have.

### 4. **The Gas Countdown**
*   From Session 4 onward, track the **Gas Timer** (starts at 10 rounds = 1 hour).
*   Each 10 minutes of in-game time reduces the timer by 1.
*   When the timer reaches 0, poison gas floods the sewers. Anyone still inside must make Constitution saves (DC 15) each round or take 3d6 poison damage and gain exhaustion.
