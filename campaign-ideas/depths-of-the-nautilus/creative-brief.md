# Creative Brief: Depths of the Nautilus

## Art Style: Victorian Scientific Romance (Jules Verne Era Illustration)

Detailed technical cross-sections of the Nautilus, romantic underwater vistas, period-accurate Victorian design mixed with fantastical technology.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Deep ocean blues and greens, bioluminescent glows, brass and polished wood of the Nautilus interior, the occasional brilliant color of exotic sea life.

**Character Design:** Victorian era clothing—Captain Nemo in elegant but practical attire, diving suits with brass helmets, the crew in naval uniforms.

**Environments:** The Nautilus's luxurious Victorian interior contrasts with alien underwater landscapes—coral forests, abyssal trenches, sunken civilizations, polar ice caverns.

## Voice

A cultured, haunted voice with a slight accent (Indian/Middle Eastern), speaking with the passion of a visionary and the bitterness of someone who has lost everything. The voice of an exile who has found freedom in the depths but can never find peace.

## Music Style

Orchestral with theremin and glass harmonica for underwater eeriness. Strings represent the ocean's depth and mystery. Brass for the submarine's power. Use musical motifs from Romantic era composers (Berlioz, Debussy's La Mer) blended with sci-fi undertones. Moments of sublime beauty (solo cello) contrast with tension (low brass, timpani). The Nautilus has its own leitmotif—powerful, mysterious, slightly ominous.
