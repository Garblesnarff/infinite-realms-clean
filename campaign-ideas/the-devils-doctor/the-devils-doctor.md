*A Criminal Mastermind / Mystery Thriller campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Devil's Doctor
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Criminal Mastermind / Mystery Thriller / Pulp Intrigue
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** criminal genius, elaborate death traps, secret societies, world domination plots, intellectual nemesis, mysterious Orient, "the world shall hear from me again," scientific villainy
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party investigates a string of impossible crimes—scientists vanishing, politicians dying in bizarre accidents, ancient secrets stolen—all connected to a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind known only as "The Doctor." This genius commands secret societies, employs esoteric science, and orchestrates global conspiracies from hidden lairs filled with death traps. They must unravel elaborate schemes, survive deadly encounters, and match wits with a villain whose intellect rivals their own—all while questioning whether this archvillain might have legitimate grievances about colonialism and exploitation.

**Note on Respectful Adaptation:** This campaign reimagines the problematic "Yellow Peril" villain archetype as a complex character motivated by anti-colonialism and genuine grievances, while maintaining the pulp adventure elements. The character's cultural background is portrayed with respect and depth, not caricature.

## Central Conflict

Justice versus revenge, progress versus tradition, East versus West. The Doctor is a villain—he kills innocents and seeks power—but his opposition to colonial exploitation is legitimate. The party must stop his methods while potentially recognizing the validity of some grievances. Is it possible to fight imperialism without becoming a monster? Can the party serve justice while acknowledging the sins of their own society? The Doctor represents both victim of colonialism and perpetrator of atrocities—morally complex.
