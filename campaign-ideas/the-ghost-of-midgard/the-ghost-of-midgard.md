## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A deeply personal three-act arc of a father teaching his son while confronting his past.

*   **Act I — The Journey Begins (Sessions 1-6):** The warrior and his son begin their journey to the mountain. They meet a mysterious witch who reveals the mountain is actually in Jotunheim, realm of the giants, requiring travel through other realms. They encounter Baldur, an invulnerable Aesir god hunting them for unknown reasons. The warrior's rage threatens to overtake him as old combat instincts resurface. The boy discovers he can understand languages he shouldn't and has unnatural abilities.
*   **Act II — Realms of Gods and Giants (Sessions 7-13):** They travel through Alfheim, Helheim, and face trials from angry gods. They learn Baldur seeks them because of a prophecy about giants and Ragnarok. The witch is revealed to be Freya, the exiled Vanir goddess. The boy learns his father is the Ghost of Sparta—a god-killer from a distant pantheon who destroyed Olympus in rage. They begin to understand each other as warriors and as family.
*   **Act III — The Truth and Ragnarok (Sessions 14-20):** They reach the highest peak and scatter the ashes, learning the boy's mother was a giant and her name was Laufey—making the boy Loki, destined to start Ragnarok. Baldur returns, his invulnerability finally broken, and they fight to the death. The father must choose between rage and mercy, breaking the cycle of god-killing. Odin's ravens watch, Asgard prepares for war, and father and son return home knowing they've started something they can't stop.
