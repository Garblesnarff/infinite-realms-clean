# Creative Brief: The Ghost of Midgard

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cinematic Norse Mythology with Grounded Brutality (God of War 2018-inspired)

Inspired by the photorealistic yet mythological aesthetic of *God of War (2018)*. This style captures Nordic landscapes, intimate character moments, the weight of violence, father-son relationship dynamics, and gods that are real, flawed, and dangerous. Everything feels grounded despite the fantastical setting.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Realism and Weight:** Photorealistic textures, detailed environments, brutal combat that feels heavy
*   **Nordic Color Palette:** Cold blues, snow whites, deep forest greens, ash grays, with mystical blues and golds for magic
*   **Scale and Intimacy:** Massive gods and monsters contrasted with personal father-son moments
*   **Continuous Camera:** Everything feels like one long take, no cuts, immersive perspective

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Redemption, fatherhood, rage restrained, Norse mythology, brutal beauty, intimate epic, consequences
*   **Feeling:** Standing in frozen forests with an axe, teaching your son to survive. The weight of a blood-soaked past. Gods that bleed and die. Rage kept under control.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Environment:** Cold blues and whites (snow and ice), deep green forests, gray stone ruins, golden magical runes
*   **Combat:** Red blood on white snow, blue ice magic from the axe, orange chaos flames, pale spectral arrows
*   **Characters:** Weathered leather, faded red markings (father's past), earth tones for practical clothing
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of cold northern winter. Deep snow covering ancient stone ruins with Norse runes glowing soft gold. Frozen pine trees heavy with snow. Sky is overcast gray-blue. In the foreground, ash marks on weathered skin and red cloth wrapped around forearms contrast with the cold environment."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Father:** Muscular build, weathered and scarred, ashen gray skin with faded red tattoos, thick beard, practical leather armor, Leviathan Axe on back
*   **The Boy:** Young, practical hunting clothes, quiver of spectral arrows, innocent face but warrior's determination growing
*   **Gods:** Towering, beautiful but alien, perfect yet flawed, dressed in ancient Nordic style
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior with ashen gray skin and faded red tattoos on his arms and face. Thick braided beard. Muscular but aging. Wearing weathered leather armor with fur trim. Carrying a glowing blue ice axe. Expression of controlled rage and protection. Beside him, a young boy in practical furs, holding a bow, looking up at his father with trust and curiosity."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Midgard:** Frozen forests, snow-covered ruins, the Lake of Nine with its rising and falling water, giant corpses and skeletons
*   **Alfheim:** Golden light temple, ethereal and bright, contrasting light and dark elf architecture
*   **Helheim:** Frozen ship graveyard, endless mist, ice and death, eerie green lighting
*   **Jotunheim:** Abandoned giant halls, massive scale architecture, frozen landscapes, murals telling history
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast frozen lake surrounded by towering mountains. Ancient stone ruins emerge from the ice. A massive serpent's corpse is frozen in the lake's center, its spine forming a bridge. The sky is overcast with hints of aurora borealis. Snow falls gently. In the distance, a mountain glows with mystic golden light. Photorealistic, cinematic lighting."

**5. Combat & Divine Powers:**
*   **Leviathan Axe:** Glowing blue-white with frost, trails ice particles when thrown, freezes enemies on impact
*   **Blades of Chaos:** Burning orange chains, brutal close combat, represent the father's violent past
*   **Spectral Arrows:** Boy shoots bright blue-white magical arrows, can summon spirit animals
*   **Spartan Rage:** Red aura, veins glowing, primal fury barely contained
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior throws a glowing blue ice axe in mid-flight, frost particles trailing behind it. The axe impacts a troll's chest, ice spreading across its body. In the background, the boy draws a glowing spectral arrow. Dynamic action shot, snow kicked up from movement, dramatic lighting emphasizing the blue magic against the gray environment."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Cinematic Realism:** Photorealistic textures, natural lighting, god rays through trees
*   **Cold Northern Light:** Overcast skies, soft diffused light, dramatic when magic appears
*   **Bioluminescence:** Mystical elements glow—runes, magic, the World Tree, realm tears
*   **Prompt Example:** "...cinematic lighting with soft overcast sky diffusing through heavy snow clouds. God rays break through the forest canopy in places. Golden runes on ancient stones provide warm contrast to cold environment. Realistic snow shader with depth and texture. The father's ice axe casts blue light on his face in the shadows."

## Voice

A deep, gravelly voice carrying both rage and restraint, like a volcano choosing not to erupt. The pacing is deliberate, measured, with explosive moments of emotion. The tone shifts between teaching lessons to his son, wrestling with violent instincts, and rare moments of vulnerability. There's an underlying theme of being better than you were. Slightly echo-y, as if spoken in vast mountain halls. Role: The voice of controlled fury seeking redemption.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Nordic orchestral with ethnic instruments (tagelharpa, lur, war drums). Slow, building, emphasizing weight and consequence. Choir singing in Old Norse.
*   **Exploration:** Minimal, ambient. Wind, snow crunching, distant animal calls. Occasional low strings creating tension.
*   **Combat:** Heavy percussion—war drums, low brass, aggressive strings. Emphasizes the weight of each blow. Fades immediately when combat ends.
*   **Father-Son Moments:** Soft strings, gentle piano, intimate and emotional. No grand orchestration, keeping it personal.
*   **Boss Battles:** Full orchestra, choir, combining Nordic instruments with modern cinematic scoring. Each major god has a unique musical identity.
*   **Realm Travel:** Ethereal, otherworldly, synthesizer-like sounds mixed with ancient instruments creating the sense of traveling between worlds.
*   **Spartan Rage:** Distorted aggressive percussion, almost industrial sounds, representing barely-controlled violence.
*   **The Mountain:** Mournful chorus, emotional strings, building to triumphant but melancholy as ashes are scattered.
