# Beneath the Surface - World Building Specification

## The Luminae: Complete Species Profile

### Biology and Physiology
**Physical Form**: Humanoid shape made of semi-solid water held by bioluminescent energy matrix
**Height**: 6-7 feet average
**Lifespan**: Unknown, potentially thousands of years
**Reproduction**: Asexual budding or fusion of two Luminae creating third
**Diet**: Absorb minerals and energy from thermal vents, photosynthetic plankton
**Senses**: 360-degree perception through water vibration, emotional resonance detection

**Unique Abilities**
- Pressure immunity (adapted to any depth)
- Shapeshifting (limited, maintain humanoid core)
- Bioluminescent communication (color and pattern = language)
- Telepathic empathy projection
- Water manipulation (minor telekinesis on water molecules)
- Symbiotic bonding (can share adaptation with other species)

### Culture and Society
**Social Structure**: Consensus-based, guided by Council of Elders
**Values**: Harmony, preservation, isolation, peace
**Taboos**: Violence, surface-dwelling, forced transformation
**Art**: Living sculptures, bioluminescent paintings, water-song performances
**History**: 30,000+ years in deep ocean, refugees from surface catastrophe
**Philosophy**: "The deep protects those who respect it"

### Technology
**Living Technology**: All Luminae tech is bio-engineered, symbiotic organisms
- Architecture grows from coral-metal hybrids
- Power from bio-luminescent reactors (living organisms)
- Transportation via directed currents and gravity manipulation
- Healing pools with regenerative properties
- Memory storage in crystalline structures (organic hard drives)

### The Transformation Process
**Stage 1** (24 hours): Gills develop, enhanced swimming ability
**Stage 2** (48 hours): Skin develops bioluminescence, pressure resistance increases
**Stage 3** (1 week): Water-breathing becomes primary, surface time limited to hours
**Stage 4** (2 weeks): Full transformation, essentially Luminae, surface lethal
**Reversibility**: Can reverse up to Stage 3 with Luminae help, Stage 4 is permanent

## The Ancient War: Complete History

### The First Surface Civilization (32,000 years ago)
**Species**: Aquarians—amphibious predecessors to Luminae
**Civilization**: Advanced, controlled both surface and shallow seas
**Conflict**: Environmental catastrophe (self-inflicted, climate change from industry)
**Response**: Desperate attempt to drain deep ocean for resources and living space
**Result**: Awakened the Sentinel, which destroyed surface infrastructure
**Survivors**: Fled to deepest trenches, evolved into Luminae over millennia
**Lesson**: Surface and deep cannot coexist if one seeks to dominate

### The Sentinel's Creation (35,000 years ago)
**Creators**: Unknown primordial ocean intelligence
**Purpose**: Protect deep ocean from surface encroachment
**Function**: Hibernates until threshold of threat reached, then activates
**Power**: Can manipulate pressure, create earthquakes, control water itself
**Weakness**: Single control chamber in ancient facility, deactivation possible
**Intelligence**: Basic—friend/foe recognition only, no negotiation capacity

### Luminae Recorded History
- **30,000 years ago**: Aquarians become Luminae, build first deep cities
- **25,000 years ago**: Forgotten the surface world, focused on deep exploration
- **10,000 years ago**: Discover Sentinel control chamber, choose to leave it active as protection
- **5,000 years ago**: Last contact with other intelligent ocean species (extinct now)
- **Present**: Isolated, peaceful, unaware of new surface civilization (humans) until contact

## Military Structure and Factions

### Surface Military Command
**Organization**: Multi-national task force
**Commander**: Victoria Preston (hardliner)
**Forces**: 3 attack submarines, 6 support craft, 300 personnel
**Armament**: Depth charges, torpedoes, experimental arcane weapons
**Mission**: Recover *Vengeance*, assess threat, secure technology
**Divided Opinions**:
- Hawks: Preston faction—sees Luminae as enemy, wants conquest
- Doves: Intelligence faction—wants peaceful study
- Pragmatists: Most soldiers—follow orders, hope for easy resolution

### Luminae Defense Forces
**Structure**: Voluntary guardians, not standing army
**Leader**: Torrent (Guardian Prime)
**Numbers**: ~500 defenders in Aquanis
**Capabilities**: Pressure manipulation, current control, structural reinforcement
**Philosophy**: Defense only, never attack surface
**Limitation**: Never fought war before, inexperienced

### USS Vengeance Crew (150 personnel)
**Transformed**: 120 crew members at various stages
**Positions on Situation**:
- Want to Return: 40 crew (mostly early-stage transformation)
- Want to Stay: 30 crew (embracing new life)
- Undecided: 30 crew (torn, afraid, confused)
- Command Staff: 10 (Captain Reynolds and officers trying to make right call)
- Scientists: 10 (Dr. Whitmore leading faction wanting to stay)

## Geographic Details: The Mariana Trench System

### Depths and Zones
**Challenger Deep** (11,000m): Where *Vengeance* rests
**The Chasm** (15,000m): Entrance to Luminae territory
**Aquanis Proper** (18,000m): Main city built into trench walls
**The Forbidden Zone** (20,000m+): Ancient ruins and Sentinel's chamber
**The Unknowable Deep** (25,000m+): Unexplored, theoretical maximum depth

### Aquanis City Districts
**The Shallows**: Entry level, welcoming areas, transformation pools
**Residential Tiers**: Living spaces, personal territories
**Council Chambers**: Government and decision-making
**The Forge**: Technology and bio-engineering
**Medical Gardens**: Healing and transformation services
**The Archive**: Historical memory crystals, library
**The Deep Temple**: Spiritual center, Sentinel monitoring station

### Pressure Zones and Effects
**0-1000m**: Normal diving gear sufficient
**1000-5000m**: Reinforced hull required, magic enhancement helpful
**5000-11000m**: Bathysphere or powerful magic mandatory
**11000-18000m**: Advanced pressure suits or Luminae symbiosis required
**18000m+**: Only transformed beings or Sentinel can survive naturally

## Extended NPC Roster

**Torrent** (Luminae Guardian Prime): Warrior, protective, suspicious of surface-dwellers, must be convinced party is peaceful
**Dr. Lisa Kwan** (Submarine Medical Officer): Treating transformed crew, conflicted about "curing" those who want to stay
**Ensign James Park** (Young Officer): Fully embraces transformation, wants to stay, symbol of hope for integration
**Commander Sarah Blake** (*Vengeance* XO): Wants to return, sees transformation as violation, advocates for reversal
**Professor Dmitri Volkov** (Surface Scientist): Remote advisor, advocates for first contact protocols
**Cascade** (Luminae Child): Befriends party, innocent perspective, asks about sun and stars
**The Witness** (Ancient Luminae Elder): 10,000+ years old, remembers the old war, warns against repeating history

## Causality Chains

### The Pressure Breach Event
1. *Vengeance* conducting deep research with arcane scanning
2. Scan pulse accidentally destabilizes trench wall
3. Catastrophic breach, submarine taking on water
4. Crew has minutes before crush depth failure
5. Luminae scouts detect distress
6. Debate: Help or remain hidden?
7. Serenity chooses compassion over safety
8. Luminae use pressure manipulation to save submarine
9. Bring crew to Aquanis
10. Begin symbiotic transformation to save lives
11. Surface loses contact, assumes worst
12. Military assumes hostile act
13. Both sides preparing for conflict from misunderstanding

### The Awakening Sequence
1. Party arrives, first surface presence in millennia
2. Luminae nervous but hopeful
3. Hawkins attempts theft, violence occurs
4. Sentinel detects conflict (threshold reached)
5. Ancient defenses activate
6. Tremors damage both city and submarine
7. Military interprets as hostile act
8. Luminae interpret as surface aggression
9. Both sides mobilize
10. Sentinel doesn't discriminate—attacks all

### Path to Peace
1. Party recognizes mutual fear
2. Dr. Chen develops translation method
3. Cultural exchange reveals shared values
4. Crew testimonies show Luminae's compassion
5. Party confronts Sentinel, learns history
6. Reveals cycle to both sides
7. Choice: Repeat history or break cycle
8. Deactivate/reprogram Sentinel shows trust
9. Treaty based on mutual respect
10. First contact becomes historic success

## Philosophical Questions

**Is transformation violation or gift?** Crew saved but changed without full consent—is that ethical?
**Can fear be overcome?** Both sides terrified—can understanding defeat instinctive xenophobia?
**Who owns the ocean?** Luminae lived here for millennia, but humans claim territorial rights—who's correct?
**Is isolation peace?** Luminae achieved safety through hiding—must they sacrifice it for progress?
**What price for peace?** Must party sacrifice something personal to prove commitment to resolution?
