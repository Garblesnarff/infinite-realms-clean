## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Investigation & Politics:** Players must navigate complex political intrigue, decode conspiracies, and manage relationships with powerful factions.
*   **Godlike Powers:** The party has access to legendary artifacts that grant near-divine abilities, but using them attracts dangerous attention and creates ethical dilemmas.
*   **Existential Stakes:** The campaign deals with themes of power, responsibility, legacy, and the nature of heroism itself.

A multi-layered conspiracy that forces players to question everything they believe about heroism and power.

*   **Act I — The Death of a Paragon (Sessions 1–3):** One of the legendary Paragons is found dead under mysterious circumstances. The party, former proteges or allies of the Paragons, is recruited to investigate. They quickly discover this is no simple murder.
*   **Act II — The Doomsday Clock (Sessions 4–8):** The investigation reveals a vast conspiracy involving government agents, rival nations, and someone with intimate knowledge of the Paragons' secrets. Meanwhile, tensions between kingdoms escalate toward war, and someone is manipulating events behind the scenes.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is philosophical and moral: When does saving the world require becoming a monster? The Paragons once saved civilization with their legendary artifacts, but now those same artifacts make them dangerously powerful wildcards. Aurelius Vex believes that engineering a controlled catastrophe is the only way to prevent an even greater one, but his plan requires mass murder. The party must decide whether utilitarian calculations justify any atrocity, or whether there are moral lines that should never be crossed—even to save the world.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Doomsday Clock**

*   A literal countdown tracking how close the world is to war. Player actions and investigation results can move the clock forward or backward. At midnight, war breaks out.

### 2. **Legendary Artifacts**

### 4. **Multi-Timeline Visions**

*   When consulting Dr. Chronomancer, players can see alternate versions of events, showing them consequences of different choices before committing to them.

### 5. **Interwoven Flashbacks**

*   Throughout the campaign, flashback sessions show the Paragons in their prime, creating context for their current broken state and allowing players to embody these legendary figures.
