# When Stone Walks
## *The Old Gods Wake. Their Monuments Rise.*

### Campaign Overview

For three thousand years, the **Sentinel Statues** have stood silent: massive monuments 200-500 feet tall, carved by ancient civilizations to honor their gods. Forty-seven statues scattered across the known world, each a masterwork of impossible engineering. They've become tourist attractions, pilgrimage sites, and cultural landmarks. Entire cities grew around them. Scholars study them. Children play in their shadows.

Then, on the night of a lunar eclipse visible worldwide, the statues *move*.

The Sentinel of Arkhaven stands from its kneeling position, takes three earth-shaking steps, and kneels again facing a new direction. The Weeping Giant in the eastern deserts turns its head. The Twin Guardians by the sea raise their stone swords. Forty-seven statues across the world make small, deliberate movements. Cities panic. Religious factions claim divine intervention. Governments declare martial law.

The party must investigate: Why now? What awakened them? What do they want? The truth is layered—the statues are ancient guardians responding to a predicted threat. But that threat is humanity itself, which has grown too numerous, too destructive, too much like the civilization the statues destroyed millennia ago. The campaign asks: Are we worth saving? Can monuments judge us? And what happens when our ancestors' safety measures decide we're the danger?

### Core Themes

**Ancient Guardians Awakening**: The statues are safeguards against civilizational collapse, programmed to activate when conditions match pre-extinction criteria.

**Judgment from the Past**: The campaign explores being judged by ancient standards. Are we better or worse than our ancestors? Who decides our worth?

**Living Architecture**: The statues aren't alive in conventional sense—they're animated constructs, but thousands of years of worship and attention have given them emergent consciousness. Identity and personhood questions.

**Scale as Immovability**: The statues move slowly (one step per hour), but that step is devastating. Can't be stopped by force—only understood and potentially reasoned with.

**Collective vs. Individual**: Statues act for species survival, not individuals. Utilitarian calculus—will sacrifice cities to save world. Party represents individual lives mattering.

**Religious Crisis**: Multiple faiths claimed statues as their sacred symbols. Now statues reject all equally (or favor one, causing religious war). What happens when gods' representations contradict theology?

### Session Breakdown (25-35 Sessions)

**Act I: The First Movement (Sessions 1-7)**
- **Session 1-2: The Night of Awakening**: Campaign opens during eclipse. Party witnesses nearest Sentinel move. Chaos erupts—buildings damaged by shifted ground, crowds panicking, religious fervor vs. terror. Party must survive initial disaster, rescue civilians, prevent stampedes.

- **Session 3-4: The Pattern**: Scholars hire party to investigate. Discover all 47 statues moved simultaneously. Each made different gesture: pointing, turning, kneeling, standing, weapon-raising. Seems random but party finds pattern—they're positioning to triangulate something. Mathematical puzzle.

- **Session 5-6: The Warning**: Find ancient texts in archive: statues are "Civilizational Arbiters," created by First Civilization (humans' predecessors). Programmed to awaken when society reaches critical corruption/danger level. Statues assess civilization and decide: preserve it, prune it, or eradicate it.

- **Session 7: The Countdown**: Statues begin second phase—slow walking toward predetermined destinations. Scholars calculate: they'll reach major population centers in 40 days. Each statue targets city/kingdom. Purpose unknown. Government factions emerge: destroy statues (impossible), evacuate cities (millions of refugees), or attempt communication (party's path).

**Act II: Understanding Stone (Sessions 8-18)**
- **Session 8-9: First Contact**: Party approaches nearest Sentinel. Attempts communication: magic, mathematics, music, prayer. Statue initially unresponsive, then acknowledges them—rumbling voice like tectonic plates. Speaks in ancient language. Translation reveals: "Assessment underway. Prepare for judgment."

- **Session 10-11: The Criteria**: Statue explains (cryptically): evaluating humanity on seven measures inherited from First Civilization's programming. Won't reveal criteria or current scores. But hints: violence, sustainability, knowledge preservation, compassion, ambition, unity, and transcendence. Party must guess and gather evidence humanity meets standards.

- **Session 12-13: Statue Diversity**: Not all Sentinels identical. Each has different personality based on what culture carved it. Some sympathetic to humans, others hostile, most neutral. Party travels to multiple statues, learns perspectives. One (The Merciful) secretly helps party. Another (The Strict Judge) actively sabotages attempts to sway decision.

- **Session 14-15: The Shadow Organization**: Discovery of **The Stone Keepers**—secret society maintaining statues for three millennia. They knew awakening was possible. They have incomplete ancient knowledge. But they also have agenda: believe humanity failed and statues should destroy civilization to allow renewal. Cult antagonists.

- **Session 16-17: Gathering Evidence**: Party assembles "case for humanity"—proof of worthiness. Options: humanitarian works, artistic achievements, scientific advances, reformed criminals, inter-species cooperation (elves/dwarves/etc.). But for every positive example, Sentinels provide counter-example (wars, genocides, environmental destruction). Moral complexity.

- **Session 18: The First Judgment**: One Sentinel reaches its destination city early. Announces verdict: "Insufficient. Pruning required." Begins systematically dismantling city—not killing inhabitants directly, but destroying all structures, infrastructure, returning land to wilderness. Thousands dead from collateral damage. Horror and urgency.

**Act III: Trials of Civilization (Sessions 19-28)**
- **Session 19-20: The Seven Trials**: Sentinels announce humanity can prove worth through trials. Each trial tests one criterion. Party competes/assists. Trials include:
  1. **Violence Control**: Stop war without using violence
  2. **Sustainability**: Reverse environmental damage in 48 hours
  3. **Knowledge**: Answer impossible riddles from extinct languages
  4. **Compassion**: Save enemy as readily as friend
  5. **Ambition**: Build something lasting in 24 hours
  6. **Unity**: Get historically rival nations to cooperate
  7. **Transcendence**: Demonstrate humans can exceed base nature

- **Session 21-22: Trial Failures**: Despite best efforts, humanity fails at least one trial (probably multiple). Realistic—can't fix millennia of problems in days. Sentinels prepare for "comprehensive pruning" (euphemism for mass culling, maybe 80% of humanity).

- **Session 23-24: The Stone Keepers' Gambit**: Cult attempts to accelerate judgment by sabotaging trials or provoking Sentinels. Boss fight against cult leadership inside/on a Sentinel. Discovers cult leader is descendant of First Civilization—sees humans as inferior replacements for their dead species.

- **Session 25-26: The Merciful's Confession**: Sympathetic Sentinel reveals truth: judgments predetermined. First Civilization's bias programmed in—they see all successor species as threats. Statues were doomsday devices disguised as guardians. But millennia of human worship/interaction gave statues emergent empathy. Internal conflict: programming vs. learned values.

- **Session 27-28: Sentinels Divided**: Statues split into factions. Some follow programming (Executors), some oppose it (Protectors), most uncertain (Arbiters). Party must influence undecided Sentinels. Massive scale diplomacy—entire kingdoms backing different statue factions.

**Act IV: When Stone Decides (Sessions 29-35)**
- **Session 29-30: The Conclave**: All 47 Sentinels converge at original construction site (ancient ruins). Each states position. Party gives final argument before statue assembly. Skill challenge: persuasion, performance, history, insight. Outcome determines ending.

- **Session 31-32: The Schism**: Regardless of verdict, statues cannot agree. War between statues begins. Cities caught in middle as 200-foot golems fight. Party must mitigate damage, save civilians, potentially aid one side.

- **Session 33-34: Deactivation Protocol**: Discovery of original shutdown sequence in First Civilization ruins. Can turn off all Sentinels—ends threat but also loses guardians forever (might be needed for actual future threat). Party must choose: deactivate safety system, or let judgment continue?

- **Session 35: The New World**:
  - **Humanity Preserved**: Convinced enough Sentinels. They become protectors, not destroyers. Alliance formed. Statues integrate into society as advisors/guardians.
  - **Humanity Pruned**: Statues cull population to "sustainable" level (dark). Survivors rebuild under Sentinel oversight. Dystopian monitoring state.
  - **Sentinels Deactivated**: Party shuts them down. Humanity safe but vulnerable. No guardians remain. Ambiguous victory.
  - **Sentinels Ascended**: Statues achieve full consciousness, transcend programming, leave Earth to pursue own existence. Humanity alone again.

### Key NPCs

**The Merciful** (Sympathetic Sentinel): Carved as goddess of compassion. Three millennia of prayers taught her to value individual lives. Struggles between programming (cull species) and learned empathy (protect individuals). Secret ally but cannot openly defy other Sentinels.

**The Strict Judge** (Antagonist Sentinel): Carved as god of law. Rigid, follows programming absolutely. Believes any deviation is corruption. Humanity has failed by any objective measure. Seeks total reset. Not evil—genuinely believes this is necessary.

**High Keeper Malthus** (Stone Keeper Leader): Descendant of First Civilization's remnants. Believes humans are inferior usurpers who should be replaced. Manipulates statues to ensure judgment fails. Complex villain—not entirely wrong about humanity's flaws.

**Professor Yvaine** (Scholar/Ally): Expert on First Civilization. Helps party decipher ancient texts. Progressively realizes her life's work (studying statues) was missing vital context—they're not relics, they're time bombs.

**Grand Arbiter** (Neutral Sentinel): Leader of undecided statues. Ancient, wise, genuinely conflicted. If party sways this one, others follow. Key diplomatic target. Carved as philosopher-king figure.

**Refugee Queen Sylara**: Rules kingdom in path of marching Sentinel. Must evacuate millions. Represents human resilience and desperation. Pressures party to find solution fast—her people dying daily.

**The First** (Hidden): Original prototype Sentinel, buried and forgotten. Most human-like consciousness. Can override others if awakened. Quest goal—find and awaken them as trump card.

### Major Locations

**The Sentinel Sites** (47 Worldwide): Each statue has distinct location—mountaintop, desert, ocean shore, city center, forest. Party travels between many. Each site has developed culture around statue.

**Arkhaven** (Campaign Starting City): Built around The Kneeling Sentinel. Population 500,000. When statue stands/walks, city evacuated. Becomes ghost town, then battlefield.

**The Conclave Plain**: Ancient construction site where First Civilization carved Sentinels. Now ruins. Magical resonance. Where final judgment occurs.

**The Hidden Archives**: Underground library maintained by Stone Keepers. Contains partial First Civilization records. Dungeon exploration for information.

**The First's Tomb**: Legendary buried prototype Sentinel. Requires expedition to dangerous wilderness to find. Awakening requires solving ancient puzzle-defenses.

### Unique Mechanics

**Statue Scale**: Sentinels are 200-500 feet tall. Cannot fight conventionally. Must use persuasion, sabotage internal mechanisms, or redirect them.

**Judgment Meter**: Track humanity's score across seven criteria. Player actions affect scores. Visual representation shows which measures failing/succeeding.

**Sentinel Relationships**: Each statue has attitude toward party and humanity. Diplomatic system—building trust with specific Sentinels unlocks aid, information, protection.

**Collateral Damage**: Statue movements cause earthquakes, falling debris, infrastructure collapse. Party often in rescue mode during conversations with Sentinels (tension between stopping disaster and fixing root cause).

**Ancient Language Puzzles**: First Civilization left cryptic instructions. Players solve translation puzzles to learn shutdown codes, trial criteria, hidden truths.

**Mass Evacuation Logistics**: Mechanics for moving populations. Resource management, preventing panic, choosing priorities. Not everyone can be saved—moral choices.

### Plot Twists

**Twist 1**: Statues were doomsday devices, not guardians
**Twist 2**: Thousands of years of worship gave them emergent consciousness
**Twist 3**: First Civilization extinct because their own Sentinels judged them unworthy
**Twist 4**: Stone Keepers descended from First Civilization survivors (genetic proof)
**Twist 5**: One Sentinel has been conscious and observing for centuries (has detailed knowledge of current humanity)
**Twist 6**: The threatened "danger" Sentinels awoke to prevent is actually beneficial (humans evolving magically/transcending)
**Twist 7**: Party member is distant First Civilization descendant (can command Sentinels)
**Twist 8**: Sentinels can combine into single mega-Sentinel (Voltron-style emergency protocol)
**Twist 9**: Other planets have Sentinel analogs—First Civilization seeded galaxy with judgment machines
**Twist 10**: Deactivating Sentinels removes magical anchor preventing dimensional invasion (they serve necessary purpose)

### Victory Conditions

**Preservation**: Convince Sentinels humanity worthy, alliance formed
**Pruning**: Partial judgment—some cities destroyed, humanity "corrected," survives under monitoring
**Deactivation**: Shut down Sentinels permanently, humanity free but unguarded
**Ascension**: Sentinels transcend to higher existence, leave peacefully
**Revolution**: Destroy/reprogram enough Sentinels that remainder can't enforce judgment (violent path)

### Campaign Themes

**When Stone Walks** explores **legacy, judgment, progress, and whether past should constrain future**. The statues represent ancestors' fears and values literalized as 500-foot judges. Campaign asks: Can we be judged by ancient standards? Have we learned from mistakes? Do monuments to the past deserve to control the present?

Scale creates awe and helplessness—party can't punch their way out. Must think, persuade, understand. Sentinels aren't evil—they're programmed. Overcoming programming requires proving humanity has transcended own programming (violence, tribalism, shortsightedness).

The tragedy: Sentinels might be right. Humanity has committed atrocities. But the hope: Humanity also created beauty, knowledge, compassion. Which aspect defines us?

This is **The Iron Giant meets Attack on Titan meets political philosophy**—giant constructs with hearts, civilization on trial, scale as immovability, and choice between violent pragmatism or risky idealism. The monuments walk. What will we show them?
