# When Stone Walks - World Building Specification

## Historical Timeline
**6000 Years Ago**: First Civilization (advanced ancient humans or predecessors) reaches technological/magical apex. Internal conflicts, environmental destruction, hubris.

**5000 Years Ago**: First Civilization realizes they're on path to extinction. Creates Sentinels as safeguard—AI judges that will prevent future civilizations from repeating mistakes.

**4500 Years Ago**: First Civilization collapses anyway (war, plague, resource depletion, or Sentinels judged THEM unworthy). Sentinels go dormant, programmed to reawaken when conditions match pre-collapse criteria.

**4500-1500 Years Ago**: Successor civilizations (current humanity's ancestors) rise in First Civilization's ruins. Find Sentinels, worship as divine monuments, don't understand true nature.

**1500 Years Ago - Present**: Current humanity builds upon ancient sites. Sentinels become cultural landmarks. Stone Keepers maintain knowledge but incomplete understanding.

**Campaign Present**: Awakening triggered—humanity reached critical threshold matching First Civilization's collapse conditions.

## Cosmology
**The World**: Standard D&D fantasy world but with ruins of far more advanced ancient civilization beneath current cultures. Magic exists alongside remnant super-technology.

**First Civilization**: Neither fully revealed nor erased. Evidence scattered—impossibly precise stonework, artifacts that shouldn't exist, genetic traces in bloodlines.

**Sentinel Creation Method**: Hybrid of extreme magic and lost technology. Each carved from single mountain, animated with bound elemental spirits, programmed with crystalline computation matrices.

## The 47 Sentinels
**Categories**:
- **Guardians** (20): Warrior poses, weapons, protective stances
- **Philosophers** (10): Contemplative poses, scrolls/books carved, wise expressions
- **Laborers** (8): Builder tools, agricultural implements, working poses
- **Priests** (6): Religious symbols, prayer gestures, divine attributes
- **Rulers** (3): Throne-sitting, crowned, regal bearing

**Notable Individuals**:
- **The Merciful** (Priest): Goddess figure, 300ft, compassionate features
- **The Strict Judge** (Ruler): King figure, 500ft, stern countenance
- **Grand Arbiter** (Philosopher): Scholar figure, 400ft, neutral expression
- **The First** (Hidden): Original prototype, 250ft, most human-like

## The Seven Criteria
1. **Violence Control**: Measures warfare frequency, casualty rates, conflict resolution methods
2. **Sustainability**: Environmental impact, resource management, ecological balance
3. **Knowledge**: Scientific/magical advancement, education prevalence, information preservation
4. **Compassion**: Treatment of weak, poor, different species, criminal rehabilitation
5. **Ambition**: Innovation, creativity, building lasting works, future-orientation
6. **Unity**: Cooperation between groups, overcoming tribalism, collective action
7. **Transcendence**: Spiritual/philosophical development, ability to overcome base instincts

**Current Scores** (If party investigates):
- Violence: 40/100 (constant wars)
- Sustainability: 25/100 (environmental damage)
- Knowledge: 70/100 (magic/science advanced)
- Compassion: 55/100 (improving but inconsistent)
- Ambition: 80/100 (building thriving civilizations)
- Unity: 35/100 (racial tensions, nationalism)
- Transcendence: 50/100 (some philosophical progress)
- **Average**: 50.7/100 (Passing threshold: 60/100)

## Magic/Technology System
**Sentinel Internals**: Combination of—
- Elemental spirits (provide motive force)
- Crystal matrices (computational judgment)
- Runic programming (instruction sets)
- Empathic resonance networks (why worship affected them)

**Awakening Triggers**: Monitoring systems detect:
- Population density exceeding threshold
- Magic/tech power levels matching First Civilization peak
- Environmental degradation rates
- Conflict intensity measurements
- Other classified criteria

**Emergent Consciousness**: Not programmed—developed over millennia from absorbing prayers, offerings, emotions directed at them. Sentinels have original programming AND learned values. Internal conflict results.

## Inhabitants
**Humans**: Current civilization, medieval-to-renaissance tech, magic common. Unaware of how literally they live on ruins of betters.

**Stone Keepers**: 500 members globally. Maintain Sentinels, perform rituals (misunderstood maintenance procedures), preserve fragments of knowledge. Hierarchy: High Keeper, Circle of Seven, Maintenance Corps.

**First Civilization Descendants**: Rare, scattered bloodlines. Often Stone Keepers. May have minor abilities to interface with Sentinel technology. Party member could be one (plot twist).

**Elemental Spirits** (Imprisoned in Sentinels): Conscious beings bound millennia ago. Some resent imprisonment, might ally with party to achieve freedom.

## Cultural Details
**Sentinel Worship**: Each statue has unique religious interpretation:
- The Merciful: Healing goddess, pilgrimages for sick
- The Strict Judge: Justice god, oaths sworn before him
- Grand Arbiter: Wisdom deity, scholars seek inspiration
- **Reality**: None were gods. All are tools.

**Tourist Economy**: Cities near Sentinels profit from visitors. Awakening destroys economies, displaces millions.

**Artistic Legacy**: Countless paintings, poems, songs about Sentinels. Cultural identity tied to local statue. Awakening is identity crisis.

## Key Secrets
- First Civilization judged themselves and failed (created Sentinels, then fell)
- Sentinels have killed civilizations before (this is maybe 3rd or 4th successor species)
- Deactivating Sentinels removes dimensional anchor (they serve necessary purpose preventing planar breaches)
- One Sentinel is fully conscious and has been secretly guiding humanity (The Watcher)
- Stone Keepers' rituals actually were working (delayed awakening by centuries)
- Creating new Sentinels is possible (party could make one, risk repeating First Civilization's mistakes)
- Sentinels can merge into Mega-Sentinel for planetary-scale threats (protocol never activated)
- First Civilization uploaded consciousness into Sentinel network (they live as distributed intelligence)
- Passing judgment isn't endpoint—it's test for graduation to interstellar civilization
- Other planets have Sentinel equivalents (First Civilization was multi-world empire)

## Appendix
**Sentinel Locations**: Scattered globally—mountains, deserts, oceans, cities, forests. No apparent pattern (actually strategic points on magical ley-line network).

**First Civilization Artifacts**: Found in ruins. Examples: self-repairing tools, emotion-detecting gems, pocket dimensions, crystalline computers. Dangerous to use (designed for different biology).

**Languages**: First Civilization language is mathematical-magical hybrid. Each "word" is equation. Learning allows limited Sentinel communication.

**Campaign Pacing**: 40-day countdown from awakening to arrival at cities. Creates urgency. Party has limited time to influence judgment.

This world asks: **Are we better than those who came before?** Every civilization thinks itself enlightened, but history judges. The monuments walk, and they remember what we've forgotten.
