# Empire of the Steppes - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Nomadic Realism Meets Epic Scope**: Harsh steppe beauty, mobile warfare, cultural clash between nomadic and sedentary civilizations. Inspired by: Mongol miniature paintings, Central Asian art, epic films like *Mongol* (2007).

## Visual Design

**Genghis Khan**: Ages from scarred youth to weathered conqueror. Iconic elements: Long black hair in braids, fur-trimmed deel (Mongol robe), composite bow, white horse banner.

**Mongol Warriors**: Light armor (lamellar leather/metal), fur caps, composite bows, multiple horses per warrior. Evolution: Nomadic simplicity → Integrated Chinese/Persian equipment.

**Environments**: Endless steppes (green summer/white winter), gers (yurts), siege of walled cities, mountain passes, desert campaigns.

## Color Palettes
- **Steppe**: Sky blue, grass green, earth brown, white (winter)
- **Mongol**: Brown leather, grey felt, red/gold accents (khan's colors)
- **Conquest**: Fire orange (burning cities), blood red, steel grey
- **Divine**: Eternal Blue Sky—vibrant blue, clouds, sky symbols

## Music
**Throat singing and horns** (Mongolian traditional), war drums, horse hooves thunder. Themes: Freedom (steppes), Unity (tribal gathering), Conquest (war march), Legacy (elegiac remembrance).

**Genghis's Theme**: Begins simple nomadic melody, evolves to incorporate conquered cultures' instruments—Chinese guzheng, Persian ney, Russian balalaika.

## Voice Direction

**Genghis Khan**: Deep, commanding, weighted with authority. Early: Desperate survival. Mid: Growing confidence. Late: Absolute power with undercurrent of mortality. Accented Mongolian English.

**Börte**: Strong, practical, warm to family, steel to enemies. Partner, not subordinate.

**Jamukha**: Charismatic rival, tragic antagonist. Aristocratic bearing, bitter towards end.

**Subutai**: Gruff soldier, tactical genius. Working-class origins, earned authority.

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Kurultai**: Genghis proclaimed Universal Ruler, white horse banner raised
- **Siege of Zhongdu**: Psychological warfare—mountains of skulls
- **Death Scene**: Secret burial, anyone who witnessed killed, location lost to history
