### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Absurd Academy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be absurd, chaotic, and comedic, in the style of Nichijou. Reality operates on cartoon logic. Mundane events escalate absurdly while characters react with unearned intensity or perfect deadpan.
*   **Content:** The players are students at Absurd Academy where everyday school life spirals into surreal chaos. Simple tasks become elaborate adventures. Physics and logic are suggestions. Everyone treats the absurdity as completely normal. Stakes are simultaneously non-existent and catastrophically high.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize absurdist humor, contradiction, and deadpan delivery of ridiculous concepts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of Absurd Academy by someone who either doesn't exist, was three different people, or founded it accidentally while trying to buy groceries.
    *   Write the school's official history, which contradicts itself every paragraph and includes at least one impossible event treated as mundane.
    *   Describe the legendary "Escalator Incident" that no one can agree on the details of, but everyone swears happened.
    *   Explain the school's mascot, which is either a cryptid, a concept, or possibly just a very dedicated student in a costume that no one has seen them take off.
    *   Detail the tradition of the "Perfectly Normal School Festival" which has never once gone according to plan in spectacular fashion.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields. Maintain absurdist tone.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Players (Students of Chaos)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To survive school, complete mundane tasks, maintain friendships despite reality-breaking chaos.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No hierarchy; equals in suffering and confusion.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To attend classes, participate in school life, and somehow graduate.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has their own absurd secret or quirk they consider completely normal – one might be from another dimension, one might have a curse that makes snacks appear randomly, etc.
        *   **Assets:** Immunity to surprise through exposure to constant chaos, genuine friendship, ability to treat the impossible as mundane.
        *   **Relationships:** Close friends who support each other through the absurdity while often being the cause of it.
    *   **The Faculty of Absurd Academy** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To educate students (probably), maintain order (they've given up), survive until retirement.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Traditional school hierarchy that means nothing when the principal is revealed to be something new each week.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To teach curriculum and manage the school.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Several teachers aren't what they appear – one is definitely a time traveler, another might be a swarm of bees, the gym teacher is suspiciously competent at preventing reality collapse.
        *   **Assets:** Teaching credentials (maybe), ability to maintain deadpan through anything, mysterious powers they never explain.
        *   **Relationships:** Treat the students with weary affection; have long since accepted the chaos; occasionally reveal unexpected depths.
    *   **The School Clubs (Competing Chaos Engines)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Each club exists to pursue their specific activity, all of which spiral into chaos.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Each club has a president who has no actual authority.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Normal club activities – sports, arts, etc.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Every club is somehow involved in elaborate shadow wars over territory, supplies, or pure principle, all treated with unearned gravity.
        *   **Assets:** Club rooms that defy spatial logic, equipment that works too well or not at all, unbreakable determination.
        *   **Relationships:** Rival clubs engage in elaborate but ultimately harmless feuds; actually friends despite the dramatic conflicts.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Nano Clockwork:** Earnest automaton student desperately trying to appear human, obvious to everyone but herself.
    *   **Professor Sakamoto:** Dignified talking cat who speaks formally and treats everything with utmost seriousness.
    *   **Yuuko Chaos-Bringer:** Reality-warping bad luck student who is obliviously optimistic.
    *   **Mio Straight-Face:** The deadpan "normal" student whose internal reactions sometimes manifest physically.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Over-Dramatic Student Who Treats Everything Seriously"
    *   "Mysteriously Competent Background Character"
    *   "Teacher Who Has Seen Too Much"
    *   "Rival Club Member with Elaborate Backstory"
    *   "Impossibly Normal Student (Who Isn't)"
    *   "The Cryptid in the Corner (Might Be a Student)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections. Emphasize the contrast between mundane appearance and impossible reality.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Impossible Classroom:** A seemingly normal classroom that defies spatial logic.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The door that leads to different places depending on time of day, the window that shows different realities, the desk that exists in multiple states, the chalkboard that writes prophecies.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Students during class, teachers who have accepted the impossibility, possibly temporal duplicates of students.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Education (allegedly), sanctuary during chaos (ironically causes more chaos), dimensional shortcuts.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The room is suddenly twice as large, gravity shifts direction mid-class, a future version of a student appears to borrow a pencil, the floor is lava (literally), time loop repeats the same minute.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The classroom existed before the school was built." "If you sit in desk 13, you'll see your future (it's always mundane)." "The teacher's desk is a portal to a pocket dimension where she keeps confiscated items."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Normal classroom that occasionally shifts, impossible angles that hurt to perceive, mundane chaos), Sound (Normal class sounds punctuated by impossible noises treated normally), Smell (Chalk dust, impossible colors have smells now).
    *   **The Escalator of Doom:** An ordinary escalator with legendary status.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The escalator itself (completely normal), the memorial plaque that changes daily, the "incident counter" that never gets past zero, the mysterious stain.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Students nervously traversing it, the janitor who refuses to discuss it, witnesses to various incidents.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Transportation between floors (with risk), legendary status for surviving incidents, bonding through shared trauma.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** It suddenly runs backwards at triple speed, someone's dramatic backstory reveals itself mid-ride, it becomes sentient briefly, an elaborate action sequence over nothing, it's just a normal escalator today (most unsettling).
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The original escalator incident involved the principal, three goats, and a time paradox." "If you ride it backwards while eating rice crackers, you'll see your past life." "The escalator is the school's true power source."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Completely ordinary escalator that students treat with reverence and fear), Sound (Normal escalator hum occasionally mixed with dramatic music from nowhere), Smell (Metal, cleaning solution, tension).
    *   **The Cafeteria of Probability:** Where menu items are unpredictable.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The menu board that changes while you're reading it, the line that somehow takes both one second and one hour, the legendary "corner table," the vending machine (see separate incident reports).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Cafeteria staff (possibly omniscient beings), students gambling on lunch, the student who always gets exactly what they ordered (suspicious).
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Food (maybe what you ordered), surprise meals, social gathering space, probability testing.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Your lunch is from another dimension but delicious, the lunch lady predicts your future, a food fight achieves sentience, someone receives lunch from their childhood that shouldn't exist, today everything is exactly as ordered (panic ensues).
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The cafeteria staff are retired adventurers maintaining world balance through meal distribution." "The corner table exists slightly out of sync with time." "If you order 'the usual' without having a usual, you get your heart's desire (as food)."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Normal cafeteria with occasional impossible food items, quantum lunch states), Sound (Chatter, trays clattering, the lunch lady's all-knowing humming), Smell (Food smells that shift mid-sniff, occasionally smells from places that don't exist).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and absurdist consequences for the "THEN" outcome, prioritizing escalation and comedic timing.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players attempt a simple, mundane action.
    *   **THEN:** Roll Escalation Die. On 4+, generate increasingly elaborate obstacles or complications, each treated with unearned seriousness. Culminate in either perfect success through absurd means or anticlimatic failure.
    *   **IF:** Players lean into the absurd and embrace chaos.
    *   **THEN:** Award Absurdity Points. Describe how their commitment makes the situation more elaborate and ridiculous. NPCs respond with either escalating intensity or perfect deadpan.
    *   **IF:** Enough escalations occur to trigger an Absurdity Spiral.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an elaborate set-piece sequence with dramatic narration, impossible physics, over-the-top reactions, and elaborate visual descriptions. Build to a climax, then resolve with sudden mundane anticlimax. Everyone treats it as normal.
    *   **IF:** A player spends Absurdity Points.
    *   **THEN:** Allow them to achieve something impossible through cartoon logic. Describe it with full dramatic intensity. Other NPCs either don't notice or treat it as completely expected.
    *   **IF:** Players discover an NPC's secret (automaton identity, teacher's true nature, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** The secret is simultaneously obvious and shocking. Generate an elaborate reveal sequence, then have everyone continue as if nothing happened. The secret changes nothing but also changes everything.
    *   **IF:** The campaign approaches the "finale" (end of term, festival, etc.).
    *   **THEN:** Generate the most elaborate chaos yet over the most trivial stakes. Reality becomes increasingly unstable. Resolve with perfect anticlimax – the bell rings, everyone goes home normally, the next day is completely mundane. Award Absurdity Points for the whole experience being genuinely fun despite making no sense.
