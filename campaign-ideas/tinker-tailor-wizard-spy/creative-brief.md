# Tinker Tailor Wizard Spy - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Drab Realism

**British Cold War Espionage** - Muted colors, rain-soaked streets, smoke-filled rooms. Everything looks worn, tired, authentic to 1970s intelligence work. No glamour, just institutional decay and human cost.

## Color Palettes
- **The Circus**: Institutional green, brown, grey—bureaucratic depression
- **Interviews**: Warm interiors hiding cold truths, amber lamp light
- **Flashbacks**: Slightly warmer but fading, memory's unreliability
- **Revelation**: Desaturated shock, color drains as truth emerges

## Music
**Melancholic Classical** - Solo piano, mournful strings, no triumphant moments. Silence used powerfully. Sound of rain, typing, turning pages.

## Voice Direction
- **Control**: Elderly statesman, every word measured, dying authority
- **Bill Haydon**: Cultured, charming, perfect spy voice hiding betrayal
- **Smiley** (if present): Quiet, observant, more listening than speaking
- **Karla**: Never speaks, presence felt in absence

## Cinematic Moments
- **The Interview**: Two people in room, tea growing cold, truth emerging
- **The Flashback**: Mission briefing years ago, seeing betrayal in hindsight
- **The Revelation**: Realizing who Gerald is, gut-punch delivery
- **The Confession**: Mole explains why, sympathy with horror
- **The Exchange**: Prisoner swap, Cold War made manifest
