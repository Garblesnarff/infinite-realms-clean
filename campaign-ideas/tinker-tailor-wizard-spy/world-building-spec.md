# Tinker Tailor Wizard Spy - World-Building Specification

## The Circus (Western Intelligence)

**Structure**: Cambridge Circus headquarters, five operational divisions (Scalphunters, Lamplighters, etc.). Control at top, desk officers manage agents, hierarchy rigid.

**Culture**: Paranoid, bureaucratic, class-conscious. Old boys' network. Public school educated elite running operations. Deeply compromised by Gerald mole.

**Operations**: Human intelligence, signal intercepts, agent networks. Currently ineffective due to penetration. Trust destroyed.

## The Suspects

**Tinker (Toby Esterhase)**: Hungarian refugee, runs Lamplighters (surveillance). Access to operational details. Shifty but competent. Not Gerald but compromised.

**Tailor (Percy Alleline)**: Current Control, ambitious. Running "Witchcraft" operation (source Merlin providing Soviet intel). Actually Gerald's conduit without knowing.

**Soldier (Roy Bland)**: Eastern Europe specialist, working class background. Good field operator. Under suspicion due to access and opportunity.

**Poorman (Ricki Tarr)**: Field agent who discovered Gerald's existence while in Istanbul. On run, unreliable due to emotional compromise (fell in love with Soviet asset).

**Beggarman (Bill Haydon)**: Charming, brilliant, connected to everyone. Perfect spy. IS Gerald—has been deep cover mole for decades. Best friend to all suspects.

## The Investigation

**Method**: Interview suspects separately, cross-reference stories, identify inconsistencies. Review operational records for patterns. Reconstruct compromised missions. Find common denominator.

**Challenges**: Suspects are professionals at deception. Files may be altered. Memory is fallible. Time pressure from ongoing damage. Political resistance to investigation.

**Evidence**: Financial records, travel logs, communication patterns, operational failures. Circumstantial requiring interpretation and inference.

## The Betrayal

**Gerald's Identity**: Bill Haydon, recruited by Karla during WWII. Ideological conversion then long-term strategic placement.

**Motivation**: Initially ideology (communism), then personal (love of Karla/cause), finally inertia (too deep to surface).

**Method**: Rose through ranks genuinely skilled, betrayed selectively to protect cover, fed intelligence through Witchcraft source (fake defector he controlled).

**Damage**: Dozens of agents killed, operations compromised for 30+ years, Western intelligence devastated. Incalculable loss.

**Endgame**: Exposed but unrepentant. Prisoner exchange. Escapes justice but mission ended.

## The Cold War

**Context**: 1970s East-West tensions, spy vs. spy shadow war. Neither side morally pure. Intelligence communities mirror each other. Individuals sacrificed for geopolitics.

**Stakes**: Information is power. Agent networks are currency. Betrayal is death. Trust is impossible. Everyone plays the game.

**Resolution**: Gerald found but Cold War continues. New moles probably exist. Cycle unbroken. Players return to game, scarred but committed.

This supports slow-burn investigation campaign about betrayal, paranoia, and intellectual detective work in morally grey Cold War espionage.
