### **World-Building Specification Brief: Baba Yaga's Bargain**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When Koschei the Deathless steals the Firebird to prevent his fated death, eternal winter descends upon the Slavic lands, and the party—marked by dangerous encounters with Baba Yaga who demands impossible tasks in exchange for guidance—must journey through enchanted forests and stranger realms to find Koschei's hidden soul, discovering that death, rebirth, and seasonal cycles form cosmic balance that immortality threatens to destroy forever.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

    *   Write about the traditional soul-hiding method—island, oak, hare, duck, egg, needle
    *   Detail Slavic forest spirits—leshy, rusalka, domovoi, kikimora—and their relationships with humans
    *   Explain Chernobog and Belobog as opposing forces of darkness/light and misfortune/fortune

*   Each location represents different aspects of Slavic folklore and the balance between life and death

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Koschei's soul remains hidden THEN eternal winter continues and spring never returns
*   IF the Firebird stays imprisoned THEN no transformation or rebirth can occur
*   IF Baba Yaga's tasks are failed THEN she takes terrible payment in flesh and years
*   IF her tasks are completed THEN she provides crucial guidance but demands future favors
*   IF forest spirits are disrespected THEN they lead travelers astray to death
*   IF proper folkloric rituals are performed THEN spirits can be bargained with safely
*   IF the party accepts transformation THEN they gain power but risk losing humanity
*   IF Chernobog's influence spreads THEN darkness and misfortune corrupt everything
*   IF the soul is found and destroyed THEN Koschei dies but balance must be restored
*   IF the Firebird is freed THEN spring can return but its fire burns indiscriminately
*   IF death is restored naturally THEN cycles resume but mortality returns to all
*   IF immortality is maintained THEN stagnation continues but individual death is prevented
*   IF new balance is negotiated THEN perhaps death and life can coexist with wisdom
*   IF folkloric rules are broken THEN transformation curses and terrible consequences follow
*   IF the party completes all tests THEN they may earn Baba Yaga's rare respect and aid
