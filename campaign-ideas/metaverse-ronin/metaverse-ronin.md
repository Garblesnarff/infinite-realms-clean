In a fractured America where corporate franchise-states (like Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong or New South Africa) control territories and the Metaverse is a virtual reality escape from urban decay, the party consists of mercenary operatives—including a sword-wielding hacker named Hiro Protagonist and a skateboard courier named Y.T. They uncover Snow Crash, a dangerous drug/virus that affects both the physical brain and virtual avatars by exploiting ancient Sumerian linguistic programming embedded in human consciousness. As they trace Snow Crash's origin to media mogul L. Bob Rife and his plot to control humanity through a neurological virus, they must navigate both meat-space and Metaverse to stop a techno-linguistic apocalypse.
