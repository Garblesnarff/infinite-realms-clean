*   **Long-Term Planning:** The revenge requires patience, establishing false identities, and executing complex schemes over multiple sessions.
*   **Moral Complexity:** The targets aren't purely evil—they have families, redeeming qualities, and the party will witness collateral damage.

## Central Conflict

Justice versus vengeance. The party helps execute elaborate revenge, but witnesses the collateral damage—innocent family members suffer, lives are destroyed, and the question haunts them: Does Dantes have the right to be judge, jury, and executioner? Is their revenge making the world better or just spreading more pain? The party must decide if they'll see it through or try to stop the Count before he becomes the monster he's fighting.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Social Facades**
*   The party maintains false identities in high society. Slipping out of character can expose them.

### 2. **The Revenge Ledger**
*   Track each betrayer's downfall through stages. Each successful scheme moves them closer to ruin.

### 3. **Collateral Damage**
*   Track innocent people harmed by the revenge. High collateral damage can shift alignment and cause moral crises.

### 4. **The Treasure**
*   Nearly unlimited wealth removes traditional resource management, focusing gameplay on social maneuvering instead.

### 5. **Time Skips**
*   The campaign uses time skips between acts as years pass, showing the patience required for perfect revenge.

### 6. **Moral Choice Points**
*   At key moments, the party can choose to show mercy, potentially redeeming enemies or stopping the Count from going too far.
