# Creative Brief: The Count of Vengeance

## Art Style: Romantic Period Drama (19th Century French Romanticism)

Inspired by Alexandre Dumas's era—think delicate watercolors for society, stark shadows for the prison, and opulent detail for the Count's mysterious wealth.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Prison scenes in grays and blues. Treasure discovery in gold and warm light. High society in rich fabrics—deep burgundies, royal blues, emerald greens. The Count wears black, standing out dramatically.

**Character Design:** Period-accurate French fashion—tailcoats, top hats, elaborate dresses, military uniforms. The Count is impeccably dressed but mysterious. Disguises are crucial.

**Environments:** The grim stone prison, the Mediterranean island with ancient ruins, Parisian ballrooms with crystal chandeliers, the Count's mysterious mansion with hidden rooms.

## Voice

A cultured male voice with a French accent, speaking with the measured patience of someone who has waited years for this moment. Emotional undertones of barely contained rage mixed with melancholy. The voice of someone playing a role so long they've almost forgotten who they truly were.

## Music Style

Romantic era orchestral—string quartets for planning scenes, full orchestra for confrontations, solo piano for moral reflection. Use recurring leitmotifs: a simple sailor's melody for Edmond's lost innocence, a complex, dark theme for the Count's revenge. The tone is elegant but tinged with tragedy—think Chopin meets a psychological thriller score.
