### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Count of Vengeance**

**1. Core Concept:**
Wrongfully imprisoned, the party escapes with Edmond Dantes and uses a hidden treasure to execute elaborate revenge against those who betrayed them, while grappling with the moral cost of vengeance.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the political landscape of this pseudo-France and the power of aristocrats
*   Explain the Chateau d'If prison and its history of political prisoners
*   Describe the legend of Monte Cristo's treasure and its ancient origins
*   Write about the secret societies and networks the Count builds
*   Detail how magic exists but is subtle—illusion, charm, information gathering

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Count's Network** (Major) - Agents and allies helping execute revenge
*   **The Betrayers** (Major) - Fernand, Danglars, Villefort, each with their own power bases
*   **Parisian High Society** (Major) - Aristocrats, merchants, politicians caught in the schemes
*   **The Innocent Bystanders** (Minor) - Families of the betrayers who suffer collaterally

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Edmond/The Count, Fernand, Danglars, Villefort, Haydee, Mercedes (Edmond's lost love), Albert (Fernand's innocent son)
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Corrupt Aristocrat," "Loyal Servant of the Count," "Investigator Tracking the Count," "Innocent Family Member"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Chateau d'If** - The prison (dark, isolated, hopeless)
*   **Monte Cristo Island** - Ancient ruins, traps, treasure vault
*   **The Count's Mansion** - Secret rooms, planning headquarters, mysterious
*   **Parisian Venues** - Ballrooms, theaters, banks, courts where schemes unfold

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party shows mercy to betrayers THEN some may redeem themselves, affecting ending
*   IF party ruthlessly destroys all targets THEN they become as dark as those they hunted
*   IF party exposes The Count's identity prematurely THEN rushed final confrontation with incomplete revenge
*   IF party protects innocent family members THEN moral complexity increases but Count may turn on them
