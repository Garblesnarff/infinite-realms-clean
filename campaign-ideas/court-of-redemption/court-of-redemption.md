Each match teaches new aspects of basketball while revealing teammates' backstories and regrets. They face Ryonan's tactical genius, Kainan's perfect machine-like execution, and learn what championship-level play looks like. The protagonist evolves from liability to genuine contributor.
*   **Act III — The National Championship (Sessions 14-20):** Having qualified for Nationals, Shohoku faces the ultimate test—Sannoh, the undefeated champions. The protagonist must play through exhaustion and injury, executing plays they've only practiced weeks. In the climactic match, every team member contributes their specialized skill.
