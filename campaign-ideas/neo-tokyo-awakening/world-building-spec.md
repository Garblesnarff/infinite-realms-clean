# Neo-Tokyo Awakening - World-Building Specification

## Setting: Neo-Tokyo 2050
Built on ruins of Old Tokyo (destroyed by Akira in 2020). 30 years of rebuilding created gleaming facade over societal trauma. Olympic Stadium construction central plot point—building over literally and figuratively buried past.

## Society Structure
- **Government**: Corrupt, secretly continuing psychic experiments
- **Military**: Colonel's faction trying to prevent repeat disaster
- **Biker Gangs**: Youth rebelling against controlled society
- **Revolutionaries**: Kei's group fighting government oppression
- **Cult**: Lady Miyako's followers worshiping psychic transcendence

## Psychic Hierarchy
1. **Latent** (Most Humans): No powers, potential exists
2. **Awakened** (Kei, Early Tetsuo): Basic telekinesis/telepathy
3. **Espers** (Children): Powerful but controlled, aged prematurely
4. **Emergent** (Mid Tetsuo): Reality-bending abilities
5. **Transcendent** (Akira, Final Tetsuo): God-like, barely comprehensible

## The Akira Project
Government program to weaponize psychic children. Failure 30 years ago destroyed Tokyo. Never stopped—went underground. Tetsuo latest subject. Pattern: Power always exceeds control, destruction follows.

## Neo-Tokyo Geography
- **City Center**: Rebuilt, modern, expensive
- **Old Tokyo Ruins**: Forbidden zone, where Akira sleeps
- **Stadium Construction**: Symbol of denial, built over crater
- **Highway Networks**: Biker gang territory
- **Underground**: Revolution and cult base

## The Capsules (Party's Gang)
Led by Kaneda, rivals with Clowns gang. More family than criminals—protecting each other in hostile world. Tetsuo always insecure about needing protection. Powers give him independence he craved but corrupt him.

## Mutation Mechanics
Uncontrolled psychic power causes physical transformation:
- Stage 1: Minor changes (eye color, temperature)
- Stage 2: Visible mutations (extra limbs, flesh warping)
- Stage 3: Body horror (organs external, impossible anatomy)
- Stage 4: Transcendence or death (become energy or explode)

## The Espers' Prophecy
Three psychic children foresee two futures:
1. Tetsuo transcends peacefully (rare, requires friendship maintained)
2. Tetsuo destroys everything (most likely, power overwhelming)
Their guidance cryptic—can party interpret warnings correctly?

## Philosophical Framework
Power as metaphor for adolescence—suddenly having adult capabilities without wisdom to use them properly. Tetsuo represents every teen who felt powerless, suddenly given ultimate power. Explores: Can friendship survive power imbalance? Does power inevitably corrupt? Is destruction sometimes necessary for true growth?

## Ending Scenarios
1. **Friendship Victory**: Save Tetsuo, he controls powers, becomes protector
2. **Tragic Sacrifice**: Tetsuo dies/transcends saving city, heroes mourn
3. **Pyrrhic Stop**: Tetsuo stopped but city destroyed, hollow victory
4. **Apocalypse**: Tetsuo becomes next Akira, cycle continues, all fails

Each ending explores different aspect of power, friendship, and sacrifice.
