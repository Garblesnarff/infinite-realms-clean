# Neo-Tokyo Awakening
**"Power beyond comprehension. Control beyond reach."**

## Campaign Overview

Neo-Tokyo, rebuilt after its destruction by psychic children 30 years ago, sits on the edge of apocalypse. The party are members of the Capsules, a biker gang navigating gang wars, corrupt government, and the sudden emergence of psychic powers among the youth. When party member Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo awakens unstable psychic abilities after a motorcycle accident, everything changes.

The government's secret project—raising psychic children as living weapons—has created something beyond control. As Tetsuo's powers spiral into god-like proportions, the party must race against time to either save their friend or stop him from annihilating the city. Underneath lies the truth about Akira, the psychic so powerful he destroyed Old Tokyo, and whose dormant consciousness might be awakening again.

Powers beyond human comprehension. Friendship tested to destruction. A city built on denial of its trauma. And the question: Are we creating gods or monsters when we unlock the human mind's full potential?

### Arc 4: Transcendence (Sessions 16-20)

## Themes
- Friendship vs. Duty (must you kill your friend to save others?)
- Power Corrupting (how much power can person handle before losing humanity?)
- Trauma Cycles (society built on denial repeating mistakes)
- Adolescent Rage (teenage powerlessness transforming into destructive power)
- Transcendence vs. Destruction (is godhood evolution or madness?)

## Victory Conditions
**Optimal**: Save Tetsuo's humanity, prevent apocalypse, maintain friendship
**Standard**: Stop destruction, Tetsuo survives but changed, friendships strained
**Pyrrhic**: City destroyed, Tetsuo dead/transcended, party traumatized
**Defeat**: Tokyo annihilated, party dead, Tetsuo becomes new Akira

High-octane anime action meets body horror meets philosophical questions about power and humanity.
