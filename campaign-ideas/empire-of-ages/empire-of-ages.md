## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-30 sessions)

A three-act arc of development, expansion, and ultimate conquest.

*   **Act I — Dark Age to Feudal (Sessions 1-10):** The party establishes their first Town Center, gathers resources (food from farms, wood from forests, gold from mines), and trains basic military units (militia, archers, scouts). They face early threats from bandits and wild animals while exploring the map. First conflicts with rival civilizations begin as territory disputes. The party advances to Feudal Age, unlocking new buildings and units. They must choose economic focus: farming, trading, or raiding.
*   **Act II — Castle Age Conflicts (Sessions 11-20):** The party advances to Castle Age, building castles and training powerful units (knights, crossbowmen, siege weapons). Trade routes and alliances form with some civilizations while wars intensify with others. The party constructs Wonders—massive buildings granting bonuses and prestige. Rival civilizations field unique armies: Mongol cavalry hordes, British longbowmen, Frankish paladins. Major battles involve hundreds of units across vast battlefields. A coalition forms against the party's growing power.
*   **Act III — Imperial Domination (Sessions 21-30):** The party enters Imperial Age with trebuchets, gunpowder units, and massive armies. They face the final coalition of rival civilizations in apocalyptic battles. The party must choose victory path: military conquest (destroy all enemies), wonder victory (defend wonder for set time), or trade supremacy (accumulate massive wealth). The climax involves siege of the final enemy capital with hundreds of units, siege weapons, and heroes leading the charge. Epilogue shows the party's civilization entering a golden age of prosperity.
