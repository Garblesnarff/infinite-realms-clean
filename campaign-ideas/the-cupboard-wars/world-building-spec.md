# The Cupboard Wars - World Building Specification

## The Cupboard's Magic

**Function**: Portal that binds historical consciousness to toys
**Origin**: Created 1650s by scholar trying to preserve human experience
**Curse**: Consciousness trapped, forced to fight when activated
**Key**: Locks and unlocks; locking = transformation, unlocking = return

**Process**:
1. Toy placed in cupboard
2. Door locked with key
3. Historical soul drawn from afterlife/beyond
4. Soul bound to toy body
5. Toy emerges with full historical consciousness

## Historical Consciousnesses

Not random—cupboard draws souls with warrior experience:
- **Jesse McCoy**: Real gunslinger, died 1891, shootout
- **Sergeant Wilson**: Normandy veteran, died 1944, combat
- **Takeshi**: Samurai, died 1615, Osaka siege
- **Shaka**: Zulu warrior, died 1879, battle
- **Erik**: Viking raider, died 1066, Stamford Bridge

Each has:
- Full memories of their life
- Cultural context and values
- Skills and knowledge
- Historical grudges and loyalties
- Confusion about toy status

## The Cycle

**Pattern**: Cupboard has done this for 370 years
**Previous Incarnations**:
- 1650-1700: Wooden soldiers
- 1700-1800: Tin figures
- 1800-1900: Lead toys
- 1900-1950: Composition soldiers
- 1950-2000: Plastic army men
- 2000-2025: Modern action figures

Each era, same souls, different bodies, same wars.

## Cultural Conflicts

**Built-in Tensions**:
- Cowboy vs. Native American toys
- WW2 Allied vs. Axis figures
- Crusader knights vs. Saracen warriors
- Colonial vs. colonized forces
- Cultural misunderstandings

**Historical Accuracy**: Campaign addresses real history, real atrocities, real perspectives

## The Curator

**Nature**: First soul trapped in cupboard (the scholar himself)
**Form**: Manifest inside cupboard's interior space
**Role**: Mediator, record-keeper, prisoner
**Desire**: End the cycle, free all souls
**Knowledge**: Knows cupboard's full history, all previous wars
**Limitation**: Cannot act directly, only advise

## Death Mechanics

**Question**: What happens if toy "dies"?
**Theories**:
- Soul returns to afterlife (hopeful)
- Soul trapped in cupboard forever (horror)
- Soul disperses (oblivion)
- Soul rebounds to next toy (cycle)

**Truth**: Unknown until tested (campaign tension)

## Modern World Confusion

Historical figures face:
- Electricity (magic?)
- Internet (incomprehensible)
- Modern weapons (terrifying)
- Equal rights movements (shocking to some)
- Technology (advantage for adaptive minds)
- Language evolution (Old English vs. modern)

Smart ones adapt, learning modern tactics.

## Omari & Amara

**Omari** (12): Loves history, collects era-appropriate figures
**Amara** (10): Collected underrepresented warrior cultures
**Dynamic**: Sibling rivalry becomes proxy war
**Horror**: Don't know toys are ACTUALLY fighting
**Stakes**: Could hurt each other through toy violence

## Factions

**The Warriors**: Embrace eternal combat (Erik's Vikings, some others)
**The Pacifists**: Seek peace, end cycle (Takeshi leads eventually)
**The Confused**: Recent transformations, adapting (Jesse)
**The Scholar Faction**: Study cupboard, seek escape
**The Loyalists**: Loyal to child-commanders (dangerous)

## Victory Paths

**Destroy Cupboard**: Free souls, end cycle, but lose toy life
**Broker Peace**: All factions agree truce, maintain transformation
**Teach Children**: Make Omari/Amara understand, use cupboard ethically
**The Curator's Plan**: Complete specific ritual, free all souls
**Embrace It**: Accept eternal war (dark path)

## Historical Responsibility

Campaign must:
- Respect actual cultures and histories
- Address colonialism, war crimes, historical trauma
- Give non-European warriors equal depth and respect
- Show complexity of historical perspectives
- Not glorify violence
- Explore reconciliation
