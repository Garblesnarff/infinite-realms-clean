### **World-Building Specification Brief: Aldnoah Drive Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   Earth soldiers pilot mass-production mechs against Martian nobles' Aldnoah-powered superweapons. Each enemy is a puzzle boss requiring tactical analysis and weakness exploitation. The war is based on a false-flag assassination. The party must use ingenuity over power, expose the conspiracy, and decide between revenge, justice, or peace.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail discovery of Aldnoah Drive (ancient hypergate technology on Mars), allowing humanity to colonize.
*   Explain Vers Empire formation—Martian colonists discovered royal lineage activates Aldnoah, created feudal nobility.
*   Describe Heaven's Fall (15 years ago)—failed assassination of Martian princess led to moon's destruction and war. Ceasefire held until current invasion.
*   Outline class structure: Martian royalty (Aldnoah users) > Martian citizens > Terrans (Earth-born, considered inferior).

**3. Factions:**
*   **United Earth Forces** (Major - Player Faction): Defending against Martian invasion with inferior tech.
*   **Vers Empire** (Major - Antagonist): Martian feudal state, nobility pilots Kataphrakts.
*   **Orbital Knights** (Major - Enforcers): 37 noble families with unique Kataphrakts, serve Emperor.
*   **Peace Faction** (Minor): Princess Asseylum and allies seeking to end hostilities.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Princess Asseylum** (peace advocate), **Slaine Troyard** (tragic loyalist), **Count Saazbaum** (conspiracy leader), **Inaho Kaizuka** (tactical genius), **Edelrittuo** (loyal maid/spy).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Earth Cities** (ruins and refugee camps), **Landing Castles** (Martian fortresses), **Vers Orbital Fortresses**, **Princess's Ship** (mobile HQ), **Moon Ruins** (Heaven's Fall aftermath).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** Princess survives **THEN** she can broker peace, but hardliners attempt further assassinations.
*   **IF** conspiracy exposed **THEN** Vers Empire fractures, some nobles defect, civil war possible.
*   **IF** Slaine captures Asseylum **THEN** he usurps power, becomes final antagonist out of twisted love.
*   **IF** party captures Kataphrakt **THEN** they need Aldnoah activation (requires Asseylum's permission), becomes high-value target.

**7. Asymmetric Combat Mechanics:**
*   **Martian Advantages:** Unique powers, energy barriers, superior armor, flight.
*   **Earth Advantages:** Numbers, tactical planning, environmental exploitation, teamwork.
*   **Victory Strategy:** Observe enemy power → Deduce weakness → Execute plan → Exploit flaw.
*   Players cannot win through direct combat—must outthink, not overpower.

**8. Kataphrakt Weakness System:**
*   Every power has an exploitable flaw:
    *   **Barriers:** Can't block specific energy types or slow objects.
    *   **Gravity:** Requires mass—useless in vacuum or against plasma.
    *   **Phasing:** Must solidify to attack—strike during attack frames.
    *   **Duplication:** Copies share damage—hit all simultaneously.
*   Investigation reveals weaknesses through observation, captured data, or interrogation.

**9. Aldnoah Activation:**
*   Only Martian royalty can activate Aldnoah tech.
*   **Mechanic:** If Asseylum trusts the party, she can grant activation rights to captured Kataphrakts.
*   **Risk:** Mars sees this as treason—assassination attempts increase.
