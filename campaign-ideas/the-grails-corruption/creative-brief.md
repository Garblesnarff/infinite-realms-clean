# Creative Brief: The Grail's Corruption

## Art Style: Dark Urban Fantasy Epic

Modern Japanese city hiding ancient magical war. Heroic figures from legend brought to life in contemporary setting. Epic battles in urban environments.

### Core Principles:

*   **Modern Meets Legend:** Armored knights and ancient heroes fighting with cars and skyscrapers as backdrop.
*   **Epic Scale Combat:** Massive magical battles destroying city blocks.
*   **Dark Atmosphere:** Night battles, shadows, desperate struggles.
*   **Heroic Designs:** Legendary figures rendered in iconic, memorable ways.

**Visual Elements:** Summoning circles glowing with power. Legendary weapons (Excalibur, etc.) shining. Command seals (glowing tattoos on hand). Urban battlefields destroyed by epic combat. The corrupted Grail oozing black mud.

**Color Palette:** Dark urban nights (blacks, dark blues). Magical effects (bright golds, reds, blues depending on Servant). The Grail's corruption (sickly black, oozing darkness).

## Voice

Epic, dramatic, occasionally tragic. Like narrating legendary battles. Environmental sounds: magical energy crackling, swords clashing, Noble Phantasms unleashing, city destruction, the Grail whispering corruption.
