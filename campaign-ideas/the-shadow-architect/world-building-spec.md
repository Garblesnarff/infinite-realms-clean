**The Shadow Architect**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party members are eccentric adventurers who love playing mysterious masterminds but have no real conspiracy to fight. Reincarnated into a fantasy world, they start "pretending" to battle a made-up cult called the Cult of Diabolos, staging theatrical battles and recruiting followers with dramatic speeches. They discover with horror that the cult is REAL, their improvised warnings are accurate, and people believe they're genius strategists. Now they must maintain their facade while frantically staying ahead of a genuine ancient conspiracy they're accidentally unraveling.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Ancient War against Diabolos, when the hero "Shadow" and their companions sealed the demon lord 1000 years ago.
    *   Write the history of the Cult of Diabolos, who have manipulated kingdoms for centuries to prepare for their master's resurrection.
    *   Describe the possession curse that afflicts certain noble bloodlines, slowly transforming them into demonic vessels.
    *   Explain how the Cult infiltrated positions of power in the church, nobility, and merchant guilds across multiple kingdoms.
    *   Detail the prophecy of Shadow's return, which the cult fears and the party accidentally fulfills.
    *   Write about the creation of Shadow Garden 1000 years ago and how the party accidentally recreates it.
    *   Describe the three kingdoms of Midgar, Oriana, and the Lawless City, and the cult's influence in each.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party successfully recruits their first members with dramatic speeches.
    *   **THEN:** Alpha begins organizing Shadow Garden officially. The party receives regular intelligence reports they must interpret. Generate scenarios where they must maintain their facade while learning what's really happening.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers the Cult of Diabolos actually exists.
    *   **THEN:** Shift from comedy to darker tone. The party must balance genuine threat with maintaining their mysterious persona. Generate real cult operations they must stop.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully cures possession in Alpha.
    *   **THEN:** Shadow Garden's members become even more devoted. The cure becomes their primary mission. Generate more possessed individuals seeking help.
    *   **IF:** The party disrupts the Academy ritual.
    *   **THEN:** The cult begins taking Shadow Garden seriously as a threat (Suspicion +3). Princess Rose becomes interested in finding these vigilantes. Generate investigation scenarios.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers the Ancient Sanctuary.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to the original Shadow's memories and powers (or convince themselves they do). Cult recognizes the prophecy might be real. Generate escalated cult response.
    *   **IF:** Shadow Garden Influence reaches 8+.

    *   **IF:** The party's dramatic improvisation fails spectacularly in front of followers.
    *   **THEN:** They must recover their reputation. Loyal agents like Alpha cover for them, interpreting it as a "test." Generate scenarios where the party must prove themselves again.
    *   **IF:** Princess Rose discovers the party's dual identity.
    *   **THEN:** She's torn between her crush on their mysterious persona and her duty. Generate complex social scenarios and potential ally recruitment.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to reveal the truth to their followers.
    *   **THEN:** Mixed reactions—some agents feel betrayed, others love them more for being "normal" people who became heroes. Alpha probably insists it's part of the master plan. Generate factional splits and loyalty tests.
