### Core Premise
The Shattered Perspectives is a dimension where all viewpoints exist simultaneously. Objects, creatures, and locations can be seen from every angle at once - front, back, sides, top, bottom, and inside all visible in a single moment. Space is non-euclidean, bodies exist as geometric assemblages, and truth is the sum of all perspectives. The party arrives searching for the Prismatic Council, a group of seers who can see all possible futures. However, the Council has fragmented across perspectives, each member seeing only from one dimensional angle. To restore them, the party must learn to perceive reality cubistically - holding multiple contradictory viewpoints in mind simultaneously without going mad.

### Core Themes
- **Multiple Simultaneous Truths**: Every viewpoint is valid; reality is the sum of perspectives
- **Geometric Reduction**: Complex forms broken into fundamental shapes
- **Dimensional Simultaneity**: Past, present, future; inside, outside; all visible at once
- **Fragmented Identity**: The self viewed from all angles ceases to be singular
- **Impossible Navigation**: Movement through multi-perspective space

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Fractured Arrival (Sessions 1-5)**
The party enters the Shattered Perspectives dimension and immediately experiences perceptual breakdown - they can see themselves from all angles, including from behind their own eyes. With help from the Geometric Order (natives who've adapted to multi-perspective existence), they learn basic navigation. They discover the Prismatic Council has shattered across six perspectives: Point (zero-dimensional), Line (one-dimensional), Plane (two-dimensional), Volume (three-dimensional), Time (four-dimensional), and Probability (five-dimensional). Each fragment sees reality differently and believes their perspective is the only truth.

**Act 2: The Six Faces of Truth (Sessions 6-13)**
The party must visit each dimensional domain and understand its perspective. The Point Sage sees only position, no extension. The Line Walker perceives only direction. The Plane Dancer exists in flatland. The Volume Keeper understands solid space. The Time Weaver sees past-present-future as one. The Probability Spinner perceives all possible realities. Each fragment holds a key to reassembling the Council, but each insists their dimension is the complete truth. The party must hold all six perspectives simultaneously without fragmenting themselves.

**Act 3: The Assembling Mind (Sessions 14-16)**
Having gathered the perspectives, the party reaches the Crucible of Angles - the point where all dimensions intersect. They must perform the Ritual of Reunification, holding each Council member's perspective in mind while maintaining their own coherent identity. This risks permanent fragmentation, but success restores the Prismatic Council who can then help the party with their original quest. The final challenge is escaping the dimension while maintaining enough perspective-tolerance to navigate home.

**Act 4: The View From All Sides (Sessions 17-18)**
With the Council restored, they provide the party the multi-perspective insight they sought (prophecy, solution to home crisis, etc.). But the party has changed - they can no longer see reality from just one viewpoint. They must choose: remain in the Shattered Perspectives and fully embrace cubist existence, return home with fragmented perspective (powerful but disorienting), or undergo the Reduction ritual that will restore singular vision but erase all memory of other dimensions.

### Major NPCs

**The Facet Prime** (Geometric Order Leader)
- **Role**: Guide / Mentor / Geometric Philosopher
- **Appearance**: Humanoid assembled from geometric primitives - spheres, cubes, pyramids. Viewable from all angles simultaneously.
- **Personality**: Logical, multi-perspective thinker, comfortable with contradiction, teaches cubist navigation
- **Flaw/Secret**: Has been fragmented and reassembled so many times, they're no longer sure which perspective was their original

**The Point Sage** (Council Fragment - Dimension 0)
- **Role**: First Fragment / Zero-Dimensional Consciousness
- **Appearance**: A single point of brilliant light. No extension. Pure position without size.
- **Personality**: Exists in perfect stillness. Speaks of location as the only truth. All motion is illusion. Reality is where things are.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Lonely beyond measure. A point has no extension, cannot touch or be touched. Yearns for the connection higher dimensions provide.

**The Line Walker** (Council Fragment - Dimension 1)
- **Role**: Second Fragment / One-Dimensional Traveler
- **Appearance**: A line of shifting color. Has length but no width or depth. Moves only forward or backward along their axis.
- **Personality**: Sees reality as paths and directions. Believes all truth is about choosing which way to go. Purpose is movement.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Trapped on their line, cannot turn left or right. Desperately wants to understand width but can't conceive of it.

**The Plane Dancer** (Council Fragment - Dimension 2)
- **Role**: Third Fragment / Two-Dimensional Artist
- **Appearance**: A geometric shape (sometimes circle, sometimes polygon) existing in flatland. Visible only as silhouette from 3D perspective.
- **Personality**: Artistic, graceful, believes reality is about relationships between shapes. All truth is configuration.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Can see front and back simultaneously but not above or below. Terrified of the third dimension - incomprehensible depth.

**The Volume Keeper** (Council Fragment - Dimension 3)
- **Role**: Fourth Fragment / Spatial Guardian
- **Appearance**: Cubic humanoid visible from all angles at once. Interior and exterior simultaneously displayed. Organs as geometric forms.
- **Personality**: Believes three dimensions are complete truth. Solid space is reality. Scoffs at time as fourth dimension - time is just change in 3D space.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Arrogant about dimensionality. Refuses to accept time as dimension. This limits them.

**The Time Weaver** (Council Fragment - Dimension 4)
- **Role**: Fifth Fragment / Temporal Sage
- **Appearance**: Exists in past, present, and future simultaneously. Appears as child, adult, and elder overlapped in same space. Movements create temporal trails.
- **Personality**: Speaks of events that haven't happened yet in past tense. Sees causality as geometric structure in time. Sad because they know how everything ends.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Trapped seeing all time at once. Cannot experience surprise, novelty, or hope. Knows when they'll die.

**The Probability Spinner** (Council Fragment - Dimension 5)
- **Role**: Sixth Fragment / Quantum Oracle
- **Appearance**: Exists in superposition - multiple versions of themselves occupying same space, each representing different probability branch.
- **Personality**: Speaks in probabilities. "I am 73% certain this conversation is happening." Sees all possible timelines as geometric shapes.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Cannot make decisions. Every choice creates infinite branches. Paralyzed by infinite possibility.

**The Flattener** (Antagonist)
- **Role**: Dimensional Terrorist / Warning
- **Appearance**: A being who was crushed from 3D to 2D. Exists now as living geometric shape, but wrong - distorted, painful.
- **Personality**: Believes higher dimensions are curse. Seeks to flatten all existence to 2D where "true understanding" exists. Mad from trauma.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Wasn't flattened accidentally - chose dimensional reduction to escape complexity, went too far, now can't reverse.

### Key Locations

**The Faceted City**: Settlement where buildings show all sides at once. Navigation requires thinking in multiple perspectives simultaneously.

**The Point of Origin**: Where the Point Sage exists - a zero-dimensional location that is everywhere and nowhere. Pure position.

**The Infinite Corridor**: One-dimensional space where only forward/backward exists. The Line Walker's domain.

**The Flatland Gallery**: Two-dimensional realm where everything is shapes and silhouettes. The Plane Dancer's art studio.

**The Volume Vault**: Three-dimensional space displayed cubistically - all angles visible at once. Most "normal" but presented impossibly.

**The Temporal Tapestry**: Four-dimensional space where past, present, future exist as geographic locations. Time is direction like north/south.

**The Probability Tree**: Five-dimensional structure where all possible timelines branch visibly. Quantum reality as geometry.

**The Crucible of Angles**: Intersection point where all dimensions meet. Most dangerous location - perspective overload likely.

### Central Conflict
The party needs the Prismatic Council's multi-perspective insight, but the Council has fragmented across dimensions, each piece convinced their view is complete truth. To restore them, the party must learn to hold contradictory perspectives simultaneously without losing coherent identity - a process that risks permanent mental fragmentation.

### Unique Mechanics

**Coherence Points (CoP)**: Represents mental unity (starts 10, max 20, min 0). High = singular perspective, Low = multi-perspective understanding but fragmented mind.

**Perspective Checks**: Wisdom saves when viewing impossible geometries. Failure = lose Coherence, gain fragmentary perception.

**Multi-Angle Vision**: Can see objects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Low Coherence = advantage on finding hidden things but disadvantage on Perception (too much information).

**Dimensional Navigation**: Different dimensions require different movement rules. 1D = only forward/back, 2D = only cardinal directions, 3D = normal, 4D = time as direction, 5D = probability branching.

**Geometric Combat**: Enemies exist in multiple perspectives. Must target the correct angle/dimension to deal full damage.

**Fragmentation Risk**: At 0 Coherence, split into separate aspects (your front-view, side-view, top-view all become separate entities). Must be reassembled.

**Perspective Keys**: Collecting fragment perspectives grants abilities - see through walls (Point perspective), predict movement (Line), artistic insight (Plane), spatial understanding (Volume), temporal awareness (Time), probability sight (Probability).

### Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Party Caused the Fragmentation**: Their arrival shattered the Council across dimensions.
2. **A PC Is a Council Member**: One player is the seventh fragment - the sixth dimension (consciousness itself).
3. **The Flattener Is Helping**: Reduction is mercy - fewer dimensions = less pain.
4. **Reassembly Requires Sacrifice**: One PC must fragment to unify the Council.
5. **The Council Wants to Stay Fragmented**: Being whole means losing the clarity each dimension provides.
6. **Cubism Is Spreading**: The party's home world is beginning to see from multiple perspectives - is this infection or evolution?

### Victory Conditions

**Unified Council**: Successfully restore all fragments. Council provides multi-perspective insight. Party returns home with fragmented but powerful perception.

**Embrace Fragmentation**: Choose not to unify Council. Learn to exist in shattered perspective. Gain powers but lose singular identity.

**Dimensional Mastery**: Master all six perspectives personally, becoming living Prismatic Council. Stay in Shattered Perspectives as guides.

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Fragmentation**: All party members reach 0 Coherence. Split into geometric aspects that cannot find each other.

**Dimensional Collapse**: Fail the ritual. Crucible implodes, dimensions crash together, existence becomes single impossible point.

**The Flattener Wins**: All existence reduced to 2D. Reality becomes geometric flatland. All depth, time, probability flattened.

**Lost in Dimensions**: Party splits across dimensional boundaries. Each PC trapped in different dimension, unable to communicate or reunite.
