# World-Building Specification: The Shattered Perspectives

## 1. Core Concept
Cubist dimension where all viewpoints exist simultaneously. Objects visible from all angles at once. The Prismatic Council fragmented across six dimensions (0D through 5D) must be reassembled.

## 2. Lore & History
- **Origin**: Created when mathematician-mage attempted to visualize higher dimensions, accidentally made them real
- **The Council's Shattering**: Seven seers tried to see all futures, perspective overload split them across dimensions
- **The Geometric Order**: Natives who adapted by fragmenting their own consciousness across perspectives
- **Dimensional Hierarchy**: 0D (point) → 1D (line) → 2D (plane) → 3D (volume) → 4D (time) → 5D (probability)

## 3. Factions
- **The Geometric Order** (maintainers of multi-perspective existence)
- **The Prismatic Council Fragments** (six separated seers, each trapped in single dimension)
- **The Flatland Purists** (led by The Flattener, seek dimensional reduction)
- **The Perspective Refugees** (beings trapped between dimensions)

## 4. NPCs
- **Facet Prime**: Geometric Order leader, humanoid of assembled shapes
- **Point Sage**: 0D fragment, single point of consciousness
- **Line Walker**: 1D fragment, existence as pure direction
- **Plane Dancer**: 2D fragment, geometric shape in flatland
- **Volume Keeper**: 3D fragment, cubist human
- **Time Weaver**: 4D fragment, past/present/future overlapped
- **Probability Spinner**: 5D fragment, quantum superposition
- **The Flattener**: Antagonist seeking dimensional reduction

## 5. Locations
- **The Faceted City**: All buildings visible from all sides simultaneously
- **The Point of Origin**: 0D space, everywhere and nowhere
- **The Infinite Corridor**: 1D realm, only forward/back
- **The Flatland Gallery**: 2D artistic realm
- **The Volume Vault**: 3D space presented cubistically
- **The Temporal Tapestry**: 4D space, time as geography
- **The Probability Tree**: 5D structure, all timelines visible
- **The Crucible of Angles**: All dimensions intersect

## 6. Mechanics
- **Coherence Points**: Mental unity vs. multi-perspective understanding
- **Perspective Checks**: Wisdom saves against impossible geometries
- **Multi-Angle Vision**: See objects from all viewpoints simultaneously
- **Dimensional Navigation**: Different movement rules per dimension
- **Geometric Combat**: Target correct angle/dimension for full damage
- **Fragmentation**: At 0 Coherence, split into separate aspect-entities
- **Perspective Keys**: Each fragment grants dimensional perception ability

## 7. Causality Chains
- **IF** Coherence reaches 0 **THEN** fragment into multiple aspect-selves
- **IF** collect all six fragments **THEN** can attempt reunification ritual
- **IF** ritual succeeds **THEN** Council restored, multi-perspective sight granted
- **IF** ritual fails **THEN** dimensions collapse into single point
- **IF** side with Flattener **THEN** dimensional reduction, lose depth perception permanently
