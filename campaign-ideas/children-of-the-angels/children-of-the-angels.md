**Tone (keywords):** psychological horror, trauma, cosmic dread, bio-mechanical, parental abandonment, chosen burden, apocalypse
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of emotionally damaged teenagers who are the only ones capable of piloting the Evangelions—massive bio-mechanical constructs bonded to their souls.

As they fight, they uncover dark truths about the Evangelions, their own origins, and a conspiracy that may doom or transcend humanity itself.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Angels are not traditional monsters—each is a unique puzzle requiring specific strategies. Direct combat often fails; players must exploit weaknesses while managing their Evangelion's unstable nature.
*   **Investigation:** Players must decipher cryptic prophecies, investigate secretive organizations (SEELE, NERV), and uncover the truth about the Human Instrumentality Project.
*   **Consequences:** The campaign explores trauma, identity, the burden of being chosen, and whether individual existence matters more than collective unity. Mental health deteriorates with each battle.

---

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that descends from monster-fighting to existential horror to a choice about humanity's future.

*   **Act I — The First Angel (Sessions 1–4):** The party is recruited by NERV to pilot Evangelions against the Angels. They learn basic piloting, bond with their mechs, and face their first terrifying Angel. Each victory comes with psychological cost.
*   **Act II — The Pattern (Sessions 5–8):** More Angels attack, each stranger and deadlier than the last. The party discovers the Angels follow a pattern, predicted by the Dead Sea Scrolls. They also learn their Evangelions contain human souls—including souls of people they knew.
*   **Act III — The Descent (Sessions 9–11):** An Angel infiltrates NERV itself. Betrayals surface. The party discovers NERV's true goal: the Human Instrumentality Project—a plan to merge all human souls into one collective consciousness to eliminate suffering and loneliness.
*   **Act IV — The End of Evangelion (Sessions 12–15):** The final Angels trigger Third Impact. The party must choose: prevent Instrumentality and preserve individual identity despite suffering, or accept it and merge all souls into eternal unity. Their choice determines humanity's fate.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Angel Attack"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Deployment
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The Third Angel attacks the Last City. The military is helpless. The party—traumatized teenagers—is brought to NERV headquarters.
    *   Gendo's Offer: Commander Gendo Ikari offers them a choice: pilot the Evangelions or watch the city die. They have no real choice.
    *   First Synchronization: The party enters the Entry Plugs and synchronizes with their Evangelions for the first time—experiencing the bio-mech's pain and power.

**Escalation:** The Angel is defeated, but the party's Evangelions go berserk, requiring emergency shutdown. They've tasted power and horror.

### Session 2 — "Hedgehog's Dilemma"

*   **Focus:** Character Development / Training
*   **Key Events:**
    *   NERV Academy: The party begins living at NERV, attending school by day and training by night. They're isolated from normal society.
    *   The Other Pilots: They meet other pilots—Rei Ayanami (emotionless, mysterious), Asuka Soryu (competitive, damaged), and others. Rivalries and alliances form.
    *   Synchronization Training: The party learns that pilot-Evangelion synchronization depends on emotional openness, creating a painful dilemma—open yourself to connection, risk being hurt.

**Escalation:** The Fourth Angel attacks during a training exercise, forcing immediate deployment with incomplete preparation.

### Session 3 — "Rei / Asuka"

*   **Focus:** Tactical Combat / NPC Bonds
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Combined Operation: The party must work with Rei and Asuka to defeat an Angel that splits into multiple forms.
    *   Personality Clashes: Asuka's aggression conflicts with Rei's detachment. The party must mediate while fighting for their lives.
    *   Victory and Cost: They win, but one Evangelion sustains heavy damage, forcing its pilot to experience the bio-mech's agony.

**Escalation:** Misato reveals that Evangelions can only operate for 5 minutes without external power—an invisible countdown in every battle.

### Session 4 — "Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win"

*   **Focus:** Synchronization Challenge
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Seventh Angel: An Angel with immense AT Field (psychic barrier) that conventional attacks cannot penetrate.
    *   Perfect Synchronization: Two party members must synchronize their movements perfectly to execute a simultaneous strike at the Angel's core.
    *   The Dance: NERV choreographs a complex "dance" of combat moves. The pilots must trust each other completely, lowering their emotional barriers.

**Escalation:** Success creates a dangerous precedent—NERV begins viewing pilots as interchangeable parts in a machine.

### Session 5 — "Rei's Secret"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Mystery of Rei: The party notices Rei has no past, no family, and seems replaceable—they find evidence of multiple "Rei" clones in NERV's secret facility.
    *   Gendo's Plan: They discover Rei is a hybrid clone of an Angel and Gendo's deceased wife, Yui—created as a key component of the Instrumentality Project.
    *   Confrontation: Rei refuses to explain, stating "If I die, I'll simply be replaced." The party grapples with her lack of self-worth.

**Escalation:** An Angel attacks that specifically targets Rei, forcing the party to protect someone who doesn't value her own life.

### Session 6 — "Magma Diver"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Volcanic Angel: An embryonic Angel discovered in a volcano. NERV orders a capture mission to study it.
    *   Extreme Conditions: One Evangelion must descend into lava, wearing experimental heat armor. The pilot experiences sensory overload and hallucinogenic visions.
    *   Moral Choice: The Angel is helpless, not hostile. The party can capture it (following orders) or destroy it (mercy). NERV's reaction depends on their choice.

**Escalation:** Whatever they choose, they learn Angels may not be purely hostile—some seem confused, even frightened.

### Session 7 — "The Dead Sea Scrolls"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Prophecy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   SEELE's Shadow: The party discovers NERV is controlled by SEELE, a secret committee that possesses the Dead Sea Scrolls—ancient prophecies predicting the Angels' arrival.
    *   The Pattern: The Scrolls reveal exactly how many Angels will come and when. The party realizes they're not reacting to random attacks—they're following a script.
    *   Forbidden Knowledge: They learn the final Angel will trigger "Third Impact," an apocalypse that ends the world as they know it.

**Escalation:** NERV's psychiatrists notice the pilots' mental health declining. Mandatory therapy sessions become interrogations.

### Session 8 — "Asuka Strikes!"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   Asuka's Past: The party learns Asuka witnessed her mother's suicide after a failed Evangelion contact experiment drove her insane.
    *   Desperate Confidence: Asuka's aggression is revealed as a defense mechanism—she pilots to prove her worth and escape her trauma.
    *   Mental Contamination: During a battle, an Angel invades Asuka's mind, forcing her to relive her worst memories. The party must sever the connection before she breaks.

**Escalation:** Asuka's synchronization rate plummets after the mental invasion. She becomes a liability, fueling her self-hatred.

### Session 9 — "Infiltration"

    *   The Twelfth Angel: An Angel that appears human infiltrates NERV, taking the form of a trusted NPC (possibly a pilot).
    *   Paranoia: The party must identify the Angel while it manipulates them psychologically, whispering doubts and fears.
    *   The Core: They discover the Angel is headed for Terminal Dogma—NERV's deepest level, where something called "Lilith" is imprisoned.

**Escalation:** The party reaches Terminal Dogma and sees Lilith—a massive Angel crucified beneath NERV. They learn humanity itself descended from Lilith, making humans and Angels kin.

### Session 10 — "The Human Instrumentality Project"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Moral Dilemma
*   **Key Events:**
    *   SEELE's Goal: The party uncovers the truth—SEELE plans to merge all human souls using Lilith, the Evangelions, and the final Angel. This will eliminate suffering, death, and loneliness by destroying individuality.
    *   Gendo's Motive: Gendo seeks Instrumentality not to save humanity, but to reunite with Yui (whose soul is in Unit-01). He'll sacrifice the world for her.
    *   The Choice Looms: The party realizes they're not heroes—they're pawns in a cosmic ritual. But can they stop it?

**Escalation:** SEELE orders NERV's destruction to seize control of Instrumentality. The military attacks NERV headquarters.

### Session 11 — "Raid on NERV"

    *   War at Home: The party must defend NERV from military forces while Angels still threaten the city.
    *   Asuka's Last Stand: Asuka, her mind shattered, makes a desperate final sortie to prove her worth—and is brutally defeated by Angel-derived mass-production units.
    *   Rei's Decision: Rei, confronted with the truth of her existence, must choose whether to follow Gendo's plan or act independently for the first time.

**Escalation:** The final Angel—Kaworu, an Angel in human form—arrives and befriends the party before revealing his nature.

### Session 12 — "Kaworu"

*   **Focus:** Moral Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Angel of Free Will: Kaworu is an Angel who loves humanity and befriends the party. He's kind, empathetic, and the first person to truly understand their pain.
    *   The Terrible Truth: Kaworu reveals he must reach Lilith to trigger Third Impact—but he asks the party to kill him instead, granting them the choice to decide humanity's fate.
    *   The Execution: The party must kill the only person who understood them. The psychological weight is crushing.

**Escalation:** Kaworu's death delays but doesn't prevent Third Impact—it's already beginning.

### Session 13 — "The End of Evangelion (Part 1)"

*   **Focus:** Apocalypse / Despair
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Third Impact Begins: The boundary between souls dissolves. People begin merging into a collective consciousness—the Sea of LCL.
    *   Rei's Apotheosis: Rei merges with Lilith, becoming a god-like entity capable of deciding humanity's fate.
    *   The Party's Crisis: As their souls begin to dissolve, the party experiences visions of their traumas, regrets, and deepest fears—a psychological trial.

**Escalation:** Rei offers them a choice: accept Instrumentality (end suffering through unity) or reject it (preserve individuality despite pain).

### Session 14 — "I Need You"

*   **Focus:** Character Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Internal Battles: Each party member faces a personalized trial in the dissolving world—confronting their fears, traumas, and self-hatred.
    *   The Hedgehog's Answer: They must decide if connection is worth the risk of pain, if existence is worth suffering, if individuality is worth loneliness.
    *   Rei's Question: Rei, now merged with Lilith, asks them directly: "Do you wish to exist as separate beings, knowing you will suffer?"

**Escalation:** The party's collective answer determines the outcome—unanimous agreement is required.

### Session 15 — "One More Final: I Need You"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / New Beginning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   **If Instrumentality is Accepted:** The campaign ends with all souls merged into eternal peace. Individuality ceases. The party members exist as one collective consciousness, free from pain but also from growth. Bittersweet transcendence.
    *   **If Instrumentality is Rejected:** The souls separate. The world is devastated but alive. The party finds themselves on a beach of red water—the only survivors. They must rebuild humanity from nothing, carrying their traumas but also their hope.
    *   The Final Image: Two party members on the beach. One reaches out. The other hesitates—then takes their hand. "I need you." Humanity chooses to exist, together.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Last City (Tokyo-3):** A fortress-city designed to fight Angels, with buildings that retract underground and massive weapon systems. The population lives in constant fear.
2.  **NERV Headquarters:** A massive pyramid buried deep underground, housing the Evangelions, command center, and secret experiments. Terminal Dogma lies at its core.
3.  **The Geofront:** A massive spherical cavity beneath Tokyo-3, containing an artificial ecosystem and NERV's facilities. It's actually an unearthed Angel (Black Moon).
4.  **Terminal Dogma:** The deepest level of NERV, where Lilith is crucified to a cross. The source of humanity and the key to Instrumentality.
5.  **The Entry Plug:** The claustrophobic cockpit inside an Evangelion, filled with LCL fluid that oxygenates blood. Pilots experience sensory fusion with their mech here.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is the burden of choice in a predetermined apocalypse. The party is told they're humanity's only hope, but they're actually pawns in SEELE's Instrumentality Project. As they uncover the truth, they must decide whether individual existence—with all its suffering, loneliness, and pain—is preferable to collective unity where all suffering ends but so does the self.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Synchronization Rating**

*   Each pilot has a Synchronization Rating with their Evangelion (starts at 40%, max 100%).
*   **Higher Sync:** Better combat abilities, but the pilot feels the Evangelion's pain more intensely.
*   **Mental Contamination:** Traumatic events lower Sync Rate. Reaching 0% means ejection from the pilot program.

### 2. **AT Field (Absolute Terror Field)**

*   Both Evangelions and Angels project AT Fields—barriers formed from the ego's rejection of others.
*   **Neutralizing AT Fields:** Pilots must lower their emotional barriers to penetrate enemy AT Fields, making them psychologically vulnerable.

### 3. **Berserk Mode**

*   When a pilot's psyche is overwhelmed, their Evangelion can go berserk—becoming feral and hyper-violent.
*   **Player Control Lost:** The DM controls the Evangelion, which fights with terrifying power but no strategy, and attacks ally and enemy alike.

### 4. **Instrumentality Visions**

*   During Third Impact, each character experiences personalized psychological trials—visions of their fears, desires, and alternate realities.
*   **Narrative Choices:** Players roleplay through these trials, and their choices determine whether they accept or reject Instrumentality.

### 5. **The Hedgehog's Dilemma**

*   A social mechanic: characters can form deep bonds (lowering emotional barriers) for mechanical bonuses, but doing so also increases vulnerability to mental attacks and trauma.

---

## Themes

*   **The Burden of Being Chosen:** The party didn't ask to be special—their unique ability to pilot Evangelions is a curse, not a gift.
*   **Parental Abandonment:** Most pilots are abandoned or orphaned, seeking validation from authority figures who exploit them.
*   **Loneliness vs. Connection:** The Hedgehog's Dilemma—people want connection but fear the pain it brings.
*   **Individuality vs. Unity:** Is it better to exist separately and suffer, or merge into collective consciousness and lose the self?
*   **Apocalypse as Therapy:** Third Impact is framed as ending all human suffering—a seductive lie with terrible cost.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Prevent All Angels from Reaching Lilith:** Tactical victory, but doesn't address the Instrumentality conspiracy.
*   **Stop the Human Instrumentality Project:** Preserve individual humanity, but the world remains broken and the party remains traumatized.
*   **Accept Instrumentality:** All suffering ends, but so does individual existence. A form of victory through transcendence.
*   **Reject Instrumentality:** Choose to exist despite suffering. Rebuild the world with hope, connection, and the courage to face pain.

---

## DM Guidance

*   **Pacing:** Evangelion is about psychological horror, not constant action. Allow sessions of pure character development between Angel battles.
*   **Tone:** Maintain a sense of dread and inevitability. The party should feel they're struggling against fate itself.
*   **Respect Player Agency:** The Instrumentality choice should be genuinely difficult—present both options as valid without forcing a "correct" answer.
*   **Mental Health:** This campaign deals with depression, trauma, and suicide. Establish safety tools (X-Card, Lines & Veils) and check in with players regularly.
