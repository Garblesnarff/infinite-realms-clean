---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Color Code Conspiracy: Strangers in Blood
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Heist Thriller / Paranoid Survival / Traitor Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 5-7 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **7**
**Tone (keywords):** paranoid, violent, claustrophobic, betrayed, desperate
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are criminals recruited for a "simple" heist using color-coded aliases to protect their identities: Mr. Ruby, Ms. Emerald, Mr. Sapphire, and so on—strangers thrown together for one job. When the heist goes catastrophically wrong with law enforcement waiting in ambush, the surviving crew members retreat to a safehouse to figure out who betrayed them. Trapped together, bleeding, paranoid, and heavily armed, they must uncover the traitor among them while law enforcement closes in and old grudges surface. As accusations fly and guns are drawn, the campaign becomes a pressure cooker of violence, betrayal, and the desperate mathematics of survival when you can't trust anyone.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the breakdown of criminal cooperation when trust is destroyed. The central conflict is the paranoid search for a traitor among a group of armed strangers with no loyalty to each other, trapped together by circumstance and mutual suspicion. The pressure-cooker environment of the safehouse siege forces violent confrontations as each member tries to survive by identifying and eliminating the threat. The campaign asks: How do you find truth when everyone has reason to lie? What happens when paranoia becomes more dangerous than the actual traitor? And how much blood will be spilled before someone can prove innocence or guilt? The color-coded aliases that were meant to protect the crew become markers of violent, impersonal death.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Suspicion Web**
*   A visual network tracks which crew members suspect each other and why.
*   As evidence accumulates, connections strengthen or weaken, creating shifting alliances.
*   High mutual suspicion triggers violent confrontations and standoffs.

### 2. **The Traitor Protocol**
*   One player (selected secretly) is actually the traitor with hidden objectives and information.
*   The traitor must avoid detection while subtly sabotaging the crew's survival.
*   Alternatively, the campaign works with no actual traitor—paranoia alone destroys the crew.

### 3. **Standoff Mechanics**
*   When multiple armed characters distrust each other, the game enters "standoff mode."
*   Initiative and negotiation determine who shoots first, creating Mexican standoff tension.
*   Any violence triggers cascading gunfire that can kill multiple participants.

### 4. **The Siege Clock**
*   Law enforcement pressure increases over time, with deadline ultimatums and escalating tactics.
*   The crew must identify the traitor before time runs out or law enforcement forces a violent resolution.
*   Creates urgency that pushes paranoid characters toward hasty, violent decisions.
