# World-Building Specification Brief: Crystal Caverns Conspiracy

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**Crystal Caverns Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
* **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
* **Content:** The Prismatic Depths are the world's richest source of magic-infused crystals, controlled by three mining cartels locked in escalating conflict. When miners begin disappearing and strange crystal formations grow at impossible speeds, the party uncovers a conspiracy: someone is awakening the Crystal Wyrm, an ancient entity slumbering in the living crystal veins. As labor revolts, corporate espionage, and magical catastrophe converge, the party must navigate greed, exploitation, and the question of whether wealth is worth its human cost.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
* **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
* **Prompts:**
    * Detail the discovery of the Prismatic Depths 150 years ago and the crystal rush that followed.
    * Write the history of the three cartels: how they formed, divided territory, and evolved into current power structures.
    * Describe the Crystal Wyrm—what it is, how it fell into slumber, and its relationship with the crystal veins.
    * Explain the original pact between early miners and the Wyrm: sacrifices in exchange for rich deposits.
    * Detail the labor history: strikes, massacres, martyrs, and the gradual erosion of workers' rights.
    * Write about crystal magic: how different crystals have different properties and how they're used in magic.
    * Describe the debt-slavery system: company scrip, inflated prices, and the trap of perpetual poverty.
    * Explain crystal corruption: how exposure to living crystal gradually transforms people and merges their consciousness.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
* **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement trigger-based state changes.
* **Triggers:**
    * **IF:** Party exposes cartel cover-ups publicly.
    * **THEN:** Market panic, crystal prices fluctuate, cartels crack down violently, union gains support.
    * **IF:** Party sides with labor union.
    * **THEN:** Gain worker allies and information; become targets for cartel assassination; access to strike actions.
    * **IF:** Party sides with cartels.
    * **THEN:** Gain resources and legal backing; lose worker trust; become complicit in exploitation; harder moral choices.
    * **IF:** Party plays all sides against each other.
    * **THEN:** Maximum information and resources but no true allies; risk of exposure increases; everyone distrusts them.
    * **IF:** Major strike shuts down mining.
    * **THEN:** Crystal prices skyrocket, economic crisis, cartels hire violent strikebreakers, potential massacre.
    * **IF:** Party prevents violence between workers and cartels.
    * **THEN:** Negotiated settlement possible but requires compromises from all sides; gains trust of moderates.
    * **IF:** Terrorist attack on cartel facility.
    * **THEN:** Harsh crackdown on all workers, public sympathy shifts, union leadership split, escalation to violence.
    * **IF:** Crystal Wyrm awakening accelerates.
    * **THEN:** More miners transformed, crystal growth spreads faster, economic concerns become survival concerns.
    * **IF:** Party discovers original pact with Wyrm.
    * **THEN:** Moral complexity deepens; current sacrifices aren't new, just industrialized; options to renegotiate pact.
    * **IF:** One cartel is destroyed or collapses.
    * **THEN:** Power vacuum, remaining cartels fight for territory, workers may seize abandoned operations.
    * **IF:** Party successfully reforms system without revolution.
    * **THEN:** Gradual change; regulations implemented; workers gain rights; economy adjusts; Wyrm still threatens.
    * **IF:** Full revolution succeeds.
    * **THEN:** Workers control mines; cartels flee or executed; economic chaos short-term; long-term uncertain; Wyrm still threatens.
    * **IF:** Party negotiates with Crystal Wyrm.
    * **THEN:** Possible compromise: willing mergers only, or complete sealing, or managed awakening with evacuations.
    * **IF:** Economic collapse occurs.
    * **THEN:** Region descends into poverty; mass unemployment; starvation; chaos creates opportunity for Wyrm cult.

**7. Economic System**

    * **Common Quartz:** 1-5 gp, basic magic storage
    * **Resonance Crystals:** 50-100 gp, spell enhancement

    * **Heart Crystals:** Priceless, directly from Wyrm's body
* **Economic Factors:**
    * **Supply:** Affected by strikes, accidents, Wyrm awakening
    * **Demand:** Wizard colleges, military, luxury market
    * **Market Manipulation:** Cartels artificially restrict supply
    * **Labor Costs:** Kept artificially low through debt-slavery
* **Price Fluctuations:**
    * Crisis revelation: Prices crash
    * Supply disruption: Prices spike
    * New deposits: Prices drop
    * Military demand: Prices rise
* **Debt-Slavery Mechanics:**
    * Workers paid in company scrip (only good at company stores)
    * Stores charge inflated prices
    * Miners fall into debt
    * Debt inherited by families
    * Escape nearly impossible without intervention

**8. Crystal Corruption System**

    * **Stage 2:** Small crystal growths on skin, crystalline thinking becoming clearer, mathematical
    * **Stage 3:** Significant growths, can communicate with Wyrm, hear merged voices
    * **Stage 4:** Major transformation, body partially crystalline, consciousness merging begins
    * **Stage 5:** Almost fully merged, retain identity but share thoughts with collective
    * **Stage 6:** Complete merger, individual consciousness dissolved into Wyrm
* **Benefits by Stage:** Enhanced magical abilities, crystal attunement, shared knowledge, immunity to physical needs
* **Drawbacks by Stage:** Loss of organic flexibility, mental influence increases, social penalties, eventual loss of self
* **Treatment:** Distance from crystal, magical purification, costly but possible in early stages
