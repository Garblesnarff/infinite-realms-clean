# Creative Brief: The Doorway Between Worlds

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Whimsical Fantasy Realism (Studio Ghibli-inspired)

Inspired by the warm, inviting aesthetic of Studio Ghibli films, particularly *Spirited Away* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*. This style emphasizes the magical in the mundane, creating spaces that feel both cozy and wondrous. Food is rendered with loving detail, making every dish look delicious and inviting. Characters from wildly different backgrounds share space harmoniously, and the overall tone is one of gentle magic and heartfelt connection.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Warmth and Welcome:** Depict the restaurant as a safe, cozy haven where all beings can relax.
*   **Food as Art:** Render dishes with exquisite detail, making them look irresistibly delicious.
*   **Diverse Harmony:** Show vastly different beings (dragons, demons, elves, etc.) peacefully sharing space.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Whimsical, heartwarming, cozy, magical, welcoming, diverse, gentle, delicious.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of comfort and wonder. The world is magical but never threatening. Differences are celebrated, and connection is always possible over a good meal.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Soft, flowing lines with attention to detail in textures (wood grain, fabric, food). Characters have distinctive but gentle designs.
*   **Forms:** The restaurant has rounded, organic architecture. Food is rendered with realistic detail. Characters maintain their fantastical elements while fitting harmoniously together.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Ghibli-style illustration of a cozy restaurant interior with warm wooden furnishings, soft lighting, and detailed food on plates. A gold dragon sits at one table, a demon at another, all peacefully dining together."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, inviting colors—rich browns of wood, warm yellows of lamplight, the vibrant colors of food, with occasional magical flourishes.
*   **Food Colors:** Especially vibrant and appetizing—golden fried rice, deep red curry, chocolate parfaits with perfect shading.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a warm color palette of rich wooden browns, golden lamplight, and the vibrant colors of beautifully prepared dishes. Steam rises from hot food, catching the light."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Diverse fantastical beings rendered with gentle, expressive features. Even intimidating creatures (dragons, demons) have soft elements that make them approachable.
*   **Expressions:** Contentment, joy, quiet satisfaction—the universal expressions of enjoying good food.
*   **Clothing:** Varied styles reflecting different cultures and worlds, but all rendered with similar soft, detailed aesthetics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A black dragon with massive wings folded carefully, sitting at a restaurant table with a chocolate parfait. Her fierce features soften with delight as she takes a bite. The style is warm and gentle, inspired by Studio Ghibli."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The restaurant is cozy and organic, with warm wood, soft lighting from lamps and candles, and details that make it feel lived-in and loved.
*   **Atmosphere:** Welcoming and safe, a refuge from the outside world. Magic is present but subtle—glowing doors, floating serving trays, impossible pantry spaces.
*   **Details:** Worn but well-maintained furniture, plants in windows, shelves of exotic ingredients, steam rising from the kitchen.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a magical restaurant in Studio Ghibli style. Warm wood paneling, glowing lanterns, tables of various sizes accommodating different beings. Through a service window, a busy kitchen is visible. Magical doors line one wall, each unique and glowing softly."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, warm lighting from multiple sources—lamplight, candles, the kitchen's glow, magical door light.
*   **Shadows:** Gentle and never harsh, creating depth without darkness.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates intimacy and comfort, emphasizing the restaurant as a sanctuary.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm, soft lamplight that creates a cozy, intimate atmosphere. Light glows from the kitchen and from magical doors, casting gentle highlights on diners' faces."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often warm, inviting shots that make viewers want to enter the scene. Close-ups of food that look delicious, medium shots of diverse customers sharing space peacefully.
*   **Techniques:** Use depth and layers to show the restaurant's cozy complexity. Frame shots through doorways or around corners to create intimacy. Food shots should look magazine-worthy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warm, inviting composition showing the restaurant dining room from the kitchen's perspective. Various fantastical beings sit at tables, enjoying meals. In the foreground, a perfectly plated dish waits to be served. The style is detailed and warm, inspired by Studio Ghibli's food scenes."

## Voice

A gentle, warm female voice with a soothing, almost maternal quality. The tone is welcoming and kind, with a slight Japanese accent that adds authenticity and charm. Pacing is relaxed and unhurried, like a storyteller sharing a beloved tale over tea. The emotion is consistently warm and compassionate, occasionally building to quiet excitement when describing food or heartwarming moments. Audio quality is intimate and clear, as if speaking directly to a friend. Role: A grandmother sharing stories of a magical place, or the spirit of hospitality itself.
