**The Doorway Between Worlds**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players stumble upon Restaurant Nekoya, a mysterious eatery that appears ordinary six days a week—but every seventh day, magical doors appear across the multiverse, connecting the restaurant to dozens of different worlds and planes. Creatures from all realms—dragons, demons, elves, mind flayers, and stranger beings—arrive to enjoy exquisite food in neutral territory. When the restaurant's owner mysteriously disappears, the party must take over operations, serving as chefs, servers, and diplomats to maintain the peace and uncover the secret of why this restaurant exists and what happened to its creator.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

    *   Explain the nature of the Seventh Day and why doors only appear on that specific day.
