# The Endless War Cycle

*A Time Loop / Military campaign — Medium Campaign (10–14 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Endless War Cycle
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Loop / Military / Alien Invasion
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–14 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **12–13**
**Tone (keywords):** time-loop, learning-from-death, military-tactical, alien-invasion, iterative-improvement, groundhog-warfare
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The kingdom is under invasion by the Mimics—hive-mind alien constructs that seem to predict every military strategy. When the party dies in their first battle, one member wakes up the previous morning with perfect memory of the failed attack. They discover they're trapped in a time loop, resetting every time they die—but each loop teaches them more about the enemy and the battlefield. To break the cycle and win the war, they must die repeatedly, learning from each failure until they can execute the perfect battle plan.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Repeated Failure:** The party will die numerous times. Each death is a learning opportunity, not a punishment.
*   **Perfect Execution Required:** Victory requires synthesizing lessons from multiple loops into one flawless execution.
*   **Enemy Adaptation:** The Mimics learn too—strategies that work once may fail if overused.
*   **Time Pressure:** The loop has an end condition. If not broken, the war is lost permanently.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–14 sessions)

A unique arc structured around the time loop—each session may represent multiple loop iterations.

*   **Act I — Die, Learn, Repeat (Sessions 1–4):** The party experiences the loop for the first time, learns its rules, and begins gathering intelligence. Each death reveals new information about the invasion, the Mimics, and the source of the loop.
*   **Act II — Finding Omega (Sessions 5–9):** The party discovers the loop is connected to an Omega Mimic—the hive mind's core. They must locate it while surviving increasingly difficult battles, using knowledge from previous loops.
*   **Act III — Breaking the Loop (Sessions 10–14):** With enough information, the party plans the perfect battle—coordinating across multiple fronts, leveraging every lesson learned. The final loop must succeed because it's the last one.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The First Death"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / First Loop
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party are soldiers in the kingdom's army. The Mimics have landed and today is the big invasion counterattack.
    *   The Battle: A chaotic beach assault against overwhelming alien forces. Everything goes wrong.
    *   Total Party Kill: The party dies in various horrible ways. This feels like a campaign-ending failure.

**Escalation:** One party member wakes up the previous morning with perfect memory of the "future." The loop has begun.

### Session 2 — "Edge of Tomorrow"

*   **Focus:** Tutorial / Learning the Rules
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Revelation: The looping character convinces the party they're in a time loop. They demonstrate by predicting events.
    *   The Test: The party tries to change events. Small changes work, but the Mimics still overwhelm them.
    *   Death and Reset: They die again, gaining more information about enemy positions and tactics.

**Escalation:** The party realizes the Mimics are also learning—using tactics that counter strategies from "previous" attempts.

### Session 3 — "Training Montage"

*   **Focus:** Intelligence Gathering / Multiple Short Loops
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Rapid Iterations: The session features multiple short loops, each testing different approaches.
    *   Mapping the Battlefield: Each loop reveals more about terrain, enemy positions, hidden dangers.
    *   The Anomaly: In one loop, they notice an unusual Mimic—larger, different color. When killed, the loop doesn't reset.

**Escalation:** Killing the wrong Mimic broke the loop connection. They're now in "true" time—if they die here, it's permanent.

### Session 4 — "The Omega Theory"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Research
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Seeking Answers: With the loop temporarily broken, they must find information about the Mimics quickly.
    *   The Scientist: They meet a researcher studying Mimic biology who explains the theory: an Omega Mimic controls the hive and can reset time.
    *   Reacquiring the Loop: The party must get the "time blood" back by dying in a specific way that reconnects them to the Omega.

**Escalation:** They deliberately die to restart the loop—a disturbing choice that shows how war changes people.

### Session 5 — "Finding Omega"

*   **Focus:** Investigation Loops / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Hunt: Across multiple loops, the party searches for the Omega Mimic's location.
    *   False Leads: Several loops end in chasing dead ends or traps.
    *   The Vision: After enough deaths, the loop-connected character begins having visions showing the Omega's general location.

**Escalation:** The visions reveal the Omega is in the capital city—the invasion is a distraction. The real target is the kingdom's heart.

### Session 6 — "Changing the Battle"

*   **Focus:** Tactical Improvement / Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   New Strategy: Using loop knowledge, the party executes improved beach assault tactics.
    *   Partial Success: They survive longer, push further inland, but still ultimately fail.
    *   Key NPCs: The party befriends key soldiers and officers in each loop, learning their capabilities.

**Escalation:** An NPC they've befriended dies heroically. In the next loop, the party knows them well but they don't recognize the party—the emotional weight of the loop.

### Session 7 — "The Impossible Shot"

*   **Focus:** Skill Mastery / Repeated Practice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Training Loops: The party uses loops to practice impossible techniques—perfect timing, incredible feats.
    *   The Sequence: They craft a complex action sequence that requires perfect execution from all members.
    *   The Trial Run: They execute the sequence successfully, opening a new path toward the Omega.

**Escalation:** The Omega becomes aware of the loop abuse and sends special hunters through time to kill the loop-connected party member.

### Session 8 — "The Hunter"

*   **Focus:** Boss Battle / Cat and Mouse
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Being Hunted: An Alpha Mimic that also experiences the loops hunts the party.
    *   Loop Warfare: Both sides reset, trying different strategies against each other.
    *   Breaking the Hunter: The party must defeat the Alpha permanently across multiple loop attempts.

**Escalation:** Defeating the Alpha doesn't reset the loop—it happens in "real" time. They're close to the Omega now.

### Session 9 — "Into the City"

*   **Focus:** Infiltration / Time Limit
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Capital: The party must reach the capital before the Omega completes its true mission.
    *   Urban Warfare: Fighting through city streets filled with Mimics, civilians, and chaos.
    *   The Reveal: They discover what the Omega is really doing—preparing to spread Mimic eggs that will consume the kingdom.

**Escalation:** This loop has a hard time limit. If they don't stop the Omega in this iteration, it completes its mission and the loop won't save them.

### Session 10 — "The Perfect Battle"

*   **Focus:** Coordination / Multiple Fronts
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Master Plan: Using knowledge from dozens of loops, the party coordinates multiple teams for simultaneous objectives.
    *   Communication: They can't explain how they know things, but they issue perfect orders based on loop knowledge.
    *   Orchestrated Victory: Like conducting a symphony, they coordinate actions across the battlefield with perfect timing.

**Escalation:** Everything goes according to plan—until one element the party never encountered appears. The Omega has one final defense.

### Session 11 — "The Omega"

*   **Focus:** Climax / Boss Battle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Face to Face: The party confronts the Omega Mimic in its lair beneath the capital.
    *   Hive Mind Horror: The Omega shows memories of all previous loops—it remembers everything too.
    *   The Final Battle: A desperate fight where death means permanent failure. All loop knowledge must be used perfectly.

**Escalation:** The Omega tries to loop trap them—if it dies, it might restart taking them with it, creating an infinite combat loop.

### Session 12 — "Breaking the Loop"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Sacrifice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Solution: To break the loop permanently, the loop-connected party member must die permanently as the Omega dies.
    *   The Choice: Either someone sacrifices their loop connection (and possibly their life) or the loop continues forever.
    *   Victory: The Omega falls. The loop breaks. Time moves forward for the first time in subjective weeks.

**Escalation:** The world moved on while they were looping. Only one day passed, but they've lived weeks or months.

### Session 13-14 — "After the Loop" (Optional Epilogue)

*   **Focus:** Aftermath / New Threat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   War Continues: The invasion is stopped but the war continues against remaining Mimic forces.
    *   Integration: The party must reintegrate with a world that doesn't know what they experienced.
    *   The Warning: Evidence suggests the Mimics were scouts. A larger force is coming.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Beach Landing:** Where most loops begin and end—the site of the initial failed assault.
2.  **The Base Camp:** The military staging ground where the party wakes each loop reset.
3.  **The Battlefield:** Varied terrain between beach and capital—forests, villages, fortifications.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict explores how repeated failure teaches success, the cost of knowledge bought through death, and whether free will exists when you can see the future. It asks: what would you sacrifice to save the world? And how many times can you die before you lose yourself?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Time Loop**

*   When the party dies, they reset to morning of the invasion day with memories intact.
*   **Mechanics:** Track which party member(s) have loop connection. They retain everything; others have vague déjà vu unless convinced.

### 2. **Loop Knowledge**

*   Information learned in previous loops can be used in current ones.
*   **Mechanics:** Keep a "loop journal" tracking enemy positions, NPC names, battlefield hazards, timing of events. This becomes the party's most valuable resource.

### 3. **Iteration Counter**

*   Track how many loops have occurred. Each loop grants cumulative bonuses to certain checks as the party's muscle memory improves.
*   **Progression:** Start at +0, gain +1 per loop to repeated actions (max +5). This represents practiced perfection.

### 4. **The Perfect Sequence**

*   The party can plan action sequences that require perfect timing across multiple characters.
*   **Mechanics:** If properly planned using loop knowledge, allow sequences that would normally be impossible—coordinated actions with split-second timing.

### 5. **Permanent Consequences**

*   Some loops result in "permanent" time where deaths are real. The party must recognize these critical moments.
*   **Tension:** After killing certain Mimics or at story milestones, the next death is final—no reset.
