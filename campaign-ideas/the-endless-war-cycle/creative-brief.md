# Creative Brief: The Endless War Cycle

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Military Sci-Fantasy (Edge of Tomorrow meets War Campaign)

Inspired by military science fiction and the visual language of time loops, this aesthetic combines gritty war realism with otherworldly alien design and the surreal repetition of experiencing the same battle repeatedly. It's about the weight of war and the disorientation of temporal displacement.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Repetition with Variation:** Show the same scenes differently—from confident morning to exhausted repeat to battle-hardened final attempt.
*   **War Weariness:** Characters should show progressive mental and physical toll across loops.
*   **Alien Otherness:** The Mimics should look utterly alien—non-humanoid, writhing, incomprehensible biology.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Time-loop, learning-from-death, military-tactical, alien-invasion, iterative-improvement, war-weariness, surreal-repetition.
*   **Feeling:** The exhaustion of dying repeatedly. The determination of soldiers who've fought the same battle a hundred times. The alien horror of the Mimics.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Gritty realism for military elements, organic and flowing for Mimics. Use visual repetition—same poses or compositions shown in different emotional states.
*   **Textures:** War-torn battlefield, alien biotech, worn military equipment showing use across loops, mud and blood.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gritty digital painting showing a soldier in the same pose in three panels: Left—alert and ready on first loop. Center—exhausted but determined after dozens. Right—battle-hardened and precise on final attempt. Same scene, different weight."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted military colors (olive, gray, brown) contrasted with the unnatural colors of alien Mimics (bioluminescent blues, toxic greens, organic reds).
*   **Progression:** Early loops have more color and hope. Later loops are more desaturated and grim.
*   **Lighting Influence:** The same beach always has the same lighting, creating eerie familiarity. Small changes in weather or time create disorientation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered in muted military colors of olive and gray under overcast morning light. The alien Mimics provide the only bright colors—unnatural bioluminescent blue and toxic green of their writhing forms. The beach sand is stained with blood that looks fresh but might be from a dozen loops ago."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical military gear showing progressive wear. Characters' faces show mental toll—thousand-yard stare, dark circles under eyes.
*   **The Mimics:** Non-humanoid alien constructs, all tentacles and segmented plates, moving in ways that defy physics.
*   **Expression:** Early loops: fear and adrenaline. Later loops: exhaustion, grim determination, the weight of knowledge bought through death.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A soldier who's died fifty times, standing on the same beach for the fifty-first time. Their equipment is pristine (it reset with the loop) but their eyes show weeks of subjective trauma. They hold their weapon with the casual expertise of endless repetition."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The beach landing zone, seen repeatedly from different angles and outcomes. Military staging areas. Urban combat in the capital.
*   **Atmosphere:** Familiar to the point of surrealism. The party knows every rock, every vehicle, every doomed soldier by name.
*   **Details:** Wreckage of failed attempts that isn't there next loop, blood stains that vanish with reset, the same NPCs dying in different ways.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The beach assault zone seen for the hundredth time. Every detail is familiar—the landing craft positions, the Mimic nests, the terrain. But this time, subtle changes from perfect loop knowledge: explosives placed precisely, soldiers positioned optimally, the weight of practiced perfection."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Consistent morning light for the loop's start point, creating eerie familiarity. Combat lighting is chaotic—explosions, alien energy weapons, smoke.
*   **Shadows:** Used to show the passage of subjective time—characters who look like they're standing in shadows even in full light, carrying darkness with them.
*   **Purpose:** Use consistent lighting to emphasize repetition, dramatic lighting for key moments that break the pattern.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the same gray morning light that begins every loop. The familiarity is oppressive. In the background, an explosion illuminates Mimics in alien blue-green light—the only variation in an otherwise perfectly repeating scene."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use repeated compositions to show iteration—the same shot but with different outcomes. Split screens showing multiple loop attempts. Visual motifs that repeat.
*   **Techniques:** Time-lapse style composites showing the same moment across loops, battle maps overlaid with knowledge from previous attempts, characters frozen in practiced poses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composite image showing the same battlefield moment across five loops: soldiers advancing in slightly different formations, different outcomes visible in the background, arrows and notes overlaid showing tactical knowledge gained from each failure. The final panel shows the perfect execution."

## Voice

A weary, determined voice—male or female, raspy from shouting orders and screaming through deaths. Military precision in speech but with an edge of seen-too-much trauma. Pacing varies: clipped and efficient during briefings, slower and haunted during reflective moments. Emotion is controlled exhaustion—they've died so many times that death lost its fear, replaced by grim determination. Audio quality includes battle sounds that loop: the same explosions, the same screams, the subtle variations that signal which iteration this is. Role: A soldier briefing their team for the hundredth time, trying to convince them this time will be different.
