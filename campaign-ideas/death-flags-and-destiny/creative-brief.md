# Creative Brief: Death Flags & Destiny

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Romantic Fantasy with Meta-Narrative Elements

Inspired by otome game aesthetics, shoujo manga art, visual novel interfaces, and anime like *My Next Life as a Villainess*, *The World God Only Knows*, and *Re:Zero*. This style balances gorgeous romantic fantasy with self-aware meta-narrative elements, creating a world that's beautiful, slightly exaggerated, and openly acknowledges its own storybook nature.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Beauty and Romance**: Everything should be aesthetically pleasing, even dramatic moments. Soft lighting, flowing clothing, expressive emotions.
*   **Visual Novel Elements**: Incorporate UI elements from romance games—floating hearts, relationship meters, dialogue boxes, choice options.
*   **Expressive Characters**: Emotions are heightened and visible. Comedic reactions are exaggerated. Romantic moments are gorgeously rendered.
*   **Meta-Awareness**: Include visual representations of narrative mechanics—glowing script text, fate threads, story branches.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Romantic, comedic, self-aware, whimsical, dramatic (but not dark), storybook aesthetic, otome game, visual novel, fate and destiny, light-hearted with heart.
*   **Feeling:** The joy of subverting expectations, the comedy of dramatic irony, the warmth of unexpected friendships, and the satisfaction of earning a happy ending.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, elegant linework inspired by shoujo manga. Characters have slightly idealized proportions emphasizing beauty and expressiveness.
*   **Form:** Flowing clothing with detailed fabric. Emphasis on hair movement (wind-blown dramatically). Eyes are large and expressive, showing emotions clearly.
*   **Chibi Moments**: During particularly comedic scenes, characters shift to chibi/super-deformed style for exaggerated reactions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A beautifully detailed illustration in shoujo manga style with clean, elegant linework. The character has large, expressive eyes reflecting their emotional state, flowing noble attire with detailed embroidery, and hair that moves with dramatic elegance..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Soft, romantic pastels with vibrant accent colors. Each character has a signature color scheme.
*   **Academy Settings**: Warm ambers, scholarly browns, rich burgundies, ivory whites
*   **Garden Scenes**: Soft pinks, lavender purples, rose reds, emerald greens
*   **Ballroom**: Glittering golds, crystalline whites, deep blues, champagne yellows
*   **Narrative Space**: Ethereal whites and golds with rainbow prismatic effects
*   **UI Elements**: Game interface colors—pink hearts for romance, red for danger/death flags, green for positive events, blue for information
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a soft, romantic color palette dominated by pastel pinks and lavenders. The garden setting features blooming roses in coral and cream. Golden afternoon sunlight creates a warm, dreamy atmosphere. The character's signature color—royal blue—appears in their outfit and the floating UI hearts around them..."

**4. Character & Creature Design:**
*   **Party Members**: Beautiful but distinctive villainous designs that gradually soften. Starts with haughty expressions, elaborate villain fashion, intimidating poses. Evolves to show genuine kindness while retaining visual flair.
*   **Protagonist Characters**: Classic romance game archetypes—the pure-hearted prince, the intellectual beauty, the gallant knight, the mysterious brooding type.
*   **Fashion**: Fantasy Victorian/Rococo inspired. Elaborate ball gowns, noble military uniforms, academy uniforms with personalized touches, flowing capes.
*   **Expressions**: Highly expressive anime-style faces. Comedy requires exaggerated reactions (comically wide eyes, dramatic sparkles, sweat drops). Romance requires soft, blushing, detailed emotional expressions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A noble academy student in elegant villain attire—an elaborate black and crimson dress with silver embroidery and a dramatic high collar. Their expression is a comedic mix of panic and forced smile as they try to act kind instead of villainous. Sweat drops and a visible panicked internal monologue in a speech bubble. Floating heart meters show their relationships..."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Academy**: Grand European-inspired architecture with magical flourishes. Tall windows, marble halls, enchanted portraits, floating books.
*   **Gardens**: Meticulously maintained with romantic spots—arbors draped in roses, marble fountains, winding paths through flower beds, perfect picnic locations.
*   **Ballroom**: Opulent and sparkling. Crystal chandeliers, polished marble floors reflecting lights, grand staircases perfect for dramatic entrances.
*   **Meta Spaces**: When narrative magic is visible, the world takes on visual novel aesthetics—dialogue boxes appear, choice options float, background fades to pure white with character spotlight.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The academy's grand library—a three-story space with spiral staircases, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, floating magical tomes, and reading areas with comfortable chairs. Large arched windows let in golden afternoon light. In the foreground, a visual novel-style dialogue box shows character speech. Floating hearts indicate this is a romance scene location..."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style**: Soft, flattering lighting that emphasizes beauty. Minimal harsh shadows except for comedic effect.
*   **Romance Scenes**: Warm golden hour lighting, soft focus backgrounds, gentle highlights on faces, sparkles and light particles in the air.
*   **Comedy Scenes**: Bright, clear lighting. Sometimes stark white backgrounds for reaction shots. Dramatic spotlight for over-the-top moments.
*   **Dramatic Scenes**: Longer shadows, more contrast, but still maintaining beauty. Backlit hair, rim lighting on faces.
*   **Meta Moments**: The Narrative Space glows with ethereal white-gold light. Glowing text casts colorful illumination.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by soft, romantic sunset light filtering through rose-covered garden arbors. The lighting is warm and flattering, creating gentle shadows and highlighting the characters' faces with golden glow. Sparkles of light particles drift through the air like magic. The background is slightly soft-focused to emphasize the character interaction in the foreground..."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Visual Novel Framing**: Characters often centered or in three-quarter view as if in a visual novel. Space for dialogue boxes at bottom.
*   **Romantic Moments**: Classic shoujo manga compositions—flowers in foreground, soft-focused backgrounds, characters in intimate spacing, eye-level or slightly low-angle.
*   **Comedy**: Exaggerated angles, chibi characters, multiple reaction panels showing different emotions.
*   **Dramatic Reveals**: Symmetrical compositions, spotlight effects, emphasis on revelation moments.
*   **Group Scenes**: Academy photos, ball dancing, social gatherings—show character relationships through positioning and body language.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A visual novel-style composition with the character in three-quarter view, centered in the frame. Behind them, the academy garden is visible but slightly blurred. At the top, a name plate shows 'Lady Seraphina Rosewood.' At the bottom, a dialogue box contains her speech. Floating around her are pink hearts showing +2 relationship increase. Rose petals drift through the scene..."

**8. UI & Meta-Narrative Elements:**
*   **Relationship Hearts**: Floating hearts or heart meters showing relationship values. Pink for romance, gold for friendship, gray for neutral, red outlined for death flags.
*   **Dialogue Boxes**: Visual novel style text boxes with character names and portraits.
*   **Choice Options**: Floating UI showing multiple choice options with different colored borders (gold for safe, red for death flag risk).
*   **Glowing Script**: When fate magic is active, actual game script text appears in glowing letters describing what "should" happen.
*   **Stat Displays**: Character relationship stats visible as semi-transparent UI overlays.
*   **Death Flag Warnings**: When triggering death flags, ominous red warning text appears.

## Music & Audio Direction

### Theme: "Rewriting the Love Story"
*   **Instrumentation**: Light orchestra with emphasis on strings (violin, cello), piano, harp, woodwinds. Occasional music box for whimsical moments.
*   **Leitmotifs**: Each major NPC has a musical theme. Party members have villain themes that gradually incorporate heroic elements.

### Specific Track Moods:

**Academy Life**: Light, whimsical orchestral. Pizzicato strings, cheerful woodwinds, gentle piano. Conveys daily school life and comedy.

**Romance Themes**: Soft piano and strings. Each romance option has a variation—Prince Cedric (regal, warm), Seraphina (intellectual, mysterious), Marcus (heroic, steadfast).

**Comedy Moments**: Playful, bouncy music with unexpected instruments (kazoo, slide whistle, xylophone). Fast-paced for chase scenes or panic.

**Death Flag Warning**: Sudden ominous shift. Minor keys, unsettling strings, clock ticking sounds. Creates tension.

**The Grand Ball**: Elegant waltz music. Full orchestra. Romantic and grand. Builds to crescendo during dramatic moments.

**Narrative Space**: Ethereal, otherworldly. Choir, strings, electronic shimmer. Represents the meta-narrative layer.

**Boss Battle** (Master of Fate): Dramatic orchestral with choir. Classical villain music with narrative-breaking elements—record scratches, game-over sounds, genre shifts.

**Happy Ending Theme**: Triumphant, warm, emotionally satisfying. All character themes weave together harmoniously. Resolution and joy.

## Voice Direction

### Party Members (Villains)
Voices that can convey both haughty villainy (their scripted role) and genuine kindness (their true selves). The contrast should be comedic and endearing.

### Prince Cedric
Warm, earnest tenor voice. Speaks with genuine kindness and slight naivety. Audio quality: clear and pleasant. Role: The protagonist everyone expects to defeat the party but becomes their friend.

Confident, sharp soprano. Speaks with calculated charm hiding ruthless ambition. Can be convinced to genuine emotion. Audio quality: crisp and commanding. Role: The other villain who might become an ally.

### Headmaster Wordwright
Smooth, charismatic baritone. Hides menace beneath scholarly charm. When revealed, voice gains echoing quality suggesting narrative manipulation. Audio quality: warm turning unsettling. Role: The secret villain reshaping reality.

## Visual Effects for Key Moments

### Death Flag Activation
The screen tints red. Glowing red text appears reading "DEATH FLAG ACTIVATED." Reality crystallizes around the character as narrative compulsion takes hold. Their eyes briefly glow as fate tries to control them.

### Relationship Level Up
Hearts float up from character interactions. Musical chime plays. A relationship meter becomes visible briefly showing the increase. Sparkles and flower petals manifest.

### The Narrative Space
Reality fades to pure white. Glowing text describing events appears and scrolls. Story route paths appear as branching lines of light. Relationship meters float visibly. Choice options appear as glowing selections. Characters appear spotlit.

### Off-Script Deviation
When characters deliberately break the script, the glowing narrative text glitches and rewrites itself. Reality shimmers. Brief rainbow prismatic effect. Liberation and uncertainty.

### The Grand Ball Chaos
All relationship meters visible simultaneously. Multiple death flags trigger in sequence. Glowing script appears everywhere trying to force events. Reality itself seems to strain between the scripted path and the party's choices.

### Destroying the Tome
The Tome shatters in slow motion. Each page explodes into rainbow light. All glowing script throughout the world fades. Relationship meters become invisible—no longer quantified, but real. Freedom and uncertainty as fate releases its hold.
