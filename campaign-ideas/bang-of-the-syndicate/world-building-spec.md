# World-Building Specification Brief: Bang of the Syndicate

**Core Concept:** Players are former Red Dragon Syndicate members who fled after Vicious staged a bloody coup. Now marked as traitors, they try to build new lives while the syndicate—and Vicious himself—hunts them. Julia, the woman caught between them, becomes the catalyst for final confrontation. The campaign is crime noir tragedy—brotherhood betrayed, love lost, and the impossibility of escaping your past.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Red Dragon Syndicate's history and structure—five elders, territorial control across Mars.
*   The coup that elevated Vicious—how he massacred the elders in one night.
*   Julia's impossible choice—betray her love or die at Vicious's hands.
*   The code of the syndicate—"once you're in, the only way out is death."

**Factions:**
*   **Red Dragon Syndicate:** Mars-based crime organization, now ruled by Vicious with absolute brutality.
*   **The Five Elders (Dead):** Former syndicate leaders, traditionalists, killed by Vicious.
*   **Vicious's Inner Circle:** The Van, Shin (secretly loyal to party), elite assassins.
*   **The Party:** Former syndicate members, now bounty hunters, carrying tremendous guilt.

**Locations:**
*   **Mars Syndicata District:** Neon-lit criminal underworld, jazz clubs as front operations.
*   **The Cathedral:** Abandoned church, Vicious's headquarters, stained glass and blood.
*   **Callisto Station:** Frozen Jupiter moon, isolated criminal haven.
*   **The Bebop:** Party's converted fishing vessel, home and refuge.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party doesn't confront Vicious, THEN he systematically murders everyone they ever cared about.
*   IF Julia chooses the party member over Vicious, THEN Vicious orders her death immediately.
*   IF Vicious survives, THEN the syndicate becomes even more brutal and expansionist.
*   IF the party kills Vicious, THEN they become legends—but lose everything that mattered.
