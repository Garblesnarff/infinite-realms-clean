## Key Locations

1.  **Mars Syndicata District:** Neon-lit underworld, jazz clubs hiding criminal empires, where the syndicate rules.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **brotherhood versus ambition**. Vicious chose power; the party chose freedom. But Julia—the woman they both loved—is the catalyst. The campaign explores whether violence begets violence, whether love can survive in the underworld, and whether you can ever escape your past. The ending is bittersweet: victory costs everything.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Weight of the Past**
*   Each character has a "Syndicate History" track measuring unresolved guilt.
*   **Breaking Point:** High guilt causes flashbacks that impose disadvantage during crucial moments.

### 2. **Noir Investigation**
*   Tracking syndicate movements requires underworld contacts, bribes, and careful detective work.

### 3. **Duel Mechanics**
*   Boss fights with Vicious use cinematic duel rules—parrying, ripostes, and dramatic declarations.

### 4. **The Blue Rose**
*   Vicious leaves blue roses as warnings. Finding one triggers ambushes or assassination attempts.

### 5. **Bang**
*   When facing certain death, a character can declare "Bang" and make a final stand, dealing massive damage before falling.
