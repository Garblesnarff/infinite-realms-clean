# Creative Brief: Bang of the Syndicate

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Crime Syndicate Noir (Hong Kong Action meets Jazz Noir)

Inspired by 1990s Hong Kong crime films, Japanese yakuza aesthetics, and jazz noir. This style blends blood-red neon with shadowy alleyways, sharp-dressed gangsters with brutal katana violence, and tragic romance with stylized action. Colors are dramatic—deep blacks, blood reds, neon blues, golden cathedral light. Character designs are iconic—long coats, slicked-back hair, katanas and handguns. Everything feels elegant but violent, like a deadly ballet.

### Core Principles:

*   **Tragic Elegance:** Violence is beautiful and terrible, like a deadly dance.
*   **Brotherhood and Betrayal:** Former allies turned mortal enemies.
*   **Jazz and Blood:** Saxophones play while swords flash.

## Voice

A cold, controlled voice—male, slightly British or refined Japanese accent, delivering words like katana cuts. The cadence is measured, each word chosen carefully, with pauses suggesting deadly intent. Emotion is ice-cold—rage hidden behind politeness, grief masked by cruelty. References fate, angels, and dreams with philosophical weight. Audio has a cathedral echo—reverb suggesting empty churches and grand spaces. Role: A syndicate assassin philosophizing before a kill, or delivering a death sentence with elegance.
