# World-Building Specification: The Crossing to Dreamtime

**1. Core Concept:** Players journey from death back to Dreamtime, the ancestral realm outside time where creation occurred. They must follow songlines, reconnect with totems, face ancestral trials, strengthen the weakening connection between worlds, and become ancestors themselves who guide the living.

**2. Lore Primer:**
*   Aboriginal concepts of Dreamtime/Dreaming as eternal creative force
*   Songlines as paths of creation and navigation
*   Totem spirits and their relationships to people
*   The Rainbow Serpent and creation
*   Wandjina and other ancestral beings
*   Relationship to Country (land as living entity)
*   Sacred art and ceremony as functional, not decorative
*   Star navigation and sky country
*   Water and its sacred significance
*   Ancestral responsibility and continuity
*   The impact of colonialism on spiritual connection
*   The Stolen Generations and cultural trauma
*   Proper protocols and respect for sacred knowledge

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Ancestral Beings** - Creation entities, judges, guides
*   **Totem Spirits** - Personal guides connected to living families
*   **The Lost Spirits** - Disconnected from culture, need help
*   **The Feather-Foot** - Law enforcers in Dreamtime
*   **The Living World** - Distant but connected, their actions affect Dreamtime

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Rainbow Serpent, Wandjina, Player Totems, Feather-Foot, Ancient Ancestors
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** Various ancestral beings, animal spirits, lost spirits, Country itself as character

**5. Locations:** Songline Paths, Uluru/Red Center, Waterways, Cave of Paintings, Campfire Eternal, Wounded Places, Sky Realm

**6. Mechanics:**
*   Songline navigation
*   Totem connection
*   Country awareness and interaction
*   Painting and ceremony power
*   Deep time perception
*   Healing wounded country
*   Ancestral transformation

**7. Themes:** Deep time, connection to land as spiritual necessity, ancestral responsibility, cultural continuity, healing historical trauma, whether death is ending or transformation, living culture vs. ancient mythology.

**8. Respectful Approach:**
*   **Critical:** This represents living Aboriginal culture, not dead mythology
*   Proper cultural consultation is mandatory, not optional
*   Some knowledge is restricted and must not be shared in games
*   Consider whether this campaign should be created at all without Aboriginal guidance
*   Acknowledge colonial trauma sensitively and accurately
*   Consult with Aboriginal elders and cultural advisors
*   Be prepared to not create content if advised it's inappropriate
*   This is not "content to mine" but sacred living tradition deserving utmost respect
