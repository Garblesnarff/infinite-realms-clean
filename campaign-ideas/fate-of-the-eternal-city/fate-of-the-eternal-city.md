# Fate of the Eternal City
**Tagline:** *Troy burns behind them; Rome awaits ahead—but destiny demands they suffer first*

## Campaign Overview

The party consists of Trojan refugees fleeing their burning city, led by Aeneas, son of Venus and destined founder of Rome. They have escaped death at Greek hands but now face a divine mandate: sail to Italy and establish a new kingdom that will become the greatest empire in history. But the gods—particularly Juno, who hates all Trojans—conspire to prevent this destiny.

The campaign combines seafaring adventure, divine politics, tragic romance, and nation-building. The party will face storms sent by angry gods, land in Carthage where love threatens duty, descend to the underworld to learn their future, battle Italian tribes, and ultimately found Rome. This is the Aeneid: duty vs. desire, fate vs. free will, and the terrible cost of building empires.

## Core Themes

- **Pietas (Duty):** Placing divine/national duty above personal desire
- **Fate vs. Free Will:** Destiny is fixed, but the journey tests resolve
- **The Cost of Empire:** Rome's glory built on Trojan suffering
- **Tragic Love:** Dido and Aeneas—duty demands sacrifice
- **Ancestors and Descendants:** Connection across time
- **Divine Politics:** Gods as active manipulators of mortal fate

## Key NPCs

**Aeneas** - Dutiful, pious, burdened by fate. Son of Venus but very human. Struggles between desire and duty. Tragic hero who does right thing at great cost.

**Dido** - Queen of Carthage, passionate and tragic. Falls in love with Aeneas. Her suicide and curse create eternal enmity between Carthage and Rome.

**Anchises** - Aeneas's father, wise elder. Dies in Sicily, appears from underworld. Represents past and prophesies future.

**Ascanius (Iulus)** - Aeneas's young son. Will found Alba Longa. Represents future, why duty matters.

**Venus** - Aeneas's divine mother, protects her son. Manipulates events to ensure his success.

**Juno** - Primary antagonist. Hates Trojans (Paris's judgment), loves Carthage. Delays but cannot prevent fate.

**King Latinus** - Italian king, wants peace, offers daughter to Aeneas. Represents reasonable authority overruled by passion.

**Turnus** - Italian champion, betrothed to Lavinia. Sympathetic antagonist fighting for what he believes is his. Achilles-like warrior.

**Lavinia** - Prize and pawn in male politics. Mostly silent but symbolically crucial.

**Mercury** - Jupiter's messenger who rebukes Aeneas in Carthage, reminding him of duty.

## Major Locations

**Troy (Flashback)** - Burning city, civilization destroyed, origin point
**The Mediterranean** - Years of sailing, island stops, divine interference
**Carthage** - Magnificent city being built, represents temptation to abandon destiny
**Sicily** - Safe harbor, funeral games, Trojan women burn ships
**Cumae** - Sibyl's grotto, entrance to underworld
**The Underworld** - Styx, Tartarus, Elysium, meeting dead
**Latium** - Italian homeland, future Rome's territory

## Unique Mechanics

**Fate Points:** Aeneas cannot die—fate protects him. But others can. Players manage protecting companions while fulfilling destiny.

**Pietas Score:** Duty vs. desire tracking. High pietas brings divine favor; low pietas brings divine wrath.

**Divine Favor:** Multiple gods offer boons and curses. Manage competing divine interests.

**Prophetic Visions:** Future Rome appears in dreams, shields, oracles. Players know destiny, must achieve it.

**Epic Duels:** Heroic single combat with special rules. Turnus vs. Aeneas is climactic.

## Plot Twists

**Dido's Curse:** Her dying words ensure Carthage vs. Rome (Punic Wars, Hannibal). Love doomed both.

**Underworld Revelation:** Seeing all future Romans reveals purpose. Suffering has meaning.

**Turnus's Sympathy:** He's not villain—legitimate claim to Lavinia, fighting for homeland. His death is necessary but tragic.

**The Cycle:** Troy fell so Rome could rise. One empire's end births another. History repeats.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Victory:** Reach Italy, defeat Italian coalition, marry Lavinia, found Lavinium. Rome's eventual rise validates all sacrifice.

**Perfect Victory:** Achieve above while minimizing casualties, honoring fallen enemies, maintaining pietas throughout.

**Tragic Victory:** Succeed but at terrible cost—Dido's death, Pallas's death, Turnus's death haunt you. Victory feels hollow.

**Defeat:** Abandon duty for love (stay in Carthage), die before reaching Italy, fail to defeat Turnus. Rome never rises.
