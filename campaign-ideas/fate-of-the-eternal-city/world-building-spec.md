# Fate of the Eternal City - World-Building Specification

## Roman Mythology and Theology

**The Gods (Roman Names):**
- **Jupiter:** King, ensures fate unfolds
- **Juno:** Queen, hates Trojans, loves Carthage
- **Venus:** Love goddess, Aeneas's mother
- **Neptune:** Ocean god, aids or hinders ships
- **Mars:** War god, important to Rome's future
- **Mercury:** Messenger, enforces Jupiter's will

**Fate (Fatum):** Even gods cannot change it. Jupiter knows all fates, others don't.

**Pietas:** Duty to gods, country, family. Roman supreme virtue. Aeneas embodies it.

## The Trojan War Context

**Aeneas's Role at Troy:** Fought bravely, second to Hector. Commanded Dardanian forces. Escaped while city fell.

**Why He Survived:** Venus protected him, had destiny to fulfill. Not random—divinely orchestrated.

**Refugees:** Not all Trojans died. Fleet of 20+ ships escaped. Thousands of civilians.

## The Geography

**Mediterranean Circuit:**
- Troy (Asia Minor) → Thrace → Delos → Crete → Sicily → Carthage → Italy

**Historical Accuracy:** Routes match real Bronze Age trade paths.

**Latium:** Rich agricultural region, home to Latin tribes. Future Rome's heartland.

## Carthage - The Tragedy

**Historical Irony:** Founded same era as Rome. Became mortal enemies (Punic Wars).

**Dido's History:** Elissa in Phoenician. Fled Tyre when brother Pygmalion murdered her husband Sychaeus. Founded Carthage through cleverness (ox-hide trick).

**The Love Story:** Virgil's invention (historically Dido died before Rome's time). Serves to explain Punic Wars through divine curse.

**The Curse:** "Rise from my bones, avenger!" (Hannibal eventually). Eternal enmity between civilizations born from broken love.

## The Underworld (Virgilian)

**Structure:**
- **Entrance:** Cumae, Sibyl's cave
- **Vestibule:** Where monsters and abstract concepts dwell
- **Acheron River:** Charon ferries across
- **Tartarus:** Punishment for wicked (Titans, great sinners)
- **Elysium:** Paradise for heroes and virtuous
- **Fields of Mourning:** Those who died from love

**The Golden Bough:** Required to enter while alive. Sacred to Proserpina.

**Seeing Future Heroes:** Anchises shows procession of unborn Romans—Romulus, Roman kings, Republic heroes, Augustus.

## Italian Politics

**King Latinus:** Old, wishes peace, follows oracles
**Queen Amata:** Wants daughter to marry Turnus (local)
**Turnus:** Rutulian prince, best Italian warrior, has claim to Lavinia
**Evander:** Greek exile who founded Pallanteum (future Rome), becomes ally

**The War:** Not simple good vs. evil. Both sides have legitimate claims. Trojans are foreign invaders to Italians; destiny to Trojans.

## Divine Politics

**Why Juno Hates Trojans:**
1. Paris's Judgment (chose Venus over her)
2. Ganymede (Jupiter took Trojan boy as cupbearer, insulting)
3. Rome destined to destroy Carthage (her beloved city)

**Venus's Agenda:** Protect son, ensure Rome rises (she'll be honored there)

**Jupiter's Role:** Impartial fate-enforcer. What must be, will be. Calms divine conflicts.

## Roman National Epic

**Why Virgil Wrote It:** Augustus commissioned. Needed founding myth linking Rome to Troy (prestigious), explaining empire's destiny.

**Political Message:** Rome's empire is fate-mandated, not conquest. Divine destiny.

**Propaganda:** Augustus appears on shield (anachronistic)—current emperor divinely ordained.

**But Also:** Sympathizes with losers (Dido, Turnus). Questions cost of empire.

## The Pietas Paradox

**Aeneas Does Right Thing:** Leaves Dido for duty, fights war for destiny, obeys gods
**But It Hurts:** Dido dies, innocent Italians die, personal happiness sacrificed
**Roman Virtue:** Duty over desire. Community over individual. Glory through sacrifice.

**The Question:** Is empire worth this cost? Virgil doesn't answer—presents tragedy.

## Historical Layering

**Bronze Age (Story Time):** ~1200 BCE, Troy falls
**Founding of Rome (Destiny):** 753 BCE, Romulus
**Virgil Writing:** 29-19 BCE, Augustus's reign
**Effect:** Past, present, future collapse. Aeneas's struggle validates current empire.

## Descendants Matter

**Ascanius (Iulus):** Founds Alba Longa
**Romulus and Remus:** Born 15 generations later, found Rome
**Julian Family:** Claims descent from Iulus (Julius Caesar, Augustus)
**Divine Line:** Venus → Aeneas → Ascanius → Romans → emperors → gods

## The Armor Scene

**Vulcan's Shield:** Depicts future Roman history
- Romulus and Remus nursed by she-wolf
- Rape of Sabine Women
- Punic Wars
- Battle of Actium (Augustus's victory)

**Anachronism:** Shows events centuries/millennia after Aeneas. Makes myth timeless.

## Tragic Structure

**Book 1:** Storm, Carthage arrival
**Book 2:** Troy flashback
**Book 3:** Wanderings
**Book 4:** Dido tragedy (campaign emotional peak)
**Book 5:** Sicily, funeral games
**Book 6:** Underworld (philosophical/prophetic center)
**Book 7-12:** Italian war

**Two Halves:** Odyssey (wandering) + Iliad (war) = Aeneid

## The Moral Complexity

**Aeneas Isn't Perfect:**
- Hesitates in Carthage
- Kills Turnus in rage (despite begging)
- Capable of cruelty (battle descriptions)

**But Always Returns to Duty:** Pietas wins despite temptations

**The Cost:** Personal happiness sacrificed for national destiny. Heroism is suffering.

The campaign asks: **Is duty worth its price? Should empire's glory justify individual tragedy?**

Virgil's answer: This is the cost. Rome rose from ashes and blood. Glory is beautiful and terrible. Honor the sacrifice.
