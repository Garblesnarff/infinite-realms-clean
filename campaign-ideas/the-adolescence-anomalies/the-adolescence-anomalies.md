### Core Premise
In the coastal academy city of Fujisawa, a phenomenon called "Adolescence Syndrome" manifests: intense emotional issues of teenagers literally become supernatural reality. Sakuta, a cynical human artificer with a reputation as a troublemaker, encounters Mai, a famous actress-bard wearing a provocative bunny costume in the library—yet no one else can see her. She's experiencing Adolescence Syndrome: people's perception of her is literally vanishing because she craved invisibility from fame's pressure. As Sakuta helps her resolve this, they fall in love. But this is just the beginning—other students manifest different syndromes: a girl reliving the same day, a girl existing in two places at once, a girl who becomes invisible to her crush, someone swapping bodies, and others. Sakuta must solve each mystery while protecting Mai, who remains at risk of fading entirely from existence.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Bunny Girl (Sessions 1-3)**
- Sakuta meets Mai in bunny costume. Only he can see her. Investigation reveals she's fading from perception due to her conflicted desire to escape fame. Through Sakuta's efforts and her own courage, she becomes visible again. They begin dating. Sakuta's own past with Adolescence Syndrome is hinted at.

**Act 2: The Endless Eight Days (Sessions 4-6)**
- Sakuta meets Tomoe, a girl experiencing time loops—reliving the same day because she's avoiding a difficult choice about a fake dating relationship. He helps her face her fears and break the loop.

**Act 3: The Dual Existence (Sessions 7-9)**
- Rio, Sakuta's scientist friend, splits into two versions of herself—one confident, one insecure—physically manifesting her internal conflict. Reuniting her requires accepting both aspects of her identity.

**Act 4: The Invisible Feelings (Sessions 10-12)**
- Nodoka, Mai's half-sister, swaps bodies with Mai due to inferiority complex. They must live each other's lives, learning empathy and resolving family issues.

**Act 5: Saving Mai (Sessions 13-15)**
- The final arc: Mai's Adolescence Syndrome returns in a new form. To save Sakuta from an accident, she sacrifices herself, and the world forgets she ever existed—including Sakuta. He must use logic, evidence, and the power of his love to remember her and bring her back to everyone's perception, proving their connection transcends even supernatural erasure.

### Key Locations

- **The Academy Library**: Where Sakuta first encounters Mai. A quiet sanctuary that becomes significant.
- **The Beach**: Fujisawa's coast, where many important conversations and resolutions occur.
- **Sakuta's Apartment**: Where he cares for Kaede. A space showing his responsible side.
- **The Hospital**: Where various syndrome manifestations are treated or studied.
- **The Academy**: Where most syndromes manifest due to social pressures.

### Central Conflict
How do we overcome the gap between perception and reality? How do we maintain our sense of self and connection in a world that wants to erase or change us? The struggle between societal pressure and individual authenticity.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Adolescence Syndrome Cases**: Each arc focuses on solving one manifestation. Players must investigate symptoms, identify the emotional root cause, and help the person resolve their internal conflict to end the syndrome.
- **Perception Mechanics**: Track who can perceive Mai (and later, other affected people). As her syndrome worsens, fewer people can see/remember her. Use this to create emotional stakes.
- **Time Loop Investigation**: During Tomoe's arc, use Groundhog Day mechanics where Sakuta retains memories across loops and must figure out how to break the cycle.
- **Body Swap Roleplay**: During Nodoka's arc, Mai's player roleplays as Nodoka and vice versa, highlighting the empathy challenge.
- **The Erasure**: In the final arc, when Mai is erased from existence, everyone forgets her—including the players. Use meta-gaming: provide subtle clues that something is missing, someone is missing. Sakuta must piece together evidence to remember.
- **Scientific Investigation**: Rio provides pseudo-scientific explanations. Use Intelligence (Investigation) to solve syndrome mysteries.
