**The Bureaucratic Maze**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Low-level bureaucrats in a retro-futuristic dystopia where a clerical error marks one as a terrorist.

They must choose between impossible correction or becoming the terrorist the paperwork says they are.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the rise of the Ministry and how bureaucracy became reality's governing force.
    *   Write the history of Information Retrieval and how torture became administrative processing.
    *   Describe the duct system and the underground resistance that exploits it.
    *   Explain how cosmetic surgery and identity manipulation through paperwork works.
    *   Detail the legend of Harry Tuttle and whether he's real or bureaucratic phantom.

*   **IF:** Join resistance → **THEN:** Can exploit loopholes but invalidated by missing signatures.
*   **IF:** Dreams intensify → **THEN:** Reality becomes more surreal, distinction blurs.
*   **IF:** Reach Ministry core → **THEN:** Physics becomes optional, architecture impossible.
*   **IF:** Accept processing → **THEN:** Catatonic freedom in dreams vs. physical torture.
