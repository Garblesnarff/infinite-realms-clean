# The Extinction Protocol - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Corporate Horror Realism

**Aesthetic:** Mundane office environment soaked in blood. Fluorescent lighting over carnage. Gray cubicles red with violence.

**Color Palette:** Office gray (#808080), sterile white (#FFFFFF), fluorescent yellow-green (#E0FFCD), blood red (#8B0000), corporate blue (#003366), fear yellow (#FFFF99).

**Design:** Hyper-realistic office. Then gradual degradation. Bodies, blood, destruction. Familiar made horrifying.

## Music and Sound Design

**Pre-Protocol:** Muzak, keyboard typing, printer sounds, coffee maker.
**During:** Heartbeat, heavy breathing, fluorescent hum, screams, office equipment as weapons.
**Tension:** Silence before violence, footsteps echoing.
**The Voice:** Calm announcer tone, updates, countdown timer.

**Voice Direction:**
- The Voice: Clinical, professional, inhuman calm
- Employees: Escalating from normal to broken to monstrous
- CEO: Corporate sociopath, MBA buzzwords for murder
