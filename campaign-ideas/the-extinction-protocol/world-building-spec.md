# The Extinction Protocol - World-Building Specification

## Concordia Solutions

**Cover Story:** International trade consulting firm. Legitimate business, profitable. 75 employees in this building. Others worldwide (also testing grounds?).

**Real Purpose:** Front for military contractor. Researching human behavior under extreme stress. Social psychology experiments. Urban warfare applications. Expendable test subjects.

**The Project:** Extinction Protocol designed to study: breakdown of social order, improvised weapon use, leadership emergence, moral flexibility, survival psychology. Data sold to militaries globally.

**Employee Selection:** Hired specifically for diversity of profiles. Psychological screening (hidden). Some employees planted (trained operatives). Others completely innocent.

## The Implants

**Installation:** "Mandatory health screening." Employees unconscious briefly. Chip implanted in brain stem. Employees never knew.

**Capabilities:** Explosive (kill). GPS tracking. Biometric monitoring (heart rate, stress). Possible mind control? Remote detonation. Tamper detection.

**Purpose:** Control mechanism. Data collection. Enforcement. No escape possible. Ultimate corporate loyalty program.

## Building Systems

**Lockdown:** Steel shutters, electrified barriers, jammed communications. No one in or out. Independent power. Could withstand siege.

**Surveillance:** Every room monitored. CEO watches all. Data recorded. Security guards access feeds. No privacy.

**Weapons:** Security office has real guns (for guards). Employees have improvised only. Intentional imbalance. More interesting data.

**Secrets:** Hidden files in CEO office. Proof of other Protocols. Military contracts. Employee psychological profiles. Incriminating evidence.

## Previous Protocols

**Other Buildings:** This isn't first test. Dozens worldwide. Different scenarios. Always mass casualties. Survivors silenced or recruited. Perfect crime, repeated.

**Variations:** Some had weapons provided. Others pure stealth. Some team-based. All deadly. Refining the formula.

## Moral Complexity

**Were They All Innocent?** Some employees were plants. Some volunteered for money. Some knew (vaguely). Others completely victims. Ambiguity intentional.

**The First Kill:** Changes everything. Self-defense vs. murder. Does reason matter? Survival justifies? Can you come back?

**The Survivors:** Are they victims? Monsters? Both? What does living cost? PTSD forever. Can't undo what they did.

**The System:** CEO evil. But company? Society that allows it? Capitalism? Customers? Everyone complicit?

This campaign uses battle royale structure to explore workplace horror, social breakdown, and the cost of survival when the enemy is your friend.
