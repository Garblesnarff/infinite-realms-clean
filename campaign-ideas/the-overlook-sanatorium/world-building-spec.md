### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Overlook Sanatorium**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party accepts employment as winter caretakers of the Overlook Sanatorium, a massive mountaintop resort closed for the season. Trapped by snow and avalanches, they discover the building is psychically alive, feeding on trauma and driving its inhabitants to madness and murder. As reality breaks down and ghosts from the Overlook's violent past manifest, the party must survive three months of psychological horror while fighting the building's influence and their own darkest impulses.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the original history of the site: a sacred Native American burial ground desecrated by settlers in the 1800s who built a sanatorium over it.
    *   Write the story of the sanatorium years (1880s-1920s), when tuberculosis patients were sent here to die. Include tales of experimental treatments and patients who went mad from isolation.
    *   Describe the transformation into a luxury resort in the 1920s, funded by mob money as a money-laundering operation, and the massacre during a New Year's Eve party in 1921.
    *   Chronicle the caretaker murders: the Grady family in 1970, the previous caretaker before them, and a pattern stretching back decades.
    *   Explain the psychic nature of the Overlook: it's a living entity created by the confluence of death, trauma, and the violated burial ground, feeding on psychic energy from those with "the Shining."
    *   Detail what "the Shining" is: a hereditary psychic ability allowing users to see past/future events, communicate telepathically, and perceive spirits.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Caretakers (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive three months, maintain the property, earn their pay, and escape with sanity intact.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A team of equals, though this will break down as paranoia sets in.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Professional caretakers doing their job.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each character likely has personal reasons for taking such an isolated job—hiding from something, needing money desperately, or seeking isolation.
        *   **Assets:** Access to the entire Overlook, a limited supply of food and fuel, tools for maintenance, and some but not all characters possess the Shining.
        *   **Relationships:** Employed by the Grady Foundation; isolated from the outside world; increasingly at odds with each other as madness sets in.
    *   **The Overlook (The Building Itself)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To feed on psychic energy, trauma, and death. To corrupt and consume those trapped within it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The Overlook is the controlling intelligence; ghosts are its servants and manifestations of its power.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. It's a building.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To drive the caretakers to murder and suicide, harvesting their death energy and binding their spirits to join its collection.
        *   **Assets:** Complete control over interior reality, an army of ghosts, the ability to manipulate memories and perceptions, psychic vampirism.
        *   **Relationships:** Commands the ghosts; opposed by those with strong Shining who can resist; patient and inevitable.
    *   **The Ghosts** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Varies by ghost. Some want to escape, some want company, some want revenge, and some are simply puppets of the Overlook.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The more violent deaths/stronger psychic imprints create more powerful ghosts. Delbert Grady is a lieutenant of sorts.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To interact with the living, often seductively or threateningly.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Most are bound to the Overlook and serve it willingly or unwillingly. A few (like Hallorann) resist and try to help.
        *   **Assets:** Can manipulate physical reality within the Overlook, create illusions, possess the living, and inflict psychic damage.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve the Overlook; hostile to most living; exceptions like Hallorann who try to aid victims.
    *   **The Grady Foundation** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain ownership of the Overlook and hide its dark history.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A corporate shell run by descendants of the original builders.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Historic preservation and eventual reopening of the resort.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know the Overlook is haunted but suppress this information. They may be under the building's influence or simply care more about property value than lives.
        *   **Assets:** Legal ownership, money, the ability to hire unsuspecting caretakers.
        *   **Relationships:** Employ the players; complicit in covering up deaths; may have members who are psychically bound to the Overlook.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.

    *   **Mr. Stuart Ullman:** The estate manager who hires the party and delivers the tour, knowing full well he's sending them to their doom.
    *   **Dick Hallorann (Ghost):** The spirit of a former cook with powerful Shining who died trying to save a previous victim. He's the party's only supernatural ally.
    *   **Delbert Grady (Ghost):** The polite, insane ghost of a 1920s caretaker who murdered his family and now serves the Overlook.
    *   **The Grady Twins (Ghosts):** The murdered daughters who speak in unison and haunt the hallways, forever playing.

*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "1920s Party Guest" (elegant, ghostly, trapped in eternal celebration, unaware they're dead)
    *   "Tuberculosis Patient" (gaunt, coughing, reaching out for help, from the sanatorium era)
    *   "Previous Caretaker" (disheveled, mad, violent, recent addition to the ghost collection)
    *   "Native Spirit" (angry, seeking justice for desecration, possibly an ally if approached correctly)
    *   "Mob Enforcer" (1920s gangster, violent, guards certain areas)

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party accumulates 10 total Isolation Points (5 per week, averaged across party).
    *   **THEN:** Escalate supernatural manifestations. Ghosts become corporeal and aggressive. The Overlook begins overt attempts to possess party members. Generate personalized hauntings for each character based on their backstory.
    *   **IF:** A character drinks the ghostly alcohol from the Gold Room.
    *   **THEN:** They experience euphoria and a temporary escape from fear, but they lose time. Generate a scene where they wake hours later having done something they don't remember—possibly violent, possibly intimate with a ghost, possibly sabotage.
    *   **IF:** A character enters Room 237.
    *   **THEN:** They experience a seduction/horror encounter. Generate a Wisdom save. Success means they resist and escape shaken but unharmed. Failure means they're psychologically scarred—gain a permanent phobia or obsession related to what they saw.
    *   **IF:** The party fails to maintain the boiler for 3 consecutive sessions.
    *   **THEN:** The boiler reaches critical pressure. The party has one final chance to vent it or it explodes in 1d4 hours, destroying the Overlook but likely killing anyone still inside. This provides a "nuclear option" escape.
    *   **IF:** A character with the Shining makes contact with Hallorann's ghost.
    *   **THEN:** Hallorann provides crucial information: the Overlook feeds on psychic energy, there's a binding ritual in the burial ground that can be broken, and the building will try hardest to corrupt or kill those with the Shining. He also warns that he couldn't escape—can they?
    *   **IF:** A party member is fully possessed and attacks the others.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a climactic confrontation. The possessed character is played by the DM. The party can attempt exorcism (requires a Shining character), subdue them non-lethally, or kill them. Each option has consequences.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully breaks the binding ritual in the basement.
    *   **THEN:** The Overlook loses its power over new victims but ghosts become enraged, manifesting for a final assault. The building begins to collapse. Generate an escape sequence where the party must flee through collapsing corridors while ghosts attack.
