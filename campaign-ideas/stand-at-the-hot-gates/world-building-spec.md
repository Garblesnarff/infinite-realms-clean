*   **Women's Role:** Spartan women train physically, own property, "Come back with your shield or on it."
*   **Death Cult:** Good death in battle preferred to long life, immortality through legend.

**9. Prophecy & Fate**
*   **Oracle's Words:** "Either your city is sacked or a king of Sparta dies."
*   **Leonidas' Choice:** Volunteers to fulfill prophecy, saves Sparta through sacrifice.
*   **Party's Knowledge:** All 300 know they march to death, choose it anyway.
*   **Religious Context:** Carneia festival forbids war, Leonidas goes as "king's bodyguard" to bypass.

**10. The Three Days**
*   **Day One:** Persian army arrives, parley fails, first assaults broken.
*   **Day Two:** Escalating attacks, Immortals defeated, exotic troops fail.
*   **Night of Betrayal:** Ephialtes reveals Phocian path for gold.
*   **Day Three:** Surrounded, final charge, last stand on the hill, all 300 die.

**11. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party holds for three days → **THEN:** Athens evacuates, fleet prepares.
*   **IF:** Ephialtes rejected from phalanx → **THEN:** Betrays Greeks to Persians.
*   **IF:** Leonidas sends away allies → **THEN:** Only 300 Spartans (and 700 Thespians) remain for final stand.
*   **IF:** Party dies at Hot Gates → **THEN:** Delay allows Greek unity at Salamis and Plataea.
*   **IF:** Party breaks phalanx formation → **THEN:** Persians overwhelm position.
*   **IF:** Spartan reinforcements arrive → **THEN:** Too late, find only bodies and monument.

**12. Tactical Reality**
*   **Narrow Pass Advantage:** Persian numbers mean nothing if only hundreds can fight at once.
*   **Phalanx Superiority:** Spartan discipline and equipment superior to Persian troops.
*   **Inevitability of Flanking:** Mountain path bypasses defensive advantage.
*   **Attrition:** Even winning every fight, Spartans accumulate injuries and fatigue.
*   **Final Charge:** Abandon defense to attempt killing Xerxes before death.

**13. Honor & Legacy**
*   **Spartan Law:** Never retreat, never surrender, victory or death only options.
*   **Shield Brothers:** Each Spartan protects man to his left with shield.
*   **Names Carried Forward:** All 300 selected have living sons to preserve their names.
*   **Monument:** "Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws, we lie."
*   **Legend Status:** The 300 achieve immortality—remembered 2500 years later.

**14. Ephialtes' Tragedy**
*   **Deformity:** Physical weakness prevents him from raising shield properly.
*   **Rejection:** Leonidas refuses him—would create gap in phalanx endangering all.
*   **Betrayal:** Sells knowledge of Phocian path to Persians for gold and acceptance.
*   **Motivation:** Wants to serve Sparta but is denied, chooses self-interest over city.

**15. Political Dimension**
*   **Gorgo's Mission:** While men fight, she lobbies Spartan council for reinforcements.
*   **Theron's Corruption:** Councilman opposes aid, revealed as traitor.
*   **Spartan Army:** Arrives after battle ends, finds only bodies and glory.
*   **Greek Unity:** 300's sacrifice shames other city-states into cooperation.
*   **Salamis & Plataea:** United Greeks defeat Persians decisively months later.

**16. Themes & Philosophy**
*   **Beautiful Death:** Spartans view heroic death as pinnacle of existence.
*   **One vs Many:** Individual excellence vs overwhelming numbers.
*   **Freedom vs Tyranny:** Democratic city-states vs divine emperor.
*   **Legend vs Life:** Immortal fame worth more than long anonymous life.
*   **Brotherhood:** Perfect unity among warriors transcends individual survival.

**17. Historical License**
*   Campaign uses stylized version of history:
    *   Numbers exaggerated (actual Persians ~100,000-300,000, not millions).
    *   Spartans didn't fight alone (700 Thespians also died).
    *   Three days compressed or expanded to fit sessions.
    *   Visual style hyper-stylized, not realistic.
    *   Focus on mythic truth over historical accuracy.
