# Beneath the Grassblade
**Tagline:** *When you're ant-sized, a backyard becomes an entire world of wonder and terror*

## Campaign Overview

A powerful wizard's experimental shrinking spell backfires during a garden party, reducing the entire party to insect scale—roughly 2-5 millimeters tall. At this size, the wizard's manicured backyard becomes an immense wilderness filled with towering grass forests, dewdrop oceans, and insect civilizations. Before the wizard can reverse the spell, a bird swoops down and carries them away, leaving the party stranded in this enormous micro-world.

The party must survive at insect scale while searching for either the wizard or the components needed to reverse the shrinking. They encounter sophisticated ant colonies with military organization, spider web cities built by sapient arachnids, bee hives operating as trading empires, and cricket bards sharing news across the lawn. Surface tension makes puddles into lakes, a garden snail becomes a massive beast, and a light rain is a catastrophic flood.

As they explore this micro-wilderness, the party discovers that several other miniaturized beings—some shrunk recently, others transformed years ago—have built entire societies at this scale. Some want to return to normal size, but others have embraced this hidden world. The party must decide: Use every resource to return home, or remain in this incredible micro-realm where everyday objects are magical treasures and insects are kingdoms?

## Core Themes

- **Scale Inversion:** Common objects become monumental, tiny creatures become significant
- **Insect Societies:** Sophisticated civilizations operating at small scale
- **Surface Tension Physics:** Water behaves differently at this size
- **Survival Horror/Wonder:** Danger and beauty in the familiar made strange
- **Finding Home:** Is home a size or a place?

## Session Breakdown (24 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Grass Forest (Sessions 1-6)

**Session 1 - The Shrinking:** Garden party interrupted by spell accident. Party shrinks to ant-size. Chaos and disorientation. Wizard grabbed by bird before reversal. Party left alone in suddenly enormous garden.

**Session 2 - First Steps:** Learning physics at this scale. Surface tension, air resistance, perspective shifts. First encounter with beetle—truck-sized to party. Escape/avoidance encounter.

**Session 3 - The Grass Jungle:** Grass blades are trees. Dirt clods are boulders. First aid from other miniaturized person—Thornwick, a halfling shrunken 3 years ago, now adapted. Exposition on survival.

**Session 4 - Ant Column Contact:** Encounter organized ant column. These ants are sentient, military culture. First diplomatic encounter. Ants curious about "giant-folk" (humans) shrunk down.

**Session 5 - The Ant Citadel:** Visiting underground ant colony. Sophisticated tunnel network, larva nurseries, fungus gardens, queen's chamber. Ant society is fascinating and alien.

**Session 6 - The Dewdrop Lake:** Morning dew creates temporary lakes. Must cross one—surface tension allows walking on water but dangerous. First major environmental puzzle.

### Arc 2: Insect Kingdoms (Sessions 7-12)

**Session 7 - Spider's Web City:** Encounter web-dwelling jumping spiders. They've built entire cities in their webs. Trade center between insect kingdoms. Not all spiders are hostile—some are merchants.

**Session 8 - The Bee Hive Empire:** Bee colony operating as merchant empire. Honey as currency. Wax architecture. Queen Bee as empress. Party can trade services for resources.

**Session 9 - Cricket Orchestra:** Musical cricket culture. Bards and storytellers. They share news across the lawn through song. Information network. Party learns of other miniaturized humans.

**Session 10 - The Beetle Riders:** Some miniaturized humans have domesticated beetles as mounts. Beetle cavalry culture. Offer party training and transportation.

**Session 11 - Centipede Attack:** Hostile encounter with centipede. Like dragon at this scale—many legs, venomous bite, armored. Major combat. Rescue by beetle riders.

**Session 12 - The Garden Wall:** Reaching edge of yard—massive stone garden wall. Like mountain range. Must find way to climb or circumvent.

### Arc 3: The Human Settlements (Sessions 13-17)

**Session 13 - Smallville:** Discovery of permanent settlement built by long-term miniaturized people. They've adapted, created society at insect scale. Some don't want to return to normal size.

**Session 14 - The Two Factions:** Ideological split in mini-human community. "Returners" want normal size restored. "Adapters" embrace new scale. Party must navigate politics.

**Session 15 - The Wizard's Trail:** Information leads to wizard's possible location—carried by bird to nest in tree. Must organize expedition. Need allies and resources.

**Session 16 - The Rain Storm:** Catastrophic weather event. Raindrop impacts like bombs. Flooding. Survival challenge. Must seek shelter in beetle shell or underground.

**Session 17 - Alliance Building:** Gathering allies for expedition: Ant warriors, beetle riders, spider scouts, bee suppliers. Grand alliance of insect kingdoms and mini-humans.

### Arc 4: The Garden Tree Expedition (Sessions 18-22)

**Session 18 - The Trunk Ascent:** Climbing tree bark—like scaling massive cliff face. Encounters with bark beetles, woodlice, caterpillars.

**Session 19 - The Branch Highway:** Tree branches are massive highways. Ant trails, spider webs, aphid farms tended by ants. Complex ecosystem in canopy.

**Session 20 - Bird Nest Siege:** Finding wizard trapped in bird nest, injured but alive. Must rescue from protective mother bird. Epic boss encounter with bird.

**Session 21 - Wizard's Dilemma:** Wizard can reverse spell but only has power for limited number of people. Not everyone can return. Who gets chosen? Moral crisis.

**Session 22 - The Great Decision:** Each party member must decide: Return to normal size or stay in micro-world? Some NPCs plead to be chosen. Heartbreaking choices.

### Arc 5: Resolution (Sessions 23-24)

**Session 23 - The Reversal Ritual:** Wizard performs spell for those who chose to return. Emotional farewells to insect allies and those staying small. Return to normal size.

**Session 24 - Two Perspectives:**
- **If party returns:** Seeing micro-world from normal size again. Can they still communicate? Will they protect this hidden realm?
- **If party stays:** Embracing new life. Building permanent home. Adventures at small scale continue.
- **Split party:** Maintaining relationship across scales.

## Key NPCs

**Thornwick the Adapted** - Halfling shrunk 3 years ago. Expert survivor, teaches party insect-scale skills. Conflicted about returning—found purpose here.

**General Mandible** - Leader of ant legion. Organized, strategic, values strength. Respects party's combat ability. Provides military support.

**Queen Vespa** - Bee hive empress. Shrewd trader, political mind. Sees party as potential trade partners between scales.

**Chirp the Cricket Bard** - Traveling minstrel. Knows everyone's stories. Source of information and comic relief. Helps gather intelligence.

**Captain Carapace** - Leader of beetle riders. Gruff cavalry commander. Teaches mounted combat. Becomes friend.

**Silk the Spider Weaver** - Jumping spider merchant. Runs web-city trade hub. Not aggressive—spiders are people too at this scale.

**The Wizard Aldus Shrink** - Caused the accident. Guilt-ridden, wants to fix it. Injured in bird capture. Has limited reversal power.

**Mother Finch** - Bird protecting nest. Not evil—just a mother. Massive, terrifying boss encounter. Can be reasoned with or fought.

**Elder Marigold** - Leader of Smallville Adapters. Believes micro-life is better. Gentle pressure on party to stay.

**Young Tavin** - Child from Smallville who wants to return to normal family. Heartbreaking embodiment of choice's weight.

## Major Locations

**The Grass Forest** - Blades like trees, canopy of leaves above. Dew catches in grass creating temporary lakes. Insects everywhere.

**The Dewdrop Lake** - Temporary body of water from morning dew. Surface tension allows walking. Evaporates by midday.

**Ant Citadel** - Underground colony with nurseries, fungus farms, storage, barracks. Organized military society.

**Spider's Web City** - Three-dimensional city built in giant web between grass blades. Trade center, beautiful and dangerous.

**Bee Hive Empire** - Wax hexagonal architecture. Honey storage, queen's chamber, drone barracks. Active, buzzing metropolis.

**Smallville** - Miniaturized human settlement. Built from found objects (bottle cap houses, nail tools, fabric clothes). Hidden from normal-sized humans.

**The Garden Wall** - Stone wall boundary of yard. Massive cliff face at small scale. Marks world's edge.

**The Tree Canopy** - Upper regions of oak tree. Branch highways, bird nests, caterpillar territories. Vertigo-inducing heights.

**The Bird Nest** - Twiggy fortress high in tree. Where wizard is trapped. Final expedition goal.

## Unique Mechanics

**Surface Tension:** Can walk on water. Crossing puddles viable. Getting wet is dangerous (hard to dry, heavy).

**Terminal Velocity:** Falling no longer lethal—air resistance too high. Can survive long falls.

**Climbing Ease:** Small size makes climbing vertical surfaces easier. Can scale what was impossible before.

**Insect Mounts:** Beetles, grasshoppers can be ridden. Fast travel, combat advantages.

**Found Object Tools:** Human items become resources. Sewing needle = spear. Bottle cap = shield. Coin = table.

**Weather Catastrophes:** Rain, wind are deadly at this scale. Must seek shelter.

**Insect Communication:** Party gains ability to understand insect languages (magic or adaptation).

**Size-Based Combat:** Small size = harder to hit, less damage dealt/taken. Adjust mechanics.

## Plot Twists

**Wizard Was Experimenting Deliberately:** Accident wasn't complete accident. Wanted to study insect scale but lost control.

**Some Don't Want To Return:** Miniaturized community split on restoration. Not everyone grateful.

**Limited Reversal Capacity:** Can't return everyone. Tragic choices required.

**The Micro-Ecosystem is Dying:** Human's normal-sized activities (lawn mowing, pesticides) threaten micro-world. Party must protect it.

**Party Member Wants To Stay:** One PC genuinely prefers life at small scale. Internal party conflict.

**Multiple Wizards Were Shrunk:** Discovery of others scattered across larger area. Quest could expand.

**Insect Civilizations Fear Giants:** Revealing normal-human perspectives on insects creates ethical complications.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory:** Find wizard, restore those who want normal size, establish protection for those who stay small and insect kingdoms.

**Secondary Victories:**
- Establish communication/trade between scales
- Protect micro-ecosystem from normal-world threats
- Unite insect kingdoms in alliance
- Ensure miniaturized community thrives
- Maintain relationships across size difference

**Exceptional Victory:** Create lasting peace between scales. Insect civilizations recognized and protected. Choice to shift between sizes at will. Hidden micro-world becomes sanctuary.

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat:** Party dies to environment/predators, wizard dies before reversal, or forced to remain small without resources.

**Partial Defeats:**
- Some party members remain stuck
- Insect allies harmed in rescue attempt
- Miniaturized community destroyed
- Unable to protect micro-world from macro threats
- Permanent separation from normal-sized loved ones
