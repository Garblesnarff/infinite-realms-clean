# Creative Brief: The Phantom's Game

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Supernatural Sports with Zone Visualization (Kuroko's Basketball-inspired)

Inspired by the supernatural basketball aesthetics of *Kuroko's Basketball* with emphasis on invisible presence and superhuman abilities. This style captures Zone state trance visuals, misdirection effects, the Generation of Miracles' overwhelming auras, and the contrast between shadow and light players.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Supernatural Abilities:** Zone state effects, Emperor Eye vision, impossible shots, lightning-fast movements
*   **Phantom Presence:** Subtle figure that draws no attention, transparency effects, sudden visibility shifts
*   **Overwhelming Auras:** Each Miracle has distinctive visual presence—their power made manifest
*   **Modern Indoor Arena:** Polished basketball courts, dramatic indoor lighting, crowd reactions

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Shadow and light, Zone trance, miracles, perfect passes, supernatural basketball, team resonance
*   **Feeling:** The intensity of transcendent focus mixed with invisible support. Lightning-fast action contrasted with perfect stillness. The clash between individual genius and perfect teamwork.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Zone State:** Blue-white glow around players in trance, slowed time effects, enhanced perception visuals
*   **Phantom's Presence:** Pale blue misdirection aura, transparency effects, sudden bright visibility
*   **Miracles' Colors:** Each has signature color (Aomine's dark blue, Midorima's green, Murasakibara's purple, Kise's yellow, Akashi's red and gold)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a basketball court with dramatic overhead lighting. One player glows with pale blue transparency—the Phantom in misdirection. Their partner blazes with intense red-orange as they enter Zone state. The opponent's Emperor Eye manifests as heterochromatic gold and red eyes seeing multiple future paths shown as ghostly afterimages."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Phantom:** Subtle features, often shown partially transparent, light blue hair, calm expression
*   **The Miracles:** Each has distinctive appearance matching their ability—intense eyes, powerful builds, unique hair colors
*   **Zone State Visual:** Glowing aura, eyes shining, intense focus, time-slowed motion blur around them
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Phantom stands at the free-throw line, their form slightly translucent with pale blue edges. In stark contrast, the ace blazes with red-gold Zone aura, mid-jump for an impossible dunk. The ball between them seems to teleport via the invisible pass. Defenders look confused, unable to track the Phantom's movement."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Indoor Arenas:** Polished hardwood courts, regulation baskets, packed spectator stands
*   **Practice Gyms:** Training facilities with multiple hoops, conditioning equipment, strategy boards
*   **Street Courts:** Outdoor urban basketball courts with chain nets and concrete, raw playground energy
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive indoor arena during the Winter Cup finals. The polished wooden court reflects the dramatic overhead spotlights. Spectators fill every seat, creating walls of color. Giant screens show close-ups of players. The atmosphere is electric with tension. Championship banners hang from the ceiling."

**5. Supernatural Basketball Action:**
*   **Zone Abilities:** Time-slowed perspective showing normally impossible plays, enhanced perception visuals
*   **Misdirection:** Transparent passes, attention drawn away, sudden appearance of the invisible player
*   **Miracle Powers:** Formless shots with impossible trajectories, laser-accurate long-distance shots, crushing blocks with shockwave effects
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Phantom makes a pass that appears as a blur of pale blue light—the ball seeming to teleport from their hands to their teammate across the court. Defenders track the wrong player, their eyes focused elsewhere due to misdirection. The receiver enters Zone state mid-catch, their body glowing as time slows around them. They shoot with perfect form as the Phantom fades back to transparency."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High-Contrast Drama:** Bright court lighting creating sharp shadows, spotlight effects on key players
*   **Supernatural Glow:** Zone state creates inner light, Miracles' auras illuminate their surroundings
*   **Dynamic Action Lighting:** Motion trails, energy effects, frozen moments of perfect plays
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit from above with harsh gymnasium lighting. Players in Zone state glow from within—one with red-gold aura, another with deep blue. The Phantom is backlit, creating a silhouette effect that makes them hard to focus on. The ball leaves light trails showing its path. Sharp shadows emphasize the intensity of competition."

## Voice

A quiet, calm voice that builds to intense determination. The pacing shifts between contemplative observation and explosive action.
