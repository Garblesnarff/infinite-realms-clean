# Heavy Metal Hell - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
Brutal fantasy meets concert venue apocalypse. Every scene should feel like the cover of a classic heavy metal album come to life. Think Frank Frazetta paintings crossed with Iron Maiden album art, filtered through the visual language of doom, death, and glory. The world is eternally on fire, yet functional—this is organized chaos, beautiful brutality.

**Primary Visual Influences:**
- Heavy metal album covers (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Megadeth, Slayer)
- Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo fantasy art
- HR Giger's biomechanical horror
- Hieronymus Bosch's depictions of hell
- Mad Max: Fury Road (chrome and fire aesthetic)
- DOOM video game series (2016/Eternal)
- Heavy metal concert stage design and pyrotechnics

### Environmental Design

**General Hell Aesthetic:**
- Sky perpetually red/orange with black clouds and lightning
- Volcanoes erupting on drum beats
- Rivers of lava serving as roadways
- Mountains made of amplifiers and speaker stacks
- Constant metal music thundering from everywhere
- Everything is sharp—spikes, blades, jagged edges

**Territory-Specific Aesthetics:**

**Thrash Territory:**
- Chaotic but energetic

- Constant motion and speed
- Orange/red color dominance

- White/black/blue colors
- Corpse forests and ice cathedrals
- Norwegian winter meets satanic imagery
- Ethereal and terrifying

**Doom Territory:**

- Brown/gray/dark red
- Everything is huge and ponderous
- Oppressive weight to the air
- Funeral aesthetics

**Power Metal Territory:**
- Heroic and shining
- Gold/silver/blue colors
- Dragons and gleaming armor
- Epic vistas and impossible architecture
- Fantasy novel cover brought to life

**Progressive Territory:**

- Spatial distortion (things too close and too far)
- Existential wrongness (horror effect)

This creative brief ensures Heavy Metal Hell feels authentically METAL while remaining epic fantasy. Every element reinforces: this is a world where music is law, power is performance, and the concert never ends.
