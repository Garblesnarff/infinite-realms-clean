## Art Style: Romantic Swashbuckler (Golden Age Adventure Films)

Inspired by classic swashbuckling films—vibrant colors, dynamic action poses, romantic lighting, Renaissance fashion with flair.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Rich jewel tones—royal blues, deep reds, gold trim. Musketeers wear distinctive tabards. Court scenes are opulent. Taverns are warm and inviting.

**Character Design:** Renaissance/Early Baroque fashion—plumed hats, flowing capes, knee boots, rapiers at the hip. Musketeers are dashing and distinctive. Milady is elegant and dangerous.

**Environments:** Paris streets, palace ballrooms, tavern interiors, countryside roads, battlefield camps. Everything has romantic grandeur.

**Action:** Dynamic dueling poses, characters mid-leap, sword fights on chandeliers and rooftops, horseback chases.

## Voice

A charismatic voice with French accent, full of energy and wit, speaking with theatrical flair and genuine warmth. The voice of a musketeer at a tavern, halfway through their third cup of wine, recounting their greatest adventure.

## Music Style

Orchestral adventure score with period instruments—harpsichord, lute, baroque strings. Themes are heroic and romantic—think Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic swashbuckler scores. Dueling scenes have rapid strings and rhythmic intensity. Court scenes are elegant minuets. Battle scenes are full orchestral glory. The Musketeer theme is rousing, hopeful, and makes you want to draw a sword and defend honor.
