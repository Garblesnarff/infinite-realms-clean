## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Social Combat:** Court intrigue requires diplomacy, deception, and reading motives.
*   **Dueling:** Frequent sword fights against skilled opponents, but rarely to the death.
*   **Time-Sensitive Missions:** Racing to deliver messages, prevent assassinations, or rescue prisoners.
*   **Moral Clarity:** Unlike grimdark campaigns, heroes are heroes and villains are villains, but with complexity.

## Central Conflict

Loyalty versus politics, honor versus pragmatism. The party serves the King but the Cardinal technically does too—and he may actually be right about some things. They must navigate a world where their enemies aren't monsters but fellow humans with different visions for France. Personal loyalty to friends, romantic interests, and ideals clash with political reality.

### 3. **Romance Subplots**
*   Each character can pursue a romantic interest. Complications arise from class differences, political alignments, or existing engagements.

### 4. **The Musketeer Bond**

### 5. **Reputation**

### 6. **The Diamond Chase**
*   A multi-session time-pressure mission with random encounters, social challenges, and a ticking clock.
