# Genre Collapse - Creative Brief

## Art Direction
**Aesthetic**: Reality glitching between visual styles. Fantasy painted art shifts to noir black-and-white shifts to horror shadowy shifts to romance soft-focus.

**Color Shifts**: Each genre has palette. When zones blend, colors clash beautifully/horrifyingly.

**Character Design**: Characters' appearance changes with genre. The fighter looks heroic in fantasy, gritty in noir, terrifying in horror, attractive in romance.

## Music Direction
**Dynamic Shifting**: Orchestra for fantasy, jazz for noir, strings for romance, synth for sci-fi, atonal for horror, quirky for comedy. Shifts mid-scene.

**Transition Effects**: Music genres blend like DJ mixing, sometimes harmonious, sometimes discordant.

## Voice Acting
**Genre-Appropriate Delivery**: Same actor shifts delivery style based on current genre. Dramatic in tragedy, deadpan in comedy, sultry in romance.

**The Storyteller**: Voice morphs between every archetype—hero, villain, lover, fool, victim, savior—all at once.

## Sound Design
**Genre Sound Effects**: Swords in fantasy, gunshots in noir, screams in horror, heartbeats in romance. All bleeding together. Audio chaos representing narrative collapse.
