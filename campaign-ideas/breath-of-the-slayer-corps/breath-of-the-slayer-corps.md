## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-18 sessions)

A three-act arc of training, escalation, and confronting the source of all demons.

*   **Act I — Breath and Blood (Sessions 1-6):** After demon attacks destroy their lives, the party undergoes brutal training to master Breathing Techniques. They pass Final Selection—a trial where trainees must survive demon-infested mountains for seven days. As new Slayers, they hunt demons, protect villages, and learn of the Twelve Demon Moons—the Demon King's most powerful servants.
*   **Act II — The Demon Moons (Sessions 7-12):** The party faces the Lower and Upper Moons—demons with centuries of experience and terrifying blood arts. They rescue their transformed family members who retain fragments of humanity. They infiltrate the Red Light District, battle on a train possessed by a demon, and face impossible odds. Each victory brings them closer to the Demon King.
*   **Act III — Sunrise Over Demons (Sessions 13-18):** The Demon King reveals himself, attempting to conquer the sun's weakness. The Corps launches a final assault on his fortress. The party must push their Breathing Techniques beyond human limits, unlock See-Through World and Transparent World states, and face demons who've lived a thousand years. The fate of humanity rests on their nichirin blades.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Breathing Techniques**
*   Combat styles that enhance physical abilities through controlled breathing
*   Major styles: Water (adaptable), Flame (offense), Thunder (speed), Stone (defense), Wind (multi-hit), etc.
*   Each style has forms—specific attack patterns with poetic names
*   Can create hybrid styles combining two techniques
*   Overuse causes exhaustion and potential unconsciousness

### 2. **Demon Physiology**
*   Demons regenerate from nearly any wound except decapitation with nichirin blades
*   Sunlight instantly kills demons, making daytime safe
*   Demons grow stronger by consuming humans or receiving the King's blood
*   Some demons develop Blood Demon Arts—unique supernatural abilities

### 3. **Total Concentration Breathing**
*   Advanced technique allowing constant breathing enhancement
*   Unlocks "constant" mode after intense training
*   Grants enhanced speed, strength, and senses even while resting
*   Must be maintained consciously until becoming automatic

### 4. **See-Through World**
*   Ultimate technique revealing opponents' muscles, blood flow, and intent
*   Allows predicting movements and identifying weak points
*   Appears as transparent view of enemy's internal systems
*   Unlocked through near-death experience or intense training

### 5. **Demon Slayer Marks**
*   Battle-triggered markings appearing on face/body during peak performance
*   Grants massive power boost but shortens lifespan
*   Only appears when pushing past normal human limits
*   Pattern unique to each Slayer

### 6. **Nichirin Blades**
*   Special swords that change color based on wielder's nature
*   Only these blades can permanently kill demons
*   Color indicates optimal Breathing Style affinity
*   Can be enhanced with poisons derived from wisteria flowers
