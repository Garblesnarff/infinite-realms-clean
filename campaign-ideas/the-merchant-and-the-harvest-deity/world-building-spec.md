    *   **THEN:** Holo's purpose vanishes. Emotional crisis. They must decide: separate now that the journey's pretense is gone, or admit they've fallen in love?
    *   **IF:** They choose to stay together not out of necessity but genuine love.
    *   **THEN:** Lawrence abandons his settled shop dream. Holo chooses mortality's companion over divine solitude. Generate epilogue showing them traveling together forever, merchant and deity, partners in life and trade.
