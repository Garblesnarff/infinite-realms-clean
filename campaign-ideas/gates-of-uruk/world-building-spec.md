**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Humbaba is slain THEN the gods demand punishment for killing their guardian
*   IF Gilgamesh rejects Ishtar THEN she sends the Bull of Heaven in vengeance
*   IF the Bull is killed THEN divine retribution demands a hero's death as balance
*   IF Enkidu dies THEN Gilgamesh's quest for immortality begins in grief and denial
*   IF they reach Utnapishtim THEN they learn immortality's secret but also its costs
*   IF the plant of eternal youth is obtained THEN it can restore youth but is easily lost
*   IF they descend to the underworld THEN they must pass seven gates losing items/power
*   IF Ereshkigal is angered THEN she can trap them in death's realm forever
*   IF they ignore Siduri's wisdom THEN they pursue immortality missing life's meaning
*   IF Gilgamesh accepts mortality THEN he returns to build lasting civilization as legacy
*   IF he continues seeking immortality THEN he wastes his life pursuing the impossible
*   IF the party helps him accept death THEN Uruk flourishes through great works
*   IF divine politics are navigated poorly THEN multiple gods turn against them
*   IF proper rituals and offerings are made THEN gods may show favor or mercy
*   IF legacy through deeds is prioritized THEN true immortality through memory is achieved
