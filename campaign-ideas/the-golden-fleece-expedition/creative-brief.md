# The Golden Fleece Expedition - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Classical Greek Adventure

**Visual:** Ray Harryhausen's *Jason and the Argonauts* (1963) meets classical Greek pottery art. Heroic proportions, Mediterranean beauty, stop-motion monster magic.

**Color Palettes:**
- **The Argo:** Ship-wood brown, white sails, bronze fittings, painted eye on prow
- **Mediterranean:** Azure sea, white foam, golden beaches, olive trees
- **Colchis:** Exotic golds, crimson, foreign architecture, dragon green
- **Monsters:** Bronze (Talos), harpy-feathers, dragon scales, supernatural
- **The Fleece:** Impossible radiant gold, glowing, magical

**Music:** Classical Greek (lyre, aulos) meets swashbuckling adventure. Bernard Herrmann's original score as inspiration.

**Themes:**
- **The Voyage:** Nautical adventure, journey motif, discovery
- **Jason:** Heroic but flawed, charismatic, youthful brass
- **Medea:** Exotic, dangerous, beautiful then terrifying strings
- **The Fleece:** Heavenly choir, shimmering, cursed undertones
- **Tragedy:** Music darkens as consequences unfold

**Voices:**
- **Jason:** Todd Armstrong/Chris Pine—young hero, charismatic
- **Medea:** Maria Callas intensity—passionate, dangerous, tragic
- **Heracles:** Brian Blessed—booming, strongest, larger than life
- **Orpheus:** Gentle poet-musician, James Taylor-esque
- **The Argo:** Ship's voice—ancient, wise, wooden creaking voice

**Cinematic Moments:**
- **Symplegades:** Rocks clashing, ship racing through gap, stern ornament crushed
- **Bronze Bulls:** Fire-breathing automata, Jason protected by magic ointment
- **Dragon Teeth Warriors:** Skeletons rising from earth, fighting each other
- **Talos:** Giant bronze statue coming to life, throwing boulders, ichor draining
- **The Dragon:** Sleepless guardian, Medea's lullaby magic
- **Medea's Revenge:** Poisoned dress burning bride, murder of children, dragon chariot escape
- **Jason's Death:** Alone beneath rotting Argo, timber falls, inglorious end

## Visual Storytelling

**Act 1: Glory** - Bright colors, heroic, exciting. Adventure begins.

**Act 2: Trial** - Increasing danger, exotic locales, monster encounters.

**Act 3: Success** - Golden Fleece obtained, triumphant return.

**Act 4: Tragedy** - Colors darken, relationships sour, curse manifests.

**Act 5: Ruin** - Gray, decayed, broken. Heroes destroyed by victory.

## Harryhausen Influence

**Stop-Motion Aesthetic:** Monsters should feel slightly otherworldly, jerky movement suggesting magic/automation.

**Practical Magic:** Visual effects feel tangible, not pure CGI. Bronze and bone, clay and metal.

**Scale Contrast:** Tiny humans vs. massive monsters. David and Goliath repeatedly.

## Costuming

**The Argonauts:** Mix of Greek styles representing different city-states. Each hero visually distinct.

**Jason:** Simple chiton, brown cloak, bronze sword. Hero of people, not kings.

**Medea:** Exotic Eastern robes (Colchis is foreign), transitions to Greek dress, final scene: goddess-like.

**Heracles:** Lion skin, massive club, bronze greaves. Instantly recognizable.

**The Crew:** Practical sailing gear, bronze armor for combat, individual weapons reflecting personality.
