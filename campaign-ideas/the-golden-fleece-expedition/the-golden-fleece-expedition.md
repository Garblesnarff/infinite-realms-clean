# The Golden Fleece Expedition
**Tagline:** *Gather the greatest heroes, sail beyond the known world, steal the impossible prize—and pray the gods are watching*

## Campaign Overview

Prince Jason has been robbed of his rightful throne by his uncle Pelias. To reclaim it, he must prove himself worthy by accomplishing an impossible task: journey to Colchis at the edge of the world and retrieve the Golden Fleece, a magical ram's hide guarded by a sleepless dragon. The party consists of the Argonauts—the greatest heroes of the age gathered aboard the ship Argo for the adventure of their lives.

This campaign combines Greek mythology, nautical adventure, monster hunting, and collecting legendary heroes. The party will face bronze giants, harpies, clashing rocks, seductive goddesses, and political intrigue. They'll navigate by stars, fight sea monsters, and witness divine intervention. The quest succeeds but at terrible cost—the Fleece is cursed, Medea's love is possessive and deadly, and Jason's triumph leads to tragedy.

**Session 11:** Phineus the prophet—blind seer tormented by harpies who steal/befoul his food. Heroes drive away harpies in exchange for prophecy. He reveals how to pass Symplegades.

**Session 12:** The Symplegades (Clashing Rocks)—moving rocks that crush ships. Must time passage perfectly. Send dove through first (some tail feathers lost). Row through at maximum speed, rocks clash behind, ship loses stern ornament. Last ship to ever pass through (rocks become fixed afterward).

**Session 13:** Black Sea—unknown waters. Strange peoples, hostile tribes. Repeated encounters testing diplomacy, combat, navigation.

**Session 14:** Arrival at Colchis—King Aeetes's golden kingdom. First sight of the Golden Fleece hanging in sacred grove. Guarded by sleepless dragon. Impossible to steal. Need plan.

### Arc 3: Trials of Colchis (Sessions 15-22)
**Session 15:** Court of Aeetes—Jason requests Fleece. Aeetes (knows Jason will die trying) sets trials: Yoke fire-breathing bronze bulls, plow field, plant dragon teeth, defeat warriors that grow from teeth.

**Session 16:** Hera and Aphrodite conspire—make Medea (Aeetes's daughter, sorceress) fall in love with Jason. She approaches secretly, offers magical help in exchange for marriage oath.

**Session 17:** The Bulls of Hephaestus—bronze automata that breathe fire. Jason, protected by Medea's ointment, yokes them, plows field. Other Argonauts provide support/distraction.

**Session 18:** Dragon Teeth Warriors—armed skeletons rise from planted teeth. Medea taught Jason secret: throw stone among them, they fight each other thinking one attacked. Deception instead of strength.

**Session 19:** Aeetes refuses to honor bargain—plans to burn Argo, kill Argonauts. Medea warns Jason. Must steal Fleece and flee.

**Session 20:** Stealing the Fleece—midnight infiltration. Medea uses magic to put guardian dragon to sleep. Jason takes Fleece. Murder of sacred grove guards necessary. Escape begins.

**Session 21:** Pursuit—Aeetes sends fleet. Medea commits terrible crime: kills her own brother Apsyrtus (traveling with them), dismembers body, throws pieces in ocean. Aeetes must stop to collect remains for burial, allowing escape. Horror at what love drove Medea to.

**Session 22:** Divine punishment for murder—Zeus sends storm. Argo driven off course. Speaking timber says they must be purified by Circe (Medea's aunt). Detour to Aeaea.

### Arc 4: The Journey Home (Sessions 23-27)
**Session 23:** Circe's island—reluctantly purifies them of murder, warns about consequences. Continuing curse. Medea and Jason's relationship strained by guilt.

**Session 24:** The Sirens—enchanted singing lures sailors to death. Orpheus plays music more beautiful than theirs, drowns them out. All saved except Butes who jumps overboard (rescued by Aphrodite).

**Session 28:** Corinth—Jason and Medea settle, have children. Years pass. Jason grows ambitious, agrees to marry King Creon's daughter (political alliance). Abandons Medea for power.

**Session 29:** Medea's Revenge—sends poisoned dress to new bride. Bride and her father Creon burn to death. Then Medea murders her own children to hurt Jason. Horror and tragedy. She flees in chariot pulled by dragons (gift from Helios).

**Session 30:** Jason's End—alone, exiled, cursed. Returns to Argo (now beached and rotting). Sits beneath it remembering glory days. Rotten timber falls, kills him. Inglorious death for hero. The Fleece brought only ruin. Epilogue: Argonauts' various fates. Some die gloriously (Achilles's father Peleus), some become legends, some forgotten. The quest succeeded but destroyed them.

## Key NPCs

**Jason** - Charismatic leader, rightful king, tragically flawed. Brave but not strongest/smartest. His power is inspiring others. Ultimately betrays Medea, leading to downfall.

**Medea** - Powerful sorceress, granddaughter of Helios (sun god). Falls obsessively in love with Jason (divine intervention). Betrays family for him. When betrayed in turn, becomes terrifying villain.

**Heracles** - Strongest Argonaut, completing his twelve labors. Leaves quest early (Hylas abduction). Represents impossible standard—even greatest hero can't complete this quest.

**Orpheus** - Musician whose songs charm gods and nature. Provides non-combat solutions. Later loses wife Eurydice, descends to underworld.

**Atalanta** - Huntress, fastest mortal, refused to be excluded because she's female. Proves herself repeatedly. Feminist icon in patriarchal age.

**Pelias** - Usurper uncle, sends Jason on quest expecting him to die. Killed by own daughters through Medea's deception.

**King Aeetes** - Colchis ruler, knows Jason will fail trials (or die trying). Cheating angers him. Pursues vengeance.

**Hera** - Patron goddess (Jason helped her in disguise). Orchestrates quest's success but can't prevent curse.

**Athena** - Helps build Argo, provides tactical advice. Represents wisdom supporting heroism.

**Aphrodite** - Makes Medea love Jason (Hera asked her to). Responsible for tragedy through manufactured passion.

**The Argo** - Ship as character. Talking timber provides prophecy and warnings. Literally carries the team.

**Phineus** - Blind prophet tormented by harpies. Provides crucial navigation intel in exchange for rescue.

**Talos** - Bronze automaton giant. Throws boulders, guards Crete. Ancient technology/magic.

## Major Locations

**Iolcus** - Jason's home kingdom, stolen by Pelias. Starting and midpoint of journey.

**Mount Pelion** - Where Chiron the centaur trained Jason and other heroes.

**Lemnos** - Island of women, temptation to abandon quest for pleasure.

**The Symplegades** - Clashing Rocks, ultimate navigation challenge. Last ship ever passes.

**Colchis** - Eastern kingdom at Black Sea's far shore. Golden kingdom, dragon-guarded Fleece.

**The Sacred Grove** - Where Fleece hangs on tree, guarded by sleepless dragon.

**Crete** - Island guarded by bronze giant Talos.

**Corinth** - Where Jason and Medea settle, where tragedy culminates.

**The Black Sea** - Unknown waters, edge of Greek world, where monsters dwell.

## Unique Mechanics

**Crew Management:** 50+ heroes, each with skills. Assign to tasks (rowing, navigation, combat). Personality conflicts.

**The Ship Speaks:** Argo's prophetic timber warns of dangers, provides cryptic advice. Limited uses.

**Heroic Reputation:** Fame grows with successful trials. High reputation attracts divine attention (good and bad).

**Divine Favor:** Multiple gods involved. Balance competing interests (Hera helps, Poseidon opposes, etc.).

**Medea's Magic:** Provides solutions but moral cost. Each spell she uses makes her more dangerous/unstable.

**The Cursed Fleece:** Possessing it grants power but brings doom. Passive curse affects all who touch it.

**Hero Deaths:** Major NPCs can die. Quest continues without them. Each loss makes journey harder.

## Plot Twists

**Hera Orchestrated Everything:** Jason's quest serves divine politics. Hera wants Medea to kill Pelias (revenge for different slight). Heroes are pawns.

**Medea's Love is Artificial:** Aphrodite's magic made her fall for Jason. Her obsession isn't natural—it's divine manipulation gone wrong.

**The Fleece is Cursed:** Phrixus (original ram) was murdered. His ghost cursed the Fleece. All who possess it suffer.

**Jason's Betrayal:** The hero becomes villain. Abandons Medea and children for political marriage. Greed corrupts.

**Heracles Can't Succeed:** Strongest hero fails (stays searching for Hylas). Suggests quest requires more than strength.

**The Quest Succeeds But Ruins Everyone:** They get the Fleece, Jason reclaims throne (briefly), but curse destroys all. Victory is tragedy.

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Standard Victory:** Retrieve Golden Fleece, return to Greece, present to Pelias. Quest objectively succeeded.

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Get Fleece but at terrible cost—heroes dead, Medea's crimes, eventual tragedy. Success that ruins you.

**Perfect Victory (Impossible?):** Get Fleece, avoid curse, keep Medea sane, defeat Pelias without murder. Likely impossible—curse is fundamental to story.

**Defeat:** Die in trials, ship destroyed by Talos/Symplegades, fail to obtain Fleece, crew mutiny.

**Tragic End:** Jason dies alone, killed by rotten timber. Medea becomes monster. Children murdered. The Fleece brought only ruin. Classical tragedy.

**Alternative Ending:** Refuse the Fleece, realizing curse. Abandon quest, keep crew alive. "Victory" through wisdom not ambition.
