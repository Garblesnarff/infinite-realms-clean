## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 14-18 sessions)

A straightforward heroic quest structure: defeat bosses, gain power, rescue the loved one.

*   **Act I — The Call to Adventure (Sessions 1-5):** Shovel Knight emerges from self-imposed retirement after Shield Knight's disappearance and the Enchantress's rise to power. The party begins their quest, visiting the village and meeting the various wandering characters who provide equipment, upgrades, and side quests. They confront their first members of the Order of No Quarter, learning that each knight has their own personality, motivation, and combat style. The party discovers the Enchantress has corrupted Shield Knight, turning her into an unwilling servant. The Tower of Fate can only be accessed after defeating all eight knights.
*   **Act II — The Order of No Quarter (Sessions 6-14):** The bulk of the campaign is spent challenging the eight strongholds in any order the party chooses. Each location has unique environmental hazards, puzzle-platforming challenges, treasure to dig up, and a climactic boss battle against a themed knight. Between adventures, the party returns to the village to upgrade equipment, take on fishing or cooking mini-quests, and interact with recurring NPCs like the Troupple King, Plague Doctor, and the mysterious Bard. The knights reveal pieces of backstory—some joined willingly, others were coerced, all have honor codes even as enemies.
*   **Act III — The Tower and Truth (Sessions 15-18):** With all eight knights defeated, the Tower of Fate is accessible. The party ascends through increasingly difficult floors filled with the best challenges from previous levels. They face corrupted versions of Shield Knight as mini-bosses, painful reminders of who they're trying to save. At the summit, the Enchantress reveals her true nature: she is an ancient evil possessing Shield Knight's body. The party must defeat her without killing their friend. The final battle requires using all collected abilities and treasures. Victory breaks the possession, reuniting Shovel Knight with Shield Knight and banishing the Enchantress. The Order of No Quarter, impressed by the party's honor, disband peacefully.
