### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Cosmic Repo**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Repo men in bizarre generic Los Angeles repo a glowing Malibu and discover alien conspiracy. Generic products are assimilation tools, coincidences reveal cosmic lattice, and cosmic radiation exposes truth. They must deliver the car while reality becomes increasingly unstable, choosing between completing the job or stopping alien invasion.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Plate o' Shrimp coincidence theory and the lattice connecting reality.
    *   Write the history of alien infiltration through generic consumer products.
    *   Describe previous Malibu deliveries and the repo men who tried and failed/succeeded.
    *   Explain the cosmic radiation and how it reveals truth while breaking minds.
    *   Detail the sacred repo code and philosophy of intense living.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Repo Underground** (Major): Working-class warriors who follow the code, intense living.
    *   **The Aliens** (Major): Two factions—invaders using generic products and warning rebels.
    *   **Government Coverup** (Minor): Agencies insisting on normalcy despite obvious truth.
    *   **Punk Resistance** (Minor): Those who reject generic assimilation through rebellion.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Miller (punk prophet), Bud (veteran repo man), Agent Rogersz (government/alien), Leila (punk aware), J. Frank Parnell (radiation victim).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Repo Man" (follows the code), "Government Agent" (emotionless), "Alien in Disguise" (generic human), "Punk" (sees truth).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Repo Lot:** Home base with impounded vehicles and job board.
*   **Generic LA:** City where everything is white-labeled, identity-stripped for assimilation.
*   **The Punk Clubs:** Underground venues where conspiracy-aware gather.
*   **The Malibu Interior:** Impossibly large trunk containing cosmic horror.
*   **Landing Site:** Desert location where truth and delivery converge.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Exposed to radiation → **THEN:** See aliens, coincidences intensify, reality becomes fluid.
*   **IF:** Follow the lattice → **THEN:** Impossible coincidences guide toward truth.
*   **IF:** Generic products destroyed → **THEN:** Aliens alerted, assimilation plan exposed.
*   **IF:** Deliver the Malibu → **THEN:** Invasion begins/prevented, cosmic revelation.
*   **IF:** Reality stability decreases → **THEN:** Generic facade falls, truth visible everywhere.
