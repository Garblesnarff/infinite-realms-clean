# Creative Brief: The Cosmic Repo

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Punk Neo-Noir with Cosmic Elements (Repo Man-inspired)

Inspired by *Repo Man*—blending 1980s LA punk aesthetic with film noir, generic consumer products with alien conspiracy, and gritty realism with cosmic surrealism. Everything generic conceals deeper cosmic truth.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Generic Everything:** Plain white packaging, products labeled "FOOD," "DRINKS," "BEER"
*   **Punk Aesthetic:** Leather jackets, mohawks, spray paint, DIY culture
*   **Cosmic Glow:** Green radiation, UFO lights, reality distortions
*   **80s LA:** Grimy urban, palm trees, parking lots, neon signs

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Punk conspiracy, alien noir, generic products, cosmic radiation, intense repo life
*   **Feeling:** The paranoia of knowing too much. Punk rebellion against cosmic control. Everything is connected.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Urban Grime:** Faded concrete, rust, dirty whites and beiges
*   **Punk Accents:** Black leather, bright spray paint, neon pink/green
*   **Generic White:** Pure white for all products, stark and suspicious
*   **Cosmic Green:** Radioactive glow from trunk, alien technology
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of faded urban decay—concrete grays, rust oranges, dirty beige buildings. Against this, stark white generic products labeled 'FOOD' in black text. A character in black leather jacket with punk patches. In the background, a car trunk glows eerie green, illuminating the scene with cosmic radiation. Neon signs add pink and blue accents."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Repo Men:** Leather jackets, jeans, tough but worn, working-class punk
*   **Punks:** Mohawks, torn clothes, pins and patches, DIY aesthetic
*   **Government Agents:** Black suits, sunglasses, emotionless, Men in Black style
*   **Aliens:** Disguised as generic humans until radiation reveals true form
*   **Prompt Example:** "A repo man in black leather jacket with 'REPO MAN' on back, jeans, work boots. Tough expression, stubble, slightly worn down. Holding a 'GENERIC' beer can—white with black text. Standing next to a 1964 Chevy Malibu in parking lot at night. Palm trees silhouetted against orange LA sky. Attitude of weary professionalism."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **LA Streets:** 1980s urban decay, parking lots, convenience stores, palm trees
*   **Generic Stores:** Shelves of white products labeled "FOOD," "DRINKS," sterile and wrong
*   **Punk Clubs:** Grimy underground venues, graffiti, loud and chaotic
*   **The Malibu:** Inside the car, glowing green trunk, too much space inside
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a generic convenience store. Every product is in white packaging with black text: 'BEER,' 'CHIPS,' 'SODA.' Fluorescent lighting creates harsh shadows. Shelves perfectly organized but deeply unsettling in their uniformity. A customer in black leather browsing, looking suspicious. Counter with generic 'CLERK' nametag. Everything feels like a facade over deeper truth."

**5. The Malibu:**
*   **Iconic Car:** 1964 Chevy Malibu, slightly beat up but significant
*   **Cosmic Trunk:** Opens to reveal green glowing contents, too deep, alien bodies
*   **Radiation Glow:** Car emanates subtle green aura at night
*   **Impossible Interior:** Bigger inside than outside, spacetime distortion
*   **Prompt Example:** "A 1964 Chevy Malibu in a dark parking lot at night. The trunk is open, glowing intense green light upward illuminating the scene. Inside the trunk: alien bodies wrapped in plastic, strange devices, and cosmic radiation creating lens flare effects. The glow casts eerie shadows. A repo man stands back, shielding eyes from brightness. The car itself seems to vibrate with otherworldly energy."

**6. Cosmic Elements:**
*   **Radiation Glow:** Green luminescence from alien technology
*   **Reality Distortions:** Visual glitches, double-exposures, frame skips
*   **Alien Revelation:** Generic humans revealed as aliens under radiation exposure
*   **UFO Aesthetic:** Classic 50s flying saucer mixed with 80s tech
*   **Prompt Example:** "A scene showing cosmic radiation revealing truth. On left: normal-looking person in generic clothing holding 'FOOD.' On right: same scene but bathed in green glow revealing the person's alien true form—elongated features, large eyes, non-human. The generic products also shimmer, revealing circuitry and alien tech beneath the white labels. Reality itself appears fractured."

**7. Generic Products as Horror:**
*   **Uniform Packaging:** Everything white with black text, no brands
*   **Unsettling Sameness:** Identical products creating unease
*   **Hidden Purpose:** Products contain alien tech, control mechanisms
*   **Visual Motif:** The more generic, the more suspicious
*   **Prompt Example:** "Close-up of shelves stocked with generic products. White cans labeled 'BEER,' white boxes labeled 'FOOD,' white bottles labeled 'DRINKS.' Everything perfectly aligned. But subtle details are wrong—the text sometimes glows faintly green, products hum with energy, shadows fall in wrong directions. The uniformity itself is threatening, suggesting inhuman organization."

**8. Punk Rebellion:**
*   **DIY Aesthetic:** Handmade clothes, spray paint, rough and authentic
*   **Anti-Authority:** Graffiti messages about truth, conspiracy warnings
*   **Music Culture:** Punk bands, underground venues, noise and energy
*   **Attitude:** Rejecting conformity and generic assimilation
*   **Prompt Example:** "A punk club interior. Graffiti covers every surface: 'THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE,' 'GENERIC = CONTROL.' Band on stage—loud and chaotic. Audience in leather and mohawks. Beer cans (generic white 'BEER') litter the floor. Energy is frantic, rebellious, alive. Everything the generic world isn't."

**9. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Film Noir:** Strong shadows, parking lot lights, night dominance
*   **Cosmic Glow:** Green radiation providing unnatural illumination
*   **Harsh Fluorescent:** Generic stores with unflattering overhead lights
*   **Neon Accents:** LA street signs, club entrances, urban punctuation
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh overhead parking lot lights creating strong noir shadows. In the center, the Malibu's trunk glows green, providing eerie unnatural light that illuminates surrounding area. Neon signs from nearby businesses add pink and blue accents. The lighting is uncomfortable—too bright where lit, too dark in shadows. Film grain texture throughout."

## Voice

A deadpan, punk-philosophy narration style like someone who's seen cosmic truth and decided it's just another job. The pacing is casual despite impossible events. The tone shifts between working-class cynicism and cosmic revelation treated with equal nonchalance. Constant repo wisdom: "The life of a repo man is always intense." References to the lattice of coincidence. Role: The voice of someone living in a conspiracy who shrugs and gets back to work.
