## Giant Classification
**Hrímþursar** (Frost Giants): 18-25 feet tall, ice-themed magic, warrior culture, honor-bound, northern Jotunheim. ~10,000 remain.

**Eldjötnar** (Fire Giants): 20-30 feet, fire manipulation, master smiths, aggressive, Muspelheim border. ~5,000 remain.

**Veðrjötnar** (Storm Giants): 25-35 feet, largest, weather control, wise seers, sky-dwelling. ~1,000 remain (rarest).

**Bergrisi** (Mountain Giants): 15-20 feet, earth magic, hermits/philosophers, scattered. ~3,000 remain.

**Trolls** (Lesser Jotun): 8-12 feet, less intelligent, affected by plague too. ~50,000 remain.

**Primordial Giants** (Ancient): 50-100 feet, nearly extinct, descended from Ymir. ~10 exist.

## Historical Timeline
**Before Time**: Ymir (first giant) born from primordial ice. Buri (first god ancestor) born from ice licked by cosmic cow.

**Creation**: Odin and brothers killed Ymir, created world from his body. Giants fled to Jotunheim. Original sin establishing endless enmity.

**Age of Wars**: Millennia of conflict. Gods vs Giants. Many died both sides. Heroes emerged (Thor killed hundreds, giants retaliated).

**Uneasy Peace**: Last thousand years, relative stability. Occasional conflicts but no total war. Both sides rebuilding.

**Campaign Era**: Fimbulwinter begins. Plague weakens giants. Ragnarok approaches.

## Magic System
**Seidr** (Gods' Magic): Fate manipulation, prophecy, transformation. Odin practices (unusual for male god). Freyja taught him.

**Galdr** (Rune Magic): Both gods and giants use. Inscribed on weapons, tools, architecture. Powerful but requires knowledge.

**Jotun Magic** (Giant Innate): Elemental control matching type—frost giants freeze, fire giants burn, storm giants control weather. Racial ability.

**Völva** (Seer Magic): Prophecy, spirit-speaking, fate-reading. Both gods and giants have practitioners. Mysterious, feared, respected.

## Culture Deep Dive
**Giant Society**: Clan-based, honor paramount, hospitality sacred (even toward enemies), poetry valued (flyting contests), dueling resolves disputes, survival of fittest but care for weak. Complex, not barbaric.

**Skaldic Tradition**: Oral history through poetry. Giants compose verses about battles, losses, love. Party can learn giant sagas revealing alternative history.

**The Thing** (Council): Democratic assemblies where issues debated. Jarl leads but clan votes. Egalitarian within honor system.

**Hospitality Law**: Guest-right sacred. Host cannot harm guest, guest cannot harm host. Breaking causes universal condemnation. Mechanically: buff while protected, curse if violated.

## Ragnarok Mechanics
**Prophesied Events**:
1. Fimbulwinter (3 years, no summer)
2. Loki freed from prison
3. Fenrir breaks chains
4. Heimdall blows Gjallarhorn
5. Armies march to Vigrid
6. Gods and giants fight
7. Major figures die (Odin vs Fenrir, Thor vs Jörmungandr, etc.)
8. Surtr burns worlds
9. Survivors rebuild in new world

**Campaign Variables**: Party actions determine which occur, in what order, severity, and whether alternatives exist.

## Key Secrets
- Odin killed Ymir (justified fear of giant revenge)
- Giants were winning pre-plague (prophecy accurate, Odin cheating)
- Loki is giant by birth (complex loyalties)
- Ragnarok is cosmic necessity (rebirth, not end)
- Skadi might betray gods for giant loyalty (or vice versa)
- World-Tree can be damaged (prevents realm-travel, stops Ragnarok but isolates worlds)
- Cure for plague requires World-Tree sap (damaging Yggdrasil accelerates Ragnarok)
- Humans can become gods OR giants through great deeds (party potential)
- Prophecy can self-fulfill (trying to prevent causes it)
- New world after Ragnarok governed by survivors (Baldr returns, some giants live)

## Appendix

This world is **mythology made playable**—respect source material while creating agency. Prophecy is challenge, not railroad. Giants are people, not monsters. Ragnarok is problem to solve (or embrace), not inevitable end.
