# Punk Rock Rebellion - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic:** Urban decay meets DIY culture. Graffiti everywhere, safety pins holding reality together, everything repurposed and reclaimed. Think 1970s-80s punk documentaries meets post-apocalyptic wasteland, but with vibrant street art and defiant energy.

**Visual Influences:**
- 1970s-80s punk photography
- Street art and graffiti culture
- Post-apocalyptic urban settings
- Anarchist zines and DIY aesthetics
- Punk show photography (crowded venues, energy, chaos)
