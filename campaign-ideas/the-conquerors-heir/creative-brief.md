## Art Style: Superhero Realism with Extreme Violence

Inspired by Invincible's unflinching approach to superhero consequences, this style combines classic superhero aesthetics with brutal realism about violence and destruction.

### Core Principles:

*   **Superhero Iconography:** Classic costumes, dynamic poses, but grounded in realistic consequences.
*   **Graphic Violence:** Don't shy away from showing the true cost of super-powered combat.
*   **Emotional Realism:** Character expressions show trauma, exhaustion, and moral weight.

### Style Guide:

**1. Overall Vibe:** Bright superhero world gradually revealing dark undercurrents.

**2. Character Design:**
*   Titanius: Classic Superman-like appearance—strong jaw, heroic costume—but eyes that can go from warm to terrifyingly cold.
*   Young Heroes: Varied powersets and costumes, showing inexperience through design.

**3. Color Palette:**
*   Early Sessions: Bright primary colors, classic superhero palette.
*   Later Sessions: Colors become more muted, showing wear and damage.
*   Violence Scenes: Bright red blood against superhero costumes creates jarring contrast.

**4. Combat Depiction:**
*   Show the destruction—buildings collapse, civilians flee, cities burn.
*   Show injuries realistically—this is not bloodless superheroics.

## Voice

**Titanius:** Deep, authoritative male voice that can shift from inspiring to terrifying. Think heroic Superman voice that occasionally cracks to reveal alien coldness.

## Music & Audio

*   **Heroic Themes:** Classic superhero orchestral music for early sessions.
*   **Shift to Horror:** Music becomes discordant and tense as betrayal unfolds.
*   **Battle Music:** Epic but tinged with tragedy—every victory costs something.
