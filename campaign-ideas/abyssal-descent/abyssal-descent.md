# Abyssal Descent

*A Horror / Survival campaign — Short Campaign (10–15 sessions) — Very Hard difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Abyssal Descent
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Horror / Survival / Psychological Terror / Cave Descent
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 10–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **10–11** (if they survive)
**Tone (keywords):** terrifying, claustrophobic, sanity-breaking, dark, desperate, isolating, crushing
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party joins an expedition to descend the Infinite Chasm, a vertical cave system that supposedly reaches the center of the earth. What begins as scientific exploration becomes a nightmare as the depths reveal horrors that shatter sanity—impossible geometry, creatures that exist outside normal reality, and the crushing realization that something at the bottom is calling them down. Equipment fails, party members disappear or go mad, and the only way out is through. Inspired by The Descent, Dead Space, and cosmic horror, this campaign asks: what happens when you descend too far and the darkness begins descending into you?

## Key Locations

1. **The Upper Chasm**: Normal caves giving way to impossible depths.
2. **The Blind Cathedral**: Massive cavern where creatures hunt by sound; absolute silence required.
3. **The Inverted Halls**: Geometry that shouldn't exist; gravity behaves strangely.
4. **The Screaming Gallery**: Walls that remember everyone who died here.
5. **The Bottom**: Where reality breaks down completely.

## Unique Mechanics

* **Sanity System**: Witnessing horrors degrades sanity; madness leads to various conditions.
* **Light Is Limited**: Strict torch/light tracking; running out means death.
* **No Way But Down**: Can't turn back—cave-ins and creature pursuit force constant descent.
* **Death Is Permanent**: This is survival horror; character death is likely and meaningful.
* **Trust Breaks**: Paranoia mechanics; party members may be compromised without knowing.

## Central Conflict

Can the party maintain humanity, teamwork, and sanity while descending into literal and psychological hell? Is survival worth the cost of witnessing the impossible?
