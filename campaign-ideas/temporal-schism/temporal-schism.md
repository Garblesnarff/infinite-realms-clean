# Temporal Schism
*Every Choice Creates a World*

## Campaign Overview

The party wakes with fragmented memories of a catastrophic event that hasn't happened yet—or has it? The city of Chronopolis exists in temporal flux, where past, present, and future bleed together. Time travel has been achieved, but at terrible cost: reality is branching uncontrollably. Every choice creates a parallel timeline, and those timelines are colliding. The party finds themselves unstuck in time, jumping between divergent presents where different choices were made, creating different worlds.

They discover they're the nexus point—the catalyst whose choices matter most. In one timeline, they're heroes who saved the world. In another, villains who destroyed it. In a third, they never existed. An entity called the Temporal Overseer claims the only solution is to collapse all timelines into one "correct" reality, erasing countless worlds. But who decides which timeline deserves to exist?

The campaign explores destiny, free will, and the weight of choice. Every decision creates a branch they must eventually confront. The question isn't whether to prevent the catastrophe, but which version of reality—and themselves—to preserve.

## Core Themes

- **Determinism vs. Free Will**: Are our choices real or predetermined?
- **The Butterfly Effect**: Small choices ripple into massive consequences
- **Alternate Selves**: Meeting who you could have been
- **The Weight of Unlived Lives**: Mourning possibilities
- **Sacrifice of Potential**: Choosing one reality means killing infinite others

## Session Breakdown (28 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The First Loop (Sessions 1-5)
Party experiences the catastrophe, dies, wakes up hours earlier. Déjà vu intensifies. Realize they're in time loop. Small changes lead to different outcomes. Can't prevent catastrophe, only delay it.

### Arc 2: Temporal Fracture (Sessions 6-11)
Loop breaks but not fixed—fractured. Party starts jumping between alternate timelines where they made different choices. Meet alternate selves: the hero, the villain, the broken, the transcendent. None remember making timeline-splitting choices.

### Arc 3: The Butterfly Hunters (Sessions 12-17)
Antagonist group trying to prune timelines, collapse multiverse. Believe only one timeline should exist. Party must decide: Help them (stability through limitation) or oppose them (diversity through chaos)?

### Arc 4: The Original Sin (Sessions 18-23)
Discover the first divergence point—when they gained time powers. That choice branched reality. Every timeline is their fault. Can undo everything by preventing their past selves from gaining powers, but that erases them from existence.

### Arc 5: The Final Timeline (Sessions 24-28)
Choose which timeline to preserve. Require traveling to crucial decision points, ensuring "correct" choices happen. But each party member wants different timeline. Must they reach consensus or will they fracture too? Final confrontation with selves across timelines deciding which deserves to live.

## Key NPCs

### The Temporal Overseer
Extradimensional being existing outside time. Sees all timelines simultaneously. Views branching as disease threatening multiverse stability. Genuinely trying to help but doesn't grasp meaning of individual lives. "Only one timeline can exist. Help me choose which."

### Your Alternate Selves
Each timeline has version of party:
- **The Hero**: Made all right choices, saved everyone, universally loved
- **The Villain**: Made all wrong choices, destroyed everything, hunted
- **The Broken**: Traumatized by choices' weight, gave up
- **The Transcendent**: Accepted temporal nature, lives across timelines
- **The Dead**: Died making noble sacrifice
- **The Hollow**: Chose safety, lost purpose

### Dr. Cassandra Chen (Temporal Scientist)
Invented time travel, regrets it deeply. Trying to fix what she broke. Different versions in each timeline ranging from helpful ally to desperate villain. Constant: She's sorry.

### The Butterfly Hunters
Zealot organization collapsing timelines. Led by Adamant Prophet who believes free will is illusion and chaos of choice must end. Some members are alternate versions of party who chose to prune themselves.

### The Fixed Point
One NPC who remains identical across all timelines. Their death is constant, unchangeable. Represents destiny's limits. Their acceptance of fate challenges party's insistence on choice.

### Future You
Visits from timeline where party "succeeded." But they're hollow, traumatized. Warn against path they're on. Or are they trying to prevent party from making better choice than they did?

## Major Locations

### Chronopolis (Multiple Versions)
City existing in temporal flux. Geography similar but details vary wildly by timeline:
- **Timeline A**: Utopia where catastrophe prevented
- **Timeline B**: Wasteland after disaster
- **Timeline C**: Police state controlling time to prevent change
- **Timeline D**: Anarchist paradise where all choices valid
- **Timeline E**: Doesn't exist—this timeline's Chronopolis was destroyed

### The Nexus
Where all timelines intersect. Only stable point in temporal chaos. Party's home base but constantly shifting as timelines merge and split. Meeting point for alternate selves.

### The Moment
The exact point where catastrophe occurs/occurred/will occur. Time breaks here completely. All possibilities exist simultaneously. Approaching causes temporal vertigo—experiencing all outcomes at once.

### The Prime Timeline
Theoretical original timeline before branching. May not exist. Butterfly Hunters seek it obsessively. May be nostalgic fiction—memory of simpler time.

### The Collapsed Zones
Timelines that Butterfly Hunters successfully pruned. Now void space, empty of possibility. Entering shows ghostly remnants of erased lives. Haunting evidence of erasure's cost.

## Unique Mechanics

### Timeline Navigation
Party can jump between branches:
- Deliberate: Using technology/magic
- Random: When paradox stress high
- Triggered: When making significant choice
- Each jump shows consequence of alternate choice

### Paradox Stress
Track temporal instability (0-100):
- Increases with timeline jumps, paradox creation, meeting alternate selves
- High stress causes random timeline shifts, memory conflicts, existence doubt
- At 100: Timeline collapse or party erasure

### Memory Fragments
Gaining memories from other timelines:
- Sometimes helpful (know things haven't learned)
- Often confusing (remember events that didn't happen here)
- Occasionally horrifying (remember dying in other timelines)
- Question: Which memories are "yours"?

### Butterfly Points
Major decision moments:
- Mark timeline split
- Can return to these points to change choice
- But changing erases everything that came from original choice
- Including people who only exist because of original choice

### Temporal Echoes
Alternate selves can communicate across timelines:
- Messages left for other versions
- Advice, warnings, apologies
- Sometimes help, sometimes mislead
- Question: Do you trust your other selves?

## Plot Twists

1. **You Caused The Catastrophe**: Investigation reveals party's time travel attempt caused the disaster they're trying to prevent
2. **The Loop Was Protection**: Time loop was containing disaster. Breaking it released catastrophe across timelines
3. **The Overseer Is Alternate You**: The extradimensional being is party from far future who transcended time completely
4. **No Original Timeline**: There never was prime timeline. Reality has always been branching. "Original" is myth
5. **One Character Is Fixed Point**: One party member dies in every timeline. They discover this. How do they react?
6. **The Catastrophe Is Necessary**: Disaster creates conditions for better future. Preventing it dooms timeline to worse fate

## Victory Conditions

### Single Timeline Victory
Choose one timeline to preserve, collapse others. Stability achieved but infinite possibilities lost. Survivor's guilt for erased worlds.

### Multiverse Acceptance Victory
Accept branching reality, manage it rather than fix it. Chaos continues but diversity preserved. Learn to live with consequences.

### Paradox Resolution Victory
Find way to stabilize all timelines simultaneously. No choice is wrong, all realities valid. Complex but complete.

### Transcendence Victory
Party transcends linear time like Overseer. Exist across all timelines simultaneously. No longer bound by single choice. But no longer truly human.

## Defeat Conditions

### Timeline Collapse
All realities merge catastrophically. Contradictions annihilate each other. Party and all timelines erased from existence.

### Trapped in Loop
Return to original loop but can't break out again. Eternal recurrence, living same day trying to prevent inevitable catastrophe.

### Erased from Existence
Paradox becomes so great that party never existed in any timeline. They fade while aware they're fading, knowing they'll be forgotten.

### Wrong Timeline Chosen
Select timeline to preserve but it's worse than alternatives. Live with guilt of choosing wrong, killing better worlds.
