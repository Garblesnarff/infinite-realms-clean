# World-Building Specification Brief: The Silence Hunts

**Core Concept:** Blind, armored predators called Shriekers hunt by sound alone. Survivors must live in absolute silence. The party journeys from their compromised farmstead to Haven's End, a town protected by a sound barrier.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Shriekers' origin: extraplanar invaders from the Resonant Void, arriving 3 years ago.
*   The fall of civilization: cities collapsed first (too loud), rural areas survived longer.
*   Haven's End and the Resonator: an engineer's desperate invention using resonance crystals.
*   Shrieker biology: blind, echolocate via sound-sensing organs, armored hide, vulnerable to sustained noise and extreme cold.
*   Survivor culture: sign language, sand paths, noise traps, community bonds.

**Factions:**
*   **Haven's End Survivors** (Major): 200 people in a walled town, protected by the Resonator, led by Council and Thane.
*   **The Nomads** (Minor): Wandering survivor groups like Elara's, distrustful and self-sufficient.
*   **The Shriekers** (Major Antagonist): Spreading across the world, establishing nests, breeding rapidly.

**NPCs (Tier 1):**
*   Marcus (Dead): The traveler whose scream dooms the farm.
*   Elara Whitewood: Nomad leader, pragmatic and jaded.
*   Thane: Haven's End engineer, anxious but brilliant.
*   The Alpha Shrieker: Larger, more intelligent variant guarding the nest.

**Locations:**
*   **The Farmstead:** Party's starting home, fortified with sand paths and noise traps.
*   **The Silent Road:** 50 miles of dangerous travel through ruins, forests, and rivers.
*   **The Shrieker Nest:** Dark lair inside an old communication tower, filled with sleeping Shriekers and eggs.
*   **Haven's End:** Walled town with the Resonator, humanity's hope.

**Causality Chains:**
*   IF party makes noise during travel: Shrieker ambush, must flee or hide.
*   IF party helps Elara's group: Gains allies but increases risk.
*   IF party fails to retrieve crystal: Haven's End falls, campaign becomes survival horror.
*   IF party successfully restores Resonator: Haven's End saved, Shriekers driven back temporarily.
*   IF party kills Alpha Shrieker in nest: Other Shriekers become disorganized, easier escape.
