# Creative Brief: The Silence Hunts

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Muted Post-Apocalyptic Realism

Inspired by *A Quiet Place*, emphasizing silent tension, family bonds, and the constant threat of sound-based predators. The world is overgrown, abandoned, and oppressively quiet.

### Core Principles:
*   **Silence as Atmosphere:** Visual emphasis on stillness, muted colors, and the absence of motion.
*   **Expressive Communication:** Show sign language, desperate facial expressions, and body language as primary communication.
*   **The Shriekers:** Biomechanical horror—blind, armored, all teeth and claws, designed to respond to sound.
*   **Family Survival:** Focus on small groups protecting each other in an abandoned world.

### Style Guide:

**Colors:** Muted earth tones, grays, faded greens. The Shriekers are dark gray with chitinous armor. Blood and danger moments add stark red contrast.

**Characters:** Ordinary people in practical, worn clothing. Bare feet (to move silently). Faces show constant tension and silent communication. Shriekers are biomechanical nightmares—eyeless faces, massive clawed limbs, sound-sensing organs visible.

**Environments:** Overgrown farmlands, abandoned villages, forests that have reclaimed roads. Everything is silent, still, and decomposing. Safe spaces have sand paths and sound-dampening materials.

**Lighting:** Natural, diffused light. Dawn and dusk dominate. Shadows are deep. Shriekers move in darkness.

**Composition:** Wide shots emphasizing isolation and vulnerability. Close-ups on silent communication and terror. Frame Shriekers as silhouettes or partially seen horrors.

## Voice

A barely-audible whisper, male, with long pauses and suppressed emotion. The tone carries exhausted determination and constant fear. Audio is pristine but minimal, with long silences broken only by essential words. Role: A survivor recounting the rules of the new world to a newcomer—knowing a single mistake means death.
