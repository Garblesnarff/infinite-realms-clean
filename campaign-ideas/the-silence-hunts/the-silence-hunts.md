## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Silence Hunts
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Stealth Horror / Survival / Family Drama / Post-Apocalyptic
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **6–7**
**Tone (keywords):** silent tension, family bonds, innovative survival, oppressive threat
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The world has been overrun by the Shriekers—blind, armored predators that hunt by sound alone. Any noise above a whisper draws them instantly, and they are nearly impossible to kill. The party is a family or tight-knit group surviving in a fortified farmstead, communicating only through sign language and carefully placed sound markers. When their sanctuary is discovered by the creatures, they must undertake a desperate, silent journey to reach a rumored safe haven—a community that has found a way to fight back.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A story of survival through silence, ingenuity, and sacrifice.

*   **Act I — The Rules (Sessions 1–2):** The party lives on a fortified farmstead where silence is survival. They have established careful routines: walking on sand paths, using sign language, creating diversions. When a traveler arrives and makes noise, the Shriekers discover the farm. The party must evacuate, taking only what they can carry, and begin a silent journey to Haven's End—a fortified town rumored to have a defense against the Shriekers.
*   **Act II — The Silent Road (Sessions 3–4):** The party travels through a post-apocalyptic landscape, navigating ruined villages, abandoned roads, and monster-infested forests. Every step must be silent. They encounter other survivors, some helpful, some desperate. They discover that the Shriekers are breeding and spreading. At night, they must hide in absolute silence as packs of Shriekers patrol.
*   **Act III — Haven's End (Sessions 5–6):** The party reaches Haven's End and discovers its secret: a constant high-frequency sound barrier that disorients the Shriekers. But the barrier is failing. The party must help repair it, which requires venturing into a Shrieker nest to retrieve components. The final session is a tense, silent infiltration of the nest, followed by a desperate race back to Haven's End as the barrier is restored.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Way We Live Now"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / World-Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party's daily life is shown: tending crops on sand paths, using sign language, maintaining noise traps (wind chimes, bells) to distract Shriekers.
    *   A traveler, Marcus, arrives seeking refuge. He is injured and desperate. The party helps him, teaching him the rules of silence.
    *   That night, Marcus has a nightmare and screams. A Shrieker descends on the farm within seconds, killing Marcus and alerting others to the farm's location.
**Escalation:** The party has hours to evacuate before a full pack arrives.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The Silent March"
*   **Focus:** Stealth / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must travel cross-country to Haven's End, 50 miles away. They carry limited supplies and must scavenge without making noise.
    *   They encounter obstacles: a rickety bridge (Dex checks to cross silently), a ruined village (must sneak past sleeping Shriekers), a river (must find a way to cross without splashing).
    *   They meet another survivor group led by Elara, who trades information: "Haven's End has a sound barrier. It's the only place left." But Elara's group is attacked by Shriekers that night, and the party must decide whether to help (risky) or flee (safe).
**Escalation:** A child in the party accidentally drops a canteen. A Shrieker hears it and begins hunting them.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Nest"
*   **Focus:** Infiltration / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party reaches Haven's End, a walled town of 200 survivors protected by a high-frequency sound emitter called the Resonator.
    *   The town's engineer, Thane, explains: "The Resonator is failing. We need a replacement resonance crystal from the old communication tower—but it's inside a Shrieker nest."
    *   The party must infiltrate the nest: a dark, twisted lair filled with dozens of sleeping Shriekers and their young. One wrong step, one noise, and they're dead.
    *   They retrieve the crystal, but the nest begins to wake. They must escape in absolute silence as Shriekers stir around them.
**Escalation:** A party member is injured during the escape, and their labored breathing risks alerting the Shriekers.

### Session 6 — "The Barrier"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Sacrifice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party returns to Haven's End just as the Resonator fails completely. Shriekers swarm the town walls.
    *   Thane installs the crystal, but it requires 5 minutes to boot up. The party must hold the gates in absolute silence, using only silent weapons (bows, crossbows, melee) and improvised traps.
    *   The final challenge: someone must create a loud diversion far from the town to draw the Shriekers away long enough for the Resonator to activate. This is a suicide mission unless the party finds a creative solution (remote explosives, clockwork devices, magical illusions).
**Resolution:** The Resonator activates, driving the Shriekers away. Haven's End is saved, but the party has lost something—innocence, loved ones, or their old way of life.

    *   **Personality:** Desperate, traumatized, and ultimately doomed.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Marcus is fleeing from a group he betrayed. His guilt manifests as nightmares.

2.  **Elara Whitewood** — *The Survivor Leader*

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of adaptation, the cost of survival, and the bonds that keep us human in inhuman times. The central conflict is maintaining absolute silence while navigating deadly threats—every dice roll for Stealth is life or death. The party must also grapple with impossible choices: sacrifice one to save many, or risk everyone to save one?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Sound System**
*   All actions are assigned a **Noise Level**: Silent (0), Whisper (1), Normal (2), Loud (3), Deafening (4).
*   Shriekers detect sounds of Level 2 or higher within 120 feet instantly.
*   Actions and their Noise Levels:
    *   Walking slowly on soft ground: Silent (0)
    *   Whispering: Whisper (1)
    *   Walking on hard ground, drawing a weapon: Normal (2)
    *   Running, combat, dropping metal objects: Loud (3)
    *   Spells with verbal components, explosions, screams: Deafening (4)
*   Players can reduce Noise Level by 1 with a successful **Stealth check (DC 12)**.

### 2. **Shrieker Behavior**
*   Shriekers are blind but have 120 feet of sound-based "vision."
*   When they detect sound:
    *   Level 2: Investigate (move toward sound cautiously).
    *   Level 3+: Attack (charge directly toward sound).
*   Shriekers have AC 18 (armored hide), HP 60, and deal 3d10+5 damage. They are meant to be avoided, not fought.
*   Stunning a Shrieker requires sustained loud noise (DC 15 Constitution save) or extreme cold.

### 3. **Silent Communication**
*   The party uses sign language and pre-arranged signals. Players should roleplay this:
    *   Use hand gestures or write notes to each other in real life.
    *   No verbal communication unless the party is in a "safe" zone (like Haven's End's Resonator field).
*   This creates immersion and tension.

### 4. **Sacrifice and Diversion**
*   At climactic moments, the party may need to create loud diversions to draw Shriekers away.
*   This can be done with:
    *   Remote explosives (timed or triggered).
    *   Magical illusions that create sound.
    *   NPC volunteers (tragic but effective).
*   The party must weigh the moral cost of sending someone (or something) to their death.
