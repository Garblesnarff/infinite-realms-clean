# Creative Brief: The Service Guild of Genuine Hearts

## Art Style: Cynical Social Drama (Oregairu-inspired)

Captures the contrast between bright social settings and the darker, more honest psychological drama underneath. Modern school environments with emphasis on subtle character expressions revealing hidden thoughts.

### Core Principles:

*   **Subtle Expression:** Characters say one thing but their eyes reveal another. Emphasis on nuanced facial expressions.
*   **Social Masks:** The gap between public persona and private truth visualized.
*   **Muted Realism:** Realistic, slightly desaturated colors reflecting the cynical tone.

### Detailed Style Guide:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:** Cynical, thoughtful, painfully honest, socially complex, ultimately hopeful.

**2. Color Palette:** Muted, realistic colors. Cool blues and grays for the service guild room. Warmer but still subdued colors for social scenes.

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Hachiman:** Dead fish eyes, slouched posture, unremarkable appearance. His ordinariness is the point.
*   **Yukino:** Beautiful, cold, perfect posture, long dark hair. Ice queen aesthetic.
*   **Yui:** Warm, approachable, pink/orange color scheme, friendly appearance.

**4. Backgrounds:** Modern academy, service guild room (sparse, quiet), various social settings, Yukino's cold family estate.

**5. Lighting:** Natural, often overcast or indoor lighting. Not overly bright or romantic—realistic and sometimes harsh.

## Voice

**Narrator Voice (Hachiman's Internal Monologue):** Deeply cynical, sarcastic, self-deprecating but secretly kind. The voice of someone who uses humor and cynicism to deflect from pain. Gradually becomes more honest and vulnerable. Studio-quality with the tone of internal thought—intimate and unfiltered.
