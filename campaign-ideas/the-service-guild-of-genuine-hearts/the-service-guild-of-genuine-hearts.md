### Core Premise
Hachiman Hikigaya is a cynical human rogue with dead fish eyes and a philosophy that youth is a lie—all social relationships are fake, built on pretense and self-interest. After writing a brutally honest essay mocking social conventions, he's forced by his teacher into the "Service Guild," a club dedicated to helping students with their problems. There he meets two girls: Yukino Yukinoshita, an ice queen wizard from a prestigious family who solves problems through harsh rationality, and Yui Yuigahama, a cheerful cleric who desperately wants everyone to get along. Forced to work together helping classmates with various social crises, Hachiman applies his cynical but effective methods (often sacrificing his own reputation to solve problems), while gradually realizing that his fear of genuine connection might be the real lie he's telling himself.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Service Guild Forms (Sessions 1-4)**
- Hachiman joins the Service Guild. Meet Yukino (initially antagonistic) and Yui (initially confused by him). First cases: helping a girl confess to a guy, solving a group project dispute, rescuing someone from a bad relationship. Hachiman's methods work but are self-destructive. The three develop unusual dynamics.

**Act 2: Complications and Connections (Sessions 5-10)**
- More complex cases reveal deeper issues. The student council election arc where Hachiman sacrifices his reputation to achieve the desired outcome, shocking Yukino and Yui. Summer camp where the three grow closer. Cultural festival preparation. Hachiman begins to realize he cares about Yukino and Yui's opinions. Both girls develop feelings for him, though he's oblivious.

**Act 3: Codependency Crisis (Sessions 11-13)**
- A major case (helping someone with a request that mirrors the trio's own issues) forces them to confront their relationship. Hachiman realizes their "help" has become codependent—they're using the guild to avoid addressing their own feelings. Yukino reveals her family pressure and feeling of inadequacy. Yui admits she's been hiding her true feelings to keep peace. Hachiman must choose: continue using cynical methods and fake relationships, or risk genuine vulnerability.

**Act 4: Genuine (Sessions 14-15)**
- Hachiman makes a genuine request of his own: he wants "something genuine" with them, not fake friendship or pretense. This forces all three to be honest. Yukino confronts her family. Yui admits her feelings. Hachiman must choose between the two girls, or find another answer. Resolution involves accepting that while youth might be full of lies, genuine connection is possible if you're willing to be vulnerable. The Service Guild continues, but now built on actual honesty rather than convenient pretense.

### Central Conflict
Is genuine connection possible in a world of social facades, or is cynicism the only honest response? The tension between self-protection through isolation and the risk of vulnerability for genuine relationships.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Request Cases**: Each arc involves solving someone's social problem. Use Investigation, Insight, and Persuasion. Hachiman's cynical solutions work but often at cost to his own social standing.
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Track the unusual three-way dynamic. It's not a simple love triangle—it's three people who need each other's perspectives but struggle with codependency.
- **The Self-Sacrifice Play**: Hachiman can solve problems by making himself the villain, taking the social hit. This works mechanically but damages relationship scores.
- **Genuine vs. Fake**: Track whether interactions are "genuine" (honest, vulnerable) or "fake" (convenient, pretense). The goal is to increase genuine moments.
- **Internal Monologue**: Hachiman's cynical narration contrasts with his actual kind actions. Use this to show character depth.
- **The Choice**: Eventually, Hachiman must make a genuine choice about relationships, acknowledging real feelings rather than hiding behind cynicism.
