They navigate LA's supernatural underworld—Sub Rosa magicians, vampire clans, angel conspiracies, and demon incursions—while hunting those responsible for their damnation.

In this LA, Heaven and Hell war in shadows, magic is real and dangerous, and sometimes the monster is the hero.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of revenge, revelation, and preventing apocalypse.

*   **Act I — Return and Revenge (Sessions 1-6):** The Hell-scarred protagonist returns to LA and reunites with allies, discovering the city's hidden supernatural society—the Sub Rosa. They begin hunting the magic circle that betrayed them: Mason Faim and his conspirators. Along the way, they encounter Kasabian (their former friend turned enemy), Candy (demon-possessed human ally), and Vidocq (centuries-old alchemist). They learn about Room 8—a supernatural video store that connects to other dimensions. Their revenge quest reveals that Mason's betrayal was part of larger plan involving Hellions wanting to invade Earth.
*   **Act II — Hell Comes to LA (Sessions 7-13):** The party discovers Hellion generals have plans for Earth invasion, with corrupt angels secretly supporting them. They're drawn into conflicts with the Vigil (government supernatural agents), vampire nests, and rogue Sub Rosa factions. They learn about the Key to the Room—an artifact that could open or close Hell itself. The protagonist's infernal powers grow stronger but at cost of humanity. They face Mason Faim in confrontation, but his death triggers worse events. Heaven's angel factions war over policy toward Hell, and some seek to use the party as weapons.
*   **Act III — Apocalypse Averted (Sessions 14-20):** Heaven and Hell's conspiracy is fully revealed—certain angels and demons seek mutual benefit through human suffering. The party must stop an apocalypse plot while navigating angelic politics and Hellion invasions. They travel between Hell, Heaven, and Earth, facing generals, archangels, and ancient evils. Final confrontations involve fighting in Hell's arena again (but now as invaders), facing Lucifer himself, and deciding the fate of the barriers between worlds. Some endings involve ruling Hell, others destroying the Key, others forging new pacts between realms. Violence is always the answer, but the question is what comes after.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of revenge's cost, surviving trauma, maintaining humanity after Hell, and whether violence solves problems. It asks: Does vengeance satisfy or hollow you? Can you return from Hell unchanged? Are angels actually good? The central conflict pits the protagonist's need for revenge against larger conspiracies threatening reality, while they struggle to maintain humanity despite becoming the monster that survives.
