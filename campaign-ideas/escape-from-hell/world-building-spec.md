### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Escape from Hell**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A survivor escapes Hell after 11 years in the arena and returns to LA seeking revenge on the magic circle that sent them there. They navigate supernatural LA—Sub Rosa magicians, vampire clans, and angel conspiracies—while discovering Hellion invasion plots and corrupt angels. With infernal powers and combat skills, they must decide between vengeance and preventing apocalypse. Violence is the language, survival is the goal.

    *   Write the history of the Sub Rosa—LA's hidden magical society with factions and politics.
    *   Describe Heaven's bureaucracy and angelic factions—some corrupt, some zealous, some tired.
    *   Explain the Key to the Room—artifact that could open or close Hell permanently.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Protagonist uses too much infernal power → **THEN:** Risks losing humanity, becoming more monster than human.
*   **IF:** Hell's ruler is absent → **THEN:** Power vacuum causes chaos threatening Earth invasion.
*   **IF:** The Key is activated → **THEN:** Could permanently open or close Hell, reshaping reality.
*   **IF:** Angels and Hellions cooperate → **THEN:** Apocalypse becomes more likely as both sides benefit.
*   **IF:** Old Gods wake → **THEN:** Reality itself threatened, current order (angels/demons) must unite or perish.
