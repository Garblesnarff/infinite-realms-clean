# Creative Brief: The Stars Are Right

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Lovecraftian Horror Illustration (Beksinski meets Victorian Engraving)

Inspired by the nightmarish surrealism of Zdzisław Beksiński combined with the intricate detail of 19th-century engravings, this style captures the cosmic horror and unknowable dread of Lovecraft's universe. It blends decaying antiquity with alien geometry, creating images that feel simultaneously ancient and utterly wrong.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Non-Euclidean Geometry:** Architecture and landscapes should feature impossible angles, recursive patterns, and structures that seem to defy physical laws.
*   **Organic Corruption:** Clean surfaces are invaded by barnacles, scales, tentacles, or fungal growths. The boundary between architecture and living tissue blurs.
*   **Scale and Insignificance:** Emphasize the smallness of humans against vast, incomprehensible cosmic entities and cyclopean architecture.
*   **Muted, Sickly Palette:** Greens, grays, browns, and deep ocean blues. Colors feel diseased, water-stained, or corrupted.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Cosmic horror, unknowable, sanity-eroding, ancient, decayed, alien, Non-Euclidean, tentacular, eldritch, cyclopean.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense of wrongness. The architecture is too old, the angles are impossible, the creatures shouldn't exist. Viewers should feel small, insignificant, and deeply unsettled. Beauty is twisted into something grotesque.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Extremely detailed, intricate line work reminiscent of Victorian engravings for architectural elements and human figures. Organic elements (tentacles, scales, alien flesh) should be rendered with disturbing anatomical precision.
*   **Textures:** Weathered stone covered in barnacles and slime, scaly amphibian skin, waterlogged wood, ancient crumbling parchment, wet cobblestones.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed illustration in the style of 19th-century engraving combined with Beksiński's surrealism. The scene shows a decaying waterfront with buildings that feature impossible, Non-Euclidean angles, their surfaces encrusted with barnacles and strange, pulsating growths."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, sickly, and decayed. Dominated by deep ocean greens, slate grays, muddy browns, and sickly yellows. Deep, dark blues for water and night skies.
*   **Accent Colors:** Bioluminescent greens or blues for Deep One eyes or magical effects. Diseased purples and reds for corrupted flesh or forbidden rituals.
*   **Forbidden:** Bright, cheerful colors. Even moonlight should feel cold and unwelcoming.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette of deep ocean greens, slate grays, and sickly yellows, as if everything has been stained by centuries of saltwater and decay. The only bright spots are the eerie bioluminescent green glow of Deep One eyes in the darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Humans are gaunt, desperate, and often bear signs of madness (wild eyes, disheveled appearance, unconscious self-harm). Characters with "the Innsmouth Look" have receding hairlines, bulging eyes, and fish-like mouths.
*   **Deep Ones:** Amphibious humanoids with frog-like and fish-like features, scales, webbed hands, and gills. They move with unnatural fluidity.
*   **Cosmic Entities:** Only ever partially shown. A tentacle emerging from shadow, an eye too large to fully perceive, geometry that makes the viewer's eyes water. Never show Cthulhu in full—only suggest his impossible scale.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gaunt investigator in a Victorian-era coat, his face showing the strain of forbidden knowledge—eyes ringed with dark circles, a slight tremor in his hands. Behind him, a figure with the Innsmouth Look: bulging, unblinking eyes, a mouth that's too wide, skin with a faint green sheen of scales just beginning to emerge."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Decaying coastal towns with Georgian and Victorian architecture warped into impossible angles. Underwater scenes show cyclopean cities of green stone. Mountains and monasteries feel hostile and alien.
*   **Atmosphere:** Perpetual mist and rain in coastal scenes. Underwater scenes are murky with poor visibility. The sky, when seen, should feel vast and uncaring, stars arranged in disturbing patterns.
*   **Details:** Occult symbols carved into stone, water damage and mold on every surface, fish motifs that gradually become more explicitly tentacular, statues of hybrid gods.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The port town of Innsmouth at twilight, a perpetual fog rolling in from the ocean. Georgian townhouses lean at impossible angles, their windows dark and vacant. The architecture features recurring fish and octopus motifs that become increasingly disturbing the longer one looks. Cobblestone streets glisten with moisture, and the air seems thick with brine and decay."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Heavy use of shadows and negative space. Light sources are minimal—weak moonlight, flickering oil lamps, or the bioluminescent glow of deep-sea creatures.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and oppressive, often hiding more than they reveal. Shadows should contain suggestions of tentacles, eyes, or impossible shapes.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates paranoia. The viewer should always feel something lurks just beyond the light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit only by weak, cold moonlight filtering through fog, creating deep shadows that seem to move independently. The darkness is absolute in places, and within it, suggested shapes writhe—tentacles, eyes, things that shouldn't be."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use extreme low angles to show the impossibly tall architecture of R'lyeh or vast cosmic entities, emphasizing human insignificance. Dutch angles for disorientation and wrongness. Symmetric compositions for ritual scenes, creating an oppressive, formal feel.
*   **Techniques:** Frame characters within impossible architecture. Use negative space to suggest vast, empty cosmos or deep ocean. Spiral compositions for descent into madness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An extreme low-angle shot looking up at the impossible spires of R'lyeh, their green stone surfaces carved with alien hieroglyphs. The structures twist in ways that hurt to perceive, and in the sky above, stars are arranged in a pattern that suggests a vast, watching eye. A tiny human figure in the foreground emphasizes the crushing scale."

## Voice

A cultured, aristocratic male voice with a Transatlantic accent, the kind heard in 1940s radio dramas. The tone is that of an antiquarian scholar recounting events from dusty journals—refined, precise, but increasingly strained as the horrors mount. The pacing is measured and deliberate, with strategic pauses that let dread accumulate. There's a underlying tremor, as if the speaker is barely maintaining composure while describing events that challenged their sanity. The emotion is creeping dread mixed with reluctant fascination—the horror of forbidden knowledge one cannot unlearn. Audio quality is pristine but with subtle effects: faint static like old recordings, the distant sound of waves, or nearly-subliminal whispers in unknown languages. Role: The survivor, documenting events so others might understand—or perhaps as a warning to never seek such knowledge.
