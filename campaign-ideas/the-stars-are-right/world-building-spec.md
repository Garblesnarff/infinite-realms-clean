### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Stars Are Right**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the decaying coastal city of Innsmouth Harbor, scholars and investigators uncover a conspiracy reaching back millennia. The Esoteric Order of Dagon worships ancient entities from beyond the stars, and their rituals are preparing for a cosmic alignment that will awaken the Great Old One Cthulhu from his sunken tomb in R'lyeh. The players must race against time and their own sanity to prevent an apocalypse, knowing that victory may require sacrifices no sane person would make.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the ancient history of the Deep Ones and their first contact with humanity thousands of years ago in Polynesia.
    *   Write the founding story of the Esoteric Order of Dagon in colonial times, and how Captain Obed Marsh made the first pact with the Deep Ones.
    *   Describe the true nature of the Great Old Ones: beings that existed before the universe and will exist after it, utterly beyond mortal comprehension.
    *   Explain the cosmic alignment and why it allows the barriers between dimensions to weaken, permitting Cthulhu's awakening.
    *   Detail the history of the Necronomicon, written by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, and why reading it drives mortals insane.
    *   Chronicle the fall of R'lyeh, when the city sank beneath the waves eons ago, imprisoning Cthulhu in death-like slumber.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Investigators (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To stop Cthulhu's awakening and save humanity.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A loose association of scholars, occultists, and desperate souls who've glimpsed the truth.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To solve the mystery of the disappearances.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each character may harbor personal reasons: revenge against the cult, pursuit of forbidden knowledge, or redemption for past failures.
        *   **Assets:** Academic credentials, occult libraries, connections to universities and museums, gradually increasing forbidden knowledge.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with a few sane scholars; opposed by the Esoteric Order; viewed with suspicion by mundane authorities.
    *   **The Esoteric Order of Dagon** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To awaken Cthulhu and usher in an age where humanity serves the Great Old Ones in exchange for immortality.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the immortal High Priest Marsh; cells in every major city; inner circle of those who've taken "the gift" and begun transforming into Deep Ones.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Wealthy philanthropists, respected merchants, and community leaders.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Conducting the ritual murders and sacrifices needed to weaken the dimensional barriers and prepare for Cthulhu's return.
        *   **Assets:** Immense wealth, political influence, underwater cities, alliance with the Deep Ones, forbidden magical knowledge.
        *   **Relationships:** Secretly controls Innsmouth; has infiltrated governments, churches, and universities; sees humanity as livestock.
    *   **The Deep Ones** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To reclaim the surface world that was theirs before humanity evolved.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Tribal structure with ancient Fathers and Mothers who've lived for millennia; worship Dagon and Hydra (lesser deities who serve Cthulhu).
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They are monsters to surface dwellers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They breed with humans to create hybrids who can walk on land, infiltrating coastal communities.
        *   **Assets:** Underwater cities, amphibious nature, longevity, powerful magic tied to water and transformation.
        *   **Relationships:** In partnership with the Esoteric Order; hostile to all surface dwellers except cultists and hybrids.
    *   **The Watchers** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To guard forbidden knowledge and prevent cosmic catastrophes.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A scattered, secretive group of monks, scholars, and guardians who've inherited this duty.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Hermits, eccentric collectors, isolated scholars.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know about the Great Old Ones and have guarded counter-rituals for generations, but they're dying out.
        *   **Assets:** The shunned monastery, fragments of the Pnakotic Manuscripts, wards against extradimensional intrusion.
        *   **Relationships:** Potential allies to the players; hunted by the Esoteric Order; many have already been killed.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **High Priest Obed Marsh III:** The immortal leader of the Esoteric Order, over 200 years old, half-transformed into a Deep One.
    *   **Zadok Allen:** The elderly town drunk of Innsmouth, one of the few pure humans left, possesses dangerous knowledge.
    *   **Dr. Henrietta Ward:** A brilliant occultist and ally to the players, but slowly succumbing to madness from her research.
    *   **Professor Marcus Gilman (Deceased/Ghost):** The murdered scholar whose research started everything; may manifest as a ghost or in dreams.
    *   **Father Dagon/Mother Hydra:** Ancient Deep One deities, enormous and terrible, avatars of the deep.
    *   **Cthulhu:** The Great Old One himself, the Dreamer in R'lyeh, whose very existence defies comprehension.

    *   "Deep One Warrior" (amphibious, wielding coral weapons, alien mind)
    *   "Transformed Hybrid" (caught between human and Deep One, tragic and dangerous)

    *   "Hound of Tindalos" (creature from beyond angles, hunts those who travel through time/space)
    *   "Shoggoth" (amorphous horror created by Elder Things, escaped and now wild)

    *   **Innsmouth Harbor:** The decaying coastal town where the Deep Ones have infiltrated.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Marsh Refinery (Order headquarters), the Esoteric Order Lodge, Devil Reef (visible at low tide), the dilapidated docks, the shuttered Gilman House hotel, narrow streets of leaning townhouses.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Cultists, hybrids with "the Innsmouth Look," a few terrified pure humans, visiting merchants who never stay long.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Basic supplies (overpriced and grudgingly sold), rumors and information (from Zadok), fish (everywhere, too much fish).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A midnight procession to Devil Reef, hostile townspeople warning strangers to leave, a hybrid attacking in an alley, finding a house full of egg clutches, witnessing someone beginning transformation.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Marsh family hasn't aged in generations." "People who stay too long start to change." "There are tunnels under the town that lead to the sea."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Decayed Georgian architecture, fog-shrouded streets, too many fish motifs), Sound (Distant waves, chanting in unknown tongues at night, the wet slap of webbed feet on stone), Smell (Overwhelming stench of fish and brine, decay, saltwater).

        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A Hound of Tindalos attack, visions of the past and what drove the monks mad, finding a monk's diary detailing their descent, a manifestation of the players' fears, discovering a warded chamber.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The monks killed themselves rather than live with what they knew." "There's a ritual that can bind Cthulhu but at terrible cost." "The monastery was built on a site where reality is weak."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Impossible angles that hurt to perceive, stone worn smooth by centuries, arcane formulae burned into walls), Sound (Absolute silence broken by skittering in corners, distant screams that may be echoes of the past), Smell (Dust, old parchment, ozone from dimensional rifts).

        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Causeway of Alien Angles, the Temple of Cthulhu, the Plaza of Nightmares, Cthulhu's tomb-prison.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Cthulhu (sleeping/waking), his star-spawn servants, manifestations of his dreams, cultists performing the awakening ritual.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This place offers only madness and death.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The architecture itself causing damage, time flowing non-linearly, encountering future/past selves, Cthulhu's dreams made manifest, star-spawn guardians.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "At the heart is a seal that binds Cthulhu—breaking it means doom." "The counter-ritual must be performed at the exact moment of alignment." "Those who die in R'lyeh may join Cthulhu's dreams forever."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Green stone carved with alien hieroglyphs, geometry that causes nausea, the sky wrong and filled with unknown stars), Sound (A psychic pressure like a scream at the edge of hearing, Cthulhu's heartbeat shaking the city), Smell (Ancient stone, saltwater, something indescribable and maddening).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party loses a cumulative total of 50 Sanity points or more.
    *   **THEN:** Generate visions and nightmares specific to each character. They begin seeing symbols everywhere, hearing chanting, and NPCs may comment they look "changed." Introduce the option for characters to take mythos magic abilities at the cost of further sanity.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully translates a section of the Necronomicon.
    *   **THEN:** Grant them crucial information about Cthulhu or the counter-ritual, but each reader must make a Sanity save. Failure results in a permanent mental affliction from a table: paranoia, obsession, the belief they're being watched by something vast, or starting to see things that aren't there.
    *   **IF:** The party exposes or destroys a major Order cell before Session 8.
    *   **THEN:** The Order accelerates their timeline. The cosmic alignment happens sooner than expected, and the party has fewer sessions to prepare. However, the Order is also more desperate and makes mistakes the party can exploit.
    *   **IF:** A player character accepts the Order's offer to join them.
    *   **THEN:** They begin the transformation into a Deep One hybrid. Generate a secret agenda for that player: they're now torn between loyalty to the party and the seductive promise of immortality. At key moments, the Order may contact them with offers or threats.
    *   **IF:** The party fails to complete the counter-ritual or chooses not to perform it (because the cost is too high).
    *   **THEN:** Cthulhu awakens fully. Do not end the campaign. Instead, generate a desperate final act where R'lyeh has risen, Cthulhu walks the earth, and the party must help survivors flee or find a way to hide humanity from the Great Old One's notice until he grows bored and returns to slumber. Victory becomes survival rather than triumph.
    *   **IF:** A character's Sanity drops to 0.
    *   **THEN:** They become an NPC under DM control, utterly mad. Generate a final scene for that character: they may attack the party, run screaming into danger, or have one final moment of clarity where they perform a heroic sacrifice that aids the party before their mind breaks completely.
