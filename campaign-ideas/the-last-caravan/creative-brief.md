# Creative Brief: The Last Caravan

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Norse Survival with Painterly Aesthetics (Banner Saga-inspired)

Inspired by the somber Viking journey of *Banner Saga* with hand-painted art style, Norse mythology, and perpetual twilight. This style captures the weight of exodus, harsh beauty of frozen wastes, distinctive Nordic character designs, and the encroaching Darkness consuming the world.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Painted Quality:** Hand-painted textures, visible brushstrokes, artistic not photorealistic
*   **Norse Aesthetic:** Viking longships, Norse runes, giant Varl warriors, horn-helmed fighters
*   **Perpetual Twilight:** Sun frozen in sky, eternal dim light, cold blue color scheme
*   **The Caravan:** Long line of refugees trudging through snow, sense of exodus

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Norse survival, Viking exodus, harsh beauty, moral weight, permadeath consequences, world-ending darkness, somber journey
*   **Feeling:** The weight of leading refugees to uncertain salvation. Beauty in bleakness. Every choice matters. Death is permanent and mourned.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant:** Cold blues and whites (snow and ice), gray skies (perpetual twilight)
*   **Accents:** Red (blood, banners, Dredge), brown (leather, wood), gold (limited warmth)
*   **The Darkness:** Black void with purple-red corruption spreading
*   **Warmth:** Rare campfires providing orange glow, precious moments of warmth
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dominated by cold blues and whites of frozen wasteland. Eternal twilight casts dim light—sun visible but frozen in sky. A Viking caravan trudges through deep snow, banners in red and gold providing only color. In the far distance behind them, encroaching black-purple Darkness consumes the northern horizon. Hand-painted aesthetic with visible brushstrokes."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Viking warriors in fur cloaks, mail armor, horn-decorated helmets, weathered faces
*   **Varl:** Giants (8-9 feet tall) with massive horns growing from heads, heavy armor, carry huge weapons
*   **Dredge:** Stone warriors—bodies made of dark rock, glowing red cores, angular and inhuman
*   **Distinctive Silhouettes:** Each character has unique recognizable shape
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Varl warrior—nine feet tall with two massive curved horns growing from head. Muscular build, wearing heavy furred armor with mail. Carries enormous two-handed axe. Face shows age and wisdom, weathered by countless winters. Behind them, smaller human warriors in Viking gear look up with respect. Hand-painted style with strong brushwork."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Caravan:** Long procession of refugees, supply wagons, warriors protecting flanks
*   **Frozen Wastes:** Endless snowy plains, dead forests, abandoned villages
*   **Godstones:** Massive ancient monuments with Norse runes, mysterious and towering
*   **Arberrang:** Last great city with massive wooden walls, crowded with refugees
*   **Prompt Example:** "The caravan marching through frozen wastes: Hundreds of people in long line trudging through deep snow. Supply wagons pulled by oxen. Warriors in furs guard flanks. In background, dead forest and abandoned village. Above, frozen sun provides dim twilight. The line stretches to horizon. Painterly style emphasizing harsh journey and scale. Footprints in snow behind them."

**5. Combat and Dredge:**
*   **Turn-Based Grid:** Chess-like positioning on battlefield grid
*   **Dredge Warriors:** Stone bodies with glowing red cores, wielding stone weapons, inhuman movement
*   **Bellower:** Massive Dredge boss, twice size of Varl, covered in runes
*   **Viking Combat:** Shield walls, axes, spears, horn signals
*   **Prompt Example:** "Turn-based battlefield: Viking warriors in formation face Dredge stone warriors. A Varl tanks the front with massive shield. Human archer draws bow. Dredge warriors—bodies of dark stone with glowing red cores—advance mechanically. In background, more Dredge emerge from darkness. Grid-based positioning clear. Painterly combat scene."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Perpetual Twilight:** Dim light always, never full day or night
*   **Frozen Sun:** Sun visible but provides minimal light, frozen in place
*   **Campfire Warmth:** Orange firelight as only warmth in cold blue world
*   **The Darkness:** Black void that absorbs light, purple-red at edges
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by perpetual twilight. Frozen sun hangs in gray-blue sky providing dim illumination. Everything has cold blue tint. Only warmth comes from campfire at caravan's center—orange glow on weary faces. Behind them, the encroaching Darkness is pure black void consuming landscape, edges glowing sickly purple-red. Hand-painted lighting emphasizing somber mood."

## Voice

A voice that begins with Nordic storytelling tradition—measured, fatalistic, accepting of death—and carries the weight of impossible leadership. The pacing is deliberate and thoughtful, like an elder telling a tragic saga. The tone shifts between narrative observation ("The caravan lost twelve souls that night"), difficult choice presentation ("We must decide: feed everyone and run out in three days, or half-rations and last the week"), and sorrowful mourning ("They will be remembered in the saga"). There's acceptance that death is coming; the question is dying well. Slightly archaic Norse-influenced English. Mournful horns in background. Role: The voice of somber survival and tragic leadership.
