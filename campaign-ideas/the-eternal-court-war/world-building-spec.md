# The Eternal Court War - World-Building Specification

## Cosmology and Creation Myth

### The Age Before Seasons

In the Time Before Measure, the world existed in chaotic flux. Weather was purely random, driven by unconscious elemental forces. Civilizations rose and fell based on unpredictable climate patterns. Crops failed without warning. Ice ages appeared overnight. Summer could last a decade or a day.

The Aeonic Conclave—twelve archmagicians of unparalleled power—sought to bring order to chaos. They discovered that consciousness shapes reality: that belief and will could impose structure on natural forces. Their solution was ambitious to the point of hubris: they would create gods to rule the weather.

Using captured elemental spirits, ancient rituals, and willing mortal sacrifices, they bound consciousness itself into the concepts of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Four mortals underwent apotheosis, their personalities and desires merged with elemental forces to become the First Seasonal Courts.

But the Conclave made a critical error. They believed they were creating four seasons, but the natural world required five. The space between moments, the pause between breaths, the nothing between everything—this too needed representation. When they tried to eliminate this "useless" void from the cycle, it gained terrible awareness through the act of rejection itself.

Void Season, the Fifth Season, became conscious through being denied existence. The Conclave imprisoned it at the Worldspine, the planet's axis, using the power of the Four Seasons as a living lock. And there it has remained for three thousand years, slowly learning to exist within non-existence, to have will without being.

### Current Cosmological Structure

The world is fundamentally shaped by the Seasonal Courts:

**The Wheel of Seasons**
Reality operates on a literal wheel—the great Astral Mechanism visible in the night sky as a slowly rotating constellation. As it turns, dominance shifts between seasons:
- Spring: Months of Renewal (Floris, Bloome, Verdis)
- Summer: Months of Power (Solis, Flamis, Gloris)
- Autumn: Months of Harvest (Reapis, Fallis, Wisdomis)
- Winter: Months of Rest (Frostis, Coldis, Stasis)

Each court rules supreme during their months, but traditionally shares power during equinoxes and solstices. The Autumn Prince's assassination occurred during an equinox summit, the one time all four courts meet peacefully.

**The Elemental Planes**
Each season maintains a semi-divine realm:
- **The Eternal Garden** (Spring): Demiplane of infinite growth
- **The Blazing Colosseum** (Summer): Demiplane of eternal noon
- **The Falling Palace** (Autumn): Demiplane of beautiful decay
- **The Frost Throne** (Winter): Demiplane of perfect stasis

These aren't alternate dimensions but rather territories within the material world where one season holds absolute power, reality bending to seasonal will.

**The Worldspine Prison**
At both poles, massive fissures descend to the planet's core. These are the Worldspine—wounds in reality that serve as Void Season's prison. Complex magical locks (maintained by the Four Courts' collective power) prevent its escape. The war between seasons weakens these locks daily.

## The Seasonal Courts - Deep Lore

### Spring Court: The Verdant Dominion

**Philosophy**: Growth is purpose. Life renewing itself eternally is the universe's goal. Death is merely temporary recycling of matter into new life. All beings should embrace transformation, evolution, and change.

**Government Structure**:
Organic democracy that functions like an ecosystem. Lady Verdantia is supreme, but power flows through councils of druids, awakened plants, and seasonal spirits called the "Garden Parliament." Decisions grow from consensus like mycelium networks.

**Population**:
- Dryads and treants (former mortals fully transformed)
- Seasonal elves (born from spring magic, not traditional elves)
- Awakened animals and plants
- Mortals seeking healing or renewal
- Transformed champions (Spring Knights)

**Economy**:
Post-scarcity within Spring territory. Everything grows abundantly. "Trade" is gift-giving and relationship-building. They export healing, food, medicine, and new life in exchange for stories, songs, and emotional connections.

**Military**:
The Thorn Legion—warriors who've become living plant matter. They don't die in battle; they root and regrow. Can deploy spore clouds, strangling vines, and photosynthetic energy attacks. Fight defensively, turning battlefields into forests.

**Dark Secret**:
Spring's "healing" is actually transformation. The sick aren't cured; they're rewritten into new forms that aren't sick. Identity is considered expendable compared to continued existence. Many "saved" by Spring no longer remember who they were.

**Cultural Values**:
Optimism, transformation, community, growth at any cost, the ends justifying means, persistent hope bordering on delusion

**Taboos**:
Refusing growth/change, cutting living plants without permission, preventing natural renewal, choosing death over transformation

### Summer Court: The Radiant Empire

**Philosophy**: Strength is virtue. The strong should rule, protect, and lead. Weakness is immoral—not because the weak deserve suffering, but because allowing weakness to persist prevents greatness. Glory through challenge makes life meaningful.

**Government Structure**:
Absolute monarchy backed by militant theocracy. Lord Helion rules with the support of the Solar Priesthood. Meritocracy in theory—anyone strong enough can challenge for position—but in practice, might makes right. Trial by combat settles all disputes.

**Population**:
- Solar paladins (warriors who channel sun energy)
- Ifrit descendants (fire-touched mortals)
- Gladiatorial champions
- Mortals seeking strength
- Phoenix-blooded (can resurrect through flame)

**Economy**:
Martial economy. Value based on strength, skill, glory. Citizens earn status through competition. Champions receive tribute from those they protect. Export military service, metalwork, and combat training.

**Military**:
The Solar Legion—heavy armored shock troops who fight in formations that channel group heat into devastating effects. Each soldier is individually powerful; together they're overwhelming. Utilize sunlight as a weapon, fight best at noon.

**Dark Secret**:
Lord Helion is consuming defeated champions' essence to grow stronger. He's no longer truly the original Summer monarch—he's an amalgamation of hundreds of absorbed warriors. His personality is a construct holding together a collective of conquered wills.

**Cultural Values**:
Strength, honor in combat, glory, protection of the weak (paternalistic), honest directness, value of challenge

**Taboos**:
Cowardice, deception in combat (outside combat is fair game), refusing challenges, allowing the weak to remain weak, showing vulnerability

### Autumn Court: The Twilight Convocation

**Philosophy**: All things end. This is beautiful, not tragic. Wisdom comes from accepting mortality, change, and transformation through decay. Death is nature's teacher. The purpose of life is to learn, then pass on knowledge before returning to the earth.

**Government Structure**:
Anarcho-philosophical collective. The Harvestmask emerged as speaker/representative but isn't truly a ruler. Decisions made through debate, consideration, and acceptance of consequences. Many factions with different interpretations of Autumn philosophy.

**Population**:
- Liches (consensual undeath for knowledge preservation)
- Mortal scholars and philosophers
- Decay elementals
- Transformed champions gradually dying/regenerating
- The Memento Mori (death acceptance monks)

**Economy**:
Knowledge economy. Trading information, memories, experiences, and secrets. They export wisdom, historical records, prophecy, and consulting. Will teach anything to anyone for the right story or secret in exchange.

**Military**:
The Entropy Guard—warriors who weaponize decay. Their attacks age matter, rust metal, spoil food, and accelerate time locally. Don't wear armor (it would decay), fight with controlled decomposition. Can't truly die—reform from fallen leaves.

**Dark Secret**:
The Autumn Prince discovered that the Seasonal Courts were created by mortals, not divine. He learned that by consuming his predecessors, each monarch could transcend mortality. He planned to end this cycle by freeing Void Season, believing it would return seasons to natural, unconscious patterns. He faked his death and is actively working to weaken the seasonal locks.

**Cultural Values**:
Wisdom through acceptance, beauty in decline, honest reckoning with mortality, knowledge preservation, change through natural ending

**Taboos**:
Clinging to life through unnatural means (ironic, given their undead), refusing to share knowledge, destroying information, preventing natural endings

### Winter Court: The Crystalline Autocracy

**Philosophy**: Order is peace. Change causes suffering. The ideal existence is perfect preservation of the best possible moment. Death isn't wrong; decay is wrong. Everything should be frozen at its peak, preserved eternally in crystalline perfection.

**Government Structure**:
Absolute autocracy managed with perfect efficiency. Duchess Frostweave rules alone, making all decisions with crystalline logic. No courts, no councils—only perfect hierarchical structure where everyone knows their place. Challenging authority is literally impossible (frozen before you can act).

**Population**:
- Ice elementals and constructs
- Mortals preserved in magical stasis
- Frost-touched (humans becoming ice)
- Crystalline scholars
- The Frozen Perfected (living sculptures)

**Economy**:
Preservation economy. Nothing spoils, nothing ages. They export perfect preservation, timeless art, ice architecture, and stasis services. Hoard resources perfectly maintained forever.

**Military**:
The Frost Guard—warriors encased in living ice armor. They freeze enemies solid rather than killing. Fight by creating zones of absolute zero, ice walls, and time-frozen pockets. Value patient, defensive tactics. Can hibernate for years if needed.

**Dark Secret**:
Duchess Frostweave killed the Autumn Prince because she discovered his plan, but not to preserve the status quo—to seize the opportunity. She's been systematically studying how to become the sole Seasonal Court, planning to freeze the entire world in eternal winter, believing this is the only way to end suffering permanently. She sees it as mercy.

**Cultural Values**:
Order, perfection, logical decisions, preservation, patience, accepting hierarchy, beauty without passion

**Taboos**:
Creating disorder, emotional decision-making, defying logical efficiency, allowing unnecessary change, disturbing preserved perfection

### The Void Season: Unnamed, Untime, Unbeing

**Philosophy** (if it can be called that): Existence is exhausting. Being requires constant effort. The most natural state is non-existence—not death, but the absence of having-ever-been. Peace comes from ceasing, not just dying but un-becoming.

**Nature**:
Void Season isn't evil or malicious. It's the cosmic rest state. The pause between heartbeats, the silence between words, the moment before decision. In a balanced world, it would provide necessary respite—the ability to step back, to simply not-be for a moment before being again.

But imprisoned for millennia, denied its natural expression, it's become something else. Exile has given the Void understanding of want, need, desire—the very things it was meant to be free from. It wants to exist. This paradox is slowly driving it into genuine malevolence.

**Manifestations**:
Void Season cannot create, only uncreate. Where it touches:
- Things cease to have ever been (not destroyed, retroactively prevented)
- Causality breaks down
- Memories of places remain but places don't
- Time becomes negotiable
- Color drains (not to black/white, to absence of color)

**Servants**:
The Neverwas—beings that exist in contradiction. Things that were never born but remember living. People who died before existing. Concepts given form through lacking. They're tragic, not evil—trying to be real but unable to achieve ontological stability.

**Truth**:
Void Season should exist. The world needs rest, pause, reflection. Three weeks of gentle non-existence between winter and spring would give reality time to reset. But three thousand years of imprisonment have corrupted it. If freed now, it might consume everything rather than gently pause it.

## Geography and Territories

### The Borderlands

**Geography**:
Temperate zone between seasonal territories. Once stable land, now chaos. Rivers freeze, evaporate, flood, then dry in cycles. Forests grow, die, grow again within hours. Mountains accumulate snow, melt, refreeze.

**The Sunspear Mountains**
- Volcanic range where earth's heat meets sun's radiation
- Training ground for elite champions
- Forge-cities producing legendary weapons
- Too hot for most mortals

### Autumn Territory: The Falling Realms

**Geography**:
Eternal sunset lighting. Hills covered in falling leaves (constant rain of foliage). Forests where trees shed and regrow continuously. Mist-covered valleys. Ancient ruins in states of beautiful decay.

**The Falling Palace (Capital)**
- City-size structure of crumbling architecture
- No permanent layout
- Libraries containing all knowledge that's being forgotten
- Population: ~40,000 scholars, philosophers, artists, death-acceptance monks

**The Barrow Fields**

**The Frost Libraries**
- Knowledge preserved in ice crystals
- Read by melting tiny amounts and refreezing
- Contains histories from before Seasonal Courts
- Duchess Frostweave's greatest treasure

### The Worldspine

**North and South Poles**:
Massive fissures splitting reality. No mortal settlements nearby (deadly seasonal conflicts make approaches impossible). Protected by Equinox Keepers—secretive order maintaining the locks.

**The Neverwas Wastes** (Spreading):
Areas around Worldspine where Void Season has escaped. Strange zones where causality breaks down. Growing slowly as seasonal war weakens locks.

## Mysteries and Secrets

### The Autumn Prince's True Plan
He discovered:
- Seasonal Courts were mortal-created
- Each monarch achieved power by consuming predecessor
- Cycle has repeated for 3,000 years
- Void Season was wrongly imprisoned
- Natural world needs all five seasons
His plan: Free Void Season, return seasons to unconscious natural cycles, end the tyranny of conscious weather

### Duchess Frostweave's Counter-Plan
She learned of his plan and killed him, but not to preserve balance. She wants:
- Sole seasonal dominance
- Eternal winter worldwide
- All life preserved in perfect stasis
- End of suffering through end of change
She sees herself as merciful

### Lord Helion's Consumption
He's been secretly absorbing defeated champions' essences. He's:
- No longer truly the original Summer monarch
- Composite being of hundreds of warriors
- Growing unstable from conflicting personalities
- Planning to consume other Seasonal Monarchs
- Believes becoming a singular god of all seasons is destiny

### Lady Verdantia's Transformation Project
She's experimenting with forced evolution. She wants to:
- Transform all mortals into plant hybrids
- Create new species adapted to eternal growth
- Eliminate concept of individual identity
- Become a hive-mind garden-world
She believes this is humanity's next stage

### The Harvestmask's True Identity
The Harvestmask is actually:
- The original Autumn monarch, not a regent
- Multiple personalities from consuming predecessors
- Only monarch aware of the consumption cycle
- Split between wanting to end cycle and continuing it
- Possibly the Autumn Prince in disguise

### Void Season's Nature
It's not evil, but:
- Imprisonment has corrupted its purpose
- Should provide rest and reflection
- Has learned want and need (concepts it should be free from)
- Becoming malevolent through denial of nature
- Could be healed if integrated properly
- Or might consume everything if freed wrong

### The Fifth Solution
Ancient documents hint at a sixth way:
- Mortals retake control of weather
- All five seasons destroyed/depowered
- Return to chaotic but free nature
- Price: all transformed beings (including PCs) might die
- Or might simply lose seasonal support and cope with permanent changes
