The players are part of a secret coalition tasked with forging an impossible peace while fighting back an invasion that threatens all life.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully expose a demon infiltrator in a faction's leadership.
    *   **THEN:** That faction's trust in the Pact increases (+10 stability). The demon's allies attempt revenge. Generate a counter-assassination mission.
    *   **IF:** The Pact Stability drops below 50.
    *   **THEN:** Skirmishes break out between Alliance and Horde forces. The Legion capitalizes, opening more portals. Generate crisis missions to prevent total war.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to defend a neutral site from Legion attack.
    *   **THEN:** The Council of Neutrals loses faith in the Pact. They withdraw support, making the final battle harder. Generate a redemption mission to earn back their trust.
    *   **IF:** A major faction leader is killed.
    *   **THEN:** That faction nearly breaks the Pact in rage. A new, more extreme leader rises. Generate a mission to either prevent civil war or assassinate the extremist.
    *   **IF:** The players achieve 75+ Pact Stability before the final battle.
