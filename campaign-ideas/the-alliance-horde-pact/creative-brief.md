# Creative Brief: The Alliance-Horde Pact

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: High Fantasy Epic Realism (Warcraft-inspired)

Inspired by the bold, heroic aesthetic of World of Warcraft—a style that blends high fantasy with larger-than-life characters, vibrant factions, and epic conflicts. This style captures the grandeur of massive faction armies, the diversity of races and cultures, and the cosmic horror of the Burning Legion.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Bold and Heroic:** Characters and creatures should have exaggerated, heroic proportions. Heroes are larger than life, armor is ornate and imposing.
*   **Vibrant Faction Identity:** Use strong, saturated colors to distinguish factions. Alliance: blues, golds, whites. Horde: reds, browns, blacks. Legion: greens, purples, fel-fire.
*   **Epic Scale:** Emphasize massive armies, towering fortresses, and world-shattering magic to convey the scale of conflict.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, heroic, factional, vibrant, world-threatening, honor-bound, savage, corrupted.
*   **Feeling:** Grand battles between noble heroes and savage warriors, unified against overwhelming demonic evil. The atmosphere should feel both triumphant and desperate.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Bold, defined lines with exaggerated proportions. Armor has large shoulder pieces, weapons are oversized.
*   **Forms:** Architecture is massive and imposing. Alliance buildings are gothic and symmetrical. Horde structures are brutal and asymmetrical.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A heavily armored human paladin in the style of Warcraft, with massive shoulder pauldrons emblazoned with lion emblems, wielding an oversized glowing hammer."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Highly saturated and faction-coded. Alliance uses royal blues, bright golds, and pure whites. Horde uses blood reds, earthy browns, and iron blacks. Legion uses sickly fel-greens, dark purples, and burning orange.
*   **Contrast:** Strong color contrast between factions creates visual drama.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of royal blue and gold Alliance banners clashing against crimson and black Horde war standards, with fel-green demon portals erupting between them."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Heroic, exaggerated proportions. Warriors are muscular and imposing, mages radiate power.
*   **Diversity:** Multiple races—humans, orcs, elves, dwarves, tauren, undead—each with distinct visual identity.
*   **Armor:** Elaborate faction-themed armor with iconic silhouettes. Alliance armor is knightly and ornate. Horde armor is spiked and primal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A fierce orc warrior in Horde armor, with green skin, prominent tusks, massive spiked shoulder pads, and a brutal two-handed axe crackling with red energy."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Grand and iconic locations—massive stone cities, fortress capitals, volcanic wastelands, frozen peaks, corrupted demon-infested zones.
*   **Alliance Zones:** Clean, orderly, gothic architecture, cobblestone streets, blue-and-gold banners.
*   **Horde Zones:** Raw, industrial, built from the land, iron spikes, red war banners.
*   **Legion Zones:** Corrupted, twisted versions of reality, fel-fire, floating rocks, demonic architecture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Alliance capital of Stormhaven, a massive white stone fortress city with towering gothic spires, blue-roofed buildings, and golden lion statues, surrounded by orderly farmlands."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, almost painterly lighting with strong highlights and shadows.
*   **Magic:** Glowing effects are prominent—holy golden light for paladins, crackling red lightning for shamans, sickly green fel-fire for demons.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the heroic and the monstrous, creating clear visual drama.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by golden holy light radiating from a paladin's armor, contrasting against the sickly green glow of a demon portal."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic, action-oriented compositions. Characters in heroic poses, armies clashing in epic battles.
*   **Techniques:** Use low angles to make heroes look imposing. Frame battles with both factions visible. Show scale by including massive structures or creatures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the Pact army—Alliance knights in blue and gold on the left, Horde warriors in red and black on the right—charging together toward a massive green Legion portal with demon hordes pouring out."
