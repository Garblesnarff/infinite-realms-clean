## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Theatrical Combat:** Fights are about style, wit, and clever tactics as much as raw power—think duels and banter.
*   **The Narrator's Influence:** A meta-narrative element where the "Storyteller" occasionally reshapes reality or provides cryptic aid.
*   **True Love's Power:** Genuine bonds between characters can accomplish what magic cannot.
*   **Mostly Dead vs. All Dead:** Death is negotiable with the right miracle worker and enough motivation.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act structure following the classic fairy tale rescue, complicated by revenge and true love.

*   **Act I — The Kidnapping (Sessions 1–4):** The party's beloved friend is kidnapped by the scheming Prince Humperdinck. They must pursue across dangerous terrain, gain allies (a master swordsman seeking revenge, a gentle giant, and others), and infiltrate the Florin border.
*   **Act II — The Castle Assault (Sessions 5–8):** The party storms the castle, faces the Prince's machinations, navigates political intrigue, and deals with the consequences of old vendettas coming to fruition. They discover the Prince plans to use the wedding to start a war.
*   **Act III — Miracles and True Love (Sessions 9–12):** After apparent death, miraculous resurrection, and final confrontations, the party must stop the war, expose the Prince's treachery, and prove that true love conquers all—even mostly-death.

## Central Conflict

True love versus political ambition. Prince Humperdinck's selfish scheme to start a war for glory threatens innocent lives and true love itself. The party must overcome impossible odds, master swordsmen, deadly terrain, and even death itself to prove that love, loyalty, and courage triumph over power and treachery.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Quotable Moment**
*   When players deliver dramatic lines or witty banter, they gain Inspiration or bonus action points. Reward theatrical play.

### 2. **Mostly Dead vs. All Dead**
*   Characters reduced to 0 HP are "mostly dead" and can be resurrected by Miracle Max if the party can provide a good reason (true love, revenge, etc.).

### 3. **The Narrator's Intervention**
*   Once per session, the DM (as the Storyteller) can reshape a small element of reality to maintain the "fairy tale" quality—but always with a narrative justification.

### 4. **True Love's Advantage**
*   Characters with genuine bonds (established through roleplay) gain mechanical benefits when protecting or rescuing each other.

### 5. **The Duel System**
*   One-on-one sword fights use extended mechanics emphasizing technique, terrain, and dramatic flourishes over raw damage.

### 6. **Revenge Motivation**
*   Inigo's revenge quest provides a secondary objective. Supporting him grants the party a powerful ally and emotional payoff.

### 7. **Inconceivable Challenges**
*   Encounters that seem impossible can be overcome through clever thinking, wit, and exploiting the fairy tale logic of the world.
