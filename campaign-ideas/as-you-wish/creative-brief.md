## Art Style: Storybook Illustration meets Swashbuckling Cinema

Romantic, theatrical fantasy combining classic fairy tale storybook aesthetics with the cinematic grandeur of adventure films. Think illuminated manuscripts meets Errol Flynn swashbucklers—everything is slightly larger than life and impossibly romantic.

### Core Principles:
*   **Theatrical Composition:** Every scene is staged for maximum dramatic impact
*   **Romantic Idealism:** Colors are saturated, heroes are handsome, true love glows
*   **Meta-Awareness:** Subtle framing devices hint at the "story being told" quality

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Rich jewel tones—deep reds, royal blues, forest greens, golden sunlight. The Fire Swamp uses ominous oranges and murky browns. The Pit of Despair is stone gray and torch-lit amber. Florin Castle gleams with white marble and gold trim.

**Character Design:** Heroes are heroically proportioned—Inigo with flowing dark hair and rapier, Fezzik as impossibly large but gentle, the Prince in hunting greens with a perfect coiffed beard. Characters should feel like they stepped from a fairy tale.

**Environments:** Impossible geography—cliffs too steep, swamps too dangerous, castles too grand. Everything has a storybook exaggeration while maintaining internal consistency.

**Composition:** Use classical painting techniques—dramatic diagonals for action, triangular compositions for romantic moments, deep perspectives for the Cliffs of Insanity. Frame key moments like they're illustrations in a leather-bound storybook.

## Voice

Warm, knowing narrator voice with theatrical flair and gentle humor. Like a grandfather telling the world's greatest bedtime story—sometimes earnest, sometimes winking at the audience, always invested in the characters. Quick-witted during banter, sincere during emotional beats. The emotion oscillates between romantic sincerity and playful meta-commentary. Role: The wise storyteller who loves this tale and wants you to love it too.

## Music Style

Romantic orchestral adventure score in the style of Mark Knopfler—sweeping strings for romance, heroic brass for action, playful harpsichord for comedy. Inigo has a Spanish guitar theme. Fezzik's theme uses gentle woodwinds despite his size. The Prince has militaristic drums. Love themes use classical guitar and strings. Combat music is energetic but never dark—this is adventure, not grim warfare. Overall tone is optimistic, romantic, and grandly theatrical.
