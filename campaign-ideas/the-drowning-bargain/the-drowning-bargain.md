---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Drowning Bargain
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Fairy Tale / Body Horror / Tragic Romance
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** voice for legs, underwater kingdom, sea witch deals, drowning horror, transformation agony, tragic love, foam and death, contract predation
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Ursula's transformation contracts aren't isolated deals but a systematic operation harvesting merfolk abilities by exploiting their desperation, with "voice for legs" being her masterpiece that leaves victims unable to speak, in constant agony from walking, and doomed to dissolve into sea foam if they fail to secure true love's kiss within three days. The party, investigating sailors drowning under mysterious circumstances and finding voiceless women on beaches, discovers Ariel is Ursula's latest victim whose stolen voice is being used to lure ships to destruction while her contract countdown ticks toward death. They must navigate both surface and undersea politics where Ursula has agents in both realms, break a binding fairy contract written in desperation, and stop the sea witch before she harvests enough power to challenge the sea king himself and flood the surface world.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act tragedy about transformation, desperation, and the price of belonging.

*   **Act I — The Voiceless Victims (Sessions 1–4):** Coastal villages are plagued by ship wrecks lured by impossible beautiful singing. The party finds mute young women on beaches, confused and in pain, unable to explain what happened. They discover these women have no past, appear overnight, and walk as if every step is agony. Investigation leads to Ariel, newest victim, trying desperately to win Prince Eric's love before her three-day deadline expires. They learn about the sea witch Ursula and her transformation contracts, discovering the stolen voices are used to lure sailors to drowning deaths.

*   **Act II — Beneath the Waves (Sessions 5–8):** The party must venture underwater (through magic or deals) to investigate Ursula's operation. They discover the mer-kingdom in turmoil—King Triton searches desperately for his daughter while Ursula operates from her lair collecting "unfortunate souls" trapped in polyp form. Previous contract victims exist as garden decorations, conscious but transformed into sea vegetation. They learn Ursula is Triton's sister, banished for dark magic, seeking revenge and his trident. Ariel's voice is in a nautilus shell being used as lure. The contract is revealed—true love's kiss before sunset on the third day or become sea foam.

*   **Act III — The Contract's Fine Print (Sessions 9–12):** They discover Ursula's contracts are designed to fail—how can you explain who you are and win love without speaking? The three-day deadline is impossibly short. The transformation itself makes victims desperate to complete the contract because walking is constant agony. Ursula's agents on the surface actively sabotage attempts at romance. Previous victims who "succeeded" are revealed to have made terrible compromises or were manipulated into worse contracts. The stolen voices create sympathetic link allowing Ursula to spy through victims' ears. She's been harvesting magical essence from merfolk for decades building power to challenge Triton and flood the surface world.

*   **Act IV — Breaking the Waves (Sessions 13–16):** Ariel's deadline approaches. The party must choose: help her win Eric's love (difficult without voice and potentially not genuine), break Ursula's contract (risking killing all victims tied to it), steal back Ariel's voice (breaking magical law), kill Ursula (releasing her harvested souls but causing political chaos), or find alternative that honors both Ariel's agency and breaks predatory contract system. Ursula makes her play for Triton's trident using Ariel as leverage. The finale involves both underwater and surface battles, deciding whether worlds should remain separate or unite, and determining if Ariel's desire to be human is valid or trauma response to systematic oppression in her own kingdom.

## Central Conflict

Belonging versus identity and the price of transformation. Ariel wants to be human—but is that genuine desire or rebellion against her father's controlling rules? Ursula exploits desperation with contracts designed to fail, but she's also product of Triton's banishment and judgement. The transformation is body horror—constant pain, loss of voice, being unable to explain yourself. The party must navigate whether helping Ariel means enabling what might be self-destructive choice, if breaking contracts helps or harms victims integrated with magic, and whether the real solution is changing the systems (both Triton's kingdom and Ursula's predation) that create such desperate bargains.
