# World-Building Specification Brief: Lightless Gardens

**Core Concept**: Underground ecosystem millions of years old faces destruction from mining. Party navigates between ecological preservation, economic needs, and radical activism.

**Lore Prompts**:
* The Gardens' evolution—unique species found nowhere else.
* Circle of Eternal Night's founding—druids dedicated to darkness-ecosystem protection.
* Mining company's discovery of valuable ores within Gardens.
* Cave dweller communities—people who depend on both ecosystem and mining.

**Factions**:
* **Circle of Eternal Night**: Druids protecting ecosystem, splintering between moderates and radicals.
* **Copper-Vein Mining Company**: Corporation needing ores, employing locals, destroying ecosystem.
* **The Radicals (Thorns of Night)**: Splinter group using eco-terrorism.
* **Cavehollow Community**: Local cave dwellers caught in middle, need both ecology and economy.
* **Surface Investors**: Care only for profit, push for maximum extraction.

**Key NPCs**:
* **Archdruid Nightbloom**: Moderate leader losing control, trying peaceful solutions.
* **Director Copper-Vein**: Mining executive, not evil but prioritizes jobs and profit.
* **Shadow-Runner**: Radical terrorist, genuinely cares about ecosystem, methods horrific.
* **Elder Darkwhisper**: Cave dweller elder, needs compromise for community survival.
* **The Last Glowmoth**: Symbolic unique creature, its fate represents Gardens' fate.

**Locations**:
* **Lightless Gardens**: Pristine darkness-adapted ecosystem.
* **Circle's Grove**: Druidic sanctuary, completely dark, sacred.
* **Mining Operations**: Strip-mining scars, harsh light pollution.
* **Cavehollow**: Village dependent on both ecosystem resources and mining jobs.
* **Deep Grotto**: Last untouched sanctuary, most endangered species.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF party supports unrestricted mining THEN ecosystem collapses, species extinct, Circle becomes fully terrorist, locals gain jobs temporarily.
* IF party supports Circle's demands THEN mining stops, economic devastation, locals turn on party, company seeks alternate sites.
* IF party negotiates compromise THEN difficult balance, neither side happy, requires constant maintenance.
* IF eco-terrorism succeeds THEN mining evacuates but locals suffer, Circle fractures further.
* IF Last Glowmoth dies THEN symbolizes point of no return, radicalizes moderates.
* IF party finds alternate ore source THEN can save ecosystem without economic collapse.

**Mechanics**:
* **Light Pollution**: Using lights damages ecosystem; must navigate in darkness.
* **Ecosystem Health Tracker**: Monitor species extinctions and environmental degradation.
* **Economic Impact**: Track local employment vs. ecological preservation.
* **Factional Reputation**: Complex three-way balance between Circle, company, locals.
* **Radicalization Meter**: Track Circle's descent from peaceful to terrorist.
* **Unique Species**: Encounter and protect (or fail to protect) species found nowhere else.
