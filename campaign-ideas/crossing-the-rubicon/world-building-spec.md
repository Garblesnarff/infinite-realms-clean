# Crossing the Rubicon - World-Building Specification

## Late Roman Republic (100-44 BCE)
Political instability, powerful generals, Senate vs. populares, slavery-based economy, expansion continuing.

## Factions
- **Optimates**: Senatorial conservatives, support oligarchy (Cato, Cicero, Pompey eventually)
- **Populares**: Popular faction, land reform, Caesar's base
- **Equites**: Business class, neutral or opportunistic
- **Legions**: Loyal to generals (problematic for Republic)
- **Gauls**: Tribal confederacies, Vercingetorix unites
- **Eastern Kingdoms**: Egypt, Pontus, etc.—client states or targets

## Roman Military
**Legions**: 4,000-6,000 men, highly disciplined, engineering capable
**Tactics**: Manipular flexibility, siege expertise
**Loyalty**: To general (paid by him), not state—danger to Republic
**Veterans**: Land grants create political base

## The Gallic Wars (58-50 BCE)
- Conquest of Gaul (modern France, Belgium, parts of Germany/Switzerland)
- Million dead, million enslaved (estimates)
- Caesar's wealth and power base
- *Commentarii*: Propaganda justifying wars

## Civil War (49-45 BCE)
- Illegal: Roman vs. Roman, constitution suspended
- Pompey initially stronger (legions, allies)
- Caesar's speed and veteran troops prevail
- Ends Republic's last hope

## Reforms
- **Julian Calendar** (365.25 days, leap years)—used 1600+ years
- **Debt relief**: Benefits poor, angers creditors
- **Senate expansion**: Dilutes opposition
- **Veteran colonies**: Spread Roman culture
- **Public works**: Employment, beautification

## The Assassination
**Ides of March** (March 15, 44 BCE): 60+ conspirators, 23 wounds
**Motives**: Mixed—idealism (Brutus), envy (Cassius), fear (monarchy)
**Result**: Opposite of intent—empire established (Octavian)
**Legacy**: Most famous assassination in history

## Aftermath
- Second Triumvirate: Octavian, Antony, Lepidus
- Proscriptions: Political murders (Cicero killed)
- Philippi (42 BCE): Liberators defeated, suicide
- Actium (31 BCE): Octavian vs. Antony/Cleopatra
- 27 BCE: Octavian becomes Augustus, first emperor
- Pax Romana: 200 years of relative peace

## Causality Chains
1. **First Triumvirate**: Enables Caesar's rise
2. **Gallic Conquest**: Provides wealth, legions, reputation
3. **Rubicon Crossing**: Republic's death sentence
4. **Pompey's Death**: Removes rival but dishonors Caesar
5. **Clemency to Brutus**: Spares future assassin
6. **Assassination**: Creates martyr, enables Octavian's empire

## Legacy
- **Name**: "Caesar" becomes emperor (Kaiser, Czar, etc.)
- **Calendar**: July named for Julius
- **Military**: Tactics studied 2,000 years
- **Politics**: Populist strongman model
- **Literature**: Shakespeare, countless works
- **Quotations**: "Veni vidi vici," "Et tu Brute," "Crossing the Rubicon," "Ides of March"
- **Empire**: Transformational figure—ended Republic, began Empire (indirectly)

Debate continues: Savior or destroyer? Genius or tyrant? Both?
