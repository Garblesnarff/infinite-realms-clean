# Sky Dominion - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

### Age of Laputa (1500-700 years ago)
Advanced civilization mastered Aetherium crystals and created floating cities. Population of millions living in sky archipelago. Peaceful scientific society focused on ecological harmony and knowledge preservation.

### The Great Hubris (900 years ago)
Laputan scientists created weapons capable of destroying continents. Orbital death rays, gravity manipulation, weather control. Built to defend against surface nations' jealousy.

### The Descent (700 years ago)
After accidentally destroying several surface cities in demonstration of power, Laputan king ordered civilization's dissolution. Most citizens descended to surface, destroying their flight technology to prevent misuse. Only Laputa itself and royal family remained as guardians.

### The Exile (700-500 years ago)
Laputan descendants integrated into surface cultures, keeping heritage secret. Royal bloodlines preserved knowledge of Laputa's location and access codes through oral tradition. Watchers established to prevent rediscovery.

### The Industrial Age (200 years ago-present)
Surface civilizations discovered Aetherium deposits and developed crude flight technology. Goliath Empire rose to dominance through military application of crystals. Legends of Laputa dismissed as myth.

### Current Era (Campaign Start)
Aetherium becoming scarce as surface mining exhausts easily accessible deposits. Goliath Empire desperate for new sources. Ancient texts mentioning Laputa rediscovered, sparking treasure hunt.

## Aetherium Crystal Details

### Types

**Clear Aetherium** (Most Common):
- Basic levitation and power storage
- Found in surface mines
- Lifespan: 50-100 years before dimming
- Dimming crystals cause crashes

**Blue Aetherium** (Rare):
- Enhanced power output, weapon applications
- Deep mine exclusive
- Lifespan: 100-200 years
- Military hoards these

**Green Aetherium** (Very Rare):
- Ecological applications, growth acceleration
- Only Laputa produces these naturally
- Lifespan: Centuries if properly maintained
- Laputan gardens use these

**Black Aetherium** (Legendary):
- Ultimate power, reality manipulation
- Royal throne uses one
- Potentially immortal
- Sentient—can communicate with attuned users

### Properties

**Levitation Mechanism**: Crystals project anti-gravity field proportional to their size and quality. Larger crystals or multiple crystals create stronger effects.

**Power Generation**: Convert ambient magical energy into usable power. Surface world doesn't understand magic aspect, treats as purely physical.

**Resonance**: Attuned crystals can communicate across distances, basis for Laputan control systems.

**Growth**: Natural crystals grow slowly over centuries in high-magic environments. Laputa can cultivate them.

**Death**: Exhausted crystals shatter into dust. Cannot be recharged by surface technology (Laputa could).

### Ecological Impact

**Surface Mining**: Devastating environmental damage, toxic runoff, habitat destruction.

**Overuse**: Depleting global Aetherium supply, causing increased airship crashes.

**Laputan Solution**: Sustainable crystal cultivation, but requires Laputan knowledge to replicate.

## Technology Systems

### Airship Construction

**Types**:
- **Cargo Haulers**: Large, slow, heavily armored
- **Military Cruisers**: Fast, armed, medium armor
- **Pirate Vessels**: Modified civilian ships, customized
- **Scout Craft**: Small, fast, lightly armed
- **Laputan Fliers**: Crystal-powered, no mechanical engines needed

**Components**:
- **Lift Crystals**: Primary levitation
- **Engines**: Propulsion (steam, clockwork, or later petrol)
- **Ballast**: Altitude control
- **Weapons**: Cannons, harpoons, boarding equipment
- **Navigation**: Maps, compasses, crystal sensors

### Laputan Technology

**Robot Guardians**:
- **Civilian Models**: Gentle, gardening and maintenance
- **Military Models**: Capable of devastating force
- **Command Structure**: Obey royal bloodline absolutely
- **Reproduction**: Can manufacture more in factory

**Weapon Systems**:
- **Orbital Death Ray**: Heat beam from space, city-killing
- **Gravity Manipulation**: Crush or levitate objects
- **Weather Control**: Create storms, lightning
- **Force Barriers**: Impenetrable shields
- **Robot Armies**: Thousands of military units

**Life Support**:
- **Atmosphere Generation**: Creates breathable air
- **Water Cycling**: Eternal waterfalls and streams
- **Food Production**: Automated gardens and greenhouses
- **Temperature Control**: Perfect climate year-round

## Causality Chains

### The Crystal Shortage Crisis
1. Surface mining depletes easily accessible Aetherium
2. Prices skyrocket, poor nations lose airship access
3. Empire monopolizes remaining supply for military
4. Economic collapse in crystal-dependent regions
5. Desperate search for new sources leads to Laputa
6. Discovery could save economy or trigger war

### Muska's Ascension Plan
1. Discover pendant's significance through research
2. Locate Sheeta through imperial orphanage records
3. Capture her to access Laputa
4. Activate city's defenses as demonstration
5. Demand world's surrender or face annihilation
6. Rule as immortal god-king from sky throne

### Robot Awakening Sequence
1. Sheeta's pendant wakes dormant mining robots
2. Robots protect her instinctively
3. Empire analyzes robots, traces to Laputa
4. More robots activate as pendant used frequently
5. Global robot awakening if Laputa fully activated
6. Potential robot army defending or destroying world

## Cultural Details

### Surface Society
- **Class System**: Industrial barons, military officers, workers, unemployed
- **Religion**: Declining, replaced by science and progress ideology
- **Family**: Nuclear families in cities, extended in rural areas
- **Education**: Limited to wealthy, apprenticeships for workers
- **Entertainment**: Theater for rich, taverns for poor

### Sky Pirate Culture
- **Honor Code**: Unwritten rules about targets and rescue
- **Family**: Crews become chosen families
- **Inheritance**: Ships passed to worthiest, not eldest
- **Legends**: Stories of greatest raids and discoveries
- **Songs**: Shanties passed between crews

### Laputan Legacy
- **Philosophy**: Harmony between technology and nature
- **Art**: Geometric patterns merged with organic forms
- **Architecture**: Buildings designed to last millennia
- **Science**: Understanding rather than exploitation
- **Tragedy**: Perfect society destroyed by its own power

## End Game Scenarios

### Complete Destruction
Sheeta speaks Destruction Spell, Laputa crumbles. Gardens survive as floating islands, weapons sink. World safe but wonder lost. Aetherium cultivation knowledge destroyed, forcing surface to develop alternatives.

### Partial Preservation
Party destroys weapon systems but preserves gardens and crystal cultivation tech. Share knowledge with trustworthy nations. Risky but potentially saves civilization from crystal shortage.

### New Sky Kingdom
Party claims Laputa, promises responsible rule. Must constantly resist corruption and defend against jealous nations. Becomes major campaign factor going forward.

### Muska Victory
Colonel claims throne, party escapes. World under tyrant god's rule. Potential resistance campaign.

### Shared Governance
Party, Watchers, and reformed Empire create council to manage Laputa's resources. Bureaucratic but peaceful solution.
