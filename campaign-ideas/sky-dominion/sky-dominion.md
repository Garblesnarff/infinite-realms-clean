# Sky Dominion
*Where ancient cities float and greed pulls them down*

## Campaign Overview

In a world where ancient flying cities drift through endless skies, powered by mysterious levitation crystals called Aetherium, the party finds themselves caught between sky pirates, military empires, and the last survivors of a fallen civilization. When a young orphan with a glowing pendant falls from the sky into their lives, they discover she holds the key to Laputa—the legendary capital of the sky people, thought to be a myth filled with unimaginable power and treasure.

The military government of the Goliath Empire wants Laputa's weapons to dominate the world. Sky pirates led by the charismatic but ruthless Dola want its treasure. The girl, Sheeta, just wants to understand her heritage and protect the peaceful floating gardens her ancestors created. The party must navigate airship battles, ancient ruins, robot guardians, and moral choices about technology that could either save or destroy civilization.

As they ascend through cloud layers toward Laputa, they'll discover the terrible truth: the sky civilization fell because they achieved too much power, and Laputa's defense systems remain active, waiting to rain destruction on the surface world if anyone attempts to claim its throne.

## Core Themes

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Muska's True Identity**: He's also Laputan royalty, making him legitimate threat to throne.

**The Robot's Loyalty**: Guardian serves whoever sits on throne, could become enemy if Muska claims it.

**Aetherium Mortality**: Crystals are alive, slowly dying. Using them accelerates their extinction.

**The Watchers' Secret**: They're descendants of Laputan people who chose exile over power.

**Sheeta's Memory**: Her "amnesia" is inherited memory blocking—too much power for child to know.

**Laputa's Sentience**: The city itself is semi-aware, mourning its lost people.

**Party Member's Heritage**: One party member discovers Laputan ancestry too.

**The True Destruction Spell**: Destroys user along with city unless someone else speaks it for them.

## Victory Conditions

**Preservation Ending**: Destroy weapons systems but preserve gardens and peaceful technology. Balanced outcome.

**Destruction Ending**: Speak the Destruction Spell, Laputa falls. World safe but wonder lost forever.

**New Sky Kingdom**: Claim Laputa for party, promise to use power responsibly. Dangerous victory requiring constant vigilance.

**Goliath Victory**: Stop Muska but military claims Laputa. Technically successful but world now threatened by empire.

**Pirate Paradise**: Dola's family takes over, establishes sky pirate haven. Chaotic neutral ending.

## Defeat Conditions

**Muska Triumphant**: Colonel claims throne, rains death on world. Party becomes rebels or submits.

**Crystal Catastrophe**: Reckless use of Aetherium causes Laputa to crash, killing millions below.

**Robot Rebellion**: Ancient guardians activate fully, execute centuries-old defense protocols.

**Lost in Skies**: Party ship destroyed during exploration, stranded on hostile floating island.

**Corruption**: Party members seduced by power become new tyrants worse than Muska.
