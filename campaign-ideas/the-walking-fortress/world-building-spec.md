### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Walking Fortress**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Cursed by a witch and seeking refuge in a wizard's walking castle, the party becomes entangled in Howl's secrets—his contract with a fire demon, his role in a destructive war, and his missing heart—discovering that breaking curses and contracts requires the courage to love and be vulnerable.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the war between kingdoms—its origins, propaganda, and why neither side can stop
    *   Explain the nature of contracts with demons and how they bind souls
    *   Describe how Howl gave his heart to Calcifer and what this means for both of them
    *   Write about the Witch of the Waste's origins and why she became so powerful and lonely
    *   Detail the magic system—how it relates to emotions, hearts, and transformation
    *   Explain Madame Suliman's role and the royal family's dependence on war wizards

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**

    *   **Howl's Household** (Major) - The party, Howl, Calcifer, Markl, goal: survive, break contracts, end war
    *   **The Royal Court** (Major) - King and Madame Suliman, goal: win war through magical superiority
    *   **The Enemy Kingdom** (Major) - Opposing royal forces, goal: defend against aggression

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Howl's Moving Castle** - Walking mechanical fortress with magic door connecting multiple locations
*   **The Capital City** - War-time kingdom with propaganda, airships, and military preparations
*   **The Waste** - Barren magical desert where the Witch lived in isolation
*   **Howl's Secret Garden** - Beautiful place from his childhood where he met Calcifer
*   **The Battlefield** - Devastated landscape showing war's magical destruction
*   Each location represents different aspects of the themes—home, duty, isolation, innocence, destruction

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the curse is not broken THEN the afflicted party member suffers permanent transformation
*   IF Howl transforms too many times THEN he becomes a monster permanently and loses his humanity
*   IF Calcifer dies THEN Howl dies, and vice versa due to their contract
*   IF the contract is broken without understanding THEN both Calcifer and Howl could be destroyed
*   IF the party helps Howl find emotional courage THEN he can reclaim his heart
*   IF they expose the war's futility THEN both kingdoms may seek peace
*   IF they discover the childhood promise THEN they understand how to break the contract safely
*   IF love and courage are demonstrated THEN curses break naturally—magic follows the heart
