### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Perfect Killer**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party are investigators who saved a child named Johan from a massacre years ago. Now, impossibly perfect murders plague the city—orchestrated by someone who manipulates victims into killing themselves or others. All evidence points to Johan, now an adult of terrifying intelligence and charm. The party must hunt someone they saved while confronting moral questions: did saving him create a monster? Is Johan evil or a victim? In pursuing justice, will they become monsters themselves? This is a psychological thriller where victory cannot come through combat—only through investigation, moral choices, and confronting the darkness in themselves. The campaign explores the nature of evil, responsibility for one's creations, and whether true redemption is possible for either the hunter or the hunted.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Massacre at the Liebert Estate: A wealthy family slaughtered in their mansion; only twin children Johan and Anna survived; party investigated and saved them.
    *   Chronicle Johan's Adoption: Taken in by a prestigious family (doctors or scholars); seemed to thrive; adoptive family later died under mysterious circumstances.
    *   Explain Johan's Philosophy: "All lives are equal"—meaning equally worthless. Humanity is fundamentally monstrous. He seeks to prove this by making "good people" into killers.
    *   Describe Johan's Methods: Psychological manipulation; finds broken people, exploits their trauma, convinces them to kill for him then themselves. Leaves no evidence.
    *   Detail the Kinderheim 511 Project (adapted): Secret program that traumatized orphans to create perfect spies/killers; Johan may have been subject; erased his identity and created his nihilism.
    *   Chronicle Previous Victims: Pattern of murders following Johan—people driven to suicide, murder-suicides, victims who seem to kill themselves willingly.
    *   Explain the Investigation Bureau: City organization that hunts dangerous criminals; party works for or with them; values both justice and lawfulness.
    *   Detail the Philosophical Question: What is a monster? Someone who kills, or someone who makes others kill? Is someone without identity or empathy even human?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Investigation Team (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Stop the serial killings; capture Johan; determine truth about the murders; maintain their own moral integrity.
        *   **Hierarchy:** May be official city watch, private investigators, or mage-inquisitors; work as team.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Solve murders, bring killer to justice.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has personal stake—guilt over saving Johan, obsession with the case, fear they're becoming monsters in pursuit.
        *   **Assets:** Investigation authority, forensic magic/skills, contacts in city, determination.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with Investigation Bureau; hunting Johan; psychological targets of Johan's manipulation.
    *   **The Investigation Bureau** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain law and order, solve crimes, protect citizens.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Director at top, inspectors, investigators, support staff.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Law enforcement and criminal investigation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some investigators (like Lunge) become so obsessed with cases they compromise themselves.
        *   **Assets:** Legal authority, resources, forensic capabilities, city-wide network.
        *   **Relationships:** Employ or allied with party; target Johan; bureaucratic and constrained by law.
    *   **Johan's Network** (Minor - Shadowy)
        *   **Goals:** Serve Johan's plan (often unknowingly); commit murders he orchestrates; spread his philosophy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Johan at top manipulating all; victims don't realize they're being controlled until it's too late.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—most are ordinary citizens.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has been broken by Johan psychologically and convinced to kill.
        *   **Assets:** Appear normal; can strike anywhere; leave no evidence connecting to Johan.

        *   **Goals:** Criminal enterprise, profit, survival.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Crime lords, smugglers, information brokers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Stay hidden from law enforcement.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party connects the murders to Johan.
    *   **THEN:** Johan becomes aware they're hunting him. Generate: cryptic messages left for party, psychological attacks targeting individual members, acceleration of his plans, direct contact attempts.
    *   **IF:** A party member acts immorally (torture suspect, kill without due process, manipulate innocent).
    *   **THEN:** Morality tracker shifts toward vengeance. Generate: Johan comments on this action (proving his point about human darkness), other NPCs react with concern, psychological weight increases.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers Johan's traumatic past at Kinderheim.
    *   **THEN:** Moral complexity increases. Generate: sympathy despite horror, Anna's perspective that he's victim AND monster, philosophical debates within party, redemption path becomes visible.
    *   **IF:** The party encounters one of Johan's manipulated killers before they act.
    *   **THEN:** Choice moment—can they save this person or must they stop them lethally? Generate: psychological battle to break Johan's influence, moral dilemma if person has already killed, tracking who was saved vs. who was stopped.
    *   **IF:** Inspector Lunge's obsession escalates.
    *   **THEN:** He becomes cautionary tale of becoming monster while hunting monster. Generate: Lunge making moral compromises, his family leaving him, party must decide whether to enable or stop him.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to kill Johan.
    *   **THEN:** Multiple outcomes based on method and justification. Generate: If in cold blood—they've proven his philosophy correct; if in defense—morally gray; if they hesitate—Johan may escape or counter-manipulate.
    *   **IF:** Anna confronts Johan directly.
    *   **THEN:** Only path to redemption ending. Generate: Johan's mask cracks, childhood trauma revealed, possibility he surrenders, requires party's moral standing to be intact (high justice, low vengeance).
    *   **IF:** The party maintains moral integrity throughout (high justice).
    *   **THEN:** Final confrontation offers legal justice option. Generate: Johan's philosophy challenged by their example, he may surrender or create final test, bittersweet but clean victory possible.
    *   **IF:** The party becomes corrupted (high vengeance).
    *   **THEN:** Pyrrhic victory—stop Johan but prove his point. Generate: Johan's satisfied death, party realizes they've become monsters, hollow victory where evil wins philosophically even as it dies physically.
