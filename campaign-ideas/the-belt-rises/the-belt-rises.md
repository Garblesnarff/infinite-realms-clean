# The Belt Rises
**The Expanse Stretches Before Us—and Someone Must Pay**

## Campaign Overview

The Belt Rises takes place in a colonized solar system where humanity has spread across planets and asteroid belts but remains divided by gravity and politics. The party consists of Belters—working-class people born in the asteroid belt's low gravity, exploited by Earth and Mars for resources. Starting as crew aboard the ice hauler *Canterbury*, a routine mission becomes a conspiracy that could ignite war between Earth, Mars, and the Belt.

The campaign blends hard sci-fi realism with political thriller elements and found family dynamics. There are no FTL drives or aliens—just humans, physics, and the void. Travel takes weeks or months. Resources are precious. Combat in zero-G is disorienting and lethal. The party uncovers a conspiracy involving a alien protomolecule, corporate greed, and faction manipulation that threatens all of humanity. Their choices ripple through the solar system's fragile political balance.

This is a campaign about class warfare in space, about ordinary people caught in power games, about physics being unforgiving, and about whether humanity can unite before self-destruction.

## Core Themes

- **Class and Exploitation**: Belters as exploited labor class
- **Realistic Space**: Physics is dangerous, space is deadly
- **Political Complexity**: No pure good or evil, just interests
- **Conspiracy and Truth**: Uncovering what powers want hidden
- **Found Family**: Crew becomes home in hostile void
- **Survival and Sacrifice**: Resources are limited, choices have weight

## Session Breakdown (36 Sessions)

### Act I: The Canterbury and the Scopuli (Sessions 1-9)

**Session 1-2: Ice Hauler Life**
Party works aboard *Canterbury*, hauling ice from Saturn's rings to Belt stations. Cramped quarters, recycled air, monotonous work. Crew dynamics established. Receive distress signal from *Scopuli*—investigate or not? Captain decides to investigate (legally required).

**Session 3-4: The Ambush**
Small shuttle crew (party) investigates derelict *Scopuli*. Trap. Stealth ship nukes *Canterbury*, killing hundreds including party's friends. Only shuttle crew survives. Stranded with limited air, accused of conspiracy. Mars and Earth blame each other. War drums beat.

**Session 5-6: Pickup by the Donnager**
Rescued by Mars Navy battleship *Donnager*. Interrogated—no one believes they're innocent ice hauler crew. While aboard, *Donnager* attacked by same stealth ships (shouldn't exist, violate treaties). *Donnager* destroyed. Party escapes in ship *Rocinante* during chaos. Now fugitives from everyone.

**Session 7-8: Unraveling the Conspiracy**
Tracking *Scopuli*'s origins, discover it was bait. Stealth ships are built with Earth/Mars tech but operated by unknown party. Someone is trying to start war. Find evidence pointing to Eros station—Belt colony. Head there to investigate.

**Session 9: Eros**
Bustling Belt station, vice and commerce. Searching for conspiracy leads. Encounter detective Miller—cop investigating missing woman (Julie Mao, rich heiress gone radical). Reluctant alliance. Discover corporate presence (Protogen) doing illegal experiments.

### Act II: The Protomolecule (Sessions 10-20)

**Session 10-11: The Infection**
Eros suddenly quarantined. Protogen locks down station. Inside, horror unfolds: alien protomolecule infection. Turns people into inhuman biomass. Test on 100,000 unwilling subjects. Party trapped inside with Miller. Fight through infected, corporate mercenaries, system failures.

**Session 12-13: The Escape**
Desperate run to docking bay. Watch station transform into alien structure. Rescue survivors but must leave thousands. Launch as Eros becomes something else—alien tech using human biomass to build. Trauma and guilt.

**Session 14-15: The Truth About Julie**
Miller finds Julie Mao—she's patient zero, merged with protomolecule. Still partially conscious. She controls Eros. It's moving—piloting toward Earth to infect planet (billions dead). Race to stop it.

**Session 16-17: The Nauvoo**
Plan: Crash generation ship *Nauvoo* into Eros, knock it off course. Coordination between Earth, Mars, and Belt (first cooperation). Nauvoo launches but Eros dodges (shouldn't be possible). Julie's consciousness directing. Eros still heading to Earth.

**Session 18-19: Miller's Walk**
Miller realizes only way: Go to Julie, convince her to redirect. Suicidal mission. Emotional goodbye with crew. Lands on Eros (now alien landscape). Finds Julie. Through love and memory, convinces her. Eros redirects to Venus. Miller and Julie die together. Crashing into Venus. Heroic sacrifice.

**Session 20: Aftermath and Secrets**
Immediate crisis ended but protomolecule now on Venus, building something. Political fallout: Who created it? Who's responsible? Corporate executives arrested but higher powers protected. OPA (Outer Planets Alliance) rises as political force.

### Act III: Venus Rising (Sessions 21-28)

**Session 21-22: The Ring**
Months later. Venus erupts, launches something to orbit: massive ring structure. Everyone investigates. Ring is gateway—to what? Ships from all factions converge. Tensions high. Party mediates or exploits.

**Session 23-24: The Slow Zone**
Ship enters Ring, pulled into bubble universe. Physics altered: speed limit enforced, ships going too fast shut down. Called "Slow Zone." Station at center. First contact with protomolecule builders' technology (not builders themselves—they're long dead).

**Session 25-26: The Station**
Investigating central station. Vast alien structure. Learns: Protomolecule is Von Neumann terraforming tool built by extinct civilization (the Ring Builders). They built 1,373 ring gates throughout galaxy. All inactive for billion years. Party's activation woke them.

**Session 27-28: The Test**
Station is security system. Determines if new species (humanity) is threat. Violence triggers defenses (kills everyone). Must convince all factions to stand down while trapped together. Diplomacy between Earth, Mars, Belt, corporations, rebels. Success opens gates. Failure means death.

### Act IV: The New Frontier (Sessions 29-36)

**Session 29-30: Thousand Suns**
Gates open. Access to 1,373 habitable systems. Gold rush. Every faction claims systems. OPA declares independence. Colonization begins. Party famous, offered governor positions, military contracts, corporate deals. What do they choose?

**Session 31-32: Illus**
Sent to frontier colony world Illus (or chosen destination). Lithium-rich, valuable. Two factions: Corporate charter vs. Belter refugees. Tensions explode. Party mediates conflict while investigating alien ruins.

**Session 33-34: The Artifacts**
Alien structures on Illus activate. Defense mechanisms from Ring Builder war. Ancient weapons and terraforming systems. Poorly understood, extremely dangerous. Choice: Exploit for power or secure/destroy for safety?

**Session 35: The Investigator**
Proto-Miller (protomolecule ghost/AI using Miller's memories) appears. Reveals: Ring Builders were destroyed by something that killed them through the gates. That something is still out there. Protomolecule seeks to understand what killed its creators. Warning: Going through gates draws attention.

**Session 36: Choice**
Final decision: Humanity stands at crossroads:
- **Expansion**: Colonize systems, risk drawing enemy
- **Containment**: Close gates, stay safe but limited
- **Investigation**: Find and confront what killed Ring Builders
- **Exploitation**: Use protomolecule as weapon

Party's choice shapes humanity's future. Epilogue shows consequences decades later.
