**Campaign Type / Genre:** Magical Academy / Mystery / Legendary Hero's Origin / Tragic Romance
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions

**Tone (keywords):** lyrical, mysterious, musical-magic, tragic-romance, legendary-making, knowledge-seeking
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
At the University, the greatest institution of learning in the Four Corners, students study sympathy (binding magic), alchemy, artificing, and the forbidden art of Naming—speaking the true names of things to command reality itself. The players are talented but poor students, navigating the politics of wealthy classmates, the mysteries of the Archives (a library containing dangerous knowledge), and the hunt for the Chandrian—seven immortal beings who appear when their names are spoken and destroy all who know of them. As they uncover fragments of the Chandrian's history, master increasingly dangerous magic, and pursue forbidden love and revenge, they risk becoming legends themselves—but legends are often tragedies.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — Admission and Secrets (Sessions 1–5):** The players arrive at the University as impoverished but talented students. They must navigate entrance exams, paying tuition through wit and skill, earning places in classes (Sympathy, Alchemy, Artificing), and dealing with wealthy rival students. One player begins researching the Chandrian in the Archives after a personal tragedy, discovering the librarians guard more than books—they guard dangerous truths. They encounter Master Elodin, who teaches Naming (speaking true names to command reality) but seems half-mad. First manifestations of natural talent appear.

*   **Act II — The Name of the Wind (Sessions 6–11):** Players advance in their studies, learning advanced sympathy (binding distant objects), crafting artifacts, and brewing alchemical compounds. They pursue dangerous knowledge in the Archives, discovering hints about the Amyr (legendary heroes who committed terrible acts "for the greater good") and the Chandrian's ancient crime. They venture beyond the University to Severen (noble court) where they encounter politics, assassination attempts, and a tragic romance with someone above their station. One player begins learning Naming from Elodin, struggling to quiet their mind enough to hear the wind's true name. The Chandrian appear when their investigation gets too close, forcing desperate flight.

*   **Act III — The Doors of Stone (Sessions 12–15+):** The players seek the Doors of Stone, legendary entrance to the Fae realm where time flows differently and Namers once learned their art. They must survive the Fae courts' deadly games, encounter Felurian (ancient fae seductress who drives men mad), and learn from the Cthaeh—an oracle who sees all futures and speaks only to cause maximum tragedy. They return changed, with deep knowledge but cursed by the Cthaeh's words which will ensure their plans fail tragically. The final confrontation with the Chandrian reveals terrible truths: the players' quest for revenge or knowledge has set in motion events that will break the world, fulfilling prophecy and becoming the tragedy that makes them legendary.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sympathy Magic System**
*   Binding allows linking similar objects to transfer forces. Wax doll + real person = voodoo damage. But: energy conservation applies.
*   **Alar (Will):** Mental strength determines binding power. Players train to split mind, hold multiple bindings.
*   **Friction:** Every binding wastes energy as heat. Poor bindings can set your blood boiling (literally).

### 2. **Naming**
*   Speaking true names commands reality. "Wind!" and the wind obeys.
*   Requires **Sleeping Mind**—intuitive, quiet state of perfect understanding.
*   Can't be practiced deliberately—names come when you truly understand the thing's essence.
*   Naming breaks natural laws—it's not energy transfer but command over reality.

### 3. **The Archives**
*   Massive library with strict rules. Banned sections require special permission.
*   Knowledge checks to research topics. Librarians watch for dangerous inquiry.
*   Finding specific information is a challenge—the Archives are vast and deliberately obtuse about dangerous topics.

### 4. **Tuition Economy**
*   Players must pay tuition each term. Wealth affects social status and opportunities.
*   Can reduce tuition through tests of knowledge, but risky—fail and pay more.
*   Side activities: performing music, crafting items, alchemy, mercenary work.

### 5. **The Cthaeh Curse**
*   If players speak to the Cthaeh, all their plans will fail in the worst possible way.
*   DM knows this—subtly ensures player choices lead to tragic consequences.
*   Not obvious doom—everything seems to work until the worst moment, then cascades into tragedy.

## Central Conflict

The pursuit of knowledge and revenge comes at terrible cost. Players must choose between wisdom and vengeance, love and duty, safety and truth. The tragic irony is that becoming legendary means becoming a cautionary tale. Magic is beautiful but dangerous. True names grant power but cost understanding. The Chandrian cannot be defeated because the players don't yet understand what they truly are or why they do what they do.
