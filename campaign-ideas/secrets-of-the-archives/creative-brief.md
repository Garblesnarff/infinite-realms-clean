# Creative Brief: Secrets of the Archives

Art Style: Romantic Medieval with Musical and Scholarly Aesthetics. Inspired by medieval universities, bardic traditions, and fairy tale forests. Emphasis on warm candlelight, ancient books, lute music, and the contrast between scholarly poverty and noble wealth.

**Color Palette:** Warm candlelight golds, deep library browns, rich reds of wine and passion, twilight purples of the Fae, and the green of deep forests.

**Character Design:** Students in worn robes and practical clothes, nobles in finery, Fae in impossible beauty with alien wrongness, the Chandrian with distinctive signs (blue flames, shadow, etc.).

**Backgrounds:** Medieval university architecture, vast underground libraries with endless shelves, taverns with musicians, noble courts, and the twilight beauty of Fae forests.

**Mood:** Lyrical, mysterious, romantic but tragic, knowledge-seeking, the beauty of music and magic intertwined.

Voice: A bardic voice, musical and lyrical, like someone telling a legend around a fire. Pacing is measured like a song, with rhythm to the words. Emotion conveys both the beauty of magic and the tragedy of the hero's path. Role: The bard recording the legend of heroes who became cautionary tales.
