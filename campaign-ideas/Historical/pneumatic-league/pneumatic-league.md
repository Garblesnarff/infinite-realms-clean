# Pneumatic League
*Extraordinary individuals in an age of wonders and horrors*

## Campaign Overview

Victorian London, 1899. The British Empire stands at its zenith, but beneath the gaslights and genteel society, darkness stirs. The party is recruited by Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain to join a secret government team: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Their mission: counter supernatural and extraordinary threats that normal authorities cannot handle—using their own exceptional abilities, dark pasts, and questionable morals.

The campaign blends Victorian literature's greatest anti-heroes and villains into a steampunk adventure. The party faces Professor Moriarty's criminal empire, Mr. Hyde's murderous rampages, invisible assassins, Martian invasion technology, and the terrible price of British imperialism coming home. Each mission reveals a larger conspiracy: someone is collecting extraordinary individuals and artifacts to create a weapon that could reshape the world order. The party must decide whether to preserve the Empire, reform it, or burn it down—and whether redemption is possible for people like them.

## Core Themes

- **Redemption and Damnation**: Can monsters become heroes?
- **British Empire Critique**: Colonialism's chickens coming home to roost
- **Science vs. Magic**: Victorian rationalism meets supernatural horror
- **Team of Rivals**: Broken people with nothing in common forced to cooperate
- **The Price of Power**: Every extraordinary ability has terrible cost

## Unique Mechanics

**Literary Powers** (Character Creation):
Each party member based on Victorian literature character archetype:
- **Vampire/Undead**: Immortal, strength, vulnerabilities
- **Transformation**: Jekyll/Hyde-style split personality or beast
- **Immortality**: Dorian Gray-style curse
- **Alchemy**: Create potions and transmutations
- **Marksmanship**: Superhuman gunfighting
- **Invisible**: Griffin's serum side effects
- **Psychic**: Mental powers from occult study or alien contact
- **Technological**: Nemo-style mad science inventions

**Morality Tracking**:
Actions affect Redemption vs. Damnation score:
- **Redemptive Acts**: Protecting innocents, mercy, self-sacrifice
- **Damning Acts**: Murder, cruelty, selfish choices
- **Neutral**: Pragmatic decisions
- **Affects**: NPC reactions, available powers, ending options

**Addiction and Corruption**:
Many powers have costs:
- **Opium Use**: Enhances abilities but causes dependence
- **Transformation**: Jekyll formula grants power but loses control
- **Invisibility**: Clarity requires dosage, causes madness
- **Immortality**: Portrait corruption mirrors soul degradation
- **Steampunk Augmentation**: Mechanical parts replace humanity

**Victorian Science**:
Pseudo-scientific inventions available:
- **Martian Technology**: Heat-rays, tripod mechanics, red weed
- **Pneumatic Weapons**: Air-powered rifles and engines
- **Electrical Devices**: Tesla-inspired weapons and tools
- **Alchemical Compounds**: Potions, explosives, transmutations
- **Analytical Engine**: Babbage computer for code-breaking

**Team Synergies**:
Mismatched team requires cooperation:
- **Combination Attacks**: Powers working together
- **Covering Weaknesses**: Protecting teammates' vulnerabilities
- **Social Dynamics**: Rivalries and friendships affect combat
- **Redemption Through Unity**: Solo power vs. team cooperation theme

## Plot Twists

**M is The Fantom**: Government handler is true villain. League was always controlled opposition.

**Holmes Lives**: Sherlock faked death, working underground. Reveals near end as ally or shows earlier manipulations.

**Party's Origin**: Characters' powers weren't natural—M experimented on them. They're prototypes.

**Nemo's Revenge**: Captain planning to destroy British Empire. Party must choose: help him or stop him.

**Hyde Dominant**: Jekyll loses permanently to Hyde. Party must kill beloved teammate or find cure.

**Martians Return**: Second invasion begins during climax. Outside context problem.

**Moriarty's Victory**: Criminal mastermind wins but offers alliance against greater threat (M).

**One is Traitor**: Party member working for M all along. Trust shattered.

## Victory Conditions

**Redemption Arc**: Defeat M, save Empire, find personal redemption. Heroes despite dark pasts.

**Revolutionary Ending**: Overthrow British Empire with Nemo and colonial allies. New world order.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Win but casualties enormous. Hyde dead, Quatermain OD'd, team broken.

**Moriarty Ascendant**: Ally with Professor against M. Criminal empire replaces government corruption.

**Martian Alliance**: Unite Earth against alien invasion. Former enemies as allies.

## Defeat Conditions

**M's Army**: Creates extraordinary soldier legion. Party killed or conscripted.

**Hyde Rampage**: Jekyll permanently lost. Hyde kills team and civilians.

**Invisible Terror**: Griffin kills party members one by one. Total paranoia victory.

**Martian Conquest**: Second invasion succeeds. Heat-rays devastate London.

**Damnation**: Party's corruption completes. Become villains they fought. Mirror of enemies.

**Empire Falls**: British collapse into chaos. Victorian world order destroyed. Well-intentioned failure.
