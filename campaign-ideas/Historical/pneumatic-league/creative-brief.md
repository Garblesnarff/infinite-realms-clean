# Pneumatic League - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Victorian Gothic meets steampunk adventure. Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen aesthetic. Dark, detailed, literary. Gaslight shadows, brass machinery, Gothic horror. Detailed period clothing mixed with impossible technology.

## Color Palettes
**Victorian London**: Fog Grey (#808080), Gaslight Yellow (#FFFF99), Soot Black (#1C1C1C), Thames Brown (#8B4513), Blood Red (#8B0000)
**Empire Gold**: Royal Purple (#800080), Colonial Gold (#FFD700), Navy Blue (#000080), Brass (#B5A642)
**Occult**: Mystic Green (#2E8B57), Alchemical Purple (#9370DB), Martian Red (#CD5C5C)
**Nautilus**: Deep Sea Blue (#00008B), Steel Grey (#708090), Electric Aqua (#00FFFF)

## Music
Victorian parlor music corrupted. String quartet with industrial percussion. Organ for horror sequences. Different national themes (British march, Indian raga for Nemo, American frontier for Sawyer). Gothic choir for supernatural moments.

## Voice Direction
**Mina Murray**: Dignified trauma. British accent, measured. Strength masking pain.
**Quatermain**: Weathered explorer. Slightly drunk. Sean Connery's weary wisdom.
**Jekyll/Hyde**: Refined British → Cockney brutality. Vocal transformation.
**Nemo**: Indian accent, cultured rage. Patrick Stewart meets revolutionary.
**Dorian Gray**: Seductive poshness. No real emotion, perfect performance.

## Cinematic Moments
- League assembles (iconic team shot)
- Hyde transformation (body horror)
- Nautilus surfacing (Victorian submarine emerging from Thames)
- Invisible Man hunt (paint revealing Griffin)
- Moriarty vs. Holmes (Reichenbach Falls flashback)
- Martian tripod activation (War of the Worlds homage)
- Final battle at British Museum (artifacts activating)
- Redemption or damnation (character arcs concluding)

## Player Experience
Literary power fantasy. Playing iconic characters reimagined. Victorian London as dark playground. Moral complexity—no clear heroes. Gothic atmosphere with steampunk action. Team dysfunction becoming strength.
