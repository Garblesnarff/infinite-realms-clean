# Pneumatic League - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

**1897**: Dracula arrives in London. Mina Murray bitten, Van Helsing destroys vampire. Mina survives scarred.

**1898**: Martian invasion (H.G. Wells). Tripods devastate countryside. Bacteria kills invaders. Technology left behind.

**1899**: Campaign begins. British Intelligence forms League to counter extraordinary threats. Victoria's reign ending. Century turning.

**Alternate History**: All Victorian literature actually happened. Fictional characters are real historical figures.

## Victorian Literary Universe

**Confirmed Events**:
- Dracula's London invasion
- Frankenstein's monster creation (1818)
- Jekyll's transformation serum (1886)
- Griffin's invisibility formula (1897)
- Moriarty vs. Holmes (1891)
- Martian invasion (1898)
- Allan Quatermain's African adventures (1880s)
- Dorian Gray's portrait curse (1890)
- Captain Nemo's submarine (1870s)

**Implications**: Magic, mad science, aliens all real. Victorian rationalism coexists with supernatural. British Empire encountered wonders and horrors colonizing world.

## British Empire Detailed

**Peak Power**: Controls quarter of globe. Sun never sets. But cracks showing:
- Colonial resistance (Nemo represents India)
- Irish independence movement
- African uprisings
- Asian resistance

**Dark Foundation**: Empire built on:
- Slavery (recently abolished but effects linger)
- Resource extraction
- Cultural destruction
- Violence masked as "civilization"

**Imperial Gothic**: Horror genre revealing Empire's sins coming home. Dracula is foreign invasion. Jekyll/Hyde is English gentleman's secret savagery. Invisible Man is surveillance state.

## The League's Purpose

**Official Mission**: Counter extraordinary threats to Crown and Empire.

**Actual Purpose** (revealed): M testing super-soldier program using expendable assets (damaged individuals no one cares about).

**Funding**: Black budget from Intelligence office. Unlimited resources for missions.

**Authority**: Can operate outside law. License to kill. Diplomatic immunity.

**Oversight**: Campion Bond reports to M. League mostly independent.

## London Geography

**West End**: Wealth, opera, Parliament, British Museum. Where elite live.

**East End**: Poverty, Whitechapel, opium dens, Limehouse. Where League finds answers.

**Thames**: Dividing river. Nautilus docks secretly. Smuggling route.

**Underground**: Sewers, forgotten passages, secret societies. Gothic underbelly.

**Specific Locations**:
- **British Museum**: Occult artifacts from Empire
- **Bedlam**: Asylum for mad and supernatural
- **The Diogenes Club**: Mycroft Holmes' base
- **Fu Manchu's Den**: Limehouse criminal empire
- **The Strand**: Publishing district, newspapers
- **The Docks**: International gateway

## Criminal Underworld

**Professor Moriarty's Web**:

- Network across Europe
- Front companies and corrupt officials
- May actually be working for M

**Fu Manchu's Empire**:

- Potential ally against British

**Jack the Ripper** (possibly):
- Still active or copycat
- May be Griffin or other extraordinary
- Unsolved mystery haunting London
- Horror subplot

## European Powers

**France**: Republican, resentful of British dominance. Has own extraordinary agents (Phantom, Arsene Lupin).

**Germany**: Industrializing rapidly. Mad scientists (Dr. Caligari). Growing military.

**Russia**: Mystics and assassins. Rasputin emerging. Occult focus.

**Austria-Hungary**: Decaying empire. Centers of art and decadence. Dorian Gray's playground.

**All Competing**: For Martian technology, occult artifacts, extraordinary individuals.

## Occult Reality

**Magic Exists**: Alongside science. Victorian rationalism partially correct—many "supernatural" things have scientific explanation. But not all.

**Sources**:
- **Eastern Mysticism**: Nemo's knowledge base
- **Western Occultism**: Hermetic tradition, alchemy
- **Vampirism**: Viral or supernatural? Unclear
- **Curses**: Dorian's portrait, others
- **Alien**: Martian abilities seem magical

**The Museum**: British Museum houses artifacts from conquered lands. Many genuinely powerful. M wants to activate them.

## Technology Level

**Real History Plus**:
- Victorian era technology accurate
- Plus: Nemo's submarines (decades early)
- Plus: Electrical weapons (Tesla-inspired)
- Plus: Analytical engines (early computers)
- Plus: Pneumatic systems (air-powered)
- Plus: Whatever Martians left

**Steampunk Aesthetic**: Brass, gears, steam, Gothic curves. Function and decoration.

**Mad Science**: Individual inventors creating impossible things. Not mass-produced yet.

## M's Plan Details

**Goal**: Create army of extraordinary soldiers for Empire.

**Method**:
1. Recruit or capture exceptional individuals
2. Study their abilities
3. Replicate through science/magic
4. Mass produce enhanced soldiers
5. Conquer world for Britain

**The League**: Test subjects and asset collectors. Their adventures gather data and artifacts.

**Ethics**: None. Ends justify means. Empire's survival paramount.

**Vulnerability**: Hubris. Doesn't expect subjects to rebel.

## Character Backgrounds Extended

**Mina**: Former schoolteacher. Dracula's victim. Lost innocence and humanity. Seeking purpose beyond trauma.

**Quatermain**: Great White Hunter. Committed atrocities in Africa colonizing. Opium numbs guilt. Seeking redemption.

**Jekyll/Hyde**: Respected doctor. Created serum to separate good/evil. Failed catastrophically. Losing himself.

**Dorian**: Aristocrat made immortal. Portrait curse from occult pact. Hedonism without consequence led to soullessness.

**Nemo**: Indian prince. British killed his family. Built Nautilus to fight back. Genius and terrorist.

**Griffin**: Scientist who succeeded in invisibility. Isolation drove mad. Became killer. No redemption likely.

**Sawyer**: American recruited for fresh perspective. Youngest. Moral center. Might die to show stakes.

## Ending Implications

**Empire Preserved**: Britain continues dominance. Colonialism continues. Morally grey.

**Empire Reformed**: Maintain power but address atrocities. Difficult but possible.

**Empire Destroyed**: Nemo and allies win. Colonies free. Chaos short-term, justice long-term.

**Criminal Victory**: Moriarty or similar takes control. Order without morality.

**Martian Return**: Humanity unites or dies. Outside threat forcing cooperation.

**Personal Redemption**: Even if empire unchanged, characters find peace or damnation.

## Adaptation Notes

**Literary Sources**: Draw from Allan Moore's League, original novels, Victorian gothic tradition.

**Sensitivity**: Address racism/sexism of period critically. Challenge, don't celebrate imperial attitudes.

**Power Fantasy**: Let players be extraordinary but emphasize costs.

**Moral Complexity**: No clear good guys. Everyone compromised. Shades of grey.

**Victorian Aesthetic**: Embrace gaslight, fog, Gothic architecture, period detail.
