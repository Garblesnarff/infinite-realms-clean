## Causality Chains and Epic Destinies

### The Prophesied Events (Fixed Points)

1. **Achilles Must Die:** Prophesied to die at Troy. Cannot be prevented, only delayed. Party may try; this angers Fates.

2. **Troy Must Fall:** All oracles agree. Question is when and how costly. Party can affect method but not outcome.

3. **Helen Returns to Sparta:** Menelaus takes her back. But party might change whether she goes willingly or as prisoner.

4. **Aeneas Survives:** Must escape to found Rome. Protecting him may mean betraying Greeks.

5. **Odysseus's Ten-Year Journey:** His hubris during sack earns Poseidon's curse. Party may share this fate.

### The Variable Destinies (Party Can Influence)

1. **The Party's Bloodline:** Decisions determine if descendants become legendary or cursed
2. **Innocents' Fates:** Who survives the sack of Troy
3. **Which Gods Favor/Oppose Them:** Divine allegiances shift based on choices
4. **The Artifact's Destiny:** Ancient relic can be destroyed, claimed, or given to specific faction
5. **The Truth About the War:** Whether the culling of heroes succeeds or heroes learn truth

### Causality Webs

**If Achilles Lives Past Prophecy:**
- The Fates unravel local reality
- Time loops or paradoxes occur
- Gods intervene forcefully to restore timeline
- Achilles may become undead, cursed to die eternally

**If Troy Doesn't Fall:**
- Prophecies worldwide begin failing
- Cosmic order destabilizes
- Gods go to war with each other
- Age of Heroes extends, angering Zeus who wants them culled

**If Party Exposes Divine Conspiracy:**
- Heroes unite against Olympians
- Titanomachy 2.0: Heroes vs. Gods
- Mortals may actually win with artifact
- Creates new age without divine interference (or total annihilation)

**If Eris's Plan Succeeds:**
- Divine civil war erupts
- Mortal world is collateral damage
- Age of Heroes ends in apocalypse
- New world order emerges from ashes

## Additional Lore and World History

### The Previous Age

**The Gigantomachy:** Giants challenged gods and lost. Their weapons and armor remain buried, including the artifact in Troy. If heroes had these weapons...

**The First Troy:** This is actually the sixth iteration. Troy has fallen and been rebuilt five times in an eternal cycle of destruction and renewal. Party may discover they're reincarnations of previous heroes.

**The Titanomachy:** Zeus overthrew his father Kronos. The Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus. Some whisper that Zeus fears heroes might do to him what he did to Kronos.

### The Cosmic Purpose

**Culling the Heroes:** Demigods and heroes have become too numerous and powerful. Their divine blood creates mortals who challenge the gods. This war was orchestrated to kill most of them.

**The Artifact:** A weapon from the Gigantomachy that could slay Zeus himself. It's hidden in Troy. The true purpose of the war is for Zeus to secure it while reducing the hero population.

**Eris's Revenge:** The goddess of discord started this specifically to punish the gods for not inviting her to a wedding. Her golden apple wasn't random—it was calculated to cause maximum destruction.

### Racial and Cultural Details

**Greeks (Achaeans):**
- Actually coalition of Mycenaean, Minoan-influenced cultures
- Speak related but distinct dialects
- Honor-based warrior culture with strict guest-friendship rules
- Patriarchal but women can wield significant influence
- Religion: gods are real and terrifying, not abstract concepts

**Trojans:**
- Anatolian culture (Luwian) with Greek influences from trade
- More cosmopolitan due to trading hub status
- Similar gods but different names and rituals
- Somewhat less rigid gender roles than Greeks
- Wealth from trade, not conquest

**The Divine Hierarchy:**
- Zeus rules but not absolutely; gods have their own agendas
- Gods need mortal worship but also resent mortal power
- Divine ichor makes demigods; too many threaten cosmic order
- Gods can be wounded by heroes, can die by specific weapons
- Prophecy binds even gods; Fates are above Olympians

### Secret History Known Only to Seers

**The Eternal Return:** This war has happened countless times. Same souls reincarnated, same conflict, cycling forever until something breaks the pattern. Party might be the variable that finally changes outcome.

**Helen's Truth:** She's not mortal but a demigoddess, daughter of Zeus and Nemesis (or Leda). Her beauty is divine weapon meant to cause wars and cull mortal populations. She's aware of this and hates her role.

**The Thirteenth Olympian:** Eris should be counted among the Twelve but isn't. Her exclusion drives her vengeance. Recognizing her as legitimate Olympian might end her interference—or make it worse.

**The Hero's Apotheosis:** Certain heroes are destined to become minor gods (Heracles did it). The party may qualify. But ascension means abandoning humanity. Is immortality worth losing your mortal self?

## Campaign Integration Notes

### How Lore Reveals Gradually

**Sessions 1-6:** Surface level. Honor, glory, face-value motivations. Greeks good, Trojans enemy (or vice versa based on party allegiance).

**Sessions 7-12:** Deeper complexity. Both sides have justice on their side. Gods are manipulating events. Not everyone wants this war.

**Sessions 13-18:** Conspiracy revealed. The war serves divine purposes. Ancient artifacts and prophecies complicate everything. Party has cosmic significance.

**Sessions 19-22:** Truth exposed. Party must choose between destinies. Their choices reshape the world. Eris's plan or Zeus's fear—which threat is greater?

**Sessions 23-25:** Endgame. All secrets revealed. Party decides fate of gods, heroes, and the age itself. Their choices echo through millennia.

### Incorporating Player Backstories

- **Divine Parentage:** Player reveals their godly parent, brings that deity's attention
- **Ancient Bloodlines:** Player descended from previous Trojan War iteration
- **Prophesied Role:** Player specifically mentioned in ancient oracle, doesn't realize it
- **Cursed Lineage:** Player's ancestor angered god; curse affects them
- **Secret Identity:** Player is actually Trojan spy, Greek double agent, or divine avatar

### The Living World

This campaign world breathes. NPCs pursue agendas with or without party involvement. The war progresses on a timeline. If party doesn't act, events happen anyway (possibly worse outcomes). Their choices create branching consequences. The DM should track:

- **War Progress:** Which side is winning, morale levels, supply situations
- **Divine Politics:** Which gods are ascending or descending in influence
- **NPC Relationships:** How NPCs view party based on actions
- **Prophecy Fulfillment:** Tracking which prophecies come true, which are subverted
- **Glory Accumulation:** Party's reputation affects opportunities and challenges

The world remembers. Songs will be sung. History will judge. Make it legendary.
