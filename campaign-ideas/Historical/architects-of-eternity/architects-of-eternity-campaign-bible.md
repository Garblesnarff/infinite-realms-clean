# Campaign Bible: Architects of Eternity

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Cosmic Blueprint
In the beginning, there was only the **Cosmic Architect**, a being of infinite precision and order. It did not create the universe; it designed it, meticulously drafting every star, every planet, every atom into a single, perfect **Cosmic Blueprint**. The world is not a planet; it is a single, intricate cog in a vast, cosmic machine, constantly turning, constantly evolving according to the Architect's grand design. The "Architects of Eternity" are not just a secret society; they are the Architect's forgotten children, tasked with maintaining the Cosmic Blueprint, ensuring that every cog turns as it should, and that the grand design unfolds as intended. The conflict arises because the Cosmic Architect has grown bored, and its attention is drifting, causing the Cosmic Blueprint to fray, and the grand design to unravel into chaos.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The First Draft):** The Cosmic Architect designs the universe, creating the Cosmic Blueprint.
2.  **-8000 Y (The Age of Builders):** The first sentient beings emerge, embodying archetypal roles: The Builder, The Destroyer, The Maintainer, The Innovator.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Grand Design):** The Architects of Eternity are founded by the **Grand Designer**, who discovers that reality can be manipulated through architectural principles.
4.  **-4000 Y (The Structural Flaw Plague):** The Cosmic Blueprint begins to fray, causing "structural flaws" to appear in reality. Buildings crumble, bridges collapse, and logic breaks down.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Master Builder Protocol):** The Architects develop a universal "Master Builder" template, forcing certain individuals into archetypal roles to maintain structural integrity.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Unreliable Blueprint Incident):** A rogue Architect attempts to rewrite the Cosmic Blueprint, causing history to become fluid and contradictory.
7.  **-500 Y (The Fourth Wall Breach):** A powerful Architect, frustrated with their role, wishes to "speak to the designer." They briefly glimpse the fading Cosmic Blueprint, driving them mad.
8.  **-100 Y (The Fading Designs):** The Cosmic Blueprint's designs grow weaker, causing builders to lose their motivation, destroyers to lose their drive, and reality to unravel into meaningless fragments.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Section):** A vital section of the Cosmic Blueprint, the "Section of Resolution," is stolen from the Architects, causing all conflicts to become endless.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new apprentices at the Architects of Eternity, each with their own unique architectural potential. They are caught in a crisis as the Cosmic Blueprint fades, and the world threatens to unravel into meaningless fragments.

### The "Why": The Meaning of Design
The central conflict is the struggle between **Design and Chaos**. The Cosmic Blueprint provides meaning, purpose, and direction to existence. But as it fades, the world loses its structural integrity, plunging into a state of meaningless chaos. The Architects of Eternity fight to preserve the Cosmic Blueprint, to remind the world of its purpose, and to prevent reality from unraveling into meaningless fragments. The party's struggle is not just to become Master Architects, but to defend the very concept of design, to prove that their lives have purpose, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably meaningless.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Architectural Cohesion
*   **Cohesion Score (0-10):** Represents the stability of the Cosmic Blueprint. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Cohesion:** Following architectural tropes, resolving design points, making architecturally satisfying choices.
*   **Losing Cohesion:** Breaking architectural tropes, creating structural flaws, making illogical or unexpected choices.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Cohesion:* Reality is stable, predictable. GNEA agents are less active.
    *   *Low Cohesion:* Reality is unstable, unpredictable. Structural flaws appear, Architectural Golems spawn.
    *   *0 Cohesion:* The Cosmic Blueprint collapses, leading to a chaotic, nonsensical reality.

### Subsystem: Archetype Points
*   **Archetype Points:** Players earn Archetype Points by leaning into specific archetypes (e.g., "Builder," "Destroyer," "Maintainer").
*   **Spending Points:** These points can be spent to gain temporary abilities associated with that archetype (e.g., a "Builder" can spend a point to gain advantage on a saving throw against structural collapse).
*   **Breaking Archetype:** Players can choose to defy their archetype, but doing so costs Archetype Points and may lead to a loss of Architectural Cohesion.
