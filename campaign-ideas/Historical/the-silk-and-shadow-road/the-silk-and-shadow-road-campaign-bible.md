# Campaign Bible: The Silk and Shadow Road

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Weaver's Gambit
Before the world had a shape, two sibling entities, the **Spinner** (Fate) and the **Unraveler** (Chaos), competed to define existence. The Spinner wove the threads of causality into a stable tapestry, creating the physical world. The Unraveler, in jealousy, could not destroy the tapestry, so it wove its own from the "shadows" of the original threads—a negative-image reality where everything was inverted. The Silk Road is not a trade route; it is the literal seam where these two tapestries were stitched together by the Spinner to prevent them from drifting apart. To travel it is to walk the knife's edge between what is and what could have been. The "shadows" that fall long on the dunes are not from the sun; they are the Unraveler's realm bleeding through.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-7000 Y (The First Stitch):** The Spinner creates the Silk Road, binding the material and shadow planes. The first caravans are not merchants, but nomadic weavers who maintain the seam.
2.  **-5500 Y (The Whisper Market):** The Djinn, beings who can walk between threads, establish the first black market, trading in secrets and echoes from the shadow realm.
3.  **-4200 Y (The Year of Two Skies):** A tear in the seam above the Taklamakan Desert causes the sun and its shadow-twin (a black anti-star) to be visible simultaneously for a year. Gravity becomes subjective in the region.
4.  **-3000 Y (The Glass Scourge):** A war between two rival merchant-wizards results in a magical cataclysm that turns a thousand square miles of the Gobi Desert into a razor-sharp, impassable sheet of black glass.
5.  **-2100 Y (The Rise of the Jade Empire):** The first great mortal empire rises, claiming a monopoly on the material road through the use of massive, disciplined armies and domesticated Rocs.
6.  **-1500 Y (The Silent Pilgrimage):** A monastic order, the Keepers of the Seam, walks the entire length of the road without speaking a word. Their silent meditation reinforces the barrier between worlds for a millennium.
7.  **-800 Y (The Sand-Ship Era):** The invention of magically-powered "sand-ships" revolutionizes trade, allowing caravans to travel at immense speeds across the dunes.
8.  **-300 Y (The Shadow-Plague):** A disease that erases one's reflection—and then one's physical body—spreads from a shadow-well, depopulating several oasis cities.
9.  **-50 Y (The Great Betrayal):** The Jade Emperor attempts to conquer the Shadow Road, sending an army of terracotta soldiers into the Unraveler's realm. They are never seen again, but their silent, screaming faces sometimes appear in the dunes.
10. **Present Day:** The seam is weakening. Caravans are disappearing overnight. The party is hired to guard a shipment of "Woven Light," a rare commodity said to be the only thing that can repair the fraying threads of reality.

### The "Why": Metaphysical Unraveling
The conflict is not one of good versus evil, but **Structure vs. Possibility**. The Material Road represents the fixed, stable reality we know. The Shadow Road represents the infinite, chaotic possibilities of what could be—every choice not taken, every path not walked. The weakening seam means these possibilities are bleeding into reality, causing paradoxes, temporal loops, and the erosion of causality. If the road fully unravels, both the material and shadow planes will dissolve back into the primordial chaos from which they were born.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Caravan Management
*   **Resources:** The caravan has four main resources: **Water**, **Food**, **Morale**, and **Seam-Integrity**.
*   **Roles:** Players can take on roles (Scout, Quartermaster, Guard Captain, Chronicler) that allow them to make decisions affecting these resources.
*   **Events:** At the start of each travel day, the GM rolls on a Caravan Event table, presenting a problem (e.g., "The water barrels were sabotaged," "A disease is spreading," "The caravan's collective shadow has detached and is now following you."). The players must solve the problem using their skills and roles.

### Physics: The Seam
*   **Fraying:** In areas where the seam is weak, reality is unstable. All d20 rolls are made with a "chaos die" (a d4). On a 1, a minor paradoxical event occurs, regardless of the d20 roll's success.
*   **Shadow-Sickness:** Spending too long on the Shadow Road requires CON saves. Failure leads to the character becoming more "unreal." Stage 1: Your reflection acts independently. Stage 2: You no longer cast a shadow. Stage 3: You begin to fade from existence.
