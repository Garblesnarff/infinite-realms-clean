# Creative Brief: Saga of the Northmen

## Art Style: Nordic Historical Epic with Mythic Elements

Inspired by *Vikings* TV series and Norse sagas. Captures the harsh beauty of Scandinavian landscapes, the brutal elegance of Viking warfare, the mysticism of Norse religion, and the cultural clash with Christian England.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Nordic Atmosphere:** Misty fjords, longships, runic carvings, northern lights
*   **Practical Combat:** Chainmail, axes, shields with painted designs, leather and fur
*   **Cultural Authenticity:** Braided hair and beards, arm rings, Thor's hammers, elaborate ship prows
*   **Mythic Presence:** Gods watching from shadows, ravens circling, Valkyries at death

### Color Palette:

*   **Nordic:** Steel-gray seas, forest greens, stone grays, leather browns
*   **Accents:** Blood red on shields and sails, gold arm rings, blue woad tattoos
*   **Sky:** Often overcast, dramatic storm clouds, northern lights in green-blue
*   **Combat:** Mud and blood, practical earth tones, nothing pristine

## Voice

A Norse skald's voice telling saga—poetic yet brutal, honoring warriors through story. Pacing includes alliteration and kennings (whale-road for sea, battle-sweat for blood). Tone shifts between rousing battle-cries, philosophical musing on fate, and tender moments of brotherhood. Accent suggests Old Norse rhythms. Role: The voice of saga preservation.
