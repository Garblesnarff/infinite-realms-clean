# The Corsican Ascension
*From artillery officer to Emperor—rewrite Europe's map through military genius and political cunning*

## Campaign Overview

Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), perhaps history's greatest military tactician, rose from minor Corsican nobility to Emperor of France and master of Europe. This campaign follows his meteoric rise, revolutionary warfare innovations, political transformation of Europe, and ultimate dramatic fall. Play as Napoleon's trusted Marshals—the inner circle executing his vision, fighting legendary campaigns, and witnessing genius devolve into hubris.

This is campaign of military brilliance, political upheaval, revolutionary change, and tragic overreach. Experience warfare as art form, witness how one person's ambition reshapes continents, and ultimately face the question: Was Napoleon liberator or tyrant, genius or madman?

## Core Themes
- **Revolutionary Genius**: Innovation in warfare and governance
- **Meritocracy**: Rising through talent, not birth
- **Imperial Ambition**: Liberation becomes conquest
- **Military as Art**: Tactical perfection in battle
- **Hubris and Nemesis**: Brilliance breeds overconfidence
- **Legacy vs. Reality**: Napoleonic Code survives, empire doesn't
