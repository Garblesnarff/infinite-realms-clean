### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Love War of Silvermoor Academy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Two brilliant student council leaders who are secretly in love with each other engage in elaborate psychological warfare to make the other confess first, believing that whoever confesses is the "loser." Every mundane school interaction becomes a strategic battle of wits, schemes, and manipulation—all while they fall deeper in love and their friends watch with bemusement.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Silvermoor Academy, founded by ancient nobles to train the elite of society in both combat and governance.
    *   Write about the legendary "First Student Council" whose president and vice president fell in love and married, becoming legendary heroes together.
    *   Describe the social hierarchy and importance of the Student Council in academy politics and social structure.
    *   Explain the cultural significance of the Shinomiya family as one of the Four Great Noble Houses controlling the realm's economy and politics.
    *   Detail the annual "Heart Festival" where students traditionally confess their feelings, and the social implications of who confesses to whom.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create detailed profiles for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Student Council** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Govern student affairs, organize events, mediate disputes, represent student interests to faculty.
        *   **Hierarchy:** President (Miyuki), Vice President (Kaguya), Secretary (Chika), Treasurer (Ishigami), Auditor (Miko).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maintain order and improve academy life through competent governance.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** President and Vice President are engaged in psychological warfare to make each other confess love first. Other members are caught between helping, hindering, or watching in amusement.
        *   **Assets:** Authority over student events, budget for activities, respect from students and faculty, access to academy resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Generally respected across the academy, sometimes at odds with individual clubs or factions.
    *   **The Shinomiya Faction** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Advance the Shinomiya family's political and economic interests within the academy and beyond.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Centered around Kaguya with her retainers, allies, and servants like Hayasaka.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maintain the family's prestigious reputation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Kaguya's family views the academy as a place to form political alliances and expects her to eventually marry advantageously, not fall for a commoner.
        *   **Assets:** Immense wealth, political connections, loyal servants, magical resources.
        *   **Relationships:** Respected and feared. Some resent their influence, others seek to ally with them.
    *   **The Commoner Coalition** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Prove that merit matters more than birth, support talented commoners against noble privilege.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loosely organized around successful commoners like Miyuki.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Advocate for fair treatment and opportunities for all students regardless of birth.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some members resent nobles entirely and would use Miyuki as a symbol against the nobility.
        *   **Assets:** Popular support, moral high ground, Miyuki's reputation and excellence.
        *   **Relationships:** Tension with traditional nobles, allied with progressive faculty.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** One character successfully wins a "battle" (makes the other blush, admit something, or act flustered).
    *   **THEN:** That character gains a Love War point but feels unexpectedly unfulfilled. The relationship doesn't actually progress toward confession. Other council members make knowing comments.
    *   **IF:** Chika randomly disrupts an elaborate scheme at a crucial moment.
    *   **THEN:** Both characters' plans collapse into chaos. They must improvise, leading to more genuine interaction than their schemes would have allowed. Real relationship progress often happens in these moments.
    *   **IF:** A genuine emergency forces them to cooperate without schemes.
    *   **THEN:** They work together perfectly, showing their actual compatibility. They almost confess but get interrupted or lose nerve. Both become more frustrated with the war afterward.
    *   **IF:** An outside romantic threat appears (someone interested in one of them).
    *   **THEN:** Jealousy overrides strategy. They act more openly protective and possessive, giving away their feelings to everyone except each other. Friends try to capitalize on this.
    *   **IF:** The deadline approaches (Heart Festival, graduation, family intervention).
    *   **THEN:** The tone shifts from comedy to urgency. Schemes become less elaborate, more desperate. They realize the war might cost them the relationship entirely.
    *   **IF:** Both simultaneously decide to confess genuinely (final session).
    *   **THEN:** They interrupt each other trying to confess, leading to a perfectly synchronized mutual confession. Neither wins the war; both win the relationship. All friends celebrate, revealing they all knew and were rooting for this ending.
