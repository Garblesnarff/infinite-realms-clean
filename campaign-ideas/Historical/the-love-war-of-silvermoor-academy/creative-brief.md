# Creative Brief: The Love War of Silvermoor Academy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Elegant Psychological Comedy (Kaguya-sama-inspired)

Inspired by the visually striking and comedically exaggerated style of Kaguya-sama: Love is War, this aesthetic balances elegant, prestigious academy settings with dramatic, over-the-top reaction shots and visual metaphors for psychological battles.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Dramatic Exaggeration:** Mundane romantic situations should be portrayed as intense strategic battles with dramatic lighting and effects.
*   **Visual Metaphors:** Use imagery of war, chess, card games, and strategy to represent social maneuvers.
*   **Contrast Elegance and Comedy:** Characters are beautiful and refined in normal moments, hilariously distorted during comedic reactions.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Witty, strategic, elegant, hilarious, dramatic, psychological, prestigious, competitive, romantic, absurd.
*   **Feeling:** A sophisticated romantic comedy where simple gestures are treated like life-or-death strategic battles. The atmosphere shifts between refined elegance and comedic absurdity.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, sharp lines for elegant moments. Exaggerated, dynamic lines for comedic reactions and battle visualizations.
*   **Forms:** Characters have refined, attractive designs that can shift to chibi or exaggerated forms for comedy. Battle sequences use dramatic angles and dynamic poses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split-panel illustration in elegant anime style. Left panel: a beautiful high-elf ice mage sitting elegantly at a council table, expression calm. Right panel: the same character's internal monologue visualized as her commanding an army on a battlefield, dramatic and intense."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Sophisticated and refined. Rich reds and pinks for romantic tension, cool blues and silvers for Kaguya's ice magic, warm golds for prestigious settings. Battle sequences use dramatic reds, blacks, and explosive effects.
*   **Luminosity:** Natural lighting for school settings, dramatic spotlighting for "battle" moments, warm romantic lighting for genuine moments.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...with a sophisticated color palette of deep crimsons and elegant golds, befitting a prestigious academy. During 'battle' moments, the scene explodes with dramatic red and black lightning effects representing psychological warfare."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Elegant, refined character designs befitting prestigious academy students. Can shift to comedic proportions for reactions.
*   **Miyuki Shirogane:** Handsome human wizard with sharp eyes and perfect posture, appears confident but sometimes shows exhaustion from maintaining his image.
*   **Kaguya Shinomiya:** Ethereally beautiful high-elf with long dark hair and striking red eyes, elegant and composed, occasionally shows childlike excitement or confusion.
*   **Chika Fujiwara:** Cheerful half-elf with pink hair and bow, bouncy and expressive, represents chaos and unpredictability.
*   **Supporting Cast:** Each visually distinct—Ishigami is slouched and tired-looking, Miko is small and stern, Hayasaka is sharp-eyed and professional.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A beautiful high-elf female student with long flowing black hair, striking red eyes, wearing an elegant academy uniform. Her expression is composed and elegant, but her eyes show intense strategic calculation. Aura of cold confidence."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Prestigious academy settings—elegant council room, grand hallways, well-maintained grounds, festival areas.
*   **Atmosphere:** Should convey wealth and prestige while being functional for comedy. Normal scenes are realistic; "battle" scenes transform into dramatic battlefields, chess boards, or card game arenas.
*   **Details:** The student council room is well-appointed with a large table, comfortable chairs, windows overlooking grounds. Can transform into a war room with strategy maps and dramatic lighting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The student council room transforms into a dramatic battlefield visualization. The mundane table becomes a strategy map with miniature figures. Red and black lightning crackles between the two main characters. Dramatic shadows and spotlighting emphasize the 'battle.'"

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, refined lighting for normal school scenes. Dramatic, high-contrast lighting for "battle" moments. Soft, romantic lighting for genuine emotional scenes.
*   **Shadows:** Subtle for normal moments, dramatically lengthened or stylized for battles, gentle for romantic scenes.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting indicates the tone—is this a real moment or a psychological battle? Reality vs. their internal dramatization.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit with dramatic, high-contrast lighting as if in an intense strategic battle, with spotlights on each character and red backlighting creating an aura of psychological warfare. Reality is mundane; their perception is dramatic."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Uses split panels to show reality vs. perception, internal monologues, and strategic planning. Dynamic angles for battles, intimate framing for genuine moments.
*   **Techniques:** Reaction shot close-ups with exaggerated expressions, wide shots showing elaborate scheme visualization, match-cuts between mundane actions and dramatic interpretations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A three-panel composition. Panel 1: The two characters sitting normally at a table. Panel 2: Internal visualization showing them as generals across a chess board. Panel 3: Close-up reaction shot of one character with dramatic, exaggerated realization."

## Voice

**Narrator (Primary Voice):** Deep, dramatic, masculine voice like a sports commentator announcing an epic battle. Treats every romantic scheme as a life-or-death strategic maneuver. Enthusiastic during battles, tender during genuine moments. Think: "The battle of the lunch invitation begins!" Studio-quality with dramatic orchestral undertones during battle narration.

**Miyuki Shirogane:** Confident, intelligent masculine voice that occasionally cracks into panic or exhaustion. Tries to sound sophisticated but reveals insecurity. Internal monologue is frantic strategic planning.

**Kaguya Shinomiya:** Elegant, refined feminine voice with aristocratic precision. Occasionally shifts to flustered or childishly excited tones when her composure breaks. Internal monologue reveals she's learning about romance from novels.

**Chika Fujiwara:** Bright, energetic, cheerful feminine voice without a care in the world. The embodiment of chaos, never sounds strategic or calculated. Pure chaotic good energy.
