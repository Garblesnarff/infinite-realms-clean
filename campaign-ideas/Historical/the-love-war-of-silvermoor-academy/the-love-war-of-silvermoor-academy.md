### Core Premise
At the prestigious Silvermoor Academy for Noble Adventurers, the Student Council is led by two brilliant strategists: Miyuki Shirogane, a commoner wizard who rose to President through sheer brilliance, and Kaguya Shinomiya, a noble ice mage from one of the realm's wealthiest families who serves as Vice President. Both are secretly in love with each other, but their pride refuses to let them confess. Instead, they engage in elaborate "battles" to manipulate situations so the other person confesses first—believing that whoever confesses first is the "loser" and will be at the mercy of the other in the relationship. Every student council meeting, school event, and social situation becomes a battlefield of wits, schemes, and psychological warfare—all while they fall deeper in love.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The War Begins (Sessions 1-5)**
- Establish the dynamic between Miyuki and Kaguya as they engage in increasingly elaborate schemes to make the other confess. Each session features 2-3 "battles" over scenarios like: who will ask whom to study together, who will make the first move during a romantic moment, who will prepare lunch for whom, or who will ask the other to a festival. The schemes involve elaborate planning, reading body language, deploying assets (friends, rumors, magical items), and psychological manipulation. Meanwhile, their council members observe with bemusement.

**Act 2: Complications and Competitors (Sessions 6-10)**
- New elements complicate the war. Miko Iino, a strict justice-cleric, joins the council and disapproves of their shenanigans. Ai Hayasaka, Kaguya's servant/friend, begins questioning whether this war serves her lady's happiness. An exchange student, the cheerful but dense Moeha, shows interest in Miyuki, triggering jealousy. A major school crisis (monster attack, political scandal, or festival disaster) forces them to work together genuinely, revealing their deeper feelings. They almost confess several times but get interrupted or chicken out.

**Act 3: Towards Genuine Feelings (Sessions 11-15)**
- The elaborate schemes become less about winning and more about creating moments together. They begin to realize that pride matters less than happiness. A major event—perhaps Kaguya's family demanding she leave the academy for an arranged political marriage, or Miyuki preparing to graduate and leave—forces them to confront their feelings. The final session features their genuine, mutual confession during the school's grand festival, with all their friends (who knew all along) celebrating their victory over their own stubbornness.

### Key Locations

- **The Student Council Room**: The primary battlefield. A well-appointed office where most schemes unfold.
- **Silvermoor Academy Grounds**: Various locations including classrooms, the library, the courtyard, training grounds.
- **The Festival Grounds**: Where major school events occur, providing romantic settings for battles.
- **The Shinomiya Estate**: Kaguya's opulent but cold family home, representing her isolated upbringing.
- **The Shirogane Apartment**: Miyuki's modest home where he cares for his sister, showing his real life.

### Central Conflict
Pride versus love. The fear that vulnerability in love equals weakness versus the desire for genuine connection. Each character's journey is about learning that love isn't about domination or submission, but mutual trust and honesty.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Battle Tracking System**: Each social "battle" has a stated objective (e.g., "Make them confess," "Get them to ask you out," "Make them jealous"). Players make opposed rolls using Intelligence (Investigation) to read intentions, Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) to execute plans, and Wisdom (Insight) to detect schemes. Winning a battle grants prestige but doesn't necessarily advance the relationship.
- **Love is War Points**: Track victories for each character. However, reveal later that these points are meaningless—the real progress is measured in "Genuine Moments" where they act honestly with each other.
- **Chika's Chaos Factor**: Whenever plans are too elaborate, roll on the "Chika Intervention Table." She randomly disrupts schemes in unpredictable ways.
- **The Confession Clock**: A hidden countdown toward forced separation (graduation, family demands) that creates urgency to stop playing games.
- **Scheme Flashbacks**: When describing a successful scheme, use cinematic flashbacks showing the elaborate planning process, complete with diagrams, contingencies, and predicted responses.
- **Narrator Commentary**: Use a dramatic narrator voice to commentate on the "battles" like a sports announcer, adding humor and highlighting the absurdity of their elaborate plans for simple romantic gestures.
