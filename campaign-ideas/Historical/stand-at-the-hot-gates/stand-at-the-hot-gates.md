**Campaign Type / Genre:** Last Stand / Epic Defense / Heroic Tragedy
**Estimated Length:** Short-Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **12-14** (or death)

**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party are elite warriors of Sparta, chosen to march with King Leonidas to defend the Hot Gates—a narrow mountain pass where a million-strong Persian army seeks entry to conquer all of Hellas. They know from the Oracle's prophecy that no one will return alive, yet they march anyway to buy time for the city-states to unite. Through impossible odds, brutal phalanx combat, and ultimate betrayal, they'll discover that some battles are won not by surviving, but by making the enemy pay such a price that your death becomes eternal legend.

## Story Arc (Short-Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A two-act arc of preparation and last stand, knowing from the start that death is certain.

*   **Act I — The March to Destiny (Sessions 1-5):** The Oracle declares that either a Spartan king must die or Sparta falls. Leonidas chooses 300 warriors who have living sons to carry their names. The party marches to Thermopylae, recruiting allies and preparing for impossible odds. They arrive at the Hot Gates—a narrow pass where numbers mean nothing. The first Persian waves break against Spartan shields. They realize they're not fighting to win, but to delay.
*   **Act II — Three Days of Glory (Sessions 6-15):** For three days and nights, the party holds the pass against endless Persian hordes. Each session is a different assault—Immortals, war elephants, arrows that blot out the sun, champions of a dozen nations. The betrayal by Ephialtes reveals a mountain path. Leonidas sends away allies but keeps the 300. The final dawn comes. They know they're surrounded, know they'll die, yet charge into the Persian center one last time. The campaign ends with total party death—but their legend never dies.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores heroic death, glory through sacrifice, and whether some causes justify certain doom. It asks: What is worth dying for? Can defeat be victory? How does one face certain death with honor? The central conflict is not about winning—it's about making your death matter so much that it changes the world. The party knows from session one they will die; the question is how gloriously.
