## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc of restraint, resistance, and standing for honor.

*   **Act I — The Occupation Begins (Sessions 1–4):** The Iron Shogunate invades, forcing martial arts schools to close and demanding cultural submission. Master Ip tries to keep his head down and protect his family, but the party witnesses escalating brutality. They must decide whether to resist openly, collaborate, or find a middle path.
*   **Act II — The Exhibition Matches (Sessions 5–9):** The occupiers force Chinese martial artists to fight in humiliating exhibition matches for the entertainment of Shogunate officers. The party must participate to protect their community, fighting without killing to maintain honor while the Shogunate's champion, Colonel Sato, defeats and kills Chinese masters. Evidence emerges of a larger plan to eradicate Chinese martial arts entirely.
*   **Act III — The Challenge (Sessions 10–15):** When Sato murders a beloved master, Master Ip breaks his restraint and challenges the Shogunate's authority. The party must support him in a final confrontation with General Miura, a master who respects martial arts but serves an oppressive regime. The campaign climaxes with a formal duel that will determine whether Chinese martial arts schools can reopen.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the tension between violent resistance and dignified restraint, cultural preservation under oppression, and whether honor can survive when facing overwhelming brutality. The central question is: How do you fight for your culture without losing the very values that make it worth preserving?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Wing Chun Combat Philosophy**
*   Emphasizes economy of motion, centerline theory, and simultaneous defense and attack.
*   Monks and fighters can gain Wing Chun techniques: chain punches, trap-and-strike, wooden dummy training benefits.
*   Combat rewards precision over power—smaller damage dice but more attacks, focus on deflection rather than dodging.

### 2. **Honor vs. Survival**
*   Track Honor Points (maintaining dignity, protecting others, refusing to kill unnecessarily) and Survival Points (collaborating, hiding, fleeing fights).
*   Both are needed—too much honor leads to martyrdom, too much survival leads to cultural loss.
*   The ending changes based on the balance achieved.

### 3. **The Exhibition Match System**
*   Fights can be won without killing opponents.
*   Defeating an opponent while showing restraint and technique earns respect even from enemies.
*   Brutal victories demoralize the community and empower the occupiers' narrative.

### 4. **Cultural Preservation**
*   The party must secretly teach martial arts to the next generation.
*   This is represented through training montages where they risk discovery to pass on knowledge.
*   Students trained this way become resources in later sessions.

### 5. **The Philosophy of Combat**
*   Before major fights, there are philosophical exchanges about the nature of martial arts, strength, and honor.
*   These dialogues can grant combat bonuses if the party presents compelling arguments about their martial philosophy.
