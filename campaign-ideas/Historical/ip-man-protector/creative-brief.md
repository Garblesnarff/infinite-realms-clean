# Creative Brief: Ip Man: Protector of the Art

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Historical Realism with Dignified Combat (Ip Man Film Series-inspired)

Inspired by the restrained, precise cinematography of the *Ip Man* film series, emphasizing the dignity of martial arts masters even under oppression, the contrast between cultural traditions and military occupation, and the philosophy behind every movement.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Dignified Restraint:** Emphasize controlled, precise movements over wild violence.
*   **Cultural Contrast:** Show the clash between traditional Chinese architecture/clothing and military occupation aesthetics.
*   **Human Cost:** Depict the suffering of civilians under occupation alongside the beauty of martial arts.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dignified, oppressed, honorable, restrained power, cultural pride, quiet resistance, philosophical.
*   **Feeling:** Tension between maintaining composure and righteous anger. Beauty and tradition threatened by brutal occupation.

**2. Character Design:**
*   **Master Ip:** Simple traditional clothing (changshan), calm expression, precise Wing Chun stance.
*   **Shogunate Forces:** Military uniforms, harsh expressions, imposing presence.
*   **Chinese Community:** Period-appropriate 1930s-40s Chinese clothing showing poverty under occupation.

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Chinese Spaces:** Warm earth tones, reds and golds of tradition (but faded under occupation).
*   **Occupation:** Cold grays, military greens, harsh blacks.
*   **Combat:** Natural lighting, emphasizing the human element over spectacle.

**4. Combat Aesthetics:**
*   Wing Chun's rapid chain punches shown with motion blur suggesting speed without sacrificing form.
*   Close-ups on precise hand positions and footwork.
*   Opponents shown being overwhelmed by technique rather than power.

## Voice

A calm, measured voice with subtle undercurrents of steel. Speaking slowly and deliberately, choosing words carefully. The tone carries wisdom earned through hardship and restraint that masks deep emotion. Role: Master Ip's internal thoughts or a narrator reflecting on the importance of preserving culture through dark times.

## Music & Sound Design

*   **Themes:** Traditional Chinese instruments (erhu, guzheng) for cultural identity; military drums for oppression.
*   **Combat:** The rapid *tap-tap-tap* of Wing Chun chain punches; the whistle of deflected strikes; heavy breathing; minimal music to emphasize technique.
*   **Ambient:** Market sounds, coal mine labor, distant military patrols, quiet resistance.
