## Campaign Overview

**Campaign Type / Genre:** Revolutionary Upheaval / Civil War / Ideological Conflict
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **9**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are participants in the Russian Revolution as the Romanov dynasty falls, the Bolsheviks seize power promising peace and bread, and Russia descends into brutal civil war between Reds and Whites while Lenin builds history's first communist state through revolutionary terror. As soldiers, revolutionaries, aristocrats, and common people, they navigate the impossible contradictions between revolutionary ideals and revolutionary violence, between ending tsarist oppression and creating Soviet totalitarianism, and between genuine liberation and new forms of control. The campaign explores how noble revolutions become authoritarian, the horror of civil war where former neighbors slaughter each other, and whether the Revolution betrayed or fulfilled its promises. This is 1917 Russia—where heroes must choose which future they're building in blood.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the Russian Revolution through its contradictions: liberation and new oppression, idealistic promises and brutal reality, destroying the old world and building what in its place. The central conflict is whether the Revolution fulfilled or betrayed its promises as players navigate between revolutionary idealism and totalitarian methods. They must choose between Red and White in a civil war where both commit atrocities, between supporting Bolshevik authoritarianism or opposing the only force defeating monarchism, and between revolutionary purity and pragmatic survival. The campaign asks: Do revolutions inevitably betray their ideals? Can authoritarianism serve liberation? What's the cost of building a new world? And was the Revolution worth what it cost? The answer: the Russian Revolution created both unprecedented hope and unprecedented horror—players determine which they see as the Revolution's legacy.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Revolutionary Idealism vs. Reality**
*   Track the gap between Bolshevik promises (peace, bread, freedom) and methods (war, famine, dictatorship).
*   This gap creates moral tension as players support ideals while witnessing their corruption.
*   The wider the gap, the harder to maintain revolutionary faith.

### 2. **Red vs. White Choice**
*   Players must choose sides in the Civil War or attempt dangerous neutrality.
*   Both sides commit atrocities—there's no morally pure option.
*   This choice determines their experience of the Revolution.

### 3. **The Terror Tracker**
*   Measure both Red Terror (Bolshevik secret police) and White Terror (monarchist massacres).
*   Both escalate in response to each other.
*   Players see how civil wars radicalize both sides.

### 4. **Revolutionary Factions**
*   Track different revolutionary groups: Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, SRs, Anarchists.
*   The Bolsheviks systematically suppress all other revolutionary factions.
*   This shows how revolution narrows from diverse coalition to one-party rule.

### 5. **The Legacy Question**
*   The campaign never definitively answers whether the Revolution succeeded or failed.
*   Players accumulate evidence for both interpretations.
*   The epilogue reflects their choices: what Russia became and whether it was inevitable.
