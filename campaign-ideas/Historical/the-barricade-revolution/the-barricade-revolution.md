## What "Medium-High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Complexity:** Justice versus mercy, law versus conscience, survival versus sacrifice.
*   **Relentless Pursuit:** The Inspector never stops hunting. Time pressure is constant.
*   **Revolutionary Combat:** Urban warfare at barricades against overwhelming odds.
*   **Tragic Stakes:** NPCs will die. Victory may be symbolic rather than practical.

## Central Conflict

Redemption versus damnation, mercy versus justice, law versus conscience. Can people truly change, or is past sin inescapable? Is it better to obey unjust laws or rebel and die? The party must choose whether to hide and survive or stand at the barricades and probably die—but die meaning something. The Inspector represents absolute law; the party represents the possibility of mercy and change.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Redemption Path**
*   Track each character's journey from crime/sin toward redemption through selfless acts. Redemption points unlock character growth and determine final fate.

### 2. **The Inspector's Hunt**
*   Javert's investigation advances each session. Party must cover tracks, use disguises, flee when necessary. If caught, face imprisonment or execution.

### 3. **Revolutionary Fervor**
*   NPCs have morale that affects the rebellion. Inspiring speeches, heroic acts, and hope raise morale. Defeats and deaths lower it.

### 4. **Barricade Combat**
*   Special combat system for defensive warfare—reinforcing barricades, ammunition management, defending positions, making last stands.

### 5. **One Day More**
*   Before critical sessions, montage system where each character gets a scene showing their preparation and inner thoughts—building dramatic tension.

### 6. **Mercy or Justice**
*   Regular moral choices where party can show mercy (like Jean received) or pursue revenge/justice. Mercy builds redemption, vengeance builds tragedy.
