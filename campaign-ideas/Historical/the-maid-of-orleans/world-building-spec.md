# The Maid of Orleans - World-Building Specification

## World Overview

The campaign takes place during the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), specifically 1425-1431 (Jeanne's life) and potentially to 1456 (Rehabilitation Trial) and beyond. France is fractured, occupied, and bleeding. The English claim the French throne through Edward III's maternal lineage. Burgundians (French but allied with England) control much of northern France. The legitimate Dauphin Charles holds a shrinking territory in the south.

Into this desperate situation comes an illiterate peasant girl claiming divine voices command her to save France. Magic exists in the form of miracles, divine intervention, and possibly demonic forces. The Catholic Church is enormously powerful, defining reality through theology. Saints are real and can intervene. The question is: Are Jeanne's voices genuinely divine, or something else?

## Causality Chains

### Chain 1: The Voices Begin

**Historical Event**
- 1425, age ~13, Jeanne first hears voices
- Saint Michael, then Catherine and Margaret
- Command: Save France, crown Dauphin

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Genuine Divine**: Party may witness, receive own callings, saints are real
- **If Psychological**: Party investigates trauma, epilepsy, other causes
- **If Demonic**: Dark powers using Jeanne for unknown ends
- **If Time Paradox**: Party from future causing visions?

**Causality Branch**
- Divine → Campaign of faith, miracles real, theological focus
- Psychological → Humanist campaign, faith vs. reason
- Demonic → Horror campaign, fighting corruption
- Paradox → Sci-fi elements, bootstrap paradox, can't change history

### Chain 2: Convincing the Dauphin

**Historical Event**
- March 1429, Jeanne identifies disguised Charles
- Private conversation convinces him
- Grants her army, armor, banner

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Party Helps**: Social challenges, gather evidence, stage "miracle"
- **If Fails**: No army, no mission, history changes drastically
- **If Charles Refuses**: Alternative path—guerrilla campaign? English service? Obscurity?

**Causality Branch**
- Success → Historical path, campaign continues
- Failure early → Jeanne returns to Domrémy, war lost, dark timeline
- Failure late → Jeanne becomes outlaw leader, different campaign
- Charles uses then betrays → Accelerated tragedy

- **If Miraculous**: Undeniable divine intervention, massive conversions

**Causality Branch**
- Historical victory → Campaign continues on track
- Defeat → Dark timeline, English win war

- July 17, 1429
- Charles VII crowned
- Jeanne's mission fulfilled

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Successful** (Historical): Legitimacy established, political complications begin

- **If Alternative**: Crowned elsewhere (Paris?), less legitimate
- **If Jeanne Crowned**: Revolutionary, impossible, fascinating

**Causality Branch**
- Historical success → Mission complete, but Jeanne not released
- Prevented → Prolonged war, different tactics needed
- Alternative site → Weaker legitimacy, more opposition

- **If Jeanne Dies**: Martyrdom at height of glory
- **If Party Convinces Charles**: Continue campaign, alternate timeline

**Causality Branch**
- Historical failure → Jeanne's decline begins

- Charles actually supports → Faster French victory

### Chain 6: The Capture at Compiègne

**Historical Event**
- May 23, 1430
- Sortie, surrounded, captured
- Sold to English
- Charles doesn't ransom

**Campaign Implications**

- **If Charles Ransoms**: Returns to service, lives longer, alternate history

**Causality Branch**
- Historical capture → Trial and execution path
- Rescue → Outlaw campaign, hunted by all sides
- Battle death → Honorable end, warrior-saint

### Chain 7: The Trial

**Historical Event**
- January - May 1431
- Inquisition trial for heresy
- Theological trap: Voices vs. Church authority
- Abjures, then relapses
- Condemned as relapsed heretic

- **If Substitution**: Someone else burns, Jeanne escapes (conspiracy)

**Causality Branch**

- Substitution → Secret survival, conspiracy campaign

### Chain 9: The Rehabilitation Trial

**Historical Event**
- 1450s, 20+ years after death
- Pope authorizes retrial
- Original trial declared fraudulent
- Jeanne declared innocent martyr

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Successful** (Historical): Name cleared, path to sainthood
- **If Fails**: Remains condemned heretic, no sainthood
- **If Party Testifies**: Influence outcome, preserve truth
- **If Reveals Uncomfortable Truths**: Politics vs. facts

**Causality Branch**
- Historical success → Vindication, sainthood path
- Failure → Forgotten or remembered as heretic
- Party testimony → Shape legend vs. truth
- Political manipulation → Useful myth vs. accuracy

### Chain 10: Canonization

**Historical Event**
- 1909: Beatification
- 1920: Canonization (Saint Joan of Arc)
- 489 years after death

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Canonized** (Historical): Ultimate vindication, eternal legacy

- **If Party Witnesses**: Time-spanning campaign to ensure sainthood

**Causality Branch**

- Jeanne appears in darkest hour of Lancastrian phase

**Major Battles Before Jeanne**
- **Crécy (1346)**: English longbows devastate French cavalry
- **Poitiers (1356)**: French king captured
- **Agincourt (1415)**: Henry V's legendary victory
- Pattern: French chivalry defeated by English longbows and discipline

- Siege warfare improvements

**After Jeanne**
- Momentum continues despite her death
- Burgundy reconciles with France (1435)

### Medieval Warfare

**Typical Forces**
- **Knights**: Heavily armored cavalry, social elite
- **Men-at-Arms**: Professional soldiers, mounted or foot
- **Longbowmen**: English specialty, devastating at range
- **Crossbowmen**: Slower than longbows, powerful, less training needed
- **Pike/Spear Infantry**: Formations counter cavalry
- **Siege Equipment**: Catapults, trebuchets, early cannons

**Jeanne's Era Innovations**
- Gunpowder weapons increasingly common
- Plate armor reaching peak development
- Fortification vs. siege in arms race
- Professional armies replacing pure feudal levies

**Siege Warfare**
- Most warfare is sieges, not battles
- Orléans: English besieging, French defending
- Bastilles: Fortified camps surrounding city
- Starvation vs. assault vs. relief

**Chivalric Code**
- Honor, loyalty, courage
- Mercy to noble prisoners (ransom system)
- Protection of clergy, women, non-combatants (often ignored)
- Single combat, tournaments
- Jeanne both uses and transcends chivalry

### Medieval Theology and the Church

**Religious Context**
- Catholic Church is THE Church (pre-Reformation)
- Church defines reality, orthodoxy, truth
- Heresy is capital crime
- Inquisition fights heresy (established 1231)

**Women's Roles**
- Subordinate to men (Church doctrine)
- Can be saints, mystics, nuns
- Cannot be priests, preach, hold authority
- Jeanne threatens gender order

**Mysticism and Visions**
- Private revelations accepted IF approved by Church
- Many saints have visions (Catherine of Siena, Hildegard, etc.)
- Test: Does vision contradict Church? (If yes, heresy)
- Jeanne's trap: Voices vs. Church authority

**Cross-Dressing**
- Forbidden: Deuteronomy 22:5
- Jeanne's justification: Necessity (safety, modesty in camp)
- Trial makes this major charge
- Relapse to male clothing = death sentence

**Witchcraft Beliefs**
- Witches are real (medieval view)
- Make pacts with Devil
- Can curse, cause harm, deceive
- English claim Jeanne is witch
- Trial investigates: Fairy Tree, prophetic knowledge, military success

### Historical Figures' Fates

**What Happened After Jeanne?**
- **Charles VII**: Ruled to 1461, eventually effective king, never ransomed Jeanne, rehabilitated her posthumously
- **Gilles de Rais**: Serial killer 1432-1440, executed, Bluebeard legend
- **La Hire**: Continued fighting, died in battle 1443
- **Dunois**: Long military career, died 1468
- **Pierre Cauchon**: Died 1442, shortly after rehabilitation began
- **Duke of Bedford**: Died 1435, English position collapsed after
- **Henry VI**: Went mad, deposed, murdered 1471
- **Philip of Burgundy**: Reconciled with France 1435, died 1467

**The Rehabilitation**
- Begun 1449 (Charles retakes Rouen)
- Papal authorization 1452
- Full trial 1455-1456
- Verdict overturned, declared innocent
- Family vindicated

**The Long Legacy**
- Symbol of French nationalism
- Catholic martyr and saint
- Feminist icon
- Military inspiration
- Cultural touchstone: Plays, operas, films, books

### Prophecies and Miracles

**Documented Prophecies**
- Predicted French defeat at Battle of Rouvray (before she met Charles)
- Identified Dauphin in disguise
- Predicted wound at Orléans
- Predicted capture: "I will last one year, scarcely longer"
- Found hidden sword at Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois (claimed voices told her)

**Reported Miracles**
- Arrow wound healed impossibly fast
- Survived 60-foot jump from tower
- Heart wouldn't burn (English soldiers' claim)
- Prophecies' fulfillment
- Military victories against odds

**Natural Explanations**
- Prophecies: Good intelligence, lucky guesses, retrofitted by believers
- Healing: Youth, good health, exaggeration
- Survival: Lucky landing
- Heart: Apocryphal story
- Victories: Morale, tactics, English unnerved

**Supernatural Explanations**
- Divine intervention real
- Saints genuinely speaking
- God protecting her
- Miracles as proof of holiness

**Campaign Choice**
- DM decides which interpretation
- Or leaves ambiguous
- Faith doesn't require proof
- Mystery is powerful

### Alternate History Considerations

**If Jeanne Saved from Execution**
- Does France still win war?
- Martyrdom rallied France; survival might not
- Personal happiness vs. historical impact
- Could campaign from hiding
- Could flee to Spain, Italy, Scotland
- Could reveal survival later

**If Orléans Falls**
- Southern France collapses
- English control all France
- No French nation as we know it
- English-French fusion culture
- No Joan of Arc legend
- Butterfly effects: No Renaissance? Different Reformation?

**If Charles Ransoms Her**
- Returns to service
- Either continues winning or retires
- Lives longer, quieter legacy
- No martyrdom, smaller sainthood chances
- Personal life possible

**If Voices Are Wrong**
- What if Charles is illegitimate bastard?
- Divine mistake? Demonic deception?
- Theological crisis
- Political earthquake

## Magic and Supernatural Elements

**Divine Magic**
- Clerical magic explicitly from God
- Paladins embody holy warriors (Jeanne is paladin archetype)
- Healing, protection, smiting evil
- Real and measurable in D&D world

**Miracles vs. Magic**
- Medieval distinction: Miracles from God, magic from Devil
- Jeanne claims no magic, only obedience to God
- Trial investigates magical practices
- Campaign can have real magic as evidence or complication

**The Voices**
- Mechanically: Divine guidance, prophecy, commune spells
- Narratively: Saints speaking, God's will
- Ambiguously: Could be magic, psychosis, or genuine
- Player choice: Do they hear too?

**Demonic Opposition**
- If divine forces support Jeanne, do demons oppose?
- English employing warlocks?
- Temptation, corruption, false visions
- Theological battle behind military one

**Fairy Elements**
- The Fairy Tree used against Jeanne at trial
- Medieval belief in fairies, spirits
- Church officially denies but folk belief strong
- Could be real supernatural element

**Relics and Holy Objects**
- Sword of Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois (found by prophecy)
- Jeanne's banner (reportedly miracle-working)
- Her ring (captured, lost)
- Post-death: Fake relics vs. real ones

## DM Notes

This world-building spec provides historical depth for complex, morally rich campaign. Jeanne's story is true and already dramatic—honor it while making it playable.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Historical Respect**: Real people, real events—handle with care
2. **Theological Sensitivity**: Catholic faith central—represent fairly
3. **Gender Dynamics**: Medieval attitudes + revolutionary figure
4. **Moral Complexity**: No simple villains; everyone has reasons
5. **Ambiguity**: Voices real or not—both interpretations valid
6. **Player Agency**: Can change history, but consequences follow

**Research Sources:**
- Trial transcripts (available in English translation)
- Mark Twain's *Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc* (novel but researched)
- Régine Pernoud's *Joan of Arc: Her Story*
- Marina Warner's *Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism*
- Medieval history texts on Hundred Years' War

**Tone Balance:**
- Hopeful (divine mission) vs. Tragic (martyrdom)
- Faith vs. Doubt
- Grand (changing history) vs. Intimate (peasant girl)
- Medieval brutality vs. Divine beauty

Use this framework to create world where faith, courage, and one girl's voices changed history—or where players can change it differently.
