# Campaign Bible: Way of the Fading Blade

[TAG: LORE_CORE]
# 1. Deep Lore & History

### Origin Myth: The Mirror and the Rust
In the beginning, the world was a still pond that reflected the Heavens so perfectly that the Gods descended to bathe in it. Their movement shattered the stillness, freezing the ripples into the archipelago of **Yamashiro**. For eons, the land possessed a "Spirit Resonance"—the Kami lived in the space between the physical object and its name. To name a sword was to give it a soul; to name a mountain was to wake it up. But the arrival of "The Black Ships" brought not just foreigners, but **Cold Iron**—a chemically treated metal that possesses no resonance. It is a dead material that spreads a spiritual silence, suffocating the Kami and turning the land grey. The conflict is not just political; it is a metaphysical war between the Singing World and the Silent Machine.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **The Heavens' Reflection (Year 0):** The First Emperor unites Yamashiro by singing the "True Names" of the four great dragons, binding them to the cardinal directions.
2.  **The Era of the Silent Blade (Year 400):** A smith creates a sword without a spirit. The wielder goes mad because the sword does not weep when it kills. The technique is banned.
3.  **The Cherry Blossom Decree (Year 850):** It becomes law that all duels must end before the last petal falls from the local trees. Combat becomes a race against nature.
4.  **The Arrival of the Black Ships (Year 1853):** Commodore Perry’s equivalent arrives. The steam whistle of his flagship is so loud it physically cracks the Great Bell of Kyoto, deafening the High Priest.
5.  **The Treaty of Smoke (Year 1854):** The Shogun signs a trade deal. The ink used was mixed with coal dust; the document smells of burning wood to this day.
6.  **The Great Wilsoning (Year 1860):** A localized reality failure where a Western camera stole the souls of an entire village. The photos are still screaming. (Low Probability Event).
7.  **The Edict of Hair (Year 1868):** The Emperor orders the cutting of topknots. Thousands of samurai bury their hair in a mass grave, which now grows black grass.
8.  **The Night of the Iron Rain (Year 1870):** The Imperial Army tests Gatling guns on a forest spirit. The spirit explodes into a cloud of rust-mites that eat the soldiers' buttons.
9.  **The Telegram Revolt (Year 1874):** Spirits invade the telegraph wires, changing military orders into haikus about death. The lines are cut. (Low Probability Event).
10. **The Current Day (Year 1876):** The Sword Ban is enforced. The sky above the capital is permanently grey, and the cherry blossoms have begun to bloom in color #808080 (Grey).

### The "Why": The Metaphysical Conflict
The burning of coal releases "Dead Air," which displaces "Living Breath" (Ki). If Yamashiro fully industrializes, the Kami will not just leave; they will petrify. The "Modernization" is literally calcifying the souls of the ancestors. The Samurai fight not just for tradition, but to keep the world soft enough to breathe.

# 8. Mechanics & Rules

### The Harmony/Dissonance System
*   **Harmony:** Gained by adhering to Bushido, meditation, and traditional acts.
    *   *Effect:* Can be spent to re-roll dice or "edit" a scene (e.g., "There happens to be a handhold here").
*   **Dissonance:** Gained by using guns, dishonorable acts, or entering high-tech zones.
    *   *Effect:* Grants +2 to Damage (Modern weapons only) but -2 to Wisdom Saves (Spirit corruption).
    *   *Threshold:* If Dissonance exceeds 10, the character develops a "Techno-Organic Mutation" (e.g., skin turns to porcelain).

### Bushido Die
*   A **d6** added to checks involving Honor.
*   If it rolls a **6**, it explodes (roll again and add).
*   If it rolls a **1**, the character must perform an act of penance or lose the die for the session.

### The Duel Mechanic
*   Initiative is based on **Wisdom** (Perception/Insight), not Dexterity.
*   "The Strike": Both players secretly bid Hit Points they are willing to sacrifice.
*   Highest bidder hits first. If the bid exceeds current HP, it is a death blow.
