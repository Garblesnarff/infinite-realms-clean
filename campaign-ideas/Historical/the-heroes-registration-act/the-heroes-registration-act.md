## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A tale of heroes divided by ideology, where every choice has consequences.

*   **Act I — The Spark of Division (Sessions 1–5):** The campaign opens with the Millhaven Incident, where the players witness or participate in a battle that goes horribly wrong, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths. In the aftermath, the Crown proposes the Heroes' Registration Act. The realm's heroes divide into two camps: those who support Captain Valor's call for accountability, and those who join the Ironclad Sentinel's resistance. The players must declare their allegiance—or refuse to choose.
*   **Act II — The War of Ideals (Sessions 6–11):** As tensions escalate, both sides recruit allies, and the players find themselves in increasingly violent confrontations with former friends. If they sided with Valor, they hunt down unregistered heroes. If they joined the Sentinel, they fight to stay free and expose the government's plans to weaponize registered heroes. If they remained neutral, both sides pressure them to join, and they may try to broker peace—or exploit the chaos for their own ends.
*   **Act III — The Breaking Point (Sessions 12–15+):** The conflict reaches its climax when the true architect of the Millhaven Incident is revealed: a manipulative villain who engineered the tragedy to divide and weaken the heroes. The players must decide whether to pursue vengeance, seek reconciliation, or allow the realm to descend into full-scale civil war. Their choices will reshape the balance of power between heroes, villains, and the state forever.

    *   **Role:** A legendary paladin-hero who leads the pro-registration faction. He genuinely believes that oversight is necessary to prevent another Millhaven.

    *   **Role:** A brilliant artificer-hero and inventor who leads the anti-registration resistance. He sees the Act as the first step toward fascist control.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of freedom versus security, accountability versus tyranny, and the cost of ideological purity. The central conflict is not between good and evil, but between two competing visions of heroism. The players must navigate a world where there are no clear right answers, and every choice carries moral weight. Can they find a third path, or will they be forced to choose between their principles and their friends?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Reputation with Both Factions**
*   The players have a Reputation score with both the Pro-Registration and Anti-Registration factions, tracked from -10 to +10.
*   Actions that favor one side lower reputation with the other. High reputation unlocks faction-specific missions, allies, and resources.
*   If reputation drops too low with a faction, they may send assassins or arrest squads after the players.

### 2. **Moral Crisis Moments**
*   At key story beats, the DM presents the players with impossible choices: betray a friend, compromise their values, or let innocents suffer.
*   Each Moral Crisis grants a permanent character development trait that reflects their choice, such as "Hardened by War" (bonus to intimidation, penalty to persuasion with civilians) or "Keeper of Hope" (bonus to inspiration abilities, but vulnerable to despair effects).

### 3. **The Breaking Point**
*   Each PC has a hidden Breaking Point threshold. When forced to act against their core beliefs too many times, they must make a Wisdom save or suffer a crisis of conscience.
*   A failed save results in temporary loss of class features (a paladin loses their oath, a cleric loses their spells) until they undertake a personal quest to reconcile their actions with their identity.
