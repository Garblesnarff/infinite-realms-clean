# The Cupboard Wars
## "When the cupboard opens, history walks out."

### Campaign Overview
Young Omari discovers an antique cupboard at an estate sale—the kind with a small key and an inexplicable feeling of importance. When he places his plastic action figures inside and locks the door, something impossible happens: they transform into real beings from the eras they represent. His cowboy becomes an actual 1880s gunslinger. His WW2 soldier carries real memories of D-Day. His medieval knight remembers the Crusades.

But Omari's sister Amara has her own toys, and they transform too: A Zulu warrior, a samurai, a Viking. The cupboard doesn't just bring toys to life—it pulls actual historical consciousnesses into toy bodies, complete with cultural conflicts, historical grudges, and genuine combat skills. What begins as imaginative play descends into genuine war as centuries-old enemies find themselves in the same bedroom, toy-sized but lethal.

The campaign forces players to navigate cultural conflicts, historical trauma, anachronistic technology (Roman gladiator with smartphone knowledge), and the terrifying question: If they die as toys, do the historical consciousnesses die too? And why does the cupboard do this? Investigation reveals it's a magical artifact that collected souls from throughout history—and they've been fighting these wars for centuries in different toy forms.
