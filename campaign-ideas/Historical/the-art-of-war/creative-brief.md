# The Art of War - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Chinese Classical Painting + Strategic Maps**: Elegant minimalism, strategic overlay, ink paintings style. Inspired by: Chinese scroll paintings, strategic wargaming, period dramas like *Three Kingdoms*.

## Visual Design
**Sun Tzu**: Scholar-general, simple robes, writing implements equal to weapons. Not flashy—understated excellence.
**Maps**: Beautiful strategic maps showing troop movements, terrain, supply lines—visualization of thought.

## Color Palettes
- **Wu Kingdom**: Blue-green (wu means military/martial)
- **Chu Kingdom**: Red (rival, fire)
- **Strategic Maps**: Black ink, red annotations, terrain colors
- **Victory**: Gold (bloodless), grey (defeated enemy)

## Music
**Chinese Classical**: Guqin (7-string zither—intellectual), pipa, dizi flute. Tactical sequences: Percussion for military movement. Philosophical moments: Silence and single instrument.

## Voice Direction
**Sun Tzu**: Measured, calm, professorial. Never loud, never emotional. Authority through wisdom, not volume.

## Cinematic Moments
- Concubine execution: Brutal discipline
- Battle of Boju: Elegant strategic ballet, not chaos
- Writing the chapters: Brush on silk, timeless wisdom
- Fall of Wu (after Sun Tzu): Vindication of predictions
