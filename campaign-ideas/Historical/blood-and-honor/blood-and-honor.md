## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act tale of betrayal, survival through spectacle, and ultimate reckoning with tyranny.

*   **Act I — The Fall (Sessions 1-5):** The party serves as generals under the dying Emperor Marcus. His son Commodus murders him and orders the party's execution to eliminate threats to his rule. They're enslaved and sold to a gladiator trainer. They must adapt from command to survival, learning arena combat while witnessing the corruption consuming Rome. Their deaths are ordered, but the mob's love keeps them alive.
*   **Act II — Blood and Sand (Sessions 6-13):** The party rises through arena ranks, becoming crowd favorites. They're brought to Rome's Grand Colosseum where politics and combat intertwine. They secretly contact senators plotting against Commodus while surviving increasingly elaborate death matches. They discover Commodus' madness extends to fighting in the arena himself, obsessed with glory. An opportunity for revenge emerges.
*   **Act III — The Dream of Rome (Sessions 14-20):** The party becomes the symbol of resistance—the Senate offers them freedom if they kill the Emperor in the arena. Commodus, learning of the conspiracy, arranges ultimate games where he'll fight the party himself before the mob. The final battle isn't just for survival but for Rome's soul. They must choose between honorable death or compromised victory, and whether Rome can be saved.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores honor in dishonor, whether vengeance corrupts the vengeful, and if noble means matter more than necessary ends. It asks: Can you remain virtuous while covered in blood? Does the mob's love confer legitimacy? Is personal revenge worth damaging a larger cause? The central conflict pits the party's desire for vengeance against their duty to Rome, their need to survive against their commitment to honor, and their understanding that sometimes entertainment matters more to the people than justice.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Crowd Favor System**
*   Arena combat tracked by Crowd Favor (0-100)
*   Favor increases: spectacular moves, dramatic moments, sparing worthy opponents, addressing crowd
*   Favor decreases: boring fights, cowardice, killing crowd favorites
*   High favor grants bonuses, prevents execution, unlocks special equipment
*   "Are You Not Entertained?" - special action to directly address crowd for massive favor shift

### 2. **Arena Combat Spectacles**
*   Fights aren't just to death—they're performances with dramatic structure
*   Environmental hazards: trapdoors, wild beasts, fire, flooding, collapsing structures
*   Themed battles: historical reenactments, mythological scenes, naval combat
*   Bonus XP for creative kills, dramatic flourishes, and satisfying narrative arcs
*   Crowd expects different things: mercy for brave foes, cruelty for criminals

### 3. **Honor vs Victory**
*   Track Honor score separate from alignment
*   Honorable actions (mercy, keeping word, protecting weak) increase honor
*   Pragmatic actions (poison, ambush, sacrifice allies) decrease honor but may ensure victory
*   Honor affects NPC reactions, especially senators and Lucilla
*   Final confrontation outcomes change based on accumulated honor

### 4. **Political Intrigue Web**
*   Rome has factions: Senate Republicans, Imperial Loyalists, Mob, Praetorian Guard, Provincial Governors
*   Actions affect each faction's support for party or Commodus
*   Information gathering reveals plots, blackmail material, alliance opportunities
*   Senate needs party to martyr themselves for Republic—conflict between personal and political goals

### 5. **Gladiator Bonds**
*   Party fights alongside other gladiators who become allies
*   Bonds developed through shared combat increase combat effectiveness
*   Some fights force party to battle friends—choice to kill, spare, or refuse
*   Survivor gladiators can be recruited for final rebellion
*   Death of bonded gladiator affects morale and revenge motivation

### 6. **Injury & Scarring**
*   Arena combat leaves permanent scars and injuries
*   Injuries can be displayed for crowd sympathy or hidden for surprise advantage
*   Some injuries reduce stats but increase intimidation
*   "Wounded Hero" status grants crowd favor
*   Winning despite terrible injuries becomes legendary

### 7. **Training & Techniques**
*   Learn different gladiator styles: Murmillo (heavy), Retiarius (net/trident), Thraex (curved sword), Dimachaerus (dual wield)
*   Train between sessions to unlock special moves
*   Proximo teaches "arena wisdom"—how to read crowd, when to show mercy, how to make deaths beautiful
*   Historical tactics from military career can be adapted to arena

### 8. **The Emperor's Madness**
*   Commodus' sanity deteriorates throughout campaign
*   His decisions become more erratic and cruel
*   He arranges increasingly unfair fights against party
*   Final battle he personally participates in, but ensures advantage (poison, hidden weapons, guard interference)
*   His madness makes him dangerous but also provides opportunities
