# Creative Brief: The Grand Conjunction

## Visual Art Direction
- Countdown aesthetics: Celestial calendar showing alignment progress
- Reality becomes increasingly "glitchy" as conjunction approaches
- Each faction has distinct visual style reflecting their vision
- Reality code visible to Conjunction-Touched as glowing symbols

## Faction Visual Themes
- **Aries:** Red and orange, battlefield aesthetics, aggressive architecture
- **Taurus:** Golden and green, frozen in time, museum-like perfection
- **Gemini:** Prismatic, splitting realities, mirror worlds
- **Cancer:** Pearl and seafoam, womb-like structures, protective shells
- **Leo:** Royal gold and purple, grand monuments, theatrical spaces
- **Virgo:** White and silver, geometric perfection, clean lines
- **Libra:** Black and white balance, symmetrical everything
- **Scorpio:** Deep purple and black, hidden spaces, transforming architecture
- **Sagittarius:** Teal and horizon colors, endless vistas, maps everywhere
- **Capricorn:** Stone gray and mountain blue, hierarchical towers
- **Aquarius:** Electric blue and rebel colors, changing structures
- **Pisces:** Lavender and dream colors, reality-bending spaces

## Music Direction
- Countdown tension building throughout campaign
- Each faction has musical theme reflecting their philosophy
- Conjunction sequence: All themes attempting to play simultaneously
- Resolution depends on coalition - harmonizing themes or cacophony

## Voice Acting
- Faction leaders should embody their sign's extreme
- Passionate conviction in their vision
- None should be purely villainous - all believe they're right
- Thirteenth Shard should sound ancient and wise

## Atmosphere
- Political thriller meets cosmic fantasy
- Growing urgency as days count down
- Reality itself becoming unreliable
- Multiple competing visions creating tension

## Marketing Taglines
- "48 hours to rewrite everything"
- "Twelve visions. One reality. Your choice."
- "When the stars align, what will you become?"
