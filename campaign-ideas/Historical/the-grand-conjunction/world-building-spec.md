# World-Building Specification: The Grand Conjunction

## The Conjunction Cycle

Every 500 years, all planets align perfectly. During 48-hour window:
- Reality becomes malleable
- Cosmic magic at apex
- Previous conjunctions rewrote aspects of reality
- This is the 6th recorded conjunction

## Previous Conjunctions

**2,500 years ago (1st):** Created the zodiac system itself
**2,000 years ago (2nd):** Established elemental balance
**1,500 years ago (3rd):** Created the concept of houses
**1,000 years ago (4th):** Established current planetary hierarchy
**500 years ago (5th):** Created Conjunction-Touched failsafe

## The Twelve Factions - Detailed

## The Constellation Shards

18 fragments of cosmic power scattered after last conjunction:
- Each Shard controls one aspect of reality rewrite
- Distribution ensures no single faction dominates
- Thirteenth Shard (hidden) can moderate all others
- Collecting Shards is primary campaign objective

## Magic System: Reality Code

Conjunction-Touched can see reality's code:
- Appears as glowing symbols and equations
- Can be edited before conjunction (small changes)
- During conjunction (total rewrite possible)
- Requires Shards to make permanent changes

## The World Before Rewrite

Current reality is result of previous conjunctions:
- Zodiac system (1st conjunction)
- Elemental balance (2nd conjunction)
- House system (3rd conjunction)
- Planetary hierarchy (4th conjunction)
- Failsafe system (5th conjunction - created the party)

## Countdown Effects

**Days 30-20:** Normal reality, factions preparing
**Days 19-10:** Minor reality glitches, magic intensifies
**Days 9-4:** Major glitches, local reality edits possible
**Days 3-1:** Reality becomes unstable, dangerous edits
**Day 0-2:** Total malleability, conjunction window
**Day 3+:** New reality solidifies based on rewrite

## The Thirteenth Shard

Created by 5th conjunction architects as failsafe:
- Can moderate extreme rewrites
- Judges worthiness of user
- Located in Void Between (outside normal reality)
- Sentient and has its own agenda
- Will only work for those building coalition

## Coalition Building

Compatible sign groups:
- Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius)
- Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn)
- Air signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius)
- Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces)

Opposing vision pairs:
- Aries vs Cancer (conflict vs safety)
- Taurus vs Aquarius (stability vs change)
- Gemini vs Capricorn (possibility vs order)
- Leo vs Pisces (hierarchy vs unity)

Building cross-faction coalition is hardest but best outcome.

## Philosophical Core

No single vision is completely right or wrong. The campaign explores:
- Value of multiple perspectives
- Danger of extremism
- Need for compromise
- Responsibility of cosmic power
- How change affects identity

The optimal ending synthesizes best aspects of all visions into coherent whole.
