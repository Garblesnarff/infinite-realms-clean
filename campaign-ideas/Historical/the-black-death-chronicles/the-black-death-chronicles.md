*A Plague Survival Campaign — Medium Campaign (10-12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Black Death Chronicles
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Horror / Survival / Social Collapse
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **8**
**Tone (keywords):** horrifying, desperate, paranoid, breakdown, haunting
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are survivors in a world ravaged by an unstoppable plague that kills half of all people it touches, transforms society into paranoid chaos, and challenges every certainty about divine justice and human nature. As physicians, clergy, merchants, and ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, they must navigate quarantined cities, flagellant mobs, collapsing feudal order, and the impossible question of whether this is divine punishment or natural disaster. The campaign explores survival when death is random and total, the breakdown of social order when fear overwhelms reason, and whether humanity's worst or best nature emerges in apocalyptic crisis. This is a story of the Black Death—where heroes must decide what matters when everything is dying.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The First Deaths"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Outbreak
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Strange illness appears in the port district—people develop black buboes and die within days.
    *   City authorities dismiss it as common disease; the church calls for prayer.
    *   Players witness the first wave of deaths: sudden, agonizing, unstoppable.
**Escalation:** By session's end, hundreds are dead and the plague is spreading faster than anyone imagined.

### Sessions 2-3 — "Quarantine"
*   **Focus:** Isolation / Breakdown Begins
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The city closes its gates—no one enters or leaves. Infected quarters are sealed with people inside.
    *   Players must navigate between helping the sick, protecting themselves, and maintaining humanity.
    *   Physicians wearing bird-mask plague doctor outfits arrive with "cures" that don't work.
**Escalation:** One quarter of the city is dead. Bodies pile up faster than they can be buried. Fear becomes hysteria.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Flagellants"
*   **Focus:** Religious Extremism / Scapegoating
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Flagellant mobs arrive, whipping themselves in public penance, declaring the plague divine punishment.
    *   They begin targeting "sinners": merchants, foreigners, religious minorities as causes of God's wrath.
    *   Players must choose whether to protect victims, join the mob for safety, or hide and survive.
**Escalation:** The flagellants gain control of city districts. Violence spreads as fast as plague. Authority collapses completely.

### Sessions 6-7 — "The Accused"
*   **Focus:** Witch Hunt / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Plague continues despite flagellation. Accusations fly: poisoned wells, witchcraft, divine curse.
    *   The players or their allies may be accused—requiring escape, proof of innocence, or political maneuvering.
    *   Mass burnings of accused witches and heretics create new horror atop the plague's natural terror.
**Escalation:** Half the city is dead. Survivors are paranoid, violent, and desperate for someone to blame.

### Sessions 8-9 — "The Breakdown"
*   **Focus:** Total Social Collapse / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Feudal order disintegrates—serfs flee dead lords' estates, priests abandon churches, merchants' guilds dissolve.
    *   Players navigate a world where every structure has failed: law, religion, economy, family.
    *   Some communities show extraordinary compassion; others descend into violence and hedonism.
**Escalation:** The plague begins to recede not because of cure but because it's killed everyone it can reach.

### Sessions 10-11 — "The Aftermath"
*   **Focus:** Transformation / New World
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Two-thirds of the city is dead. Survivors emerge to a transformed world.
    *   Labor shortage gives peasants leverage over lords; Church authority is questioned; merchants gain power.
    *   Players help shape what emerges: revolution, restoration, or something entirely new.
**Escalation:** Other cities report the same devastation. This isn't local—it's continental, maybe global.

### Session 12 — "What Remains"
*   **Focus:** Resolution / Legacy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The campaign concludes with the players seeing what they preserved through the apocalypse.
    *   Some became healers who saved lives, others maintained order, some preserved knowledge or protected the vulnerable.
    *   The session ends with the question: Did the plague destroy the old world, or reveal what was already broken?
**Escalation:** The players realize they're among the survivors who will build the new world—for better or worse.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores survival during apocalyptic plague and humanity's response to random, total death. The central conflict is the players navigating a world where death is everywhere, cause is unknown, cure is impossible, and society's response ranges from heroic compassion to paranoid violence. They must balance self-preservation with helping others, maintain sanity as everything collapses, and choose what values to uphold when all structures fail. The campaign asks: How do people respond when facing incomprehensible disaster? Does crisis reveal humanity's best or worst nature? What matters when survival is random chance? And what world emerges after apocalypse? The answer: plague destroys but also transforms—the survivors' choices during crisis determine whether the new world is better or worse than what died.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Plague Exposure System**
*   Every interaction with infected people, corpses, or contaminated areas risks exposure.
*   Exposure accumulates; reaching threshold requires a save or contract the plague.
*   Players must balance helping others against survival—compassion has mechanical cost.

### 2. **Social Breakdown Tracker**
*   Measures the collapse of Order, Faith, Economy, and Compassion.
*   As trackers fall, different crises emerge: mobs, witch hunts, hoarding, violence.
*   Players can slow breakdown in some areas by their actions, creating pockets of stability.

### 3. **Paranoia Spiral**
*   NPC suspicion and scapegoating increases as plague continues despite prayers and penance.
*   Anyone different becomes suspect: foreigners, healers, the wealthy, religious minorities.
*   Players may be accused and must defend themselves or flee.

### 4. **Survival vs. Humanity**
*   Track the players' choices between self-preservation and helping others.
*   These choices determine what kind of people they become and what world emerges.
*   The epilogue shows whether their example inspired compassion or justified selfishness.

### 5. **The Transformation**
*   As feudal order collapses, new social structures emerge: peasant power, merchant guilds, religious reform.
*   Players' actions during the crisis influence what replaces the old world.
*   The campaign ends showing the transformed society their choices helped create.
