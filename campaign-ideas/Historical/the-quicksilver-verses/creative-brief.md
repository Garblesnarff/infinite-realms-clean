## Art Style: Traditional Elegance with Lightning Speed (Chihayafuru-inspired)

Inspired by the beautiful competitive karuta aesthetics of *Chihayafuru* with emphasis on traditional Japanese culture, lightning-fast card grabs, classical poetry, and the contrast between ancient verses and modern competition. This style captures flowing hakama, intense focus, motion blur of grabbing cards, and the spiritual connection to poetry.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Quicksilver speed, classical poetry, passionate focus, traditional elegance, memory and reflex
*   **Feeling:** The intensity of split-second decisions mixed with the beauty of ancient poetry. Traditional culture in modern competition. The stillness before the lightning strike.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Traditional:** Tatami beige, hakama blues and purples, calligraphy black, rice paper white
*   **Seasonal Poetry:** Autumn reds and golds, cherry blossom pinks, winter whites, summer greens
*   **Karuta Cards:** White cards with black calligraphy, cream backgrounds
*   **Motion Effects:** Speed lines in blues and whites, sound wave visualizations
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a traditional tatami room at the national karuta championship. Two players in hakama—formal traditional divided skirts in deep blue and purple—kneel opposite each other with 25 white karuta cards arranged between them. The cards show classical black calligraphy. Autumn leaves visible through the window suggest the season. The lighting is natural and soft. The atmosphere is tense with anticipation before the reader begins."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Competition Attire:** Traditional hakama over white kimono tops, formal and elegant
*   **Casual Training:** School uniforms or casual clothes during practice
*   **Focused Expressions:** Intense concentration, eyes tracking cards, listening intently
*   **Hand Positioning:** Hands poised above cards, ready to strike instantly
*   **Prompt Example:** "The protagonist kneels in competitive karuta position wearing a purple hakama and white kimono top. Their right hand is extended above the cards in striking position, left hand resting on thigh. Expression shows intense focus—eyes scanning the card field, listening for the poem. Hair tied back for competition. Subtle motion lines suggest they're ready to move at any instant. The posture combines elegance and coiled readiness."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Tatami Rooms:** Traditional Japanese rooms with tatami mats, shoji screens, minimal decoration
*   **Omi Jingu Shrine:** Sacred championship site with traditional architecture, historical atmosphere
*   **School Clubroom:** Tatami practice area with card sets, poetry books, casual training atmosphere
*   **Prompt Example:** "Omi Jingu Shrine's tournament hall—a large traditional Japanese room with tatami mat floors. Multiple karuta matches occur simultaneously, each pair of players kneeling with their card sets. Shoji screen walls with natural light filtering through. Traditional wooden architecture visible. Spectators sit seiza-style around the edges. The atmosphere is sacred and respectful, befitting the historic site where Queen and Master titles are decided."

**5. Karuta Action:**
*   **The Card Grab:** Hand shooting out in blur of motion, fingers touching card first
*   **Sound Visualization:** Waves emanating from reader showing poem being heard
*   **Memory Moments:** Overlay of poem text in calligraphy, flashback to memorization
*   **Victory and Defeat:** Cards sent to opponent as penalty, dwindling card numbers
*   **Prompt Example:** "The instant of card grab—protagonist's hand is a motion blur shooting toward a specific card among the spread. Speed lines emphasize the velocity. Sound waves visualized as concentric circles from the reader's voice. The opponent's hand reaches simultaneously but is a fraction behind. Both players' expressions show maximum intensity. Time seems frozen at the moment of contact. The karuta card they're grabbing shows classical calligraphy clearly."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Natural Traditional:** Soft natural light through shoji screens, gentle shadows
*   **Focused Intensity:** Dramatic lighting on faces showing concentration
*   **Motion Emphasis:** Contrast between stillness and explosive movement
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by soft natural light filtering through shoji screens creating gentle shadows on the tatami. The two competitors are in sharp focus, their intense expressions highlighted. The karuta cards between them are crisply defined. When they move, motion blur and speed lines contrast with the serene setting. The lighting emphasizes the contradiction between the peaceful traditional space and the lightning-fast competitive action."

## Voice

A voice that starts uncertain but builds to passionate intensity. The pacing alternates between stillness (listening to poems) and explosive speed (grabbing cards). The tone shifts between appreciating poetry's beauty, analytical strategy, and fierce competitive determination. There's an underlying theme of connecting to ancient verses through modern competition and finding beauty in speed and memory. Includes moments of breathless focus and declarations of love for the game. Role: The voice of someone discovering that tradition and passion can coexist in competition.
