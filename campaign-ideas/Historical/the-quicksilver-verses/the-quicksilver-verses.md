## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act journey from beginner to championship challenger.

*   **Act I — Discovery and Formation (Sessions 1-7):** The protagonist is introduced to competitive karuta by a childhood friend and becomes obsessed with the game's beauty—the poetry, the speed, the focus. They form a karuta club at school, recruiting members who each have different relationships with the game. Through local tournaments, they learn fundamentals: memorizing poem positions, reading strategies, attacking versus defending. Their first major tournament teaches them they're still beginners in a game with lifelong masters.
*   **Act II — Regional Competition (Sessions 8-13):** The club enters regional team tournaments facing established schools with experienced players. Each match teaches different aspects of karuta: some opponents have perfect speed, others have flawless memory, others employ psychological tactics. The protagonist develops their unique style—aggressive attacking karuta—while learning to work as a team. Individual tournaments run parallel, with each member chasing personal ranking advancement.
*   **Act III — The National Stage (Sessions 14-20):** At Nationals, they face the absolute elite—players who have dedicated their lives to karuta. The protagonist must challenge for the Queen title while supporting their team's championship run. The final match requires not just speed and memory, but deep understanding of the poetry's meaning and connection to the game. Whether they achieve the title or not, they've discovered that karuta is about more than cards—it's about passion, poetry, and the bonds formed through competition.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Poem Memorization**
*   Must memorize all 100 Hyakunin Isshu classical poems
*   Each poem has specific first syllables that identify it—some unique, some shared
*   Perfect memory allows instant recognition from first sound
*   Knowing poem meanings adds contextual understanding
*   Memory retention affected by fatigue and pressure

### 2. **Card Arrangement Strategy**
*   Before match, arrange 25 cards on your side and opponent arranges their 25
*   Arrangement determines: reach distance, defensive strength, attacking paths
*   Can memorize opponent's arrangement to know where their cards are
*   Rearranging mid-game is allowed but costs focus

### 3. **Speed and Accuracy**
*   Must grab correct card faster than opponent
*   Grabbing wrong card is fault—penalty card sent to you
*   Speed without accuracy is useless—control is crucial
*   Reaction time from hearing poem to touching card measured in fractions of seconds
*   Fatigue affects both speed and accuracy

### 4. **Attacking vs Defending**
*   Attacking style: Aggressively target opponent's cards, pressure them
*   Defending style: Protect your cards, wait for opponent mistakes
*   Balanced style: Adapt based on game situation
*   Protagonist's aggressive style risks faults but creates pressure
*   Opponent's style determines optimal counter-strategy

### 5. **One-Syllable Cards**
*   Some poems identified by single syllable—must react instantly
*   Harder to defend since reaction window is minimal
*   Pressure cards that can swing game momentum
*   Mastering one-syllable cards is mark of elite player

### 6. **Match Flow**
*   Matches last 1-3 hours of intense focus
*   Begin with 50 cards (25 per player), decrease toward zero
*   Early game: many cards, building advantage
*   Mid game: strategy becomes clearer
*   End game: Every card is crucial, pressure is maximum
*   Mental fatigue accumulates throughout

### 7. **Team vs Individual**
*   Team tournaments: Five players, best of five individual matches
*   Team must coordinate but each member plays alone
*   Individual rankings determine tournament seeding
*   Personal goals can conflict with team needs
*   Supporting teammates while pursuing individual dreams

### 8. **Poetry Connection**
*   Understanding poem's meaning, emotion, historical context
*   Deep connection helps with: memory, appreciation, focus
*   Poems about love, seasons, loss, beauty, impermanence
