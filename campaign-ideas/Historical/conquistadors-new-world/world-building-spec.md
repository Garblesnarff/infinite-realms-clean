**Conquistadors of the New World**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The players are conquistadors and explorers arriving in the New World seeking gold, glory, and spreading Christianity, only to encounter sophisticated civilizations they'll help destroy through superior weapons, disease, and unstoppable greed. The campaign explores colonialism's brutal reality, the horror of disease destroying populations, and whether any individual can be moral when participating in systemic conquest.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the motivations for exploration: finding routes to Asia, gold, religious mission, glory.
    *   Write about native civilizations pre-contact: Aztec, Inca, sophisticated societies with cities, agriculture, astronomy.
    *   Describe the disease apocalypse: 90% mortality from European diseases natives had no immunity to.
    *   Explain conquistador advantages: steel, horses, guns, disease, and native allies.
    *   Detail the encomienda system: enslaving natives on their own land for gold extraction.
    *   Write about the Columbian Exchange: both worlds permanently transformed.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**

IF players prioritize gold THEN exploitation intensifies. IF players oppose atrocities THEN they face consequences from fellow conquistadors.
