The party serves the great king-hero Gilgamesh of Uruk as he seeks to defy death itself after losing his beloved friend Enkidu, journeying to the ends of the earth seeking Utnapishtim the immortal flood survivor while facing demons, divine retribution, and the scorpion-guardians of the sun's path. They must navigate ancient Mesopotamia's divine politics where gods like Ishtar demand worship and punish slights, where the goddess Tiamat's primordial chaos still threatens creation, and where the underworld traps all who enter. They'll discover that Gilgamesh's quest for immortality reveals mortality's true meaning—that death gives life purpose, and legacy matters more than living forever.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 14–18 sessions)

A four-act epic following Gilgamesh's legendary journey.

*   **Act I — The Wild Man (Sessions 1–4):** Gilgamesh tyrannizes Uruk with his demigod strength. The gods create Enkidu, a wild man, to challenge him. The party witnesses their legendary friendship form and helps them slay Humbaba, guardian of the Cedar Forest, angering the gods.
*   **Act II — Divine Wrath (Sessions 5–9):** Ishtar propositions Gilgamesh who rejects her. She sends the Bull of Heaven to punish Uruk. They slay it, but Enkidu is cursed with death as divine punishment. His slow death and Gilgamesh's grief drive the quest for immortality.
*   **Act III — The Journey's End (Sessions 10–14):** They journey beyond the edge of the world, crossing mountains of Mashu guarded by scorpion-people, traversing the waters of death, seeking Utnapishtim who survived the great flood. They learn the secret of immortality but discover it cannot be claimed without cosmic permission.
*   **Act IV — Descent and Return (Sessions 15–18):** They descend to the underworld seeking to restore Enkidu or accept death's necessity. They face Ereshkigal, goddess of the dead, and learn that legacy through great deeds matters more than living forever. Gilgamesh returns to Uruk transformed, building lasting civilization rather than seeking impossible immortality.

## Central Conflict

Mortality versus immortality and the meaning of life. Gilgamesh seeks to escape death but learns that mortality gives life meaning—immortals like Utnapishtim exist without purpose, while mortals create legacy through deeds. Friendship, love, and accomplishment matter because they're temporary. The underworld represents acceptance—all must die, but how one lives determines what echoes remain. The party determines whether Gilgamesh learns this wisdom or remains trapped seeking impossible immortality.
