*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** At the prestigious Tristain Academy of Magic, students summon familiars to bond with during the sacred Springtime Summoning Ceremony. When Louise Françoise, a noble girl with a reputation for catastrophic magical failures, performs her summoning, she accidentally pulls the party from another world instead of a traditional familiar. Bound by magical contract to serve as her familiars, the party must navigate academy politics, magical duels, romantic entanglements, and a conspiracy that threatens the kingdom—all while pretending to be mystical creatures and helping Louise overcome her "Zero" reputation to discover her true, legendary Void power.
