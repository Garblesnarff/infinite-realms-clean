## Historical Impact
- Largest contiguous land empire (history)

- Spread technologies: Printing, gunpowder, compass

- Mixed legacy: Genocidal conqueror + empire builder

## Causality Chains
1. **Uniting Mongols**: Success = World conquest. Failure = Divided tribes conquered by others
2. **Meritocracy vs. Aristocracy**: Shapes Mongol society forever
3. **Khwarazmian Insult**: Diplomatic resolution? No Central Asian conquest
4. **Succession**: Ögedei chosen = Continued expansion. Civil war = Fragmentation
5. **Western Campaign**: Ögedei lives longer = Europe conquered?
