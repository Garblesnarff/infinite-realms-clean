# Crossing the Rubicon
*From politician to dictator—conquer Gaul, defy the Senate, and transform Republic into Empire*

## Campaign Overview

Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BCE), Rome's most famous leader, conquered Gaul, crossed the Rubicon River in defiance of Senate, won a civil war, became dictator, and was assassinated by those fearing monarchy. This campaign follows his rise from debt-ridden politician to master of Rome, exploring themes of ambition, republican ideals vs. autocracy, military genius, political manipulation, and the thin line between saving a state and destroying it.

The party serves as Caesar's inner circle—legates, tribunes, political allies like Mark Antony and confidants who execute his vision. Conquer barbarians, navigate Senate politics, fight fellow Romans, witness republic's death, and ultimately face the question: Is Caesar Rome's savior or destroyer?

## Core Themes
- **Ambition and Destiny**: Was Caesar saving Rome or serving himself?
- **Republic vs. Dictatorship**: Freedom vs. order, chaos vs. tyranny
- **Military Genius**: Gallic Wars demonstrate tactical brilliance
- **Political Maneuvering**: Senate intrigue, propaganda, populism
- **Civil War Tragedy**: Roman vs. Roman, friend vs. friend
- **Assassination and Legacy**: Murder creates martyr, enables Octavian's empire

## Key NPCs

**Julius Caesar**: Brilliant general, ruthless politician, charismatic, arrogant, merciful (clementia), ambitious beyond measure. Genuinely believed saving Rome? Or ultimate egoist?

**Pompey the Great**: Caesar's rival, former ally. Great general, politically inept. Tragic figure—fled, defeated, murdered.

**Marcus Brutus**: "Noblest Roman," Caesar's possible son, joins conspiracy. Stoic idealist, parricide.

**Mark Antony**: Caesar's loyal lieutenant, brilliant orator. After Caesar: Ally/rival to Octavian.

**Cleopatra VII**: Egyptian queen, Caesar's lover, mother of Caesarion. Political partnership.

**Vercingetorix**: Gallic hero, noble enemy. Unified Gauls, lost to genius, died in chains.

**Cato the Younger**: Stoic philosopher, implacable enemy. Suicide rather than Caesar's mercy.

**Cicero**: Greatest orator, republican idealist, vacillated, eventually murdered (proscriptions).

**Octavian (Augustus)**: Adopted heir age 18, becomes first emperor. Cold political genius.

## Major Locations

**Gaul**: Conquered territories, Alesia siege
**Rubicon River**: Point of no return

## Unique Mechanics

### Military Campaigns

### Political Maneuvering

**Historical Erasure**: Remembered as tyrant, not savior

---

**Note**: Caesar transformed Rome from Republic to Empire (via Octavian). Whether hero or villain debated since antiquity. Campaign explores ambition's heights, moral complexity of power, and how one person reshapes civilizations. "Crossing the Rubicon" = irreversible decision (phrase enters language).
