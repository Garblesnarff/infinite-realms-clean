This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Historical Medieval Real-Time Strategy (Age of Empires-inspired)

Inspired by the historical warfare aesthetics of *Age of Empires* with medieval civilizations, resource gathering, and massive army battles. This style captures historical authenticity, civilization diversity, economic simulation, and epic scale of medieval conquest.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Historical Detail:** Accurate medieval architecture, period-appropriate units, authentic weaponry
*   **Resource Economy Visual:** Villages with farms, lumber camps, mines, bustling medieval economy
*   **Mass Battles:** Hundreds of units clashing, siege weapons, cavalry charges
*   **Civilization Identity:** Each faction has distinct architectural and cultural style

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Historical medieval warfare, resource management, empire building, age progression, siege warfare, civilization conquest
*   **Feeling:** The grandeur of building civilizations. Economic hustle of villagers gathering resources. Epic scale of army clashes. Historical warfare brought to life.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Dark Age:** Earth tones, simple browns, thatch roofs, primitive
*   **Feudal Age:** Medieval colors emerge, stone gray, banner reds and blues
*   **Castle Age:** Rich heraldic colors, castle stone, siege weapon wood
*   **Imperial Age:** Golden imperial colors, gunpowder smoke, advanced architecture
*   **Prompt Example:** "...showing age progression. Dark Age village with wooden palisades and thatch huts, brown earth tones. Same location in Castle Age now has stone walls, gray castle keep, colorful heraldic banners. Imperial Age version shows massive stone fortifications, gold-trimmed buildings, trebuchets, and gunpowder units."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Villagers:** Peasant clothing, carrying resources (wood, food, gold), working at buildings
*   **Military Evolution:** Militia (basic) → Man-at-Arms → Swordsmen → Champions showing armor progression
*   **Cavalry:** Scouts → Knights in chainmail → Paladins in full plate
*   **Archers:** Basic archers → Crossbowmen → Longbowmen with specialized gear
*   **Heroes:** Civilization-specific legendary units commanding armies
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Frankish Paladin in full plate armor with royal blue and gold livery, mounted on armored warhorse with matching barding. Lance raised, charging position. Behind them, formation of Frankish knights in similar colors. Castle with French heraldry visible in background."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Town Centers:** Economic hubs with villagers working, markets, farms surrounding
*   **Castles:** Medieval fortresses with arrow slits, battlements, defensive towers
*   **Battlefields:** Open plains with armies in formation, siege weapons advancing
*   **Resources:** Dense forests, gold/stone mines, rivers with fish traps, trade routes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A thriving medieval town: Stone Town Center at center, villagers carrying wood from nearby forest, farmers tending fields, miners at gold deposit. Stone walls protect the perimeter. Market with merchants. Castle under construction. Knights training. Bustling medieval economy visible."

**5. Combat and Siege Warfare:**
*   **Mass Battles:** Formations of infantry, cavalry flanking, archers volleying arrows
*   **Siege Weapons:** Trebuchets launching stones, battering rams at gates, siege towers
*   **Castle Assaults:** Defenders on walls raining arrows, attackers scaling with ladders
*   **Naval Warfare:** Warships with archers and rams clashing at sea
*   **Prompt Example:** "Epic siege battle: Massive stone castle under assault. Three trebuchets launch flaming stones at walls. Battering ram approaches gate with shield bearers. Defenders on walls fire arrows down. Cavalry wait for breach. Smoke and fire everywhere. Hundreds of units engaged."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Natural Medieval Lighting:** Sunlight on armor, torch light on castle walls at night
*   **Battle Atmosphere:** Dust clouds from cavalry, smoke from siege weapons
*   **Economic Scenes:** Warm daylight on villages, golden hour on farmlands
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by golden afternoon sunlight making armor gleam. Castle casts long shadows. Dust kicked up by cavalry charges creates atmospheric haze. Torch light on walls as night falls. Siege fire creates orange glow contrasting blue twilight sky."

## Voice

A voice that begins with medieval storytelling gravitas and builds to commanding battlefield authority. The pacing is measured for economic phases, rapid for combat. The tone shifts between historical narration ("In the year 1200, our civilization enters the Castle Age"), economic management ("We need more wood for building, send villagers to the forest"), and tactical command ("Knights, flank their archers! Trebuchets, target the walls!"). There's pride in civilization building. Slightly archaic English for historical flavor. Role: The voice of medieval command and empire building.
