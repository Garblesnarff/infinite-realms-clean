# Campaign Bible: War of the Elements

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Astra-Panopticon
In the Beginning, there was only the Screaming Chaos—a roiling, sentient entropy that sought to devour itself. To impose order, the Prime Architect (an entity now forgotten) did not create the world; they trapped the Chaos. The twelve Constellations are not merely stars; they are the great rivets of a cosmic cage called the *Astra-Panopticon*. Zodiactica exists on the "lid" of this cage. The magic of the Zodiac is the waste-heat of the cage's bars holding back the entropy. The "Void" is not an invader; it is the prisoner waking up and picking the lock.

### Timeline of Zodiactica
1.  **Year 1 (The Great Riveting):** The stars are hammered into place; the Screaming Chaos is silenced.
2.  **Year 400 (The Age of Mud):** Before the elements separated, Zodiactica was a sludge-filled purgatory.
3.  **Year 890 (The First Schism):** Fire and Water attempt to divorce; the continent cracks, forming the Steam Jungle.
4.  **Year 1050 (The Treaty of Sol):** The Twelve Signs sign the compact of eternal interdependence.
5.  **Year 1500 (The Day of Floating Mountains):** Gravity briefly reversed in Libra territories; cities were tethered to the ground by chains.
6.  **Year 2020 (The Weeping of Virgo):** A plague of uncontrollable empathy swept the land; armies laid down weapons to hug.
7.  **Year 2300 (The Invention of the Calendar):** Time is standardized, angering the Retrograde Historians.
8.  **Year 2495 (The Birth of Unity):** The first multi-elemental child is rumored to have been born and immediately eaten by a griffin (False Rumor).
9.  **Year 2500 (3 Months Ago - The Elemental Schism):** The stars dim. The lock is picked. The factions fracture.
10. **Year 2500 (Current Day):** The Modality Refuge is declared the last neutral ground.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The conflict exists because the **Cognitive Anchor** has slipped. The collective belief of the mortals powers the Constellations. By convincing the elements to hate one another, the Void Cult is starving the stars of belief, thereby weakening the cage's rivets.
