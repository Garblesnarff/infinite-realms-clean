### **World-Building Specification Brief: Twilight of the Nine Realms**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** As the signs of Ragnarok manifest across the Nine Realms, the party—marked by the Norns as neither fully mortal nor divine—must journey across Yggdrasil to prevent or prepare for the prophesied apocalypse, discovering that while fate binds the gods, mortal heroes can still change the outcome of the end times and shape what rises from the ashes.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the structure of the Nine Realms and how Yggdrasil connects them physically and metaphysically

    *   Write about the binding of Fenrir and the sacrifices made to chain him
    *   Detail Jormungandr's origin and why Thor is fated to fight it
    *   Explain the Norns' power over fate and why they chose the party to act outside prophecy
    *   Describe Fimbulwinter's nature and how it signals the approaching end

*   **Midgard** - Mortal realm of Vikings, forests, seas, and winter, gripped by Fimbulwinter
*   **Asgard** - Golden divine realm with great halls, connected by Bifrost rainbow bridge
*   **Yggdrasil** - The World Tree itself as a location, with its trunk, branches, and roots as pathways
*   **Jotunheim** - Frozen wasteland of frost giants with ice fortresses and ancient grudges
*   **Helheim** - Misty realm of the dead below Niflheim, ruled by Hel, where dishonored souls wander

*   **Vanaheim** - Forested realm of the Vanir nature gods (optional exploration)
*   **Vigrid** - The prophesied battlefield where Ragnarok's final battle will occur
*   Each location represents different aspects of Norse cosmology and the approaching apocalypse

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Fimbulwinter continues unchecked THEN mortal realms collapse before Ragnarok begins
*   IF Loki escapes his prison THEN he rallies his armies early, accelerating the timeline
*   IF Fenrir breaks his chains THEN he devours the sun and moon, plunging worlds into darkness
*   IF Jormungandr releases its tail THEN massive floods devastate coastal realms
*   IF the party fails to rally allies THEN the gods fight Ragnarok alone and lose decisively
*   IF corruption among gods is exposed THEN the divine host fractures, weakening Asgard
*   IF Surtr reaches Yggdrasil's heart THEN the World Tree burns completely with nothing surviving
*   IF the party protects specific gods THEN they survive their fated deaths, changing prophecy
*   IF sacred artifacts are preserved THEN they seed the new world with power and knowledge
*   IF the party gains Hel's favor THEN she might spare certain souls from her army
*   IF dwarven alliances are forged THEN legendary weapons can be created for the final battle
*   IF the party defies the Norns THEN fate itself becomes unstable with unpredictable consequences
*   IF enough mortal heroes survive THEN humanity rebuilds stronger in the new world
*   IF the party chooses to become the new gods THEN they shape the next age of the cosmos
