# Saladin: Uniter of Kingdoms - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Islamic Golden Age + Medieval Warfare**: Geometric Islamic art, Crusader castles, desert campaigns. Inspired by: Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Islamic manuscripts, Crusader art.

## Visual Design
**Saladin**: Kurdish features, simple dress (avoided ostentation), beard, turban, curved sword (scimitar). Not gold-adorned—practical warrior.
**Islamic Architecture**: Geometric patterns, calligraphy, elegant domes vs. Crusader stone fortresses.

## Color Palettes
- **Islamic**: Green (Prophet's color), gold script, white marble
- **Desert**: Sand gold, sun orange, shadow blue
- **Battle**: Steel grey, blood red, dust brown
- **Holy Sites**: Jerusalem gold, Dome's blue, sacred white

## Music
**Middle Eastern + Sacred**: Oud, ney flute, qanun, Islamic call to prayer, martial drums. Blend with Western medieval for Crusader scenes. Respectful of both cultures' music.

## Voice Direction
**Saladin**: Calm authority, Arabic accent, strategic thinker's measured pace. Firm but merciful, religious but pragmatic.

## Cinematic Moments
- Hattin victory: Desert heat, thirsty Crusaders, decisive encirclement
- Jerusalem entry: Peaceful, no massacre (contrast 1099)
- Saladin/Richard mutual respect: Exchange of gifts, never meet
- Death scene: Simple room, Quran reading, legacy complete
