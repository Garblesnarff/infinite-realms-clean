# Saladin: Uniter of Kingdoms - World-Building Specification

## The Crusades Era (1096-1291)
European Christians vs. Middle Eastern Muslims for control of Holy Land. Saladin's era: Third Crusade (1189-1192), recapture of Jerusalem (1187).

## Factions
- **Ayyubid Dynasty**: Saladin's creation, Kurdish, unites Egypt/Syria/Mesopotamia
- **Crusader States**: Jerusalem, Antioch, Tripoli, Edessa—European kingdoms in Levant
- **Zengids**: Previous Muslim dynasty, rivals to Saladin
- **Fatimids**: Shia dynasty in Egypt, abolished by Saladin
- **Abbasid Caliphate**: Sunni religious authority (Baghdad)
- **European Powers**: England, France, Holy Roman Empire send crusaders

## Religious Context
**Sunni vs. Shia**: Saladin Sunni, restores Sunni orthodoxy in Egypt
**Jihad**: Religious duty to reclaim Jerusalem
**Christianity**: Latin (Catholic) Crusaders, some Eastern Orthodox, religious fervor

## Military Forces
**Muslim**: Mamluk cavalry (slave-soldiers), Kurdish/Turkish horsemen, Syrian infantry, Egyptian navy
**Crusaders**: Heavy cavalry (knights), crossbowmen, military orders (Templars, Hospitallers)

## Key Battles
- **Montgisard** (1177): Saladin's rare defeat (young, lessons learned)
- **Hattin** (1187): Masterpiece, Crusader army destroyed
- **Arsuf** (1191): Richard defeats Saladin
- **Jaffa** (1192): Stalemate, leads to treaty

## Cultural Exchange
Crusades brought European/Islamic contact: Mathematics, philosophy, medicine, technology transferred. Saladin's court: Scholarship encouraged.

## Saladin's Character (Historical)
- Generous to fault (died nearly penniless)
- Devout Muslim, not fanatic
- Honored truces (mostly)
- Merciful to defeated enemies (usually)
- Politically shrewd (had to be—complex politics)
- Respected by Muslim historians and Crusader chronicles equally

## Causality Chains
1. **Nur ad-Din Death**: Enables Saladin's rise
2. **Egypt Unification**: Provides resources for jihad
3. **Hattin**: Win = Jerusalem reclaimed. Lose = Crusaders survive
4. **Third Crusade**: Permanent stalemate vs. Crusader expulsion
5. **Succession**: Unified vs. fragmented Ayyubid realm

## Legacy
- Symbol of Islamic resistance
- Model of chivalry (East and West)
- Jerusalem Muslim until 1917 (British Mandate)
- Ayyubids replaced by Mamluks (1250)
- Name invoked in modern Middle East conflicts
- Respected in West (rare for historical enemies)
