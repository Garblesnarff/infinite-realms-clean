# Saladin: Uniter of Kingdoms
*Unite the Muslim world and reclaim Jerusalem through chivalry, strategy, and unwavering faith*

## Campaign Overview

Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb—Saladin (1137-1193)—united fractured Muslim kingdoms, recaptured Jerusalem from Crusaders, and became legendary for military brilliance and chivalric honor. Respected by enemies and allies alike, he embodied Islamic ideals while fighting holy war. This campaign explores religious warfare, political unification, cultural clash, and how honor transcends sides in conflict.

The party serves as Saladin's trusted emirs—commanders, diplomats, scholars who help unite Sunni Muslim world, defeat Crusader states, and establish Ayyubid dynasty. Navigate complex politics where Muslim rivals are often greater enemies than Christians, where mercy can be strategic weapon, and where legacy is measured in faith preserved and enemies earned respect.

## Victory Conditions

**Historical Unity**: Reclaim Jerusalem, unite Muslim world, die with honor
