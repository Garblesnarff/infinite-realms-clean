**Curse of the Black Pearl**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In the Golden Age of Piracy, the party encounters the Black Pearl and its cursed undead crew seeking Aztec gold. This draws them into supernatural conflicts involving Davy Jones' heart, the imprisoned goddess Calypso, and the Company's campaign to destroy all pirates.

    *   Davy Jones commands sea life when holding his heart.
*   **Magical Items:**

    *   Sword of Triton: Can control ship rigging, part of larger Trident.

*   **Tactics:** Crossing the T (rake enemy with broadside), boarding actions, chain shot for rigging, grapeshot for crew, fire ships.
*   **Navigation:** Sextants, charts, compass (normal and magical), reading stars, knowing currents.

**8. Economy & Pirate Life**
*   **Pirate Code:** Democratic ship operations, votes for captain and major decisions, equal shares of prizes.
*   **Shares System:** Captain gets 2 shares, officers 1.5, crew 1, compensation for injuries (loss of limb = 600 pieces of eight).
*   **Letters of Marque:** Privateers have legal permission to raid enemy ships, blurry line with piracy.
*   **Black Market:** Tortuga and hidden ports trade stolen goods, no questions asked.
*   **Crew Recruitment:** Press gangs (forced service), promises of riches, escaping Company justice.

**9. Cultural & Social Dynamics**
*   **Pirate Democracy:** Crews vote on captain, can remove him if unpopular, share loot equally.
*   **Company Hierarchy:** Rigid class system, noble-born officers, profit above all, view natives/pirates as lesser.
*   **Honor Among Thieves:** Parley must be respected, Code violations punished even by enemy pirates.
*   **Superstition:** Sailors believe in sea gods, curses, omens, unlucky days, whistling bringing wind.
*   **Romance of the Seas:** Freedom vs security, adventure vs safety, many join pirates to escape rigid society.

**10. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Black Pearl's curse broken → **THEN:** Barbossa crew becomes mortal, vulnerable, but also able to enjoy life again.
*   **IF:** Davy Jones' heart controlled by Company → **THEN:** Systematic destruction of pirate ships begins.
*   **IF:** Calypso freed from binding → **THEN:** Weather becomes chaotic, maelstrom appears, divine wrath unleashed.
*   **IF:** Party takes cursed Aztec gold → **THEN:** Become immortal skeletons in moonlight, cannot feel pleasure.
*   **IF:** Someone stabs Jones' heart → **THEN:** They become new Dutchman captain, must ferry souls 10 years (or forever if they don't pass duty).
*   **IF:** Trident of Poseidon destroyed → **THEN:** All ocean curses break, magic fades from seas, age of supernatural ends.
*   **IF:** Company wins → **THEN:** Piracy eliminated, rigid order imposed, Caribbean becomes corporate territory.
*   **IF:** Pirates unite → **THEN:** Temporarily powerful enough to fight Company armada.

**11. The Kraken & Sea Monsters**
*   **Kraken:** Davy Jones' pet, massive squid that drags ships down.
*   **Summoning:** Jones plays organ, Kraken emerges from depths.
*   **Combat:** Tentacles attack separately, can drag crew overboard, crushes ships.
*   **Weakness:** Vulnerable if Jones commanded to call it off, can be hurt by concentrated cannon fire.
*   **Other Monsters:** Sea serpents, mermaids (beautiful but deadly), sirens, ghost ships.

**12. Supernatural Realms**
*   **Davy Jones' Locker:**
    *   Physical: Endless desert with ships instead of rocks, crabs everywhere, green twilight.
    *   Psychological: Manifests regrets and fears, multiple copies of people, time doesn't flow normally.
    *   Escape: Must "go up is down"—capsize ship so bottom becomes top.
*   **The Triangle:**
    *   Ships float upside-down in air, water flows wrong direction.
    *   Time loops create paradoxes—meet yourself from future.
    *   Dead trapped here exist as ghosts but can interact with living.
    *   Escaping requires navigating by what shouldn't work.

**13. Company Brutality & Propaganda**
*   **Methods:** Mass hangings including children, destroying pirate-sympathetic towns, press-ganging sailors.
*   **Justification:** "Civilization requires order," "Pirates are thieves and murderers," "Greater good of commerce."
*   **Hypocrisy:** Company commits worse atrocities than most pirates, enslaves populations, destroys ecosystems for profit.
*   **Public Opinion:** Common folk sympathize with pirates as freedom fighters, nobility supports Company.

**14. Pirate Lord Politics**
*   **Nine Pirate Lords:** Each rules different ocean region, all equal in theory.
*   **Pieces of Eight:** Personal items proving their position (piece of eight is misnomer).
*   **Conflicts:** Rivalries between lords, some want to fight Company, others want to hide.
*   **Pirate King:** Elected only in crisis, needs majority vote, Jack Sparrow tricks them into voting for him.

**15. Character Motivations & Themes**
*   **Freedom vs Safety:** Pirates choose dangerous freedom over safe servitude.
*   **Immortality's Cost:** Curses grant eternal life but strip away what makes life worth living.
*   **Betrayal & Redemption:** Everyone betrays everyone, but some find redemption.
*   **Bargains with Devils:** Quick solutions (Jones' deals) always cost more than expected.
*   **End of an Age:** Golden Age of Piracy ending, characters decide if it dies with honor or fades shamefully.
