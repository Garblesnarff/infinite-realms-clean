## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-30 sessions)

A four-act epic of piracy, curses, and the supernatural powers that rule the seas.

*   **Act I — The Curse of the Black Pearl (Sessions 1-8):** The party encounters the Black Pearl, whose undead crew seeks Aztec gold to break their curse. They become entangled in battles between pirates, the Company, and supernatural forces. They discover that cursed treasure offers power but strips away life's pleasures. First major arc climaxes with breaking the Pearl's curse, but this awakens worse threats.
*   **Act II — Dead Man's Chest (Sessions 9-16):** With the Pearl freed, they learn of Davy Jones—an immortal who ferries the dead for the sea goddess Calypso. Jones' heart is locked in a chest, and whoever holds it commands him and his ship, the Flying Dutchman. The party must race the Company to find the heart while avoiding Jones' wrath. They discover Jones was once human, betrayed by love.
*   **Act III — At World's End (Sessions 17-24):** The Company executes all pirates using Jones' power, forcing a Pirate Lord council. The party must navigate pirate politics, break Calypso's human imprisonment, and wage war against the Company's armada. Reality itself cracks as gods walk the seas. They must choose sides in a conflict where every option costs something precious.
*   **Act IV — Dead Men Tell No Tales (Sessions 25-30):** An ancient curse returns—the crew of the Silent Mary, Spanish ghost sailors hunting pirates. They seek the Trident of Poseidon to break all ocean curses. The party's final voyage requires descending to Davy Jones' Locker, facing the Triangle that devours ships, and claiming the Trident before it unmakes the supernatural seas. The age of pirates hangs in the balance.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores freedom versus order, the cost of immortality, and whether supernatural power corrupts inevitably. It asks: Is piracy's freedom worth the chaos it brings? Should humanity command gods or let them be? When does survival become cowardice? The central conflict pits the chaos of pirate freedom against the Company's brutal order, with supernatural forces treating both as equally insignificant. The party must navigate between extremes and decide what the seas should become.
