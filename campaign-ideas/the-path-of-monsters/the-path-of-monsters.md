Players are Witchers—mutant monster hunters created through dangerous alchemical trials, trained to slay creatures that terrorize humanity. They navigate a morally gray world where the real monsters often wear human faces, where destiny binds people together in unexpected ways, and where choosing the lesser evil is still choosing evil. As they hunt contracts across war-torn kingdoms, they become entangled with a Child of Destiny, ancient prophecies, and the question: are Witchers saving humanity or simply postponing its inevitable end?

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20–30 sessions)

A three-timeline epic about destiny, monsters, and found family.

*   **Timeline One: The Last Wish (Sessions 1–10):** The players take contracts as Witchers, hunting monsters and navigating human politics. They encounter Yennefer, a powerful sorceress seeking to cure her infertility, and invoke the Law of Surprise to save a merchant—unknowingly binding themselves to a Child of Destiny. They hunt a djinn, fight a striga, and discover that monsters are often more honest than men.
*   **Timeline Two: The Convergence (Sessions 11–20):** Years pass. The players claim their Child of Surprise—Ciri, a young princess with mysterious powers. They must train and protect her as kingdoms fall to war and invasion. Meanwhile, Yennefer searches for Ciri for her own purposes. The Wild Hunt—spectral elven riders who hunt across dimensions—begins pursuing Ciri for her Elder Blood.
*   **Timeline Three: The Wild Hunt (Sessions 21–30):** The timelines converge. Ciri's powers awaken fully—she can travel between worlds and through time. The Wild Hunt seeks to use her to prevent the White Frost, an apocalyptic ice age that will consume all worlds. Players must protect Ciri, confront destiny, and decide: sacrifice her to save the world, or find another way?

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Monster Contract"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / World Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players are Witchers at a roadside tavern. They're feared and needed in equal measure—mutant freaks who kill monsters for coin.
    *   They take a contract to hunt a beast terrorizing a village, discovering it's a cursed princess transformed into a striga.
    *   They must choose: kill the monster, or attempt the dangerous ritual to break the curse and save the person within.
**Escalation:** Breaking the curse succeeds but creates political complications—the king now owes them, and obligations are dangerous.

### Sessions 2-10 — "Destiny's Price"
*   **Focus:** Contracts / World Exploration / Relationships
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players take various contracts: drowners in a lake, a possessed house, a werewolf that was once human.
    *   They meet Yennefer, who magically binds a player Witcher to her wish, creating a complicated relationship.
    *   They save a merchant and invoke the Law of Surprise—"Give me that which you possess but do not know." The merchant's wife is pregnant.
    *   They hunt a djinn whose magic has catastrophic consequences for anyone who tries to use it.
**Escalation:** Years later, they must claim their Child of Surprise—a young girl named Ciri whose kingdom has fallen to war.

### Sessions 11-20 — "The Child of Destiny"
*   **Focus:** Protecting Ciri / War / Politics
*   **Key Events:**

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores moral ambiguity, destiny versus choice, and what makes someone a monster. The central question: "Is choosing the lesser evil still choosing evil, or is it the only choice humans have?" Players must navigate a world where monsters are honest in their nature but humans hide their monstrosity behind laws and morals. Destiny binds people together—Witchers to their Children of Surprise, lovers to their fates—but can they forge their own paths or only postpone the inevitable?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Witcher Mutations and Signs**
*   Witchers have enhanced abilities from alchemical mutations: enhanced senses, immunity to disease, slow aging, cat eyes.
*   They cast simple spells called Signs (Igni/fire, Quen/shield, Aard/force push, Yrden/trap, Axii/mind control).
*   They use alchemical potions that would kill normal humans but grant Witchers temporary powers at a cost (toxicity).

### 2. **Monster Contracts** (Investigation and Hunting)
*   Each monster hunt is a mini mystery: investigate, gather clues, identify the monster, prepare specifically for it.
*   Different monsters require different tactics, oils, bombs, and Signs.
*   Research is crucial—a bestiary provides clues, but fieldwork reveals specifics.

### 3. **The Law of Surprise**
*   An ancient tradition where saving someone's life grants you "that which they possess but do not know."
*   This often means an unborn child, creating a Child of Destiny bond.
*   Violating this law brings supernatural consequences—destiny enforces itself.

### 4. **Lesser Evil Choices**
*   Moral choices are never between good and evil, but between bad and worse.
*   Staying neutral is rarely possible—inaction is a choice with consequences.
*   NPCs remember choices and react accordingly. There are no perfect outcomes.

### 5. **Multiple Timelines** (Narrative Structure)
*   The campaign can use non-linear storytelling—flashbacks, time skips, convergent timelines.
*   Events from "past" sessions influence "present" sessions in unexpected ways.
*   Ciri's time/space powers can create alternate timelines and parallel worlds.
