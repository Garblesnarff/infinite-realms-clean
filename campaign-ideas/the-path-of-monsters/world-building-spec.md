### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Path of Monsters**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Players are Witchers—mutant monster hunters created through dangerous trials, trained to slay creatures that terrorize humanity. They navigate a morally gray world where monsters are honest in their nature but humans hide their monstrosity. Bound by destiny through the Law of Surprise, they become guardians of Ciri, a Child of Destiny whose powers can save or doom all worlds. As the Wild Hunt pursues her and kingdoms fall to war, players must choose: sacrifice her for the greater good or find another way.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the creation of Witchers through the Trial of the Grasses—an alchemical mutation process that kills most candidates but grants survivors enhanced abilities.
    *   Explain the Conjunction of the Spheres—a cataclysm that merged multiple realities, bringing monsters and magic to the world.
    *   Describe the Elder Blood—an ancient elven genetic trait granting Ciri the power to travel between worlds and through time.
    *   Write the history of the Law of Surprise and how destiny enforces these magical contracts.
    *   Detail the Wild Hunt's origins—elven warriors from a dying frozen world, seeking Ciri to prevent the White Frost apocalypse.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Witchers of Kaer Morhen** (Minor, Dying)
        *   **Goals:** Hunt monsters; survive in a world that fears and needs them; train and protect Ciri.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Few remain—Vesemir (oldest), other surviving Witchers, no new mutations performed.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Kill monsters for coin.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They are the last of their kind. No more Witchers can be created. They protect Ciri as their final purpose.
        *   **Assets:** Witcher mutations, combat training, Signs, alchemical knowledge, Kaer Morhen fortress.
        *   **Relationships:** Feared and despised by humans; neutral in politics; bound to Ciri by destiny and choice.

        *   **Hierarchy:** Emperor Emhyr, generals, mages, vast armies.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Bring civilization and order to the barbaric North.

        *   **Assets:** Largest military, mage support, superior organization, political cunning.
        *   **Relationships:** At war with Northern Kingdoms; hunting Ciri; see Witchers as tools to be used.

        *   **Public Agenda:** Advise rulers and maintain magical knowledge.

    *   **The Wild Hunt** (Major, Existential Threat)
        *   **Goals:** Capture Ciri; use her Elder Blood to stop the White Frost; save their dying world.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Eredin (leader), elven warriors, hounds, spectral manifestations.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they appear as death itself.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They are not evil but desperate—their entire world is freezing to death.
        *   **Assets:** Ability to travel between worlds, spectral nature makes them hard to kill, magical powers, relentless pursuit.
        *   **Relationships:** Enemies of all—humans, elves, monsters. They want only Ciri.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Kaer Morhen:** The ancient Witcher fortress in the mountains, now ruined but still a refuge.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The courtyard where Ciri trains, the laboratory where mutations were performed, the library, the great hall, the defensive walls.

        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Witcher training, alchemy, safe haven, research into monsters and magic.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Training session goes wrong, monster attacks the fortress, Wild Hunt scouts appear, flashback to the Trial of Grasses, Ciri's powers manifest uncontrollably.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "No more Witchers can be created—the knowledge died with the mages who perfected it." "Ciri's Elder Blood is the key to everything." "The Wild Hunt will eventually find this place."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Ruined stone walls, snow-covered mountains, Witcher training equipment, ancient medallions), Sound (Sword practice, howling mountain wind, silence of abandonment), Smell (Old stone, leather, alchemical reagents).
    *   **A Monster Contract Site (Swamp):** A typical location for a Witcher contract—investigating and hunting a monster.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Abandoned village, murky water, submerged ruins, monster nest/lair, shrines to forgotten gods.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The monster (drowners, water hag, etc.), ghosts of victims, desperate survivors.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** The contract reward (if successful), monster parts for alchemy, information from survivors.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Monster attacks, discover victim's body with clues, encounter other hunters (rivals or bandits), magical phenomenon, villagers offering misleading information.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The monster was once human, cursed by a mage." "There's more than one monster here." "The village elder knows more than they're telling."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Murky water, hanging moss, fog, distant lights from ignis fatui), Sound (Croaking, splashing, distant screams or laughter), Smell (Rot, stagnant water, death).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Players invoke the Law of Surprise.
    *   **THEN:** They become bound to a Child of Destiny. Destiny will enforce this bond through increasingly improbable events until they meet their Surprise.
    *   **IF:** Players train Ciri in Witcher skills.
    *   **THEN:** She grows more capable but also more reckless. Her powers become stronger but harder to control. She sees herself as a Witcher, not a princess.
    *   **IF:** The Wild Hunt finds Ciri's location.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a terrifying encounter. Players may fight (nearly impossible) or flee. The location is no longer safe. Someone may die protecting her.
    *   **IF:** Players choose the "lesser evil" in a moral dilemma.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences showing there was no good choice—innocents suffer regardless, but in different ways depending on the choice made.
    *   **IF:** Ciri's Elder Blood powers fully awaken.
    *   **THEN:** She can travel between worlds and through time, but risks losing herself in the power. She becomes a target for everyone—the Wild Hunt, Nilfgaard, the Lodge.
    *   **IF:** Players confront the Wild Hunt's leader Eredin.
    *   **THEN:** He reveals his world is dying. His cause is sympathetic even if his methods are monstrous. Players must choose: help him condemn Ciri, or fight him to protect her.
    *   **IF:** The campaign concludes.
    *   **THEN:** Multiple endings based on choices: Ciri sacrifices herself to stop the White Frost (tragic), Ciri becomes Empress (political), Ciri becomes a Witcher (found family), or Ciri is lost between worlds (bittersweet).
