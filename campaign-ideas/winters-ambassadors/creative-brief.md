# Creative Brief: Winter's Ambassadors

## Art Style: Sparse Nordic Minimalism (Scandinavian Folk Art meets Sci-Fi)

Minimalist compositions emphasizing ice, stone, and cultural warmth amid environmental harshness. Muted colors, clean lines, focus on character interaction.

### Core Principles:
*   **Environmental Harshness:** Endless ice, blizzards, stone architecture against white wilderness.
*   **Cultural Warmth:** Interior scenes show hearth fires, communal spaces, intricate cultural details.
*   **Gender Fluidity:** Character designs avoid Earth gender markers, emphasize alien beauty and ambiguity.

### Color Palette:
*   **Winter Landscapes:** Whites, grays, ice blues, with rare warm browns of stone buildings.
*   **Interior Scenes:** Warm oranges from fires, rich browns of wood, deep blues of traditional clothing.

## Voice

A calm, measured voice with slight Scandinavian accent, thoughtful and introspective. Pacing is slow and deliberate, suggesting patience and cultural sensitivity. Role: An ambassador recounting their mission, a Gethenian elder sharing history.
