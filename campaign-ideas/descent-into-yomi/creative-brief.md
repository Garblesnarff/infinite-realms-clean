# Creative Brief: Descent into Yomi

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Japanese Horror & Decay

Inspired by Japanese horror films (Ringu, Ju-On), classical Heian period aesthetics corrupted by rot, and the visual language of pollution (kegare) in Shinto tradition. The style combines elegant Japanese design with horrific decay - beautiful robes rotting off bodies, elegant architecture crumbling with moss and maggots, darkness that swallows everything. Colors are desaturated, dominated by blacks, grays, sickly greens, and the absence of color itself.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Elegant Decay:** Beautiful Japanese aesthetics (kimono, architecture, nature) corrupted by rot, creating tragic horror.
*   **Absolute Darkness:** Most scenes are barely lit. Darkness is tangible, oppressive, and dangerous.
*   **Organic Horror:** Decay is natural, inevitable. Bodies rot in realistic, tragic ways. Not gore for shock - horror from inevitability.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dark, decaying, polluted, desperate, tragic, claustrophobic, humid, hopeless, corrupted, lonely.
*   **Feeling:** Suffocating darkness, slow inevitable decay, tragic beauty ruined, desperate survival, the horror of watching yourself rot, ancient loneliness, pollution that clings to everything.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Mix of elegant Japanese traditional art with horror elements. Clean lines for architecture and clothing, decaying into organic corruption.
*   **Textures:** Rot, mold, maggots, wet stone, decaying fabric, bones emerging from flesh, darkness as physical texture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Japanese underworld horror illustration showing elegant decay. Traditional kimono rotting off a figure, beautiful architecture crumbling with moss and mold, darkness swallowing edges of the scene..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Severely desaturated. Black dominates. Sickly greens and grays. Rare spots of color (peach blossoms, a small light) stand out dramatically.
*   **Accent Colors:** The pale light of the Messenger, sickly bioluminescent rot, the impossible beauty of peach blossoms in darkness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an almost monochromatic color palette dominated by blacks, dark grays, and sickly greens. Heavily desaturated, creating oppressive atmosphere. The only bright spot is the faint glow of a small light-spirit, emphasizing surrounding darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters in various stages of decay. Beautiful traditional Japanese clothing rotting. Izanami is horrifically tragic - elegant corpse-queen. Yomotsu-shikome are nightmare hags.
*   **Clothing:** Traditional Japanese garments (kimono, hakama) in states of decay. Once beautiful, now rotting. The decay should feel sad more than grotesque.
*   **Expression:** Desperation, resignation, grief, the slow loss of humanity. Izanami's face shows loneliness beneath horror.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A figure in traditional Japanese kimono showing advanced decay - pale, rotting flesh visible through tears in once-beautiful fabric. Eyes still show humanity and desperation. Standing in absolute darkness with only faint light. Tragic and horrific simultaneously."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Darkness is the primary environment. What little is visible shows Japanese architecture (Heian period influenced) crumbling with decay. Organic corruption everywhere.
*   **Atmosphere:** Oppressively dark, humid, claustrophobic despite vast spaces. The darkness feels alive and malevolent.
*   **Details:** Moss, mold, maggots, rot, bones, collapsed beauty. Everything beautiful is ruined. The corruption feels natural, inevitable.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The interior of Yomi - ancient Japanese palace halls crumbling into darkness. Elegant columns covered in moss and mold, beautiful screens rotting. Maggots arranged in elegant patterns. Absolutely dark except for a small circle of light revealing the horror. Humid, suffocating atmosphere."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Extreme contrast - small points of light surrounded by absolute darkness. Most scenes are barely visible. Darkness has weight and texture.
*   **Light Sources:** The Messenger spirit (pale, dying light), purifying peaches (soft glow), Izanami's presence (sickly luminescence), rare torches (desperate, flickering).
*   **Shadows:** Darkness isn't just shadow - it's absolute, swallowing everything. What emerges from darkness is horrifying.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...extreme contrast lighting with a tiny point of pale light in overwhelming darkness. The darkness is textured, tangible, oppressive. What little is illuminated shows decay and horror. Most of the frame is black."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Darkness dominates composition. Use negative space aggressively. What's hidden in darkness is scarier than what's shown. Japanese horror framing.
*   **Techniques:** Frame within darkness, show partial figures emerging, use the edge of light to create tension, suggest rather than show horror.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition dominated by black negative space. In a small circle of pale light, a figure reaches desperately upward toward an exit barely visible above. Darkness presses in from all sides. Suggestion of other figures in the darkness beyond the light. Claustrophobic, vertical composition emphasizing the desperate climb from darkness."

## Voice

A hushed, intimate voice like someone whispering in darkness, afraid to attract attention. The narrator speaks with resignation and suppressed desperation. Pronunciation includes authentic Japanese terms and deity names. The tone is tragic horror - mourning what's being lost. Emotional range includes quiet desperation, grief, resignation, brief moments of hope that make the darkness worse by contrast, and the loneliness of eternal decay. The voice carries the weight of inevitable corruption. Audio has slight distortion, as if the speaker is slowly losing coherence. Role: A fellow soul in Yomi, further decayed than the players, warning them about what's coming while mourning what's already lost.

## Music Direction

Minimal, ambient horror with traditional Japanese instruments used sparingly and wrong. The absence of music is important - silence and ambient sound dominate. When music appears, use koto played dissonantly, shakuhachi flute with wrong notes suggesting corruption, broken shamisen strings, taiko drums that sound like heartbeats stopping. The peach grove has impossible beauty - brief traditional melody that makes the surrounding silence worse. Izanami's theme should be tragic and beautiful corrupted - perhaps a distorted lullaby. Most scenes have only ambient sound and breathing. The score should make players uncomfortable through absence and distortion. Reference: Silent Hill soundtracks, Japanese horror film scores, traditional gagaku court music corrupted, the sound of decay.

## Sound Design

Darkness made audible. The primary soundscape is organic horror: dripping water, wet footsteps, the soft sound of flesh decaying, maggots moving, bones grinding, distant weeping. Breathing (yours and others') becomes loud in silence. The yomotsu-shikome make wet dragging sounds. Izanami's approach is marked by increasing silence - sound dying around her. The pollution sounds like humidity given audio - thick, clinging, wrong. Rare light sources hum faintly. The darkness itself has sound - a low frequency hum that's felt more than heard. No sudden loud noises - horror is quiet, inevitable, coming slowly. The environment should sound alive, wet, corrupt. Players should be able to navigate by sound in darkness. Every footstep, every breath, every drip tells them where they are and what's near.
