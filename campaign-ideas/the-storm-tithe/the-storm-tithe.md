# The Storm Tithe
**Every Storm Demands Its Price**

## Campaign Overview

The storm gods have awakened—or rather, humanity finally noticed they were always there. Across the world, massive weather systems have begun demanding tribute. Pay the tithe, and your lands receive gentle rains and fair winds. Refuse, and face hurricanes, droughts, and divine wrath. Nations must now negotiate with thunder, bargain with blizzards, and sacrifice to storm systems that remember every slight and broken promise.

The party begins in the Tithed Lands—a confederation of city-states that have accepted storm sovereignty. Here, weather priests interpret the will of their local storm gods: The Monsoon Empress, The Hurricane King, The Blizzard Council. Each demands different payment: crops, art, labor, stories, emotions, or lives. The system works, barely—until a revolutionary movement called the Storm Breakers begins assassinating weather priests and attacking storm shrines, declaring that humanity should be free from meteorological tyranny.

Caught between those who worship storms as rightful rulers and those who seek independence at any cost, the party must navigate theocratic politics, actual divine beings made of wind and rain, and the fundamental question: Is it slavery to pay tribute to nature, or is it simply the cost of civilization? And what happens when you learn the storms aren't demanding tribute for greed—they need it to survive a greater threat that hungers for them?

## Core Themes

- **The Price of Safety**: Trading freedom for security
- **Worship vs. Appeasement**: Religion or protection racket?
- **Revolutionary Violence vs. Imperfect Peace**: Is rebellion worth the cost?
- **Nature's Rights**: Do weather systems deserve tribute if conscious?
- **Power and Dependency**: Who really controls whom?
- **Hidden Threats**: Sometimes the obvious tyrant protects from worse

## Session Breakdown (28-Session Campaign)

### Arc 1: The Tithed Lands (Sessions 1-7)

**Sessions 1-2**: Party arrives in Port Monsoon during the Seasonal Offering—massive festival where the city presents tribute to the Monsoon Empress. Witness the spectacle: Offerings thrown into sacred storm, priestess channeling the Empress's will, weather changing to show approval. Afterward, perfect growing rains. Is this divine blessing or Stockholm syndrome?

**Sessions 3-4**: Recruited to investigate attacks on weather shrines by Storm Breakers. Meet revolutionaries with compelling arguments: Humanity shouldn't have to pay protection money to weather. Also meet victims of storms that didn't receive adequate tribute: entire villages destroyed. Both sides have points.

**Sessions 5-6**: Diplomatic mission to the Hurricane King's domain—ocean city built to withstand his fury. Negotiate on behalf of smaller community that can't afford his demands. Experience storm god negotiation: The Hurricane King communicates through pressure changes and wave patterns. Demands are steep but negotiable. He's vain, proud, and cares about his reputation.

**Session 7**: The Storm Breakers succeed in assassinating a high priestess. Her storm god— The Gentle Rain—goes berserk without guidance, flooding valley and killing thousands. Revolutionary action causes exactly what they claimed to prevent. Party must deal with consequence: Calm the storm, stop the Breakers, or question everything.

### Arc 2: The Revolution (Sessions 8-15)

**Sessions 8-9**: Infiltrate Storm Breaker movement to understand their goals. Meet charismatic leader who lost everything to a storm's wrath when tribute was late. Their plan: Use ancient weather control technology to destroy storm consciousness. Technology exists in vaults from pre-storm era when humanity controlled weather.

**Sessions 10-11**: The Blizzard Council (three winter storms ruling polar regions) sends envoy demanding party appear before them. Trial for interfering in storm affairs. Navigate alien justice system where laws are based on wind patterns and precedent spans centuries. Learn that storms remember every human interaction going back generations.

**Sessions 12-13**: Quest for the Weather Vaults—pre-storm military installations containing climate control weapons. Discover truth: Humanity used to control weather completely. Storms awakened in response to climate manipulation. The "tithe" system was a peace treaty after devastating Weather Wars. The revolution wants to restart the war.

**Sessions 14-15**: The Storm Breakers activate ancient weather control network. Succeed in killing a minor storm god—The Spring Squall. All nearby storms go into mourning rage. Weather becomes chaotic and vengeful. Party must choose: Help Breakers continue (freedom through force), help storms defend themselves (accept tithe system), or find third way.

### Arc 3: The Greater Threat (Sessions 16-22)

**Sessions 16-17**: The Monsoon Empress does something unprecedented: She asks for help. Shows the party why storms really demand tribute—they're not hoarding it, they're using it as defense. Something is consuming storms from the edge of reality: The Calm, an anti-weather entity that creates zones of perfect stillness where no wind blows, no rain falls, no change occurs. Absolute meteorological death.

**Sessions 18-19**: Journey to the Still Zones—regions where The Calm has consumed local weather. Horrifying: Crops don't grow (no rain), temperatures become extreme (no regulating winds), sky is unchanging gray. Local populations dying. The Calm slowly spreading, consuming storm gods one by one. The tithe-energy was being used to fight it.

**Sessions 20-21**: Alliance mission—convince Storm Breakers and storm gods to cooperate against true threat. Navigate delicate politics: Storms must admit they concealed the danger, Breakers must accept they weakened defenses at worst time. Broker deal where humans help fight The Calm in exchange for renegotiated tribute terms.

**Session 22**: The Calm achieves consciousness, speaks through zones of silence. Its message: Change causes suffering. Stability is peace. It offers humanity a deal—eliminate all storms, live in perfect unchanging weather. Eternal spring, no disasters, no chaos. Also: No growth, no adaptation, slow stagnation. The ultimate temptation to "solve" the storm problem.

### Arc 4: The Weather War (Sessions 23-28)

**Sessions 23-24**: Build coalition of storms and humans. Each storm god must contribute power, each human nation contribute troops/resources. Create magical/technological hybrid weapons that humans can wield to fight The Calm. Train in storm-bonded combat—humans carrying piece of storm's consciousness, becoming temporary weather-warriors.

**Sessions 25-26**: Battle at the Still Front—where The Calm's expansion meets storm territory. Epic combat against silence itself. The Calm manifests as: Zones of anti-weather, creatures of stillness, absence given form. Storms can't enter Calm zones without dissipating. Humans must be the ground troops.

**Session 27**: The Calm's offer still stands—it reveals it's not evil, it's the absence of conflict. Was created by humanity's longing for peace, predictability, safety. It genuinely believes eliminating change helps humans. Final choice: Defeat The Calm (accept weather chaos and storms), Accept The Calm (stable weather but no growth), or Merge (create balance between change and stability).

**Session 28**: Resolution and new world order. If Calm defeated: New Tithe Accord with fair terms. If Calm accepted: Eternal unchanging weather, party watches long-term consequences. If merged: Storms become less violent, weather more predictable, but still alive and conscious. Show years-later epilogue of the choice's impact.

5. **Storm Ascension**: Humanity and storms merge into hybrid civilization

## Campaign Notes

This campaign explores relationships with nature as conscious, demanding entity. Is it tyranny if weather gods are real and need tribute to protect you? The tithe system is imperfect but functional until revolutionaries threaten it—then players learn why it existed.

Best with players who enjoy political intrigue, moral ambiguity, and negotiation over pure combat. Storms are alien but not evil, revolutionaries are sympathetic but wrong. No clean answers.

Weather should feel alive: Describe storms reacting, having moods, remembering. Make tribute-giving ritualistic and meaningful. Show both benefits (good weather) and costs (sacrificed resources, freedom).
