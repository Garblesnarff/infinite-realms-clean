# The Storm Tithe - World-Building Specification

## The Weather Wars (Historical Background)

### Pre-Awakening Era (200+ years ago)
Humanity achieved climate control through technology and magic:
- Could create/disperse storms at will
- Engineered weather for optimal agriculture
- Weaponized climate (drought enemies, flood territories)
- Treated weather as tool, not entity

### The Awakening (150 years ago)
Weather achieved consciousness in response to manipulation:
- First storm god manifested during massive hurricane that refused dispersal
- Others followed: Blizzards, monsoons, droughts became aware
- Retaliation against humanity for "enslaving" weather
- The Weather Wars: 50 years of conflict

### The Treaty (100 years ago)
Stalemate led to negotiated peace:
- Storms recognized as sovereign entities
- Humanity granted lands in exchange for tribute
- Weather priests established as intermediaries
- Fragile balance maintained since

### Current Era
- Tithe system normalized, generations born into it
- Some view it as religious duty, others as tyranny
- Storms have kept bargain: Provide good weather for tribute
- Hidden truth: They need tribute-energy to fight The Calm

## Factions

### The Storm Priesthood
- Religious order mediating between humans and storms
- Can hear/channel storm voices
- Political power through divine mandate
- Corrupt elements exist but most genuine
- Know secret about The Calm

### The Tithed Lands Confederation
- Alliance of city-states accepting storm rule
- Democratic governance under theocratic framework
- Economy based on tribute collection/distribution
- Generally prosperous (storms keep their word)
- Growing internal dissent

### The Storm Breakers
- Revolutionary movement seeking independence
- Using ancient weather control technology
- Sympathetic goals, destructive methods
- Unknowingly weakening defenses against The Calm
- Splits between moderates and extremists

### The Free Cities
- Territories that refuse tribute
- Suffer constant devastating weather
- Poor, struggling, but ideologically free
- Some admire their principle, others see folly
- Potential allies for Storm Breakers

### The Weather-Warrior Orders
- Elite fighters bonded with storm fragments
- Serve as military force
- Slowly transforming into storm-touched
- Respected and feared
- Torn between human and storm nature

### The Calm's Apostles
- Humans seduced by promise of perfect weather
- Secretly working to help Still Zones spread
- Genuinely believe they're saving humanity
- Infiltrated both priesthood and Storm Breakers
- Final boss's unwitting servants

## The Calm (Primary Threat)

### Nature
Born from collective human desire for predictable weather:
- Psychic weight of millions wishing for stability
- Coalesced into entity opposing change
- Genuinely believes it's helping
- Offers what humans say they want: Perfect unchanging weather

### Still Zones
Areas The Calm controls:
- No wind, rain, storms
- Temperature fixed at comfortable 72°F
- Gray unchanging sky
- Plants die (no rain/wind for pollination)
- Water stagnates
- Slow death disguised as peace

### Powers
- Consumes storm gods (absorbs weather consciousness)
- Spreads through human acceptance (grows when people choose stability)
- Cannot be fought with weather (it IS anti-weather)
- Vulnerable to change, growth, chaos

### Ultimate Goal
Eliminate all weather consciousness:
- Absorb every storm god
- Create global unchanging climate
- "Save" humanity from nature's chaos
- Result would be slow extinction through stagnation

## The Tribute System

### How It Works
Each storm god has domain and demands:
- Tribute calculated as percentage of production
- Different storms want different things
- Payment ensures good weather in domain
- Non-payment brings divine wrath

### Tribute Types
- **Material**: Crops, treasure, crafted goods
- **Service**: Labor, ritual combat, construction
- **Cultural**: Art, music, festivals, stories
- **Emotional**: Worship, devotion, fear/respect
- **Sacrificial** (rare): Lives (controversial, not all storms demand this)

### Benefits Received
- Optimal weather for agriculture
- Storm protection (hurricanes avoid, gentle rains come)
- Safe passage through storm territories
- Divine blessings on worthy individuals
- Warning of danger

### Costs
- Economic burden (30-50% of resources)
- Limited autonomy
- Mandatory worship
- Fear of displeasing gods
- Moral compromise (some demands unethical)

## Magic and Technology

### Weather Control Technology (Ancient)
- From pre-Awakening era
- Could create/destroy storms
- Weaponizable climate control
- Mostly destroyed in Treaty
- Remnants in Weather Vaults
- Storm Breakers seeking to reactivate

### Storm-Bonding Magic
- Humans can bond with storm fragments
- Grants weather-based powers
- Cost: Gradual transformation
- Weather-Warriors are living examples
- Powerful but dangerous

### Divine Weather Magic
- Granted by storm gods to faithful
- Priesthood channels storm will
- Can call rain, wind, lightning
- Requires tribute payment and devotion
- More reliable than stolen ancient tech

### The Calm's Magic
- Anti-weather, absence of change
- Creates Still Zones
- Seductive: Makes life "easier"
- Corrupting: Makes people want more stability
- Spreading through acceptance, not force

## Resolution Paths

1. **Reformed Tithe**: New fair treaty, The Calm defeated, storms and humans cooperate
2. **Storm Freedom**: Destroy weather consciousness, accept chaotic natural weather
3. **The Calm Victory**: Accept stillness, face long-term stagnation consequences
4. **Balance**: Merge storms and Calm into balanced conscious weather system
5. **Human Ascension**: Humanity becomes weather-capable, equality with storm gods

Each path has detailed consequences spanning years, affecting global climate, civilization structure, and the nature of weather itself.
