# The Stuffing Within - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Style**: Soft-focus children's book meets psychological horror
- **Colors**: Pastel nursery colors corrupted by shadow
- **Lighting**: Nightlight glow, creeping darkness
- **Dream Sequences**: Surreal, illogical, emotionally true

## Character Design
- Classic stuffed animal designs (teddy bears, bunnies, etc.)
- Visible wear showing age and love
- Dream-crystals visible inside when damaged (glowing memory shards)
- Corruption shown as darkness spreading through stuffing
- Different filling materials (cotton, polyester, beans) = different properties

## Environment
- **Nursery**: Warm, safe, but shadows creeping
- **Dreamscape**: Constantly shifting, impossible geometry
- **Memory Lane**: Sepia-toned past, nostalgic and sad
- **Nightmare Realm**: Dark, terrifying, child's worst fears made real

## Music Direction
- Lullabies and music box melodies (comfort theme)
- Distorted versions during nightmares
- Heartbeat bass (child sleeping)
- Crystalline chimes (dream-crystals)
- Horror strings during nightmare attacks

## Voice Acting
- **Old Bear**: Grandmotherly/grandfatherly, wise, tired
- **Hoppy**: Young, energetic, innocent
- **Rex**: Gruff protector, soft heart
- **Nightmare King**: Multiple voices (all fears at once)
- **Luna**: Baby sounds, innocence incarnate

## Marketing Tagline
"Guardians don't just watch over children. They absorb their nightmares."
