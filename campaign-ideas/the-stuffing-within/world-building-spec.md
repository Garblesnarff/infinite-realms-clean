# The Stuffing Within - World Building Specification

## Dream Crystal System

**Formation**: When child loves stuffed animal, their dreams crystallize inside stuffing
**Properties**: Crystals grant powers based on dream content
- Happy dreams: Healing, protection, light
- Sad dreams: Empathy, understanding, connection
- Nightmares: Dark powers, corruption risk

**Absorption**: Stuffed animals can intentionally absorb child's dreams/nightmares
**Cost**: Too many nightmares corrupt stuffing, turning guardian into nightmare

## The Nightmare King

**Origin**: Manifestation of grandmother's unresolved trauma
**Form**: Shifting horror, taking shape of deepest fears
**Goal**: Consume all dreams, leaving only darkness
**Weakness**: Love, acceptance, processing trauma

**Connection**: Lives in Old Bear's oldest crystals, spreading through generations

## Dreamscape Navigation

**Entry**: Must be touching sleeping child
**Appearance**: Child's imagination made manifest
**Rules**: Dream logic (nonsensical but emotionally consistent)
**Danger**: Can get lost, forget who you are, become part of dream
**Exit**: Wake child (dangerous) or wait for natural wake

## Stuffing Types

**Cotton**: Traditional, good dream absorption, natural
**Polyester**: Modern, resists nightmares better, less capacity
**Bean-filled**: Grounding, hard to corrupt, limited powers
**Mixed**: Hybrid properties, unstable
**Ancient**: Old Bear's original horsehair stuffing, irreplaceable

## Damage = Memory Loss

When stuffed animal takes damage:
- Stuffing literally falls out
- With it, absorbed dreams/memories
- Too much damage = identity loss
- Can be restuffed but memories are gone forever

## Guardian's Oath

Unspoken code among stuffed animals:
1. Protect child's sleep
2. Absorb nightmares when needed
3. Never let child know you're alive (preserve magic)
4. Support fellow guardians
5. Pass wisdom to new toys

## Luna's Development

**Current**: Infant, pure imagination, no defenses
**Danger**: Nightmares can overwhelm her
**Potential**: Learning to self-soothe is healthiest path
**Timeline**: Players have until she's 2 (developmental milestone)

## Generational Trauma Thread

**Grandmother**: Had terrible childhood, never processed
**Mother**: Inherited anxiety, passed unconsciously to Luna
**Luna**: Third generation receiving trauma
**Old Bear**: Contains all three generations' memories
**Solution**: Heal at source (grandmother's memories) to break cycle

## Victory Paths

**Combat**: Defeat Nightmare King directly (violent, may recur)
**Healing**: Process grandmother's trauma, dissolve King peacefully
**Growth**: Teach Luna self-soothing, she defeats her own nightmares
**Sacrifice**: Absorb all nightmares into one stuffed animal, exile them

## Corruption Stages

1. **Clean**: Pure stuffing, no nightmares
2. **Tainted**: Dark spots in stuffing, minor corruption
3. **Compromised**: Half-dark, losing self, powers unstable
4. **Consumed**: Mostly nightmare, becoming enemy
5. **Fallen**: Full nightmare, must be defeated/saved
