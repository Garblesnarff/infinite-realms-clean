# The Stuffing Within
## "What's inside defines us more than what's outside."

### Campaign Overview
In the nursery of infant Luna, stuffed animals serve as silent guardians, protectors, and companions. But the players discover they're more than toys—they're vessels for something ancient. Each stuffed animal contains not just cotton or polyester filling, but crystallized dreams, absorbed from the children who love them. These dream-crystals grant powers but also carry memories, hopes, and nightmares of past owners.

When Luna begins having terrible nightmares that manifest as physical shadow-creatures, the stuffed animals realize the dream-realm is bleeding into reality. Led by Old Bear (Luna's grandmother's teddy, containing 60 years of absorbed dreams), they must enter Luna's dreamscape to fight the Nightmare King—a manifestation of inherited trauma, generational fears, and the dark side of imagination. But dream-diving is dangerous: stuffed animals risk losing themselves in the dreams they've absorbed, becoming the children they once comforted instead of the guardians they are.

The campaign explores found family, the weight of carrying others' burdens, inherited trauma, and whether protecting someone means fighting their battles or teaching them to fight their own. As nightmares grow stronger, players must decide: absorb Luna's nightmares to protect her (becoming corrupted), teach her to face fears herself (risky for infant), or find the source of generational trauma in grandmother's memories within Old Bear.
