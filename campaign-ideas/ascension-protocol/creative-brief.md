# Ascension Protocol - Creative Brief

## Visual Identity

**Aesthetic**: Free Solo cinematography meets MC Escher meets 2001: A Space Odyssey
- Vertigo-inducing cliff shots from climber POV
- Ancient glyphs glowing when activated
- Reality distortion effects during Protocol tests
- Impossible stone architecture (cliffs stacking into clouds)
- Minimalist beauty—stone, sky, human

**Colors**: Stone gray, sky blue, cloud white, ancient gold (glyphs), reality fracture (prismatic), Vertigo red

## Audio Design

**Music**: Minimal piano during climbs (building tension), silence as primary instrument, orchestral swells for completions, ambient drone for reality warping

**Sounds**: Chalk on stone, breathing (heavy with exertion), heartbeat during dangerous moves, wind howling, stone groaning, reality "tearing" sound when Protocol activates

## Voice Acting

**Elder Pitch**: Wise, regretful, elderly male, speaks slowly
**Razor Edge**: Intense, traumatized, believes he's saving humanity
**The Architect**: Layered inhuman voices, speaks in mathematical poetry
**Ghost**: Echoing, distant, helpful but disturbed
**Nova**: Young, enthusiastic, hiding deep wisdom

## Cinematics

**Opening**: Camera pans up impossible cliff sequence, climber tiny against stone, glyph activates, reality shimmer, title card

**Face Completions**: Slow-motion final move, glyph activation, reality gift granted, climber's expression of awe/fear

**The Summit**: Camera reveals what's truly at the top (DM's choice—god, machine, mirror, void, etc.)

## Tone

**Primary**: Meditative terror—extended focus punctuated by mortal fear
**Secondary**: Philosophical weight of power
**Tertiary**: Brotherhood/sisterhood of climbers

Make players feel exposure, height, the absoluteness of commitment, the beauty of perfect execution, the burden of godlike choices.
