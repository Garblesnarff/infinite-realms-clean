# Steam War Chronicles
*In the age of steam and steel, young inventors hold humanity's future*

## Campaign Overview

In an alternate 1866, the American Civil War never ended but evolved into global conflict when brilliant young inventor Ray Steam created the Steam Ball—a revolutionary compact steam engine producing unprecedented power. Nations scrambled to weaponize this technology, creating steam-powered war machines: battle dirigibles, steam knights (armored suits), fortress cities, and ultimately weapons capable of leveling civilizations.

The party consists of young inventors, engineers, pilots, and idealists caught between three factions: the O'Hara Foundation (capitalist industrialists weaponizing steam tech for profit), the Steam Union (working-class engineers seeking democratic control of technology), and the various military powers (nations trying to claim supremacy). When they discover plans for the ultimate weapon—a steam-powered doomsday device that could change Earth's atmosphere—they must choose sides and decide whether human innovation should continue unchecked or be restrained.

## Core Themes

- **Technology and Responsibility**: Should scientists police their own creations?
- **Class and Industry**: Who controls the means of production controls the future
- **War's Evolution**: Technological advancement making conflict more devastating
- **Youth vs. Age**: Young idealists versus cynical veterans
- **Progress's Price**: Innovation always has environmental and human costs

## Session Breakdown (26 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Steam Ball Incident (Sessions 1-6)
**Sessions 1-2**: Party members (young engineers/inventors) at Great London Exposition showcasing steam inventions. O'Hara Foundation unveiling Steam Castle (floating fortress). Sabotage attempt goes wrong, party caught in crossfire.

**Sessions 3-4**: Ray Steam (teenage genius) arrives with Steam Ball—father and grandfather both claim ownership. Family conflict represents larger ideological split. Party must choose: help Ray, ally with capitalists (O'Hara), or join labor movement (Steam Union).

**Sessions 5-6**: Steam Castle activates prematurely. Flying fortress attacks London. First major combat using steam knights and dirigibles. Party must board castle mid-flight and stop it. London damaged. Ray's innocence lost.

### Arc 2: The Steam Union (Sessions 7-12)
**Sessions 7-8**: Meeting David and Alfred Steam (Ray's father and grandfather). David wants pure science, Alfred wants labor control, O'Hara wants profit. Party chooses mentor or tries to bridge factions.

**Sessions 9-10**: Industrial district conflict. Steam Union workers striking against deadly conditions. O'Hara using steam police to crush protest. Party intervention determines outcome: brutal suppression, worker victory, or negotiation.

**Sessions 11-12**: Introduction to international tensions. America's Confederate Steam Navy, Prussian Dampfkrieger (steam warriors), Russian Tsar's pneumatic guards. Everyone wants Steam Ball technology. Arms race accelerating toward war.

### Arc 3: The Manchester Conspiracy (Sessions 13-18)
**Sessions 13-14**: Industrial city of Manchester revealed as testing ground for militarized steam tech. Entire population breathing toxic fumes. Children working in hellish foundries. Environmental catastrophe for profit.

**Sessions 15-16**: Discovery that O'Hara Foundation planning to sell Steam Ball replication to all sides, ensuring perpetual conflict and weapon sales. War profiteering scheme. Party must decide: expose them (crashes economy), steal evidence, or join for power.

**Sessions 17-18**: Assassination attempts on Ray and party. Hired by competitors or O'Hara covering tracks. Steam knight duels through London streets. Dirigible chase sequences. Someone dies (NPC or party member).

### Arc 4: The American Theater (Sessions 19-22)
**Sessions 19-20**: Journey to America (by airship or submarine). Civil War evolved into technological nightmare. Both sides using steam weapons. Ironclad land-ships, steam cavalry, pneumatic artillery. Devastation beyond Europe's imagination.

**Sessions 21-22**: Meeting Confederate and Union engineers. Both sides descended into atrocity. Learning that Steam Ball technology makes total war inevitable—weapons too powerful to use responsibly. First hint of doomsday weapon development.

### Arc 5: The Atmospheric Engine (Sessions 23-26)
**Sessions 23-24**: Discovery of ultimate weapon: Atmospheric Converter. Uses Steam Ball principles to alter Earth's air composition. Could terraform planet or suffocate millions. Multiple factions racing to control it.

**Sessions 25**: Race to weapon site (Arctic fortress or deep underground). Multi-faction battle. Everyone wants it: capitalists for leverage, unions for deterrent, militaries for victory. Party must decide final allegiance.

**Session 26**: Final confrontation. Activating weapon could save or doom world. Destroying it preserves current system (unjust but survivable). Using it risks everything. Character deaths likely. Epilogue shows world transformed by choice—better, worse, or destroyed.
