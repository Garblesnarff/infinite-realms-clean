# Steam War Chronicles - World-Building Specification

## Alternate Historical Timeline

**1776-1865**: American Revolution and early industrial revolution proceed normally.

**1859**: Ray Steam's grandfather Alfred discovers revolutionary compact steam compression technique while working in Manchester mills.

**1861**: American Civil War begins but doesn't follow historical course. Both sides rapidly industrialize using emerging steam technology.

**1863**: Edward Steam (Alfred's son) perfects mathematical principles behind steam compression, creates first prototype Steam Ball.

**1865**: Ray Steam born. Raised between grandfather's workshop (labor-focused) and father's laboratory (pure research).

**1866 (Campaign Start)**: Ray creates perfected Steam Ball. Multiple factions compete for control. Civil War still raging. Victorian Britain at technological crossroads.

## The Steam Ball Technology

**What It Is**: Ultra-compact steam engine storing tremendous pressure in spherical container. Single ball = power plant in your hand.

**How It Works**:
- Multi-layered compression chamber
- Self-sustaining pressure loop
- Heat recycling preventing energy loss
- Modular—can chain multiple balls
- Safe until deliberately destabilized

**Applications**:
- Power source for anything (vehicles, weapons, cities)
- Propulsion (dirigibles, steam knights)
- Direct energy weapon (pressure release as blast)
- Environmental alteration (atmospheric engine)

**Dangers**:
- Explosion if damaged (city-leveling)
- Requires precise engineering (accidents common)
- Environmental pollution from mass production
- Arms race as nations seek parity
- Enables total war

**Replication**:
- Original blueprints in Ray's head
- Father and grandfather have incomplete versions
- O'Hara Foundation trying to reverse-engineer
- Foreign powers attempting to steal or buy

### American Theaters

**Union Territory (North)**:
- Industrial cities (Pittsburgh, Chicago, New York)
- Steam-powered industry
- Free labor but exploitation continues
- Military innovation focused

**Confederate Territory (South)**:
- Steam-powered plantations

## Environmental Consequences

### Short-Term (Visible During Campaign)
- Air pollution killing thousands
- Rivers becoming toxic
- Deforestation for coal
- Weather patterns disrupted locally
- Wildlife fleeing or dying

### Medium-Term (5-10 Years)
- Regions becoming uninhabitable
- Food crop failures
- Disease epidemics from pollution
- Acid rain
- Social collapse in worst areas

### Long-Term (Decades)
- Global climate change
- Mass extinction
- Human population decline
- Technological civilization collapse possible
- Or atmospheric engineering provides solution

## Social Classes in Steam Age

**Industrialists**: O'Hara class. Own everything. Live in luxury. Conscience optional.

**Engineers**: Middle class. Educated. Design machines. Caught between labor and capital.

**Skilled Workers**: Union core. Mechanics, metalworkers. Awareness of exploitation.

**Unskilled Labor**: Lowest class. Factory fodder. Desperate and dying.

**Aristocracy**: Declining. Old money can't compete with steam money.

**Military**: Cross-class. Officers aristocratic, enlisted workers.

**Youth**: Ray's generation. Growing up in steam age. Future in their hands.

## The American Civil War Evolution

**Historical Divergence**: 1863, steam technology proliferates.

**Union Developments**:
- Industrial north weaponizes factories
- Steam-powered ironclads (land and sea)
- Railroad artillery
- Repeating firearms (steam-actuated)

**Confederate Innovations**:
- Cotton wealth buys steam tech abroad
- Enslaved engineers forced to innovate
- Guerrilla steam weapons
- Diplomatic efforts to trade cotton for weapons

**Stalemate**: Neither can win decisively. Technology extends war indefinitely.

**International Involvement**: Europeans selling to both sides. Profit over principle.

**Cost**: Million+ dead and rising. Entire generations destroyed.

## Atmospheric Engine Details

**Function**: Uses Steam Ball principles at continental scale to alter atmospheric composition.

**Potential Uses**:

**Beneficial**:
- Remove pollution (reverse industrial damage)
- Increase oxygen (help endangered species)
- Regulate climate (prevent disasters)
- Terraform barren regions

**Harmful**:
- Weaponize (suffocate enemy nations)
- Create dependence (control weather, control world)
- Experiment (unknown consequences)
- Destroy accidentally (most likely outcome)

**Control**: Whoever activates determines settings. Irreversible for decades.

**Location**: Arctic to prevent unauthorized activation. Remote kill switch possibly exists.

## Campaign Moral Dilemmas

**Invention vs. Responsibility**: Should scientists limit discoveries?

**Progress vs. Environment**: Development versus destruction?

**Democracy vs. Efficiency**: Workers control (slow, fair) vs. corporate control (fast, unjust)?

**Youth vs. Experience**: Ray's idealism vs. Alfred's pragmatism vs. Edward's amorality?

**Individual vs. Collective**: Personal glory versus human welfare?

**Revolution vs. Reform**: Burn system down or work within it?

## Ending Scenarios Detailed

- Efficient but unjust
- Innovation continues, exploitation continues
- Stable dystopia

### Military Supremacy
- One nation claims all steam tech
- Empire rules through force
- Others reduced to vassals
- Perpetual militarized state

### Luddite Ending
- All steam technology destroyed
- Return to pre-industrial life
- Environment recovers
- Human suffering continues, just different

### Atmospheric Salvation
- Engine used to reverse pollution
- Risky but succeeds
- Technology redeems itself
- Optimistic but uncertain

### Apocalypse
- Engine malfunctions or weaponized
- Atmosphere becomes toxic
- Humanity reduced to scattered survivors
- Total failure state

### New World
- Portal to alternate Earth opens
- Humanity evacuates dying world
- Unknown future
- Escape rather than solution

## Youth Empowerment Theme

**Ray and Party**: Teenagers/young adults making world-changing decisions.

**Adult Failures**: Previous generation created mess through greed (O'Hara), ideology (Alfred), or indifference (Edward).

**Responsibility**: Youth inheriting broken world must fix it.

**Idealism**: Young characters can imagine different future. Adults cynical.

**Growth**: Campaign transforms innocent inventors into world leaders or casualties.

**Hope**: Despite darkness, youth represents possibility of change.

## Technology Ethics Framework

**Questions Campaign Raises**:
- Should some knowledge remain undiscovered?
- Who decides how inventions are used?
- Can creators control their creations?
- Is ignorance safer than knowledge?
- Does progress require suffering?
- Can technology solve problems it creates?

**No Easy Answers**: Campaign presents dilemmas without clear solutions. Party must choose and live with consequences.
