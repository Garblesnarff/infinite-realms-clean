# Steam War Chronicles - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Steamboy anime aesthetic. Hyper-detailed Victorian machinery. Gothic industrial. Emphasis on cutaway views showing complex steam mechanisms. Young protagonists in adult world. Realistic physics applied to impossible steam technology.

## Color Palettes
**Victorian London**: Brass Gold (#B5A642), Coal Black (#1C1C1C), Industrial Grey (#696969), Steam White (#F5F5F5), Thames Brown (#8B4513)
**Steam Technology**: Copper Glow (#CD7F32), Pressure Red (#DC143C), Pneumatic Blue (#00BFFF), Engine Heat (#FF4500)
**Environmental**: Smog Yellow (#DAA520), Toxic Green (#32CD32), Dead Water (#696969), Fire Orange (#FF8C00)
**Factions**: O'Hara Purple (#800080), Union Red (#DC143C), Military Blue (#000080)

## Music
Industrial symphony. Orchestral foundation with mechanical percussion—pistons, gears, steam hiss as rhythm section. Heroic brass for adventure, mournful strings for human cost. Period music (1860s) meets futuristic industrial.

**Ray's Theme**: Innocent wonder turning darker. Music box to orchestral complexity.
**Battle Theme**: Mechanical precision meets chaos. Rhythm of war machines.
**London Theme**: Victorian elegance corrupted by industry. Waltz with factory sounds.
**Revolution Theme**: Working class anthem. Powerful, hopeful, dangerous.

## Voice Direction

**Ray Steam**: Young teen (13-15), British accent, enthusiasm shifting to horror as he understands consequences. Hayao Miyazaki protagonist energy.

**Alfred Steam**: Gruff working-class elder. Scottish or Northern English accent. Passionate revolutionary who's seen too much death.

**Dr. Edward Steam**: Refined British academic. Emotionally distant. Treats science like pure math—consequences irrelevant to equations.

**Scarlett O'Hara**: American Southern belle meets ruthless CEO. Charming sociopath. Cate Blanchett's corporate villain.

**Emma Barton**: Working-class rage. Cockney or Manchester accent. Joan of Arc meets labor organizer.

## Cinematic Moments

### The Steam Ball Activation
- **Visual**: Compact sphere glowing with contained energy, pressure gauges spinning, steam venting, Ray's face reflecting light
- **Audio**: Building mechanical hum, pressure release screaming, then sudden pure power
- **Direction**: Close-up on technology, pull back to show scale, zoom to Ray's wonder/terror

### Steam Castle Takes Flight
- **Visual**: Massive Gothic fortress detaching from moorings, engines igniting, London spreading below, population scattering
- **Audio**: Hundreds of engines firing, metal groaning, crowds screaming, triumphant music turning ominous
- **Direction**: Ground perspective watching city-sized structure rise impossibly, aerial view showing scale

### Steam Knight Duel
- **Visual**: Armored suits clashing through Victorian streets, hydraulics hissing, fists leaving craters, civilians fleeing
- **Audio**: Metal on metal impacts, steam venting, pilot breathing heavily, civilian panic
- **Direction**: Fast-paced choreography showing weight and power, environmental destruction, personal cost

### Manchester Revealed
- **Visual**: Pan across industrial hellscape—child workers, toxic rivers, endless chimneys, skeletal workers
- **Audio**: Coughing, machinery grinding, no music, just industrial horror
- **Direction**: Slow tracking shot letting horror sink in, close-ups on individual suffering, pull back to show scope

### The American Wastes
- **Visual**: Battlefield littered with destroyed steam machines, scorched earth, dying soldiers, refugees
- **Audio**: Wind through wreckage, distant explosions, wounded crying, decay sounds
- **Direction**: Post-apocalyptic war zone. Show what "progress" achieves

### Dirigible Battle
- **Visual**: Airships exchanging fire at altitude, engines burning, envelopes punctured, crews struggling
- **Audio**: Wind roaring, weapons firing, ripping fabric, commands shouted, falling debris whistling
- **Direction**: Three-dimensional combat, vertigo of height, ships as naval vessels but flying

### Atmospheric Engine Activation
- **Visual**: Massive installation humming to life, sky changing color, weather patterns distorting, reality bending
- **Audio**: Fundamental hum changing world, wind patterns shifting, ecosystem dying/reviving
- **Direction**: Cosmic scale. Humanity's power to reshape planet. Terrifying and awesome

### Final Choice
- **Visual**: Split screen showing consequence paths—utopia, dystopia, apocalypse
- **Audio**: Multiple timelines' music overlapping, then silence before choice
- **Direction**: Each player gets moment to decide. Slow-motion revealing outcome

## Environmental Storytelling

**Class Division Through Air Quality**:
- Rich neighborhoods: Clean air, trees, sunshine
- Middle areas: Moderate smog, mixed
- Industrial slums: Can't see sky, constant coughing, toxic atmosphere

**Technology Progression**:
- Early campaign: Steam tech is wonder
- Mid campaign: Pollution visible, workers suffering
- Late campaign: Environmental catastrophe obvious
- Ending: Consequences of choices visible in skyline

**Faction Visual Identity**:
- **O'Hara**: Sleek, efficient, purple accents, corporate aesthetic
- **Union**: Rough, practical, red flags, improvised gear
- **Military**: Disciplined, grey/blue, standardized equipment
- **Party**: Mix reflecting their allegiances

## Special Effects Budget

### Essential Effects
- Steam venting constantly (atmosphere)
- Pressure gauges, gears, pistons (steampunk detail)
- Smog and pollution (environmental)
- Fire and explosions (combat)

### Signature Moments
- Steam Ball activation (energy core glowing)
- Castle flight (massive scale levitation)
- Steam Knight combat (mecha choreography)
- Dirigible battles (aerial naval combat)
- Atmospheric Engine (planetary-scale effect)

### Practical vs. Digital
- **Practical**: Steam effects, mechanical props, Victorian sets
- **Digital**: Flying castle, scale effects, environmental catastrophe
- **Hybrid**: Steam knights (practical suits enhanced digitally)

## Player Experience Goals

### Emotional Arc
Wonder at technology → Pride in innovation → Discomfort at costs → Horror at consequences → Determination to fix or destroy → Bittersweet resolution

### Tonal Balance
- 30% Adventure and invention excitement
- 30% Political intrigue and faction conflict
- 20% Combat (steam knights, dirigibles, warfare)
- 20% Environmental and social horror

### Age Appropriate Darkness
Party likely young (teenagers). Show war's cost without gratuitous gore. Industrial horror through implication and environmental damage.

### Engineering Joy
Let players design, build, tinker. Invention should be fun even as consequences darken. Preserve wonder of creation.
