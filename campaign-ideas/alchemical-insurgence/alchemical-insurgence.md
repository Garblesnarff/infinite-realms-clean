# Alchemical Insurgence
*The truth lies beneath the circle of transmutation*

## Campaign Overview

The Amestrian Empire stands as a beacon of alchemical achievement, where State Alchemists serve as both scholars and soldiers, wielding the power of scientific magic to maintain order and advance civilization. The party consists of State Alchemists or those connected to them, sworn to protect the nation from threats both foreign and domestic. When they're assigned to investigate a series of brutal murders targeting State Alchemists across the country, they uncover a conspiracy that shakes the very foundations of their world.

The murders are ritualistic, each victim positioned to form pieces of a massive transmutation circle spanning the entire nation. As the party digs deeper, they discover the horrifying truth: the Empire's leadership belongs to an immortal cabal of homunculi—artificial humans created through forbidden alchemy. These beings have orchestrated the nation's entire history toward a single goal: a nationwide transmutation that will sacrifice millions of souls to create a Philosopher's Stone powerful enough to open the Gate of Truth and grant them godhood.

The campaign becomes a race against time as the party navigates military politics, uncovers their nation's dark history, confronts the nature of equivalent exchange, and ultimately decides whether to save humanity or pursue their own desperate dreams of resurrection, restoration, or revenge.

## Core Themes

- **Equivalent Exchange**: Nothing gained without sacrifice, but what price is too high?
- **Truth and Deception**: The lies nations tell themselves and the cost of revelation
- **Military Ethics**: Following orders versus doing what's right
- **Loss and Redemption**: Can past mistakes be undone, or must we live with consequences?
- **Human vs. Inhuman**: What makes someone human—a soul, a body, or their choices?

## Session Breakdown (35 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Crimson Conspiracy (Sessions 1-7)
**Session 1**: Party receives orders to investigate the murder of State Alchemist Isaac McDougal. The crime scene shows signs of blood manipulation alchemy and strange markings.

**Session 2-3**: Following the trail leads to multiple murder scenes forming a pattern. Each victim died differently—water, combustion, earth entombment—suggesting multiple killers with diverse specializations.

**Session 4-5**: Investigation into the victims' pasts reveals they all participated in the Ishvalan War of Extermination, where State Alchemists slaughtered a religious minority. Survivors might be seeking revenge.

**Session 6-7**: First confrontation with Scar, an Ishvalan survivor with destructive alchemy abilities. Combat reveals his right arm is tattooed with deconstruction circles. He escapes but the party gains a sketch of his face and his list of targets.

### Arc 2: The Philosopher's Stone (Sessions 8-14)
**Session 8-9**: Orders come to hunt a mysterious figure called "The Philosopher"—a serial killer creating Philosopher's Stones using human transmutation. Investigation leads to Laboratory 5 beneath Central City.

**Session 10-11**: Laboratory 5 infiltration reveals human experimentation creating chimeras (human-animal hybrids) and testing Stone creation. The party encounters prisoners being used as raw materials. Moral choice: mercy kill them or try to save the unsavable.

**Session 12-13**: Discovery of research notes from the legendary alchemist Van Hohenheim and references to "the Dwarf in the Flask." Evidence suggests multiple immortals exist within the government.

**Session 14**: First encounter with a homunculus—Envy, a shapeshifter who orchestrated the Ishvalan War. Boss fight ends with Envy's temporary defeat, but they reveal that the party is "right on schedule" before regenerating and escaping.

### Arc 3: The Eastern Rebellion (Sessions 15-21)
**Session 15-16**: Reassigned to Fort Briggs on the northern border where General Armstrong commands. Introduction to harsh survival conditions and Armstrong's brutal efficiency. Border skirmishes with Drachma test the party's combat skills.

**Session 17-18**: Discovery of a secret tunnel network beneath Briggs connects to a nationwide underground system. Ancient alchemy suggests this is older than Amestris itself—possibly the bloodcrest transmutation circle.

**Session 19-20**: Political maneuvering in Central City as the Fuhrer hosts a summit. Party must navigate between Mustang's reformist faction, Armstrong's militant faction, and the Fuhrer's loyalists. Assassination attempt during summit reveals Bradley himself is a homunculus.

**Session 21**: The party must choose: attempt to expose Bradley (likely failing and becoming fugitives), quietly investigate further, or pretend ignorance while planning. Choice determines arc difficulty and NPC allies.

### Arc 4: Truth's Price (Sessions 22-28)
**Session 22-23**: Flashback mission showing each party member's past and what led them to alchemy. Reveal their equivalent exchanges—what they sacrificed or what they seek to restore through forbidden transmutation.

**Session 24-25**: Temptation arc. Homunculus Pride offers the party completed Philosopher's Stones that could achieve their deepest desires (restore lost loved ones, heal crippling wounds, gain ultimate power). The Stones contain screaming souls visible to those who use True Sight.

**Session 26-27**: Uneasy alliance with Scar and Ishvalan survivors. Learning their perspective on the war crimes committed in the name of peace. Introduction to Ishvalan alkahestry (purification alchemy) as alternative to Amestrian methods.

**Session 28**: Raid on Central Command to steal research on Father—the immortal Dwarf in the Flask who created the homunculi and rules from the shadows. High-stakes infiltration with severe consequences for failure.

### Arc 5: The Promised Day (Sessions 29-35)
**Session 29-30**: All factions converge on Central City as the eclipse approaches—the astrologically perfect moment for nationwide transmutation. The party coordinates with Mustang's coup, Armstrong's forces, and Ishvalan allies.

**Session 31-32**: Street-level warfare as homunculi reveal themselves and activate their human subordinates. The party must fight through to Central Command while protecting civilians. Each homunculus represents a deadly sin: Pride, Envy, Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth.

**Session 33-34**: Descent into Father's underground lair. The transmutation circle activates, attempting to consume the nation's souls. The party must disrupt key points while confronting personal demons (literally—their darkest selves manifested).

**Session 35**: Final confrontation with Father, who has absorbed God and attempts to recreate the world. Multi-phase boss fight using all campaign mechanics. Resolution depends on party's choices: sacrifice themselves for humanity, find alternative using equivalent exchange, or make dark bargain for power.

## Key NPCs

**King Bradley / Wrath** (Lawful Evil)
The Fuhrer-President of Amestris, secretly the homunculus Wrath. Unlike other homunculi, he ages and can be killed normally, but possesses the Ultimate Eye that predicts all movements. Charming, grandfatherly, and absolutely ruthless. The perfect soldier-leader.

**Roy Mustang** (Neutral Good)
The Flame Alchemist, ambitious colonel seeking to reform the military from within. Charismatic leader with loyal subordinates. Haunted by Ishvalan War crimes. Can become Fuhrer or die trying depending on party support.

**Riza Hawkeye** (Lawful Good)
Mustang's aide and bodyguard, sharpshooter with her father's flame alchemy research tattooed on her back. The conscience preventing Mustang's ambition from corrupting him. Absolutely loyal, dangerously competent.

**Scar** (Chaotic Neutral)
Ishvalan survivor seeking revenge against State Alchemists who destroyed his people. His right arm bears his brother's deconstruction research. Antagonist-turned-ally if party earns his respect by acknowledging Amestrian crimes.

**Van Hohenheim** (Neutral Good)
Ancient alchemist and Father's twin, both created from the original Dwarf in the Flask. Appears to be party's enemy but actually working to stop Father. Living Philosopher's Stone containing thousands of souls he communes with. Tragic immortal seeking death.

**Father / The Dwarf in the Flask** (Neutral Evil)
The ancient homunculus who created Amestris as a sacrifice zone. Emotionless and godlike, sees humans as components in experiments. Created seven homunculi from his own sins to achieve emotional purity. Final boss and architect of all suffering.

**Olivier Armstrong** (Lawful Neutral)
General of Fort Briggs, "The Northern Wall of Briggs." Ruthless pragmatist who values strength and competence above politics. Will ally with whoever proves strongest. Sister to weaker Alex Armstrong. Potential post-campaign leader.

**Alex Armstrong** (Neutral Good)
The Strong-Arm Alchemist, muscle-bound gentle giant. Fled Ishvalan War due to conscience, now overcompensates with performance of strength. Comic relief who becomes unexpectedly crucial in final battle.

**Izumi Curtis** (True Neutral)
Master alchemist who tried to resurrect her stillborn child and lost internal organs as payment. Potential mentor or antagonist depending on party's attitudes toward human transmutation. Knows Truth personally.

**Truth** (True Neutral)
The metaphysical embodiment of universal knowledge and equivalent exchange. Appears as white silhouette of whoever faces it. Guards the Gate where all alchemical knowledge originates. Takes body parts as toll for forbidden knowledge.

## Major Locations

**Central City**
Capital of Amestris, circular city built around Central Command. Mix of early 1900s European architecture with alchemical augmentation. Underground catacombs hide Father's lair and the nation's dark secrets.

**Laboratory 5**
Abandoned facility beneath Central, actually active human experimentation site. Chimera creation, Philosopher's Stone research, and prisoner torture. Gothic horror aesthetic with medical instruments and caged horrors.

**Fort Briggs**
Northern border fortress built into mountain. Harsh winter environment tests survival. Garrison of elite soldiers loyal to Armstrong. Secret tunnel system connects to underground transmutation network.

**Ishval Ruins**
Destroyed homeland of the Ishvalan people, still radioactive from alchemical bombardment. Ruins of mosques and homes. Survivor camps on periphery. Ghosts of war crimes haunt the landscape.

**Resembool**
Small farming village, represents innocent Amestris. Party members might have roots here. Automail (mechanical prosthetic) mechanic Rockbell family provides equipment and moral grounding.

**Xerxes Ruins**
Ancient city destroyed by Father's first nationwide transmutation 400 years ago. All inhabitants became Philosopher's Stone. Now desert wasteland with crumbling architecture. Contains clues to stopping Father.

**The Gate of Truth**
Metaphysical realm accessed through human transmutation. Black and white space with massive door covered in alchemical diagrams. Truth waits within to judge alchemists. Different for each person who enters.

## Unique Mechanics

**Alchemy System**
Players can research and create alchemical formulas based on material composition:
- **Transmutation Circles**: Draw or pre-inscribe circles for specific effects
- **Clap Alchemy**: Those who've seen Truth can transmute without circles
- **Specializations**: Each alchemist develops signature techniques (flame, metal, water, etc.)

**Alchemy Categories**:
- **Combat**: Weapons, projectiles, barriers, elemental attacks
- **Utility**: Construction, disguise, healing (limited), transportation
- **Forbidden**: Human transmutation, Philosopher's Stone creation, biological modification

**Equivalent Exchange Rules**:
Every transmutation requires equal material value. Creating gold requires gold's worth in materials. Living things can't be created (only rearranged). Human souls can't be transmuted without catastrophic consequences.

**Philosopher's Stone Temptation**:
Stones bypass equivalent exchange but contain human souls. Using them grants incredible power but corrupts the user. Track Corruption score—high corruption leads to madness or transformation into homunculus.

**Automail Prosthetics**:
Mechanical limbs replacing those lost to Truth or combat:
- **Benefits**: Enhanced strength, built-in weapons, immunity to pain in that limb
- **Drawbacks**: Maintenance required, vulnerable to electricity, painful in extreme weather
- **Customization**: Can be upgraded with alchemical augmentations

**Homunculus Encounters**:
Each homunculus represents a sin and requires specific strategy:
- **Pride**: Shadow manipulation, must be contained in darkness
- **Envy**: Shapeshifting, must identify true form
- **Wrath**: Combat perfection, must overwhelm prediction
- **Greed**: Ultimate shield, must attack from inside
- **Gluttomy**: Consumption, must avoid being eaten
- **Lust**: Speed and precision, must use distance
- **Sloth**: Tremendous speed despite laziness, must exhaust

**Seeing Truth**:
Characters who attempt human transmutation and survive see Truth, gaining:
- **Clap Alchemy**: No circles needed
- **True Sight**: See souls, illusions, and truth of things
- **Physical Cost**: Lost body part(s) equivalent to knowledge gained
- **Psychological Burden**: Permanent trauma from Truth's revelation

## Plot Twists and Complications

**The Fuhrer's Identity**: King Bradley is Wrath, meaning every military action for decades served the homunculi's plan.

**Hohenheim's Nature**: The party's mysterious patron is also a living Philosopher's Stone, morally better than Father but technically the same type of being.

**Mustang's Blindness**: If party fails to protect him, Mustang is forced to open the Gate and loses his sight, requiring party to become his eyes.

**The Stone's Truth**: Philosopher's Stones aren't objects—they're thousands of human souls compressed and screaming. Using them is mass murder.

**Party Member's Secret**: One character unknowingly carries homunculus essence, making them a sleeper agent or vessel for resurrection.

**Ishvalan Justification**: The Ishvalan War wasn't religiously motivated—it was triggered by homunculi to create massive death for Stone creation and draw the transmutation circle's lines.

**The Gate's Offer**: Truth offers party members their deepest desires in exchange for becoming his agents, testing if they've learned about equivalent exchange.

**The True Sacrifice**: Stopping Father requires someone to sacrifice themselves by entering the Gate permanently, becoming the lock keeping God contained.

## Victory Conditions

**Heroic Victory**: Defeat Father, dismantle homunculi, expose conspiracy, establish democracy. Requires sacrificing Philosopher's Stones and accepting personal losses can't be undone.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Stop the transmutation but at terrible cost—many NPCs dead, nation in chaos, party permanently scarred. Realistic ending requiring difficult choices.

**Reformed Victory**: Defeat Father and use limited alchemical knowledge to heal some wounds while accepting others. Balance between sacrifice and hope.

**Philosophical Victory**: Convince Father that humanity's value lies in its flaws and mortality. Requires high Persuasion and proof through party's actions throughout campaign.

**Transcendent Victory**: Bargain with Truth itself for alternative solution. Requires collecting forbidden knowledge throughout campaign and willingness to permanently sacrifice alchemy itself.

## Defeat Conditions

**Nationwide Transmutation**: Party fails to disrupt the circle. Millions die becoming Father's Philosopher's Stone. Apocalyptic ending with few survivors.

**Corrupted by Power**: Party uses Philosopher's Stones too much, becoming homunculi themselves. They become new villains ruling through alchemy.

**Military Coup Fails**: Bradley and homunculi crush Mustang's rebellion. Party executed as traitors or flee as fugitives, leaving nation in evil's grip.

**Truth's Judgment**: Party's sins in pursuit of victory are too great. Truth judges them unworthy and takes their alchemy, leaving them powerless.

**Personal Failure**: Party achieves mission but loses themselves—performing human transmutation or other forbidden acts that damn their souls despite saving the world.
