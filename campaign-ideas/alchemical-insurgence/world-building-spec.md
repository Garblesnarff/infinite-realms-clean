# Alchemical Insurgence - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

### Ancient Era (2000 years ago)
**Xerxes Empire**: Advanced civilization mastering alchemy through natural understanding of material composition. Population of millions living in desert kingdom. No knowledge of Gate or Truth—alchemy was purely scientific.

### The First Sacrifice (400 years ago)
**Dwarf in the Flask** created by Xerxian alchemists as experiment in artificial life. Gained sentience and manipulated King of Xerxes into creating nationwide transmutation circle. Single night: all citizens of Xerxes transformed into raw energy, creating two beings—Hohenheim (unwilling) and Father (architect).

### Foundation of Amestris (350 years ago)
Father emerged from Xerxes ruins and began multi-generational plan. Manipulated tribes into forming Amestris, designing borders in perfect circle. Each expansion war carved transmutation lines. Population growth encouraged to create sufficient "material" for final transmutation.

### The Alchemical Renaissance (200 years ago)
State Alchemy program established, recruiting talented practitioners and giving them military ranks. Research into Philosopher's Stones officially banned but secretly conducted in underground laboratories. Homunculi infiltrated government at highest levels.

### The Ishvalan War of Extermination (15 years ago)
Religious Ishvalan minority objected to alchemy as "playing god." Homunculi orchestrated incident causing conflict. State Alchemists deployed with orders to eliminate entire population. War crimes created massive death toll and drew blood boundary of transmutation circle. Trauma scars surviving alchemists.

### Current Era (Campaign Start)
Transmutation circle nearly complete. Final sacrifices (State Alchemists murdered by Scar) add finishing details. Eclipse approaching—astrologically perfect moment when dimensional barriers thin. Father ready to execute 400-year plan.

All former soldiers turned into chimeras involuntarily. Serve Greed but sympathetic to party. Represent body horror of unethical alchemy.

**Nina Tucker** (Background Horror):
Young girl transmuted with her dog by her father to prove value as State Alchemist. Tragic victim showing consequences of desperation. Haunts party's decisions about human transmutation.

## Location Deep Dives

### Central City
**Layout**: Circular city built around Central Command (literally center). Five districts radiating outward, all connected by underground tunnel network (actually transmutation circle).

**Key Locations**:
- **Central Command**: Five-sided fortress, actually entrance to Father's lair
- **State Alchemist Exam Hall**: Where hopefuls demonstrate abilities
- **Third Laboratory**: Surface facility, nothing interesting (misdirection from Lab 5)
- **Hughes' House**: Site of his murder, investigation location
- **Shopping District**: Where everyday life continues ignorant of conspiracy

**Underground Network**:
Officially sewer system, actually transmutation circle boundary. Sloth dug tunnels connecting key points. Ancient construction predating official city founding. Walls carved with alchemical formulas. Patrols of corrupted guards kill intruders.

### Laboratory 5
**Purpose**: Human experimentation creating chimeras and Philosopher's Stones.

**Layout**:
- **Entrance**: Disguised as abandoned building
- **Chimera Pens**: Cages holding human-animal hybrids in various stages
- **Surgery Floor**: Operating theaters where "doctors" create chimeras
- **Prisoner Block**: Condemned criminals used as raw materials
- **Stone Synthesis Room**: Where human souls are compressed into Stones
- **Guardian's Lair**: Homunculi (usually Envy or Lust) guard deepest level

**Atmosphere**: Medical horror meets gothic prison. Screaming subjects, chemical smells, blood-stained floors. Evidence everywhere of unethical science. Party's first exposure to regime's true evil.

### Fort Briggs
**Geography**: Built into mountain on northern border, perpetual blizzard conditions.

**Structure**:
- **Mountain Fortress**: Carved into cliff face, defensible against armies
- **Barracks**: Spartan, heated only in common areas
- **Armstrong's Office**: War room with maps and intelligence
- **Training Grounds**: Outdoor areas where soldiers prove toughness
- **Underground Tunnel**: Sloth's excavation connects to nationwide circle
- **Drachman Border**: Enemy nation visible across frozen wasteland

**Culture**: Meritocracy where weakness means death. Soldiers fiercely loyal to Armstrong. Suspicious of Central Command. Self-sufficient and isolated. Tests party's survival skills.

### Ishval Ruins
**History**: Once thriving religious community, now radioactive wasteland.

**Destruction**:
State Alchemists systematically destroyed every building. Flame alchemy burned people alive. Explosion alchemy leveled infrastructure. Crystal alchemy impaled fleeing civilians. Thousands dead in single week.

**Current State**:
- Radioactive from excessive alchemy use
- Ruined mosques and homes as tombstones
- Survivor camps on periphery
- Mass graves barely covered
- Spiritual weight—ghosts or guilt haunting area

**Investigation Opportunities**:
- War crime evidence (party's decision to report or hide)
- Alkahestry knowledge in ruined monastery
- Scar's backstory revealed through environmental storytelling
- Moral confrontation with party's own potential war crimes

### Xerxes Ruins
**Location**: Desert wasteland far from Amestris.

**History**: Ancient civilization destroyed in single night 400 years ago. Entire population (millions) transmuted into Philosopher's Stone, creating Hohenheim and Father.

**Current State**:
- Perfectly preserved due to desert climate
- Empty city with no bodies (all became energy)
- Alchemical formulas carved into every surface
- Underground chamber where original transmutation occurred
- Hohenheim's memories linger here

**Importance**: Contains clues to Father's plan and potential countermeasure. Party must decipher ancient alchemy to understand how to stop nationwide transmutation.

### The Gate of Truth
**Nature**: Metaphysical realm beyond reality, accessed through human transmutation.

**Appearance**: Changes for each person, reflecting their soul. Common elements:
- Massive white door covered in black alchemical diagrams
- Thousands of eyes opening across surface
- Reaching hands emerging from edges
- Truth's white silhouette waiting inside

**Inside the Gate**:
- Information overload—all alchemical knowledge simultaneously
- Branching paths to infinite doors (alternate realities?)
- Truth judges alchemist's hubris
- Takes toll equivalent to knowledge gained (typically body parts)
- Time flows differently (subjective hours, objective seconds)

**Consequences of Opening**:
- Gain clap alchemy (no circles needed)
- Permanent physical loss
- Psychological trauma from seeing Truth
- Marked by Truth—other Gate-touched recognize each other
- Some never return (pulled fully inside)

## Alchemy Systems Detailed

### Types of Alchemy

**Combat Alchemy**:
- **Flame**: Transmute air oxygen density, ignite with spark (Mustang's specialty)
- **Metal**: Reshape weapons, armor, projectiles from minerals
- **Earth**: Create walls, pitfalls, launch stones
- **Water/Ice**: Freeze enemies, create barriers, manipulate humidity
- **Explosion**: Trigger controlled detonations (Kimblee's specialty)
- **Crystal**: Grow crystalline structures, impaling attacks
- **Lightning**: Redirect electrical energy
- **Biological**: Forbidden except medical applications

**Utility Alchemy**:
- **Construction**: Build bridges, shelters, fortifications
- **Repair**: Fix broken objects if materials present
- **Medical**: Accelerate healing (limited—can't create life)
- **Disguise**: Reshape features temporarily
- **Communication**: Transmute messages into materials
- **Transportation**: Reshape vehicles, create paths

**Forbidden Alchemy**:
- **Human Transmutation**: Attempting to create or revive humans
- **Chimeras**: Fusing humans with animals
- **Philosopher's Stones**: Compressing human souls into gems
- **Biological Weapons**: Creating diseases or toxins
- **Soul Binding**: Attaching souls to objects or bodies

### Alkahestry (Ishvalan Alternative)
**Philosophy**: Work with energy flow rather than material composition. Based on understanding chi/life force networks.

**Differences from Amestrian Alchemy**:
- Uses earth's natural energy (dragon pulse) as power source
- Focus on healing and purification
- Cannot destroy—only restore and balance
- Requires meditation and spiritual attunement
- More limited combat applications but more versatile healing

**Applications**:
- **Medical**: Cure diseases, repair organs, extend life
- **Purification**: Remove toxins, cleanse corruption
- **Detection**: Sense life force, find hidden people
- **Enhancement**: Temporary physical boosts
- **Restoration**: Return altered materials to natural state

**Advantages**: No temptation of Philosopher's Stones, no opening Gates, no Truth's judgment.

**Disadvantages**: Slower, less dramatic, requires constant spiritual discipline.

## Causality Chains

### The Murder Investigation
1. Scar begins killing State Alchemists from Ishvalan War
2. Party investigates, discovers pattern
3. Pattern reveals transmutation circle boundary
4. Investigation leads to Lab 5 discovery
5. Lab 5 reveals homunculi existence
6. Homunculi existence proves government conspiracy
7. Conspiracy reveals nationwide transmutation plan
8. Race against time to stop Father begins

**Player Interventions**:
- Catch Scar early (prevents some murders, lose information)
- Protect State Alchemists (saves lives, slows investigation)
- Ally with Scar (gain Ishvalan support, betray military)
- Report conspiracy (likely killed, campaign ends badly)
- Investigate quietly (careful balance required)

### Mustang's Coup
1. Hughes investigates murders, discovers homunculi
2. Envy kills Hughes to silence him
3. Mustang swears vengeance, commits to reform
4. Builds coalition of reform-minded officers
5. Plans coup for Promised Day when Bradley's distracted
6. Coup succeeds or fails based on party's support
7. If successful, Mustang becomes Fuhrer
8. If failed, executed as traitors

**Player Interventions**:
- Support coup actively (risky but rewarding)
- Remain neutral (miss opportunities for influence)
- Betray coup (dark path, potential rewards from homunculi)
- Prevent Hughes' death (changes entire timeline)

### Father's Plan
1. Created Amestris 350 years ago as sacrifice zone
2. Each war drew transmutation circle boundaries
3. Homunculi infiltrated government at all levels
4. Philosopher's Stone research produces human sacrifices
5. Five humans who've seen Truth required as triggers
6. Promised Day eclipse provides astronomical alignment
7. Nationwide transmutation activates
8. All souls in Amestris become Philosopher's Stone
9. Father uses Stone to open Gate and absorb God
10. Father transcends alchemy, becomes omnipotent

**Player Interventions**:
- Disrupt circle (damage key points in tunnel network)
- Prevent eclipse (impossible, but could try)
- Infiltrate Father's lair early (suicide mission but possible)
- Become fifth sacrifice themselves (dark temptation)
- Rally allies for Promised Day convergence (optimal path)

## Cultural Details

### Military Culture
- **Rank**: More important than nobility, meritocracy in theory
- **Honor**: Valued publicly, ignored privately when convenient
- **Loyalty**: To commanding officer first, institution second
- **Women**: Accepted equally if competent (Hawkeye, Armstrong)
- **State Alchemists**: Respected and feared, called "Dogs of the Military"

### Amestrian Society
- **Class System**: Nobility declining, military rising, merchants growing
- **Religion**: Not emphasized, cultural superstition remains
- **Education**: Military academies, civilian universities, apprenticeships
- **Economy**: Industrial revolution beginning, agriculture still dominant
- **Arts**: Propaganda style emphasizing military glory and progress

### Ishvalan Culture
- **Religion**: Central to identity, sun god Ishvala
- **Alchemy Ban**: Considered playing god, punishable by exile
- **Appearance**: Dark skin, red eyes, white hair (distinctive)
- **Traditions**: Forehead scarring, prayer five times daily, dietary restrictions
- **Post-War**: Cultural preservation despite genocide attempt

## End Game Scenarios Expanded

### Heroic Victory
Party disrupts transmutation circle, defeats Father with Hohenheim's help, exposes homunculi, supports Mustang's coup. New government established with Ishvalan representation and alchemy regulations.

**Epilogue**: Mustang becomes Fuhrer, Armstrong heads military, party recognized as heroes. State Alchemist program reformed with ethics oversight. Ishvalan reparations begin. Slow healing for nation.

**Personal Costs**: Party members who used Philosopher's Stones bear guilt. Those who saw Truth keep physical scars. Some NPCs dead despite best efforts.

### Pyrrhic Victory
Father stopped but terrible cost: many allies dead, cities damaged, party permanently scarred. Victory feels hollow.

**Epilogue**: Armstrong becomes military dictator to restore order. Alchemy banned entirely. Party blamed for chaos despite saving world. Must flee or accept trial.

### Philosopher's Stone Corruption
Party used Stones too much, became addicted to easy power. Defeat Father but become new homunculi, emotionless rulers.

**Epilogue**: New age of alchemical tyranny. Party enforces order through power. Some part of them knows they've become what they fought, but Stones suppress regret.

### The Promised Day Fails
Party fails to stop transmutation. Millions die. Father achieves godhood.

**Epilogue**: Few survivors in wasteland. Party must flee Amestris or submit to Father's rule. Potential for sequel campaign about rebellion against god-king.
