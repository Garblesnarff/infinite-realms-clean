**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Aurora awakens improperly THEN the Thorn King is released into mortal realm
*   IF the curse continues indefinitely THEN Aurora suffers conscious imprisonment forever
*   IF true love's kiss is performed THEN the sacrifice dies to transfer life force
*   IF the Thorn King breaches containment THEN decay and stasis spread consuming reality
*   IF thorns are destroyed carelessly THEN containment fails and possession completes
*   IF party enters sleeping sickness THEN they join the trapped courtiers
*   IF temporal paradoxes are created THEN castle becomes increasingly unstable
*   IF Aurora's fractured selves are reunited THEN her power to resist increases
*   IF the Dream Merchant's bargains are accepted THEN memories are traded for advantages
*   IF Maleficent's true purpose is understood THEN new binding options become available
*   IF King Oberon dies before resolution THEN succession crisis compounds problems
*   IF the three fairies' loops are broken THEN they can act freely again
*   IF Aurora is killed while possessed THEN Thorn King might survive in thorns
*   IF new binding is negotiated THEN Aurora might achieve limited freedom
*   IF sacrifice is willing and pure THEN awakening might not release Thorn King
