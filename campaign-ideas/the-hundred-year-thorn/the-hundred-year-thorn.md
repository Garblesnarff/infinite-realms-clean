## Campaign Overview

**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Fairy Tale / Temporal Horror / Gothic Romance
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **13–15**
**Tone (keywords):** cursed sleep, temporal displacement, thorny prison, corrupted prophecy, kiss of death, beauty preserved in nightmare, awakening horror
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Princess Aurora's hundred-year curse wasn't sleep but conscious imprisonment in temporal stasis, and her castle has become a nightmare realm where the thorns grow inward, slowly devouring the sleepers while keeping them aware for every moment of the century. The party, hired to breach the thorn wall, discovers that Aurora has been awake the entire time, that her "true love's kiss" is actually a death ritual requiring sacrifice, and that the curse is all that prevents an ancient evil bound within her from escaping. They must navigate a castle existing in multiple time streams simultaneously, where the sleeping court has fractured into nightmare versions of themselves, and decide whether awakening the princess means dooming the world.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Temporal Displacement:** Time flows differently, aging effects, paradoxes, and being trapped in loops.
*   **Conscious Imprisonment:** The horror of being aware but unable to move or speak for decades.
*   **Thorn Corruption:** Living thorns that grow through flesh, causing pain without death.
*   **Fractured Identities:** NPCs exist in multiple temporal states, contradicting themselves.
*   **Sacrifice Requirements:** True love's kiss requires willing sacrifice of life force.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act journey through time, thorns, and the price of awakening.

*   **Act I — The Wall of Thorns (Sessions 1–4):** The party is hired by desperate kingdoms to breach the impenetrable thorn wall surrounding Castle Roseheart. They discover previous rescue attempts have become part of the thorns—skeletons wrapped in roses, armor grown into bark. Early breaches reveal temporal anomalies—spending hours inside while minutes pass outside, or vice versa. They encounter the first nightmare courtiers who've been "sleeping" for a century but are aware and mad.

*   **Act II — The Sleeping Court (Sessions 5–8):** Inside the castle, they find the court exists in multiple temporal states simultaneously. Some courtiers are truly sleeping, some are aware and begging for death, some have fractured into different versions from different decades of imprisonment. Aurora can communicate through dreams, revealing she's been conscious the entire hundred years and the thorns have grown through her body. The "spinning wheel" curse was meant to bind an ancient evil that possessed her as a child.

*   **Act III — The Thirteenth Fairy (Sessions 9–12):** They learn the curse-giver was actually trying to contain the Thorn King, an archfey of decay and preservation who claimed Aurora as vessel. Her "sleep" prevents the Thorn King from using her as anchor to enter the mortal realm. Previous "princes" who attempted rescue were actually the Thorn King trying to engineer awakening through pawns. The thorns serve dual purpose—prison keeping Aurora in and Thorn King out, but slowly the barrier erodes. Aurora's consciousness has been fighting the entity for a century, growing stronger but also more merged with it.

*   **Act IV — True Love's Curse (Sessions 13–16):** The party discovers "true love's kiss" is actually a death ritual requiring willing sacrifice of another's life to break the binding. They must choose: let Aurora remain imprisoned (condemning her to eternal conscious suffering but keeping world safe), sacrifice someone to awaken her (risking Thorn King's emergence), find a way to separate Aurora from the entity (potentially killing both), or broker a new binding with different terms. The Thorn King offers power and promises, Aurora begs for freedom even if it means her death, and time is running out as the hundred years end and the curse weakens naturally.

## Central Conflict

Freedom versus containment and the price of both. Aurora has suffered conscious imprisonment for a century—unimaginable torture—but her freedom means releasing an ancient evil that will devastate the world. The Thorn King represents preservation through stasis, beauty maintained through suffering, eternity at cost of growth. The party must weigh individual suffering against collective safety, decide if redemption is possible for the possessed, and confront whether some evils can only be contained rather than destroyed. True love's kiss requiring sacrifice asks what love means when freedom demands death.
