# Creative Brief: Sunless Seas

## Art Style: Subterranean Ocean Gothic

Inspired by Sunless Sea (the game), Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Master and Commander nautical aesthetics, and the alien beauty of deep sea creatures. Gothic ships sailing on underground waters, bioluminescent creatures, strange islands.

### Visual Principles:
* **Dark Waters**: Black water with bioluminescent creatures providing only light.
* **Nautical Gothic**: Ships designed for enclosed seas—no masts, oars and paddlewheels, modified sails.
* **Island Variety**: Each island unique—some lit by glowing crystals, others by fire, some in complete darkness.
* **Deep Sea Horror**: Creatures beautiful and terrifying—massive leviathans, alien fish, merfolk warriors.

### Color Palette:
Deep blacks and blues for water. Bioluminescent aqua, green, and purple. Ship lanterns provide warm orange/yellow. Islands have varied lighting—fire, crystal, fungal.

### Character Design:
Sailors of all races adapted to underground sea life. Merfolk with deep-sea adaptations. Clothing nautical but modified for enclosed ocean. Progressive changes as air quality worsens—characters need breathing apparatus.

## Music Direction:
Sea shanties echoing in caverns. Creaking ships. Water sounds. Leviathan calls. Each island has musical theme. Combat is boarding actions and ship battles.

## Voice Acting:
Nautical accents vary by faction. Merfolk voices have liquid quality. Leviathan cultists speak with reverence and madness. The Deep Mother communicates through whale-song that suggests meaning.
