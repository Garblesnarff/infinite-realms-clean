**Tone (keywords):** mysterious, aquatic, exploratory, mercantile, alien, island-hopping, nautical
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Miles below the surface, the Sunless Sea—a vast underground ocean—harbors strange islands, aquatic civilizations, and mysteries of the deep. The party inherits a ship and becomes captains of their destiny, navigating between island-ports controlled by competing factions: the Coral Throne (merfolk empire), the Surface Exiles (desperate human colonies), and the Leviathan Cults (who worship the massive creatures dwelling in the abyss). As they trade, explore, and fight for survival, they discover the sea itself is dying—ancient magic that maintains the water and air is failing. They must find the source of the magic, navigate political intrigue, and possibly make the ultimate sacrifice to save the Sunless Sea or escape before it becomes a tomb.
