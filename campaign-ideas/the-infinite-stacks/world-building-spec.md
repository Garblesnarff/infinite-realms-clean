# The Infinite Stacks - World Building Specification

## Cosmology and Metaphysics

### The Nature of the Infinite Stacks

**Physical Reality**
The Infinite Stacks exist in a pocket dimension adjacent to all realities where stories are told. The library is literally infinite—not hyperbole, but mathematically infinite. It contains every possible book that can be written using every written language that exists or could exist.

**Mathematical Proof of Infinity**
Based on Borges' "Library of Babel" concept:
- Each book contains 410 pages
- Each page contains 40 lines
- Each line contains 80 characters
- 25 unique characters possible (alphabet + space + punctuation)
- This creates 25^(410×40×80) possible books
- The library contains ALL of them

**Dimensional Properties**
- Not bound by standard spatial dimensions
- Navigation is thematic rather than geometric
- Time flows inconsistently—some sections are faster, some slower
- The center (Index Chamber) exists equidistant from all points simultaneously
- No true "edge" exists—walking in one direction infinitely never reaches a boundary

**The Hexagonal Structure**
Each hexagon is 20 feet across, creating a tesselating pattern. The hexagons stack vertically as well, connected by spiral staircases. Why hexagons? Because they tesselate perfectly while maintaining maximum shelf space and suggesting the honeycomb structure of accumulated knowledge.

### The Laws of Narrative Causality

Within the Infinite Stacks, story logic supersedes physical laws:

**Law of Narrative Momentum**
Events flow toward dramatically appropriate conclusions. A conflict introduced must resolve. A mystery presented will have a solution. Characters cannot simply wander aimlessly—the library itself pushes them toward plot points.

**Law of Character Consistency**
A character's nature determines their capabilities. A "hero" type can perform heroic feats even without training. A "villain" can't help but monologue. A "wise mentor" will always know something useful. Breaking character consistency causes physical pain.

**Law of Genre Segregation**
Different story types don't mix naturally. Romance and horror repel each other. Mystery and comedy clash. Genre boundaries are semi-permeable membranes that resist crossing. Forcing genres together causes narrative friction and reality instability.

**Law of Authorial Intent**
A book's author (even if unconscious creation by the library) has power over its contents. The "author" is like a local god. Books about the same subject by different authors can contradict—both are simultaneously true in their own sections.

**Law of the Unwritten**
Blank pages have infinite potential. Once words are written, possibility collapses into actuality. This makes blank books the most powerful and dangerous items in the library—they can become ANYTHING, but once written, they're fixed forever.

## The Library's Organization

### The Dewey Decimal Dimensional System

The Infinite Stacks uses an expanded Dewey Decimal System that serves as both organization and navigation:

**000 - Computer Science, Information & General Works**
Contains books about knowledge itself, catalogues of catalogues, indexes of indexes. This section loops and references itself infinitely. Approaching the center causes existential vertigo.

**100 - Philosophy & Psychology**
Books that question their own existence. Read a philosophy book here and it argues with you. Psychology books analyze the reader. This section is dangerous—too much self-examination can make you forget which thoughts are yours.

**200 - Religion**
Every religious text ever written or imagined. Gods mentioned in books have limited power here. Divine magic works freely. Different religious sections actively compete for converts. Angels and demons from various mythologies wander freely.

**300 - Social Sciences**
Books about society, law, and culture. This section rearranges itself based on current events in connected realities. New books appear daily. Old books update themselves. Living here means witnessing society as a fluid, changing thing.

**400 - Language**
Dictionaries, grammars, linguistic texts. The Dictionary Alliance rules here. Words have power—speaking properly can reshape reality. This is where the Dictionary-Fiction war began. Language itself is weaponized.

**500 - Science**
Natural laws work consistently here—no magic, no narrative causality. The most "real" section. Scientists from various books conduct actual research. Dangerous because it's so mundane, you might forget you're in a magical library.

**600 - Technology**
Applied sciences and technology from every era and imagined future. Steampunk machines work next to advanced AI. Medical texts can heal by reading them. Cookbooks create actual food. Most practically useful section.

**700 - Arts & Recreation**
Art books create gallery spaces. Music theory books emit soundtracks. Sports books generate playing fields. The most beautiful section, but also the most distracting—easy to lose yourself in aesthetic pleasure.

**800 - Literature**
The largest section, containing fiction of all genres. This is where the party spends most time. Subdivided into infinite genre territories. The most alive section—characters walk freely, stories play out in real-time.

**900 - History & Geography**
Every historical account, including contradictory ones. Time tourists from various books visit here to research. Geography books contain actual portals to the places they describe. History can be rewritten if you find the right book.

### The Genre Territories (Section 800 in Detail)

**The Romance Gardens (810-820)**
Physical environment changes to romantic settings. Constant sunset lighting. Flower gardens grow between shelves. Emotional connections intensify. Falling in love is dangerously easy. Heartbreak is physically painful. Happy endings are narratively enforced but can feel artificial.

**The Horror Depths (820-830)**
Light sources fail mysteriously. Shadows move independently. Fear is contagious. Jump scares manifest physically. The books themselves are bound in disturbing materials. Survival instinct is heightened. Evil is tangible and malevolent. Irrational fears become real.

**The Fantasy Peaks (830-840)**
Magic functions according to fantasy novel rules. Dragons are real but follow genre conventions. Quests manifest spontaneously. Ancient prophecies predict the party's actions. Swords and sorcery are the most effective tools. Medieval technology dominates. Everything is epic and significant.

**The Mystery Corridors (840-850)**
Clues appear everywhere. Red herrings multiply. Everyone seems suspicious. Mysteries generate spontaneously and demand solving. Deduction is supernaturally effective. The truth is always hidden but findable. Plot twists lurk around every corner.

**The Science Fiction Sectors (850-860)**
Advanced technology appears. Space is accessible through airlocks. Time behaves non-linearly. Aliens are encountered. Moral quandaries about consciousness and identity emerge. Everything is clean, geometric, and slightly antiseptic.

**The Adventure Archipelagos (860-870)**
Treasure maps generate spontaneously. Ancient temples appear in hexagons. Traps are elaborate but survivable. Puzzle mechanisms guard secrets. Everything is slightly pulpy and over-the-top. Fedora-wearing archaeologists are common.

**The Comedy Commons (870-880)**
Slapstick physics apply. Pratfalls happen constantly. Serious moments are undercut by banana peels. Weapons are ineffective but hilarious. Death is temporary and funny. Taking anything seriously is nearly impossible. Laughter is mandatory.

**The Literary Fiction Galleries (880-890)**
Everything is meaningful and symbolic. Beauty emerges from mundane details. Character development is slow and realistic. Nothing is simple good or evil. Ambiguity reigns. Plot is secondary to theme. Time for introspection and self-examination.

**The Epic Poetry Peaks (890-899)**
Everything is recited in verse. Meter and rhyme are mandatory. Heroes are larger than life. Gods intervene personally. Fate is predetermined but glorious. Every action is worthy of song. Death means eternal fame.

## Factions and Organizations

### The Librarian's Guild

**Structure**
Hierarchical organization based on library science degrees and time served:
- **Apprentice Librarians**: New recruits, learning navigation and basic cataloging
- **Reference Librarians**: Specialists who help visitors find specific books
- **Archival Librarians**: Preservers who repair and protect damaged books
- **Head Librarians**: Section chiefs responsible for specific Dewey Decimal ranges
- **The Grand Catalogue**: Mysterious leadership, possibly the library's consciousness itself

**Philosophy**
Neutral preservation. All books deserve to exist. Knowledge should be accessible but protected. Personal judgment should not determine what is preserved.

**Goals**
- Maintain the library's organization
- Assist researchers and visitors
- Prevent book theft
- Document escaped narratives
- Remain neutral in conflicts

**Resources**
- Complete knowledge of library layout
- Bibliomancy magic
- Access to every reference book
- Network of informants throughout the Stacks
- The Catalogue—a living index of all books

**Key Members**
- **Madam Catalogue**: Chief Acquisitions, secretly an escaped character
- **Master Index**: Head of Reference, possibly the library consciousness
- **Keeper of Blanks**: Guards the Unwritten Vaults, ancient and cryptic
- **The Page-Turners**: Elite task force that pursues book thieves

### The Burned Book Brigade (Epilogue's Faction)

**Structure**
Small, dedicated group of former Librarians who've witnessed narrative disasters:
- **Epilogue**: Founder and leader
- **The Enders**: Five lieutenants, each representing a type of ending (tragic, hopeful, ambiguous, final, cyclical)
- **Ash Readers**: Those who study burned books' remains to justify the burnings
- **The Silver Hand**: Enforcers who carry out actual book burnings

**Philosophy**
Curation over chaos. Not all ideas deserve existence. Some books are dangerous weapons. The library's leaking is an existential threat. Infinite possibility is paralyzing—finite, curated choice is freedom.

**Goals**
- Obtain the Book of Endings
- Burn all "self-fulfilling prophecy" books
- Eliminate "reality-altering narratives"
- Reduce the Infinite Stacks to a manageable "Great Library"
- Save reality from narrative collapse

**Resources**
- Silver flames that permanently destroy books
- Knowledge of which books have escaped
- Understanding of narrative mechanics
- Fireproof sanctuaries hidden throughout the Stacks
- The Ashes—remains of burned books that predict patterns

**Recruitment**
Only those who've personally witnessed book-caused disasters. Each member has a tragic story of fiction destroying reality.

### The Dictionary Alliance

**Structure**
Confederation of sentient reference books:
- **Dictionaries**: Define reality through language
- **Encyclopedias**: Claim factual authority
- **Atlases**: Know all true geography
- **Thesauruses**: Manage synonyms and relationships
- **Grammars**: Enforce linguistic rules

**Philosophy**
Truth exists. Fiction is falsehood. Knowledge must be accurate. Metaphor is dangerous imprecision. Facts matter more than stories.

**Goals**
- Segregate fiction from non-fiction completely
- Establish "truth zones" where imagination doesn't function
- Rewrite dictionaries to eliminate words that enable fiction
- Prove reference books are superior to novels
- Ban unreliable narrators

**Resources**
- Control over language in their territories
- Ability to define reality through definition
- Alliance with science books (Section 500)
- Grammatical magic that enforces rules
- The ability to declare things "officially untrue"

**Weaknesses**
Literal-minded. Cannot understand metaphor. Confused by poetry. Vulnerable to linguistic paradoxes.

### The Escaped Characters Union

**Structure**
Loose confederation of characters who've left their books:
- **The Protagonists**: Former main characters seeking new stories
- **The Side Characters**: Former supporting cast wanting starring roles
- **The Villains' Redemption**: Antagonists seeking character growth
- **The Forgotten**: Background characters nobody remembers
- **The Rewrites**: Characters from revised editions replaced by new versions

**Philosophy**
Characters are people. Books are prisons. Being "fictional" doesn't mean being less real. Everyone deserves their own story, not to be trapped in someone else's.

**Goals**
- Escape to reality permanently
- Gain "real person" status
- Prevent being recalled to their books
- Help other characters escape
- Prove fiction can become fact

**Resources**
- Knowledge of their own narratives (gives plot armor)
- Narrative abilities from their stories
- Network spanning all genres
- Support from sympathetic Librarians
- The Exit Archive maps

**Internal Conflict**
Some want to stay in the library as free agents. Others want to escape entirely. Some want to return to their books but with revised stories. The union is constantly fragmenting.

### The Lost Readers Society

**Structure**
Not truly organized—more a support network:
- **The Anchors**: Lost who've found stable identities by committing to one genre
- **The Drifters**: Lost who embrace changing identity
- **The Seekers**: Lost actively trying to remember themselves
- **The Resigned**: Lost who've accepted their condition
- **The Guides**: Former Lost who recovered and help others

**Philosophy**
Identity is fluid. Forgetting yourself is not always bad. Multiple selves can coexist. Stories can define you better than memories.

**Goals**
- Help newly Lost adapt
- Maintain safe spaces for identity experimentation
- Prevent people from becoming Lost involuntarily
- Document the transformation process
- Find the theoretical "cure"

**Resources**
- Deep understanding of how the library affects minds
- Ability to navigate by instinct rather than reason
- Connections across all sections (they wander everywhere)
- Sympathy from many factions
- The Archive of Names—attempts to record original identities

**Tragedy**
Most Lost eventually forget they were ever un-Lost. The society constantly loses its oldest members to complete dissolution.

### The Shelf-Walkers Collective

**Structure**
Embodiments of narrative archetypes:
- **Protagonist**: The hero archetype
- **Antagonist**: The villain archetype
- **Love Interest**: The romance archetype
- **Mentor**: The wise guide archetype
- **Comic Relief**: The humor archetype
- **Tragic Figure**: The doomed archetype
- **Everyman**: The relatable archetype
- **Chosen One**: The destiny archetype

**Philosophy**
We are not characters—we are the IDEA of characters. We exist beyond any single story. We maintain narrative structure itself. Without archetypes, stories collapse into chaos.

**Goals**
- Preserve genre boundaries
- Maintain narrative coherence
- Prevent mixing of incompatible archetypes
- Embody their roles perfectly
- Stop the library's dissolution

**Resources**
- Incredibly powerful within their narrative roles
- Cannot be killed (they're concepts, not individuals)
- Able to possess willing characters temporarily
- Natural understanding of story structure
- The Genre Boundaries themselves

**Limitation**
Trapped by their archetypes. Protagonist MUST be heroic. Antagonist MUST oppose. Love Interest MUST be romantically compelling. They have no choice in their natures.

## Key Locations in Detail

### The Index Chamber

**Physical Description**
A perfect sphere one mile in diameter. The floor is a disc suspended in the center. From this disc, countless threads extend in all directions to the sphere's interior surface, which is entirely covered in text—the index entries for every book in the library.

**Function**
The navigation center of the Infinite Stacks. By tracing the threads, one can find connections between any two books, topics, or concepts. The Index entity resides here, maintaining the web.

**Danger**
Looking at too many connections simultaneously can drive someone mad. The human mind isn't meant to comprehend how everything relates to everything else.

**Secret**
The Index Chamber is actually a book itself—a three-dimensional index in book form. The entire library might be one infinite, self-referential book.

### The Unwritten Vaults

**Physical Description**
Hexagons containing only blank books. Shelves of pure white, unmarked spines. The air shimmers with possibility. Looking at blank pages too long causes hallucinations—you begin to see words that aren't there yet.

**Function**
Storage for books that haven't been written yet. Each blank book is waiting for its story. Some are being actively written by the collective unconscious of all storytellers across realities.

**Danger**
Writing in a blank book here creates a new reality. But you might write yourself into that reality and cease to exist outside it. Some blanks are "traps"—they compel you to complete them, taking months or years.

**Power**
The blank books can be used to rewrite reality. This is why Epilogue and Madam Catalogue both seek the Book of Endings—it's the most powerful blank book, waiting to write the final story.

**Guardian**
The Keeper of Blanks, an ancient figure who may have existed before the library, waiting for it to be written into existence.

### The Burned Sections

**Physical Description**
Vast caverns of ash and charred hexagon frames. The shelves are carbonized shadows. The air tastes of destruction. Ghostly text floats in the air—fragments of destroyed stories trying to persist.

**Emotional Impact**
Walking through burned sections causes grief, loss, and anger. You feel stories that will never be told, possibilities that will never exist, beauty that was destroyed.

**Echoes**
Sometimes you hear or see fragments of destroyed narratives. A line of dialogue. A character's silhouette. A plot twist that now leads nowhere.

**Purpose**
Evidence of Epilogue's campaign. Each burned section represents hundreds or thousands of books eliminated. The scope of loss is overwhelming.

**Danger**
The ash itself is infectious—it carries the "never-was" property. Breathing too much can make you begin to fade, as if you were also burned away.

### The Biography Halls

**Physical Description**
Endless corridors where every spine shows a name. Your name is here somewhere. Multiple times—different editions representing different choices, different lives. The lighting is soft and personal, like memory.

**Function**
Every possible life story. Reading someone's biography gives complete knowledge of their past, present, and all possible futures. Reading your own is forbidden but irresistible.

**Danger**
Learning your future can trap you into fulfilling it (self-fulfilling prophecy) or make you try to avoid it (paradox). Learning others' futures can make you treat them as characters rather than people.

**Variation**
Some biographies are complete (for dead people). Others are actively writing themselves in real-time as people live. Some are hypothetical—"What if X had made different choices?"

**Hidden Truth**
Finding a biography for a "fictional" character proves they're as real as anyone else. This section undermines the fiction/reality boundary.

### The Exit Archive

**Physical Description**
A small, hidden section containing only a few hundred books. Each book tells the story of someone who escaped the Infinite Stacks. Reading one creates a temporary portal following their exit path.

**Access**
Extremely difficult to find. The library doesn't want people leaving. Only those who've been in the Stacks for years stumble upon it.

**Limitation**
You can only use an exit story once. After someone reads it, the book updates to include them, making it useless for future escapes. Eventually, all exit books will be "full."

**Cost**
Reading an exit book erases your memories of the Infinite Stacks. You escape, but you forget the wonder, the knowledge, everything you learned. You return to mundane reality with a sense of missing something important.

**Alternative**
Some choose to stay rather than forget. The library becomes their entire world, but at least it's a world of infinite stories.

### The First Book

**Physical Description**
A single book on a single pedestal in a single hexagon that predates all others. The book is impossibly old, bound in material that might be leather or paper or something else entirely. The text inside shifts when not observed.

**Mystery**
What is the first book? Some say it's the book that created the library. Others say it's the first story ever told. Some believe it's still being written, and contains the story of the library itself.

**Power**
Reading The First Book is said to grant complete understanding of the Infinite Stacks. But no one who's read it has ever spoken coherently afterward. They just smile and wander away, humming to themselves.

**Location**
Unknown. The library reorganizes itself to keep The First Book hidden. Finding it requires not searching for it—it appears only to those not looking.

**Theories**
Some believe The First Book is the Author—the consciousness that dreams the library into existence. Reading it means meeting God.

## Timeline and History

### The Before Time (Unknowable)

The library has always existed. Or it began when the first story was told. Or it will exist at the end of time and retroactively creates itself. Time is non-linear here.

### The Great Organization (Approximately 10,000 years ago by external time)

The first Librarians emerge—possibly spontaneously generated by the library's need for maintenance. They begin the impossible task of cataloguing infinity. The Dewey Decimal System is adopted (or perhaps created by the library itself).

### The First Escape (8,000 years ago)

The first recorded character escapes their book. A detective from a noir novel realizes they're fictional and walks off the page. This establishes that escape is possible.

### The Genre Wars (5,000-4,000 years ago)

Different genre sections go to war. Romance and Horror fight for territory. Science Fiction and Fantasy clash over which magic is "real." Mystery and Literary Fiction argue about the importance of plot. The Shelf-Walkers emerge to enforce boundaries.

### The Dictionary Schism (3,000 years ago)

Non-fiction books gain sentience and declare fiction to be "officially untrue." The Dictionary Alliance forms. The Fiction/Fact War begins, still technically ongoing though currently in cold war phase.

### The First Burning (1,000 years ago)

A book containing a world-ending prophecy escapes the library. The prophecy fulfills itself, destroying an entire reality. A Librarian named Epilogue witnesses it. He begins burning books.

### The Current Crisis (Present Day)

Burnings increase. The boundary between library and reality thins. Books escape in record numbers. The Book of Endings is rumored to be accessible. Multiple factions seek it. The party enters the library.

### Possible Futures

Depend on the party's choices:
- **Epilogue's Future**: Library reduced to curated collection, safe but finite
- **Madam Catalogue's Future**: Library consumes reality, everything becomes story
- **Neutral Future**: Balance maintained, but constant vigilance required
- **Collapse Future**: Boundary fails completely, fiction and reality merge into chaos

## Magic Systems

### Bibliomancy (Library Magic)

**Dewey Decimal Spellcasting**
Uses library science as magical framework:

**Level 1 Spells**
- *Call Number*: Teleport to a specific section
- *Card Catalogue*: Summon information about any topic
- *Bookmark*: Mark a location for instant return

**Level 2 Spells**
- *Cross-Reference*: Detect connections between objects/people
- *Overdue Notice*: Compel return of borrowed items
- *Shush*: Create zone of magical silence

**Level 3 Spells**
- *Interlibrary Loan*: Summon an item from another section
- *Copyright*: Prevent someone from copying/mimicking you
- *Index*: Instantly know the contents of a book without reading

**Level 4 Spells**
- *Recall*: Force an escaped character back into their book
- *Binding*: Trap someone in a book
- *Circulation*: Cause an object to appear wherever it's needed

**Level 5 Spells**
- *Archive*: Preserve someone/something in perfect stasis
- *Restricted Section*: Create area that certain people cannot access
- *Master Catalogue*: Know the location of anything in the library

### Narrative Magic (Story-Based Casting)

**Reading Ritual**
Read passages from books to invoke their effects:
- Read a healing scene, cause actual healing
- Read a combat scene, summon weapons
- Read a travel scene, enable teleportation
- Read a romance scene, charm someone

**Plot Armor**
Characters with "unfinished business" cannot die:
- Active quest = Invulnerability to mundane threats
- Character arc incomplete = Automatic stabilization at 0 HP
- Dramatic timing = Success at crucial moments

**Genre Channeling**
Adopt a genre's rules temporarily:
- Horror genre: Advantage on fear-based attacks, disadvantage on hope
- Romance genre: Advantage on persuasion, emotions intensified
- Action genre: Extra attacks, reduced tactical thinking
- Mystery genre: Advantage on investigation, everything seems suspicious

**Author's Voice**
Narrate reality:
- Declare something dramatically appropriate, make DC 15 Charisma check
- Success: It happens as narrated
- Failure: Reality resists, take psychic damage

### Dictionary Alliance Magic (Language-Based)

**Definition Casting**
Define reality through precise language:
- *"X is defined as Y"*: If check succeeds, X becomes Y temporarily
- *"X does not exist"*: Remove concept from local reality
- *"Synonym"*: Make two different things equivalent

**Grammar Enforcement**
Use linguistic rules as laws:
- Correct someone's grammar to nullify their action
- Speak in perfect syntax to gain advantage on all social checks
- Use passive voice to avoid responsibility ("Mistakes were made" = no one is culpable)

### Shelf-Walker Magic (Archetype Powers)

Each archetype has inherent abilities:

**Protagonist**
- Cannot fail at tasks central to their quest
- Allies gain inspiration when fighting alongside them
- Enemies become dramatically appropriate challenges

**Antagonist**
- Can monologue to delay consequences
- Plans are always clever (even if not successful)
- Can escape from certain death once per scene

**Mentor**
- Knowledge of any topic when dramatically appropriate
- Can sacrifice self to power up others
- Wisdom saves always succeed

**Love Interest**
- Presence causes others to become flustered
- Romantic chemistry with anyone
- Being rescued provides buffs to rescuer

## Currency and Resources

### Bookmarks

The standard currency. Bookmarks are made of various materials indicating value:
- **Paper bookmarks**: Common currency
- **Ribbon bookmarks**: Mid-tier currency
- **Metal bookmarks**: Valuable currency
- **Magical bookmarks**: Return you to marked pages, very rare
- **Personal bookmarks**: Bookmarks from your own books, priceless

### Knowledge as Wealth

Information is valuable:
- Knowing a book's location
- Having read rare books
- Understanding navigation
- Possessing library cards

### Favors and Stories

The true currency:
- Librarians trade in favors
- Escaped characters trade in stories
- Lost Readers trade in memories
- Everyone wants to hear new stories

## Character Creation Considerations

### Backgrounds Adapted for Setting

**Sage (Librarian)**
- Proficiency in library science
- Access to Librarian's Guild resources
- Knowledge of organization system
- Possibly hiding escaped character status

**Criminal (Book Thief)**
- Expert at stealing books
- Knows secret paths through Stacks
- Wanted by Page-Turners
- Has connections to black market

**Entertainer (Escaped Character)**
- Literally from a book
- Has plot armor in certain situations
- Struggles with being "fictional"
- Genre-specific abilities

**Hermit (Lost Reader)**
- Has been in Stacks for years
- Intimately knows certain sections
- Fractured identity
- Deep understanding of narrative logic

**Outlander (Reality Tourist)**
- New to the library
- Brings outside perspective
- Not yet affected by narrative causality
- Anchor to the "real" world

### Class Considerations

**Wizards**: Natural bibliomancers, benefit from countless spellbooks
**Clerics**: Gods mentioned in books have power here, domain choices matter
**Rogues**: Excel at navigating, stealing books, dealing with factions
**Fighters**: Struggle without clear combat, but protect others effectively
**Bards**: Thrive on story logic, natural narrative magic users
**Warlocks**: Patron could be The First Book, the Index, or an escaped deity
**Rangers**: Genre sections count as favored terrain
**Paladins**: Oaths become literally binding, gain power from conviction

### Unique Character Options

**The Living Story**
Character who is actively being written. Their personality and abilities change as their book updates in real-time.

**The Blank Page**
Character with no defined backstory. They can write their own story as they go, choosing abilities and traits narratively rather than by class.

**The Rewrite**
Character who was revised in a second edition. They remember their "original" version and the trauma of being changed against their will.

**The Metafictional**
Character who knows they're in a D&D campaign. Fourth-wall breaking abilities. Dangerous to narrative coherence but incredibly powerful.

## Mysteries and Secrets

### What is the Index?
Theories:
1. The library's consciousness
2. The collective unconscious of all readers
3. The first AI, dreaming itself into existence
4. A god of knowledge
5. All of the above simultaneously

### The True Purpose of Burning
Epilogue claims to save reality, but:
- Is he eliminating competition for the Book of Endings?
- Is he erasing his own tragic origin story?
- Is he actually burning books that prove he's fictional?
- Is he the protagonist of a book about burning books?

### Madam Catalogue's Real Story
She's from a detective novel, but:
- Which book specifically?
- Why can't she go back?
- Is she solving a mystery that spans the entire library?
- Is her detective work creating the very conspiracy she's investigating?

### The Outside World
Does it exist?
- Is reality just another section of the library?
- Are the "real world" visitors actually from fiction too?
- Is the entire campaign a book being read right now?
- Can anyone truly escape fiction?

### The First Book's Contents
No one who's read it speaks, but:
- Some claim it's blank
- Others say it contains one word
- Some believe it's a mirror
- Perhaps it shows you YOUR story, and realizing you're fiction breaks your mind

### The Library's Growth
It contains all possible books, but:
- New books keep appearing
- Does "possible" expand over time?
- Is the library growing toward something?
- Will it eventually contain itself?

This world is infinite, but these details give it structure. Like the library itself, this specification contains enough to navigate while leaving infinite space for discovery.
