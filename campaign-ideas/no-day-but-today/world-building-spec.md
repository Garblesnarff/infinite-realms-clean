### **World-Building Specification Brief: No Day But Today**

**1. Core Concept:**
Struggling bohemian artists facing eviction and terminal illness in a gentrifying city must choose between artistic integrity and survival, finding love and meaning in their chosen family while time runs out.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the neighborhood's bohemian history—once affordable artists' community
*   Explain the gentrification wave—developers pushing out the poor and artists
*   Describe the wasting plague (AIDS crisis analog)—how it devastates the community
*   Write about the arts scene—underground performances, documentaries, street art
*   Detail support systems—community care, activist groups, chosen family networks
*   Explain the tension between selling out and selling art—commerce versus integrity
*   Describe protest culture and activism around housing and healthcare

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Bohemian Community** (Major) - Artists, performers, outcasts building chosen family
*   **The Developers** (Major) - Benny and investors pushing gentrification
*   **The Support Network** (Minor) - AIDS activists, support groups, community organizers
*   **The Street Community** (Minor) - Homeless, sex workers, street performers
*   **Former Idealists** (Minor) - Like Benny, sold out and justify it as helping
*   **The Arts Scene** (Minor) - Gallery owners, club promoters, fellow struggling artists

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Mark the Documentarian, Roger the Musician, Mimi the Dancer, Collins the Professor, Angel the Performer, Benny the Landlord
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Support Group Member," "Street Performer," "Club Regular," "Developer," "Former Lover," "Community Activist," "Nurse," "Gallery Owner"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Loft** - Condemned building, cold but theirs, creative hub of chosen family
*   **The Life Cafe** - Bohemian gathering place, protests and performances
*   **The Cat Scratch Club** - Where survival work happens, community of sex workers
*   **The Support Group** - Where those with plague find comfort and care
*   **The Lot** - Empty space, symbol of gentrification versus community control

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party accepts Benny's deal THEN survive comfortably but compromise principles
*   IF party fights eviction THEN solidarity but constant struggle for survival
*   IF character with plague doesn't manage condition THEN death becomes imminent
*   IF Angel dies THEN community fractures but may reunite through shared grief
*   IF party creates meaningful art THEN touches lives, builds legacy, matters beyond survival
*   IF party measures life in moments not money THEN finds meaning despite tragedy
