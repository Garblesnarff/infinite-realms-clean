## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc of fall, redemption, and philosophical triumph.

*   **Act I — Pride Before the Fall (Sessions 1–4):** Huo Yuanjia is the strongest fighter in the region, but his arrogance makes him reckless. The party witnesses him accept foolish challenges, provoke rivals, and measure worth only by victory. When he kills an opponent in a duel—not intentionally, but through careless brutality—the guilt begins to break him. Simultaneously, he's slowly being poisoned, his strength fading.
*   **Act II — The Spiritual Journey (Sessions 5–9):** Broken by guilt and illness, Huo retreats from the martial world. The party accompanies him to the countryside where a humble farmer and his daughter teach him about life beyond fighting. This is the philosophical heart of the campaign—learning that strength without wisdom is meaningless, that protecting others matters more than defeating them, and that true martial arts is about discipline, not dominance.
*   **Act III — The World Tournament (Sessions 10–15):** Huo returns to Shanghai transformed, establishing the Jingwu Association to teach martial philosophy. Foreign martial artists challenge Chinese masters, seeking to prove their superiority. The party must compete in a massive international tournament while investigating who poisoned Huo and why. The final fight is not just physical but philosophical—proving that honor, humility, and wisdom make a true martial artist.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Philosophy & Combat Integration**
*   Before major fights, there are philosophical exchanges.
*   The quality of the party's philosophy (Persuasion, Insight checks) can grant combat bonuses.
*   Defeating an opponent while embodying Huo's philosophy (not killing, showing restraint) grants additional rewards.

### 2. **The Poison Mechanic**
*   Huo (and potentially party members) suffer from slow-acting poison.
*   Track poison levels affecting maximum HP and abilities.
*   Finding and administering antidotes is a recurring challenge.
*   The poison adds urgency to the final act.

### 3. **Style vs. Style Tournament**
*   The international tournament features matchups between different martial arts styles.
*   Each style has mechanical differences (kung fu, karate, jujitsu, muay thai, savate, etc.).
*   Learning to adapt to different styles is key to victory.

### 4. **Transformation Mechanics**
*   Track Huo's character development from "Arrogant" to "Humble."
*   Party actions influence this meter.
*   The ending quality depends on whether the transformation is complete.
*   A fully transformed Huo can win through philosophy even as the poison weakens him physically.

### 5. **Cultural Pride vs. Respect**
*   Balance maintaining cultural identity with respecting other martial arts traditions.
*   Defeating foreign opponents while showing respect earns their friendship.
*   Defeating them with arrogance perpetuates the cycle of conflict.
