*A High-Stakes Gaming campaign — Medium Campaign (6-8 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Ten Pledges
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Social / Strategy / High-Stakes Gaming / Isekai
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **10-11**
**Tone (keywords):** clever, strategic, high-stakes, colorful, non-violent, mind-games
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party awakens in Disboard, a vibrant fantasy world governed by the Ten Pledges—absolute magical laws that forbid violence and mandate that all conflicts be resolved through games of chance, skill, or wit. To survive and thrive, the party must master this world's unique rules, challenge the Sixteen Races (each with their own magical advantages) in creative contests, and ultimately play their way to political power. Every dispute from territorial claims to romantic rivalries must be won at the gaming table, where clever strategy and reading your opponent matter more than swords and spells.

---

## Difficulty Context: Medium

This campaign challenges players to think creatively and strategically rather than relying on combat. The difficulty lies in:
- Designing winning strategies for various game types
- Reading opponents and identifying their advantages
- Managing resources (wagers) across multiple challenges
- Solving problems without traditional combat options

However, the campaign provides clear rules (the Ten Pledges) and opportunities for cleverness to overcome superior magical advantages.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions)

A strategic ascent through the hierarchy of games and power.

*   **Act I — Learning the Game (Sessions 1-3):** The party arrives in Disboard and must quickly learn the Ten Pledges and the gaming culture. They establish themselves by winning small-stakes games against local humans, then face their first major challenge: winning a territory dispute against a cheating noble. They must prove themselves worthy players in this new world.

*   **Act II — The Racial Tournament (Sessions 4-6):** Now recognized as skilled players, the party is invited to represent humanity in a grand tournament where each of the Sixteen Races sends their champions. They must face opponents with innate magical advantages—Elves who can detect lies, Dwarves who can manipulate probability, Flugel who can read minds—and find creative ways to overcome these cheats within the bounds of the Pledges.

*   **Act III — The Crown Game (Sessions 7-8):** The party discovers that the current human monarch is actually a puppet of another race, slowly gambling away humanity's remaining territories. In a climactic, multi-stage game, the party must challenge the monarch for the crown itself, using everything they've learned about strategy, bluffing, and exploiting loopholes in the Pledges to secure humanity's future.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Welcome to Disboard"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / World-Building / Tutorial Game
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens in a colorful, impossible city where violence is literally impossible (the Ten Pledges prevent it).
    *   They meet Stephanie Dola, a frustrated noble who explains the world: everything is decided by games, and humanity is losing.
    *   Tutorial encounter: A simple dice game against a tavern regular teaches them the basics of challenging, wagering, and the binding nature of game outcomes.
*   **Escalation:** They witness a human lose his entire shop in a rigged card game. Stephanie begs them to help recover it, introducing them to the concept that while violence is forbidden, cheating is fair game if you can't prove it.

### Session 2 — "The Cheater's Gambit"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / First Major Challenge
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party investigates how the tavern regular has been winning so consistently (sleight of hand, marked cards, accomplices).
    *   They must prepare their counter-strategy: either expose the cheating or out-cheat the cheater.
    *   The rematch: A tense card game where the party must use clever tactics to overcome the rigged deck.
*   **Escalation:** They win back the shop, earning respect, but attract the attention of a vindictive Elven merchant who wants to put the "uppity humans" in their place.

### Session 3 — "Truth and Lies"
*   **Focus:** Facing Magical Advantage / Creative Problem-Solving
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Elven merchant challenges them to a game of questions and answers, where lies can be magically detected—an impossible game for humans to win fairly.
    *   The party must find a loophole: speaking only truths that mislead, using wordplay, or finding a way to obscure the Elf's detection magic.
    *   They wager something precious (perhaps their freedom or Stephanie's family estate) to raise the stakes.
*   **Escalation:** Victory earns them an invitation to the Grand Racial Tournament, but also makes them enemies among the Elvenkind, who see humanity as inferior.

### Session 4 — "The Tournament of Sixteen"
*   **Focus:** Tournament Arc Begins / Multiple Challenges
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives at the tournament grounds, a massive interdimensional arena where all sixteen races gather.
    *   Round One: They face the Dwarven champions in a probability manipulation game (like enhanced craps), where the Dwarves can subtly alter dice outcomes.
    *   The party must use misdirection, psychology, and creative interpretation of the game rules to win.
*   **Escalation:** They advance but learn that the tournament's true purpose is to determine which race will gain a massive territorial concession from humanity's dwindling lands.

### Session 5 — "Mind Games"
*   **Focus:** Psychological Warfare / High-Stakes Bluffing
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Semi-finals: The party faces the Flugel, angelic beings who can read surface thoughts, in a strategic board game.
    *   This is the ultimate bluffing challenge—they must think in layers, using false thoughts as decoys while hiding their true strategy deeper in their minds.
    *   Introduce a mechanic where players must write down their "surface thoughts" vs. their "true strategy."
*   **Escalation:** Victory comes at a cost: they must reveal a secret or truth about themselves to proceed, creating personal vulnerability.

### Session 6 — "The Finals"
*   **Focus:** Epic Game / All Skills Combined
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The finals pit them against a mysterious masked champion representing the Werebeasts, known for their incredible instincts and ability to read micro-expressions.
    *   The game is a complex, multi-layered challenge combining elements of all previous games.
    *   The party must use everything they've learned: anti-cheating measures, psychological manipulation, creative rule interpretation, and perfect teamwork.
*   **Escalation:** They win the tournament, securing humanity's territory, but discover evidence that the human king has been throwing games deliberately—betraying his own people.

### Session 7 — "The King's Gambit"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Conspiracy Uncovered
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party investigates the king and discovers he's under a magical compulsion from the Eastern Union (Werebeasts), slowly gambling away humanity's freedom.
    *   They must gather evidence and allies from other races who respect fair play.
    *   Stephanie reveals her family's history: her grandfather was the last great human player, and she has his secret journals on game theory.
*   **Escalation:** The king, knowing he's been discovered, challenges them to a game for the crown itself—if they lose, they'll be exiled from Disboard forever.

### Session 8 — "The Crown Game"
*   **Focus:** Climactic Multi-Stage Game / Campaign Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The final game is a three-stage challenge designed by the king to be unwinnable:
        * Stage 1: A speed chess variant where the king has magical assistance
        * Stage 2: A reality-altering game where the environment itself changes based on moves
        * Stage 3: A pure bluffing game where the stakes are memories and identity itself
    *   The party must identify and counter each stage's hidden trick while protecting their most precious wagers.
    *   The climax reveals the king was trying to lose all along—leaving clues for worthy successors to free him from the compulsion.
*   **Resolution:** Victory means the party can either claim the throne themselves, install Stephanie as queen, or establish a council of champions. Humanity has a future again in Disboard.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is fundamentally about asymmetrical competition—how cleverness and creativity can overcome raw power. The central conflict is humanity's struggle to survive in a world where they have no magical advantages, facing races that can read minds, detect lies, manipulate probability, and cheat with impunity. It's a story about using rules to your advantage, finding loopholes, and proving that intelligence and teamwork can triumph over individual power. The philosophical question: is a world without violence truly peaceful, or does it just move conflict to a different battlefield?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Ten Pledges** (Absolute Laws)
The Ten Pledges are magically enforced laws that govern all of Disboard:
1. All killing, war, and violence is forbidden
2. All conflict shall be resolved through games
3. In games, each player will wager something of equal value
4. Rules and wagers must be decided by mutual agreement
5. The challenged party has the right to decide the game
6. Any wager made in accordance with the Pledges must be upheld
7. Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives
8. Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss
9. In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed
10. Let's all have fun together!

These create interesting constraints:
- Combat is completely unavailable as a solution
- Every challenge requires wagering something of value
- Cheating is allowed if you don't get caught
- The "equal value" rule means you can't be forced into unfair wagers

### 2. **Game Challenge Resolution System**
When the party enters a game challenge, use this framework:
*   **Intelligence Check (DC varies):** To understand the game's rules and identify possible strategies
*   **Investigation Check:** To spot if opponents are cheating and how
*   **Insight Check:** To read opponents and predict their strategies
*   **Deception/Performance Check:** For bluffing and psychological manipulation
*   **Specific Game Skill:** Depending on the game (Sleight of Hand for cards, relevant tool proficiency, etc.)

Success isn't just winning the game, but identifying and countering opponent advantages.

### 3. **Racial Advantages** (Opponent Abilities)
Different races have inherent magical abilities that give them unfair advantages:
*   **Elves:** Can detect lies and falsehoods
*   **Dwarves:** Can subtly manipulate probability and chance
*   **Flugel:** Can read surface thoughts
*   **Werebeasts:** Can detect micro-expressions and physical tells
*   **Humans:** No magical advantages (must rely on creativity and teamwork)

The party must identify these advantages and find creative counters that don't violate the Pledges.

### 4. **Wager Economy**
Everything has value in Disboard, and all games require equal wagers:
*   **Tangible:** Money, property, territory, possessions
*   **Intangible:** Memories, abilities, even identity itself
*   **Rights:** Freedom, titles, privileges

Players must carefully manage what they wager, as lost bets are magically enforced. This creates tension in deciding what to risk for what reward.
