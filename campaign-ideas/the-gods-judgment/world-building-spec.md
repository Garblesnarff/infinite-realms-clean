### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The God's Judgment**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A supernatural artifact called the Death Ledger kills anyone whose true name is written in it. A vigilante named Kira uses it to execute criminals, creating a cult following and a safer but fear-based world. The party must hunt Kira in an intellectual battle where one mistake means death, while questioning whether Kira's brutal efficiency is preferable to traditional justice. The campaign explores absolute power, moral authority, and whether the ends justify the means.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:** Detail the Death Ledger's origin (fell from death god's realm), its rules (true name + face = death in 60 seconds), chronicle Kira's rise (first kills were justice, now include innocents), explain public reaction (cult of Kira vs. those who fear tyranny), describe the death entity's nature (amoral observer enjoying human drama), detail the escalation (second Ledger, eyes that see names, accomplices).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Investigation Team (Players):** Hunt Kira while protecting identities; must balance effectiveness with morality.
*   **Kira's Followers:** Cult believing Kira is divine justice; provide support and shield Kira.
*   **The Authorities:** Officially hunt Kira but politically pressured; public loves Kira's results.
*   **The Criminal Underworld:** Terrified of Kira; willing to help investigators despite being criminals.
*   **The Death Entities:** Supernatural beings who own Ledgers; amoral, amused by human chaos.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Kira (vigilante mastermind), Death Entity (supernatural observer), Lead Detective (rival investigator), Kira's Ally (second Ledger user), Authority Figure (conflicted official).
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Kira Cultist," "Criminal Target," "Innocent Victim," "Investigator," "Media Figure."

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Investigation HQ:** Secret facility with evidence boards, surveillance tech, hidden from Kira.
*   **Kira's Territory:** Academy, office, or residence where they operate undetected.
*   **Public Shrine to Kira:** Where followers worship; symbolizes public support.
*   **Communication Hub:** Where Kira broadcasts messages to the world.
*   **Supernatural Realm:** Origin of the Ledgers; otherworldly, death-themed.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF Kira learns party names:** Immediate death threat; must fake deaths or hide.
*   **IF party uses illegal methods:** Morality shifts toward tyranny; affects ending.
*   **IF crime rate drops significantly:** Public supports Kira more; pressure increases.
*   **IF party captures Kira's ally:** Gain intelligence but Kira escalates.
*   **IF party reveals Kira kills innocents:** Public opinion shifts; investigation easier.
*   **IF party member takes the Ledger:** Becomes new Kira; tragic cycle ending.
