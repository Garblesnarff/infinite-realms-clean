# Creative Brief: The Gray Veil Town

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Foggy Realism Transforms to Industrial Nightmare

Inspired by Silent Hill's iconic aesthetic, this style contrasts two realities: the Fog World (abandoned normalcy shrouded in mist) and the Otherworld (rusted industrial hellscape of blood and decay). Both are rendered with photorealistic detail that makes the horror visceral.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Two Worlds:** Fog World is eerie but recognizable. Otherworld is nightmarish—rust, blood, barbed wire, industrial decay.
*   **Symbolic Monsters:** Creatures represent psychological concepts, not just random horror.
*   **Oppressive Atmosphere:** Fog limits visibility. Darkness and rust create claustrophobia.
*   **Personal Horror:** Imagery should feel intimate and deeply wrong, like seeing your trauma made flesh.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Psychological horror, fog, guilt, rust, blood, symbolic, surreal, oppressive, intimate terror, Otherworld.
*   **Feeling:** Lost in a nightmare that knows your secrets. The town judges you and finds you wanting.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Fog World:** Realistic small-town America architecture softened by mist. Soft edges, muted details.
*   **Otherworld:** Hard edges, industrial geometry, rust textures, wire mesh, bloodstained surfaces. Everything is angular and hostile.
*   **Monsters:** Surreal, symbolic designs combining human and abstract elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Photorealistic illustration of a small-town street in perpetual fog. Buildings are normal but abandoned. The fog is so thick you can barely see 20 feet. Everything is muted, grayscale, and silent."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Fog World:** Desaturated grays, browns, muted greens. Everything washed out by fog. Occasional warm light from windows (empty inside).
*   **Otherworld:** Rust reds, dark browns, sickly yellows, black. Blood-stained surfaces everywhere. The only bright color is fresh blood.
*   **Emotional Effect:** Fog World is melancholic, lonely. Otherworld is viscerally horrific.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Otherworld version: rusted metal replaces walls, surfaces are covered in dried blood and grime, chain-link fences with barbed wire, sickly yellow emergency lighting, fresh blood pooling on grated floors."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Realistic, showing strain and exhaustion. Clothing becomes ragged as sessions progress.
*   **Monsters (Symbolic):**
    *   **Nurses:** Faceless, in stained uniforms, representing medical trauma.
    *   **Pyramid Head:** Massive executioner with oversized blade and a pyramid-shaped metal helmet, unkillable.
    *   **Lying Figures:** Body-shaped masses in straightjackets, representing suppressed truth.
    *   **Mannequins:** Partial human forms, representing objectification or dismemberment of identity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Silent Hill-style monster: a humanoid nurse with no face, head tilted at an unnatural angle, wearing a blood-stained white uniform, moving with jerky, inhuman movements through a fog-shrouded hospital corridor."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Fog World:** Realistic small town—main street, hospital, school, church, apartments. Everything abandoned, foggy, lit by weak daylight or street lamps.
*   **Otherworld:** Same locations transformed into industrial nightmare—rusty metal, blood, wire, darkness, sounds of grinding metal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Otherworld hospital: corridors of rusted metal mesh walls, floors of bloodstained grating, ceiling of exposed pipes dripping red liquid, flickering industrial lights, distant sound of metal scraping."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Fog World:** Diffuse, weak light. No harsh shadows, just gradual fade into fog. Eternal twilight.
*   **Otherworld:** Harsh, industrial lighting—bare bulbs, sparking wires, emergency lights, deep shadows. Light is aggressive, not comforting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Lit by a single flickering emergency light casting harsh shadows. The fog creates visible light beams. Beyond 10 feet, only darkness and shapes that might be monsters or debris."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Fog World:** Use fog to limit frame, creating claustrophobic compositions even in open spaces.
*   **Otherworld:** Use industrial elements (wire, pipes, rust) to create geometric, cage-like compositions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "First-person perspective walking down a fog-shrouded street. Buildings fade into gray on both sides. At the edge of vision, a silhouette that might be human stands motionless, watching."

## Voice

A haunting, ethereal female voice with no specific accent, sounding distant and echoing as if heard through water or fog. The tone is melancholic and accusatory, like a conscience given voice. Pacing is slow, deliberate, with long pauses that force reflection. Emotion shifts from sorrowful to condemning. Audio quality includes environmental effects: radio static, distant air-raid sirens, metallic scraping, and the ever-present sound of footsteps that might not be your own. Role: The voice of Gray Veil itself, speaking truths you don't want to hear, offering judgment you can't escape.
