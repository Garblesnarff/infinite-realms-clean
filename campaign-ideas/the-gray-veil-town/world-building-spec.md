### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Gray Veil Town**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party is mysteriously drawn to Gray Veil, a fog-shrouded town that manifests personal guilt and trauma as physical reality. The town exists in multiple layers: the Fog World (abandoned normalcy), the Otherworld (nightmarish industrial hellscape), and the Core (pure manifestation of collective suffering). Each character faces personalized horror based on their backstory and must confront their deepest guilt to escape, knowing the town will not release them until they achieve genuine repentance or succumb to madness.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Gray Veil's origins as a normal town built on sacred ground where a Native American cult once performed rituals of atonement.
    *   Chronicle the catastrophe 20 years ago: a doomsday cult performed a ritual sacrifice believing it would bring purification, instead creating a permanent link to the Otherworld.
    *   Explain the nature of the town as a living entity: it draws those with unresolved guilt through mysterious letters, manifestations, or compulsion.
    *   Describe the Otherworld as a dimension overlapping our reality, where psychological trauma becomes physical law.
    *   Detail the symbolic monsters: each is a manifestation of specific traumas (medical horror, violence, sexual abuse, abandonment, etc.).
    *   Explain why some visitors become monsters themselves, permanent residents, or manage to escape based on how they confront their guilt.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Visitors (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Escape Gray Veil, find whatever drew them here, survive, and confront personal guilt.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure. United by shared predicament.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Find missing people or solve the mystery.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has personal guilt they're hiding, even from each other. The town knows and will expose it.
        *   **Assets:** Whatever they brought, weapons found in town, their wits, and potential for psychological growth.
        *   **Relationships:** Initially cooperative; tested by personal revelations; may fracture if guilt is too shameful.
    *   **The Town (Gray Veil Itself)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Force confession and atonement, feed on suffering and guilt, maintain its existence.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The town is a singular entity with the Otherworld as its true form and monsters as its antibodies.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. It appears abandoned.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To judge visitors and either purify them through suffering or consume them permanently.
        *   **Assets:** Control over reality within its bounds, manifestation of fears, Otherworld transitions, unkillable symbolic monsters.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to those who deny guilt; offers escape to those who truly repent; neutral to those who accept their nature.
    *   **The Order / The Cult (Historical)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Were seeking to bring about purification through suffering and rebirth.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by Dahlia Gillespie; inner circle of true believers; outer circle of manipulated followers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Religious salvation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Believed pain and guilt were the path to divinity, created the catastrophe intentionally.
        *   **Assets:** None remaining; all dead. But their ritual's effects persist.
        *   **Relationships:** Created the current situation; some members may persist as ghosts or manifestations.
    *   **The Lost** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Previous visitors who failed to escape, now part of the town.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No structure. Each exists in their personal hell or has become a monster.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Some offer warnings. Others are hostile.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some want company in damnation. Others genuinely want to help newcomers escape.
        *   **Assets:** Knowledge of the town, supernatural abilities tied to their transformation.
        *   **Relationships:** Some are potential allies; others are cautionary tales; some have become the monsters hunting the party.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A character's Guilt reaches 8 or higher.
    *   **THEN:** They trigger frequent Otherworld transitions and encounter Pyramid Head, who stalks them relentlessly. Generate personalized encounters where they must hide or flee, as he cannot be defeated.
    *   **IF:** A character genuinely confesses their guilt to another party member (roleplay required).
    *   **THEN:** Reduce their Guilt by 2 points. Their personalized monsters become less aggressive. Grant a moment of respite.
    *   **IF:** A character denies their guilt when confronted by a manifestation.
    *   **THEN:** Increase Guilt by 1. Their monsters become more aggressive and numerous. The town becomes more hostile.
    *   **IF:** The air-raid siren sounds.
    *   **THEN:** Immediate transition to Otherworld for all characters. Generate chaotic transformation of environment and immediate monster threat.
    *   **IF:** A character achieves Guilt 0 through genuine repentance and acceptance.
    *   **THEN:** The town releases them. They find a path out of the fog. However, they carry the emotional weight of what they've accepted.
    *   **IF:** A character rejects escape and chooses to stay in Gray Veil.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an ending where they become part of the town—either as a helpful ghost warning future visitors or transforming into a monster representing their unresolved guilt.
