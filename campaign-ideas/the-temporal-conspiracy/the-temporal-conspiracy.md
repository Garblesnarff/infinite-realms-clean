# The Temporal Conspiracy
**Tagline:** *"Time is not a river, but a battlefield—and someone is rewriting history."*

## Campaign Overview

The players are recruited by the Chronal Conclave, a secret organization that monitors and protects the timeline from those who would abuse temporal magic. When historical events begin changing without explanation—battles won that should have been lost, kingdoms falling centuries too early, heroes dying before their destined moments—the party must become time-traveling investigators to uncover a vast conspiracy that spans millennia.

As they jump between eras using ancient chronomantic portals, the players discover that reality itself is being edited by a cabal of rogue time travelers known as the Revisionist Council. These powerful entities believe they can perfect history by "correcting" its mistakes, but their interference is creating cascading paradoxes that threaten to unravel the fabric of existence. The party must race against time itself, literally, to stop the Revisionists while avoiding their own erasure from history.

The campaign features a unique mechanic where changes to the timeline affect the players' present, forcing them to adapt to an ever-shifting reality where allies may become enemies, and their own backstories can be rewritten.

## Core Themes
