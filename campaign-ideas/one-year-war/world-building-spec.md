### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**One Year War**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party consists of soldiers or civilians caught in the devastating One Year War between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon—a conflict fought with mobile suits (giant mechanized armor). As they pilot these machines of war, they witness atrocities on both sides, lose friends to senseless violence, and some discover they are Newtypes—evolved humans with psychic abilities that make them ace pilots but force them to feel their enemies' deaths. The campaign explores whether war can ever be justified and whether understanding your enemy makes killing them harder or easier.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Universal Century calendar, beginning with humanity's migration to space colonies (massive O'Neill cylinders orbiting Earth). Overpopulation on Earth forced billions to emigrate.
    *   Write the history of Zeon Zum Deikun, philosopher who preached Spacenoid independence and Newtype evolution. His death (assassination by the Zabi family) sparked the independence movement.
    *   Describe the Zabi family's rise to power in the Principality of Zeon, transforming a philosophical movement into a militaristic fascist state.
    *   Detail Operation British, the war's opening move—Zeon dropping a space colony on Earth, killing three billion people. The ultimate war crime.
    *   Explain Newtype theory—humans who live in space will evolve psychic abilities (spatial awareness, empathy, precognition), representing the next stage of human evolution.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Earth Federation Forces (EFF)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain Earth's dominance over space colonies; crush the Zeon rebellion.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military hierarchy led by General Revil, with bureaucrats and corrupt politicians influencing decisions.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Defend Earth from colonial terrorists; preserve peace and unity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Maintain Earth's political and economic exploitation of Spacenoids; suppress colonial independence movements.
        *   **Assets:** Numerical superiority, Luna II base, eventually superior mobile suits (Gundam, GM), Solar System superweapon.
        *   **Relationships:** Earth's defenders but also colonial oppressors; commit war crimes in the name of order.
    *   **Principality of Zeon** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Achieve independence for space colonies; prove Spacenoid superiority through Newtype evolution.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Sovereign Degwin Zabi (figurehead), his children control military branches—Gihren (supreme commander, fascist), Dozle (space fleet, honorable), Kycilia (intelligence, ruthless), Garma (Earth forces, inexperienced).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Liberation of Spacenoids from Earth oppression; create a homeland for evolved humanity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Gihren seeks total domination, not just independence—willing to commit genocide. The Zabi family murdered Zeon Deikun to seize power.
        *   **Assets:** Superior early mobile suits (Zaku, Gouf, Dom), asteroid fortresses (Solomon, A Baoa Qu), superweapons (colony laser).
        *   **Relationships:** Freedom fighters who commit atrocities; fascist state using liberation rhetoric.
    *   **Flanagan Institute** (Minor - Research)
        *   **Goals:** Study and weaponize Newtype abilities for military advantage.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Controlled by Zeon, led by Dr. Flanagan. Federation has similar programs.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Understand human evolution in space environments.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Create Cyber-Newtypes—artificially enhanced humans through drugs and surgery, treating people as weapons.
        *   **Assets:** Psychic research, experimental Newtype mobile suits, unwilling test subjects.
        *   **Relationships:** Both factions use them; morally abhorrent to natural Newtypes.
    *   **Zeon Remnants** (Minor - Post-War)
        *   **Goals:** Continue the war through guerrilla operations; refuse to accept defeat.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized cells of die-hard soldiers, some led by surviving aces.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—operate as terrorists after the ceasefire.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Revenge, ideology, or inability to return to peacetime life.
        *   **Assets:** Stolen mobile suits, hidden bases, fanatical loyalty.
        *   **Relationships:** Terrorists to the Federation; heroes or embarrassments to former Zeon citizens.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**

    *   **Bright Noa:** Young Federation captain, forced into command, learns leadership through loss. Strict but caring.
    *   **Ramba Ral:** Honorable Zeon ace, veteran of the Deikun era, fights for ideals not the Zabis. Dies nobly.
    *   **General Revil:** Federation's top commander, gruff but competent, famous for "Zeon is exhausted" speech that rallies humanity.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party prevents a war crime (stops poison gas attack, protects civilians, exposes false-flag operation).
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where their own faction labels them insubordinate. They're reassigned to dangerous missions or face court-martial, but gain moral integrity and respect from some NPCs.
    *   **IF:** The party commits or allows a war crime.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where they advance in rank and receive commendations, but PTSD increases, Newtype abilities may malfunction (psychic backlash from guilt), and honorable NPCs distance themselves.
    *   **IF:** A party member awakens as a Newtype.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scene where military scientists want to study/exploit them. They gain psychic flashes in combat but also feel enemies' fear and pain when killing. Lalah or enemy Newtypes reach out psychically.
    *   **IF:** The party kills Lalah Sune.
    *   **THEN:** Generate Char's rage and grief. He becomes obsessed with destroying the party. All Newtypes feel the psychic shockwave of her death. The party carries guilt for killing someone who wanted peace.
    *   **IF:** The party spares Lalah or helps her escape.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where she defects and provides intelligence on Zeon, but Char considers it a betrayal. She survives the war and becomes a peace advocate, proving Newtypes can transcend conflict.
    *   **IF:** The party defects from their faction.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where they're hunted by both sides as deserters. They fight to expose war crimes or protect civilians, becoming legends to some, traitors to others. The war ends with them in hiding, but morally intact.
    *   **IF:** The party sides with Char's revenge against the Zabis.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where Char's true identity is revealed. The party helps assassinate Zabi family members, changing Zeon's leadership. War may end differently but at the cost of their souls.

**7. Mobile Suit Roster & Progression**
*   **Directive:** Generate stat blocks for mobile suits the party can pilot, with progression from mass-production to ace customs.
*   **Federation Mobile Suits:**
    *   **RGM-79 GM:** Mass-production model, reliable but unremarkable. Party starts here.
    *   **RX-78-2 Gundam:** Prototype, superior performance, learning computer that improves with pilot. Rare—only one exists.
    *   **Custom Ace Units:** Late-war, party receives custom GMs with upgraded weapons/armor based on their combat style.
*   **Zeon Mobile Suits:**
    *   **MS-06 Zaku II:** Mass-production, versatile, party starts here. Variants: Commander type (better sensors), Sniper (long-range).
    *   **MS-07B Gouf:** Melee specialist with heat sword and finger gatling guns.
    *   **MS-14 Gelgoog:** Elite late-war suit, equal to Gundam.
    *   **Custom Ace Units:** Painted in personal colors (red for Char, blue for rivals), upgraded thrusters or weapons.
*   **Upgrade Mechanics:** As party gains ace reputation, they receive:
    *   Custom paint schemes (mechanical bonuses + intimidation)
    *   Upgraded weapons (beam sabers, bazookas, sniper rifles)
    *   Enhanced thrusters (better mobility)
    *   Learning computers (adapt to pilot's style)

**8. Newtype Mechanics**
*   **Directive:** Create rules for psychic awakening and abilities.
*   **Awakening Triggers:** Extreme stress in combat, near-death experience, or psychic contact with another Newtype.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Psychic Flashes:** Advantage on initiative, sense ambushes before they occur.
    *   **Predictive Targeting:** Bonus to attack rolls as you predict enemy movements.
    *   **Empathic Burden:** When killing with Newtype powers active, you feel the victim's fear/pain/final thoughts. Make a Wisdom save or gain exhaustion/trauma.
    *   **Newtype Communication:** Psychic contact with other Newtypes across distances—share emotions, intentions, memories without words.
*   **Combat Integration:** Newtype abilities make you a better killer, but the psychic cost increases with each kill—leading to PTSD, guilt, or eventual breakdown unless the character finds meaning beyond war.
