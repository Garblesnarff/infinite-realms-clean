*   **The Mirror Tower** - Prison showing each child's true family proving "abandonment"
*   Each location represents different aspects of imprisonment, manipulation, and yearning for freedom

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Rapunzel leaves the tower unwillingly THEN psychological damage may be permanent
*   IF Mother Gothel's gaslighting is exposed THEN her control over prisoners weakens
*   IF the Tower Guardian is destroyed THEN all prisoners might die with binding
*   IF Rapunzel's hair is cut THEN healing magic ends but so does Gothel's power source
*   IF Eugene reaches Rapunzel first THEN Gothel uses him to "prove" world is dangerous
*   IF other prisoners are contacted THEN alliance or warning depending on conditioning level
*   IF Gothel is killed normally THEN magic backlash might harm all connected prisoners
*   IF Rapunzel learns the truth too quickly THEN psychological break is possible
*   IF the lantern festival connection is made THEN Rapunzel realizes her true parentage
*   IF Cassandra is deprogrammed THEN powerful ally but also shows difficulty of recovery
*   IF the sundrop flower's magic is studied THEN understanding of Rapunzel's importance grows
*   IF all towers are freed simultaneously THEN Gothel's power collapses but chaos results
*   IF Rapunzel chooses to stay THEN party must respect agency even in imprisonment
*   IF the binding magic is broken THEN some prisoners integrated too deeply may not survive
*   IF Gothel's immortality is severed THEN her true age catches up catastrophically
