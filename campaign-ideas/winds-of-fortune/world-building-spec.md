# World-Building Specification: Winds of Fortune

## Faction Details

### The Bamboo Clan (Natural Suit)
Philosophy: Growth, flexibility, connection to nature. Bamboo people believe in organic matching—finding partners through natural affinity rather than forced combination. Environmentalists and traditionalists.

### The Character Clan (Cultural Suit)
Philosophy: Wisdom, tradition, written knowledge. Character people value intellectual matching—partners who share understanding and values. Scholars and historians.

### The Dot Clan (Material Suit)
Philosophy: Wealth, abundance, practical matters. Dot people seek matches based on mutual benefit and resource sharing. Merchants and pragmatists.

### The Wind Kingdoms (Four Directional Powers)
**East Kingdom**: Leadership, beginnings, dealer position. Most powerful politically. Conservative.
**South Kingdom**: Growth, passion, rebellion. Revolutionary faction. Emotional and impulsive.
**West Kingdom**: Change, wisdom, mediation. Philosophical neutrals. Accept evolution.
**North Kingdom**: Endings, completion, finality. Death-focused but not evil. Understand cycles.

### The Dragon Triad
Red, Green, White dragons—ancient entities predating the tile system. They created the 144-tile reality but now question whether it was wise. Hold ultimate secrets.

### The Honor Purists
Tiles that only match with honor tiles (winds and dragons), rejecting simple suits. Elitist faction believing some tiles are inherently superior. Cause social conflict.

### The Terminal Society
1s and 9s of each suit—the endpoint tiles. Believe beginnings and endings are most important, middle numbers are less significant. Work toward Thirteen Orphans hand.

### The All-Chow Movement
Reject pungs (identical matching) in favor of chows (sequential matching). Believe flow and sequence are superior to rigid sameness. Progressive faction.

### The Kong Dominance
Four-of-a-kind tiles who have achieved maximum matching. Powerful but inflexible. Represent strength through total commitment to one identity.

### The 145th Tile Collective
Those who accept and protect the impossible 145th tile. Believe it represents evolution beyond the 144 limitation. Hunted by traditionalists.

## The Revelation

The 144-tile system is not natural law—it was created by the Three Dragons to bring order to infinite chaos. Before the Wall, tiles existed in countless forms with infinite matching possibilities. The dragons reduced infinity to 144 to make existence comprehensible.

The 145th tile is not corruption—it's evolution. It represents the system's attempt to grow beyond its original limitations. Accepting it means entering a new era of tiles (145, then 146, then infinite again—but consciously chosen infinity rather than primordial chaos).

The Four Winds are compass points the dragons created to orient tiles in space. Without winds, no direction exists—freedom but also disorientation.

Completing a hand (achieving mahjong) forces the player to discard their identity into the Wall, becoming part of the structure that imprisons others. The "victory" is actually sacrifice—completing yourself means becoming building material for the system.

True transcendence requires:
1. Accept incompletion as valuable (reject mahjong victory)
2. Embrace the 145th tile (evolution beyond 144)
3. Free the dragons (let them leave the system they created)
4. Rotate beyond the Four Winds (find fifth direction—center/within)

The final hand is not Thirteen Orphans or any traditional combination—it's a hand that includes the 145th tile and creates new matching rules. This hand doesn't "win" the game; it transforms the game into something else entirely.
