# Winds of Fortune
*"144 tiles hold the universe. Four Winds guide destiny. Match three and claim fate itself."*

## Campaign Overview

The Mahjong Dynasty exists in a realm where reality is composed of exactly 144 sacred tiles divided into suits (Bamboo, Characters, Dots), honors (Four Winds—East, South, West, North), and dragons (Red, Green, White). All citizens are living tiles who must find matching partners (pungs of 3 identical tiles or chows of 3 sequential tiles) to achieve completion. An incomplete tile is an incomplete person—fragmented and suffering.

The cosmic structure follows the Four Winds representing cardinal directions and seasons: East Wind (spring, beginning, leadership), South Wind (summer, passion, growth), West Wind (autumn, change, harvest), North Wind (winter, wisdom, endings). Players sit at positions aligned with winds, and winds rotate in sacred sequence. The dealer sits at East, holding power and responsibility.

The campaign begins when the Wall—the arrangement of 144 tiles that should never change in count—is discovered to have 145 tiles. An impossible extra tile that shouldn't exist. Then tiles start spontaneously changing suits (a Bamboo becoming a Character). Winds blow in wrong directions (North Wind from the south). Someone is manipulating the sacred tile-matching reality. The party must master pungs, chows, kongs (four matching tiles), and special hands (all pungs, all chows, seven pairs, thirteen orphans), navigate the rotating winds, and discover who created the 145th tile and what it represents—perhaps a new suit beyond the traditional three, or proof that the 144-tile system is a prison.

## Core Themes

- **Pattern and Matching**: Finding complementary elements
- **The Four Winds**: Directional philosophy and seasonal cycles
- **Suits and Dragons**: Different philosophical traditions
- **Completion and Incompletion**: The suffering of being unmatched
- **Honor vs. Simple Tiles**: Complexity versus simplicity
- **The Wall**: Structure that both supports and imprisons

## Campaign Sessions (36 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Wall Breaks (Sessions 1-9)
Discovery of the 145th tile. Learning mahjong mechanics—forming pungs, chows, and complete hands. Introduction to the Four Wind Kingdoms. Investigation into the impossible extra tile. First rotating winds experience.

### Arc 2: The Four Winds War (Sessions 10-20)
Conflict between the Four Wind Kingdoms. East Wind claims supremacy as dealer. South Wind challenges with passion. West Wind offers wisdom and change. North Wind brings ending and renewal. Party must navigate political intrigue while completing increasingly complex tile hands.

### Arc 3: The Dragon Ascension (Sessions 21-30)
Discovery that the three dragons (Red, Green, White) are ancient entities predating the winds. They hold secrets about the original purpose of the tile system. Party must collect dragon tiles to access forbidden knowledge. Revelation about the 145th tile.

### Arc 4: The Perfect Hand (Sessions 31-36)
Final arc where party attempts to form the legendary Thirteen Orphans hand or other special combinations. Discovery that completing the perfect hand either solidifies the 144-tile reality or transcends it into the 145-tile universe. Climactic choice about whether to preserve tradition or embrace evolution.

## Key NPCs

### The East Wind Emperor (Dong Huang)
Dealer of reality, sits at East position. Believes East Wind (spring, beginning, leadership) is supreme. Controls the draw cycle and enforces traditional tile laws. Conservative and authoritarian.

### The South Wind Rebellion (Nan Fury)
Passionate revolutionary from South Kingdom (summer, growth, passion). Believes the tile system restricts freedom. Leader of those seeking to break the Wall and create new matching rules.

### The West Wind Sage (Xi Wisdom)
Philosopher from West Kingdom (autumn, change, harvest). Teaches that change is natural and the 145th tile represents evolution, not corruption. Neutral mediator attempting to prevent war.

### The North Wind Finisher (Bei Terminus)
Ancient entity from North Kingdom (winter, endings, completion). Believes the 145th tile signals the end of the current cosmic cycle and the beginning of a new one. Apocalyptic prophet or visionary?

### The Red Dragon (Zhong)
One of three dragon honor tiles. Represents passion, fire, and transformation. Guards secrets about the tile system's origins. Cryptic and dangerous.

### The Green Dragon (Fa Cai)
Represents growth, nature, and prosperity. More benevolent than Red Dragon but still mysterious. Knows the location of the 145th tile and its true purpose.

### The White Dragon (Bai Ban)
Represents purity, emptiness, and potential. The blank tile. Some believe it IS the 145th tile, or that it can become any tile. Most enigmatic of the three dragons.

### The Tile Matcher (Pung Master)
NPC who has achieved perfect matching—always finds two others identical to themselves, forming complete pungs. Teaches the party advanced matching techniques but is dogmatic about traditional rules.

### The Sequence Seeker (Chow Dancer)
Specializes in sequential matching (chow)—finding tiles that flow in numerical order. Represents fluidity versus the rigid identical matching of pungs. More flexible philosophically.

### The Kong Enforcer (Four-of-a-Kind)
Has achieved kong status—four identical tiles. Immensely powerful but inflexible. Represents the apex of traditional matching but also its limitation (kong uses all four of a tile type, none left for others).

### The Orphan Thirteen (Lone Tiles)
A collective of thirteen terminal and honor tiles (1 and 9 of each suit, plus all honors) who have formed the legendary Thirteen Orphans hand—not matching any other tiles but achieving power through diversity.

### The 145th Tile (The Impossible)
The extra tile that shouldn't exist. Appears differently to each observer—some see it as a new suit, others as a new dragon, others as something incomprehensible. May be the key to transcending the 144-tile limitation.

## Major Locations

### The Wall (The Great Structure)
The 144 tiles arranged in walls—18 stacks of 8 tiles forming a square. The Wall is both physical structure and metaphysical prison. Breaking the Wall is heresy but might be necessary for evolution.

### The East Wind Palace (Spring Beginning)
Imperial court where East Wind rules. Always dawn here, eternal spring. Traditional and conservative. The dealer position, controlling the draw sequence.

### The South Wind Flames (Summer Passion)
Revolutionary territory of intense heat and emotion. Always noon, eternal summer. Passionate radicals seeking to break traditional matching rules. Growth and change emphasized.

### The West Wind Garden (Autumn Harvest)
Philosophical monastery where sages contemplate the nature of tiles and matching. Always dusk, eternal autumn. Change and transformation studied here. Most likely to accept the 145th tile.

### The North Wind Tundra (Winter Ending)
Frozen wasteland where endings are accepted and completions achieved. Always midnight, eternal winter. Death and rebirth cycle. Understands that the current system may need to end.

### The Dragon Mountains
Three peaks where the Red, Green, and White Dragons dwell. Ancient and dangerous. Climbing all three mountains grants audience with the dragons and access to forbidden tile knowledge.

### The Matching Temples
Sacred sites where tiles go to find their matching partners. Pung Temple (three identical), Chow Shrine (three sequential), Kong Fortress (four identical), Pair Sanctuary (two identical for eyes—the foundation).

### The Dead Wall
Reserved tiles not used in play. Limbo for tiles not drawn. Dark and sad place where potential goes unrealized. Some tiles spend entire existences in the Dead Wall, never matched, never completed.

### The Discard Pool
Where unwanted tiles are cast. A flowing river of rejected tiles seeking new purpose. Dangerous—discarded tiles can be claimed by opponents through chi, pung, kong, or win declarations.

### The Hidden Hand
Private space where each player conceals their tiles. Represents interiority, secrets, and potential. Only the player knows what tiles they hold. Revealing your hand prematurely is vulnerability.

### The Revealed Melds
Public space where declared pungs, chows, and kongs are displayed. Represents commitment and transparency. Once revealed, tiles cannot be rearranged—locked into their pattern.

### The Waiting Space
The tenpai state—one tile away from completion. Tense anticipation, waiting for the final tile to achieve mahjong (winning hand). Represents readiness and vulnerability simultaneously.

## Unique Mechanics

### Tile Suits and Types
- **Bamboo** (1-9): Nature, growth, flexibility
- **Characters** (1-9): Culture, wisdom, tradition
- **Dots** (1-9): Wealth, material, quantity
- **Winds** (East, South, West, North): Direction, season, philosophy
- **Dragons** (Red, Green, White): Power, transformation, purity

### Matching Combinations
- **Pung**: Three identical tiles (e.g., three 3-Bamboo)
- **Chow**: Three sequential tiles same suit (e.g., 2-3-4 Dots)
- **Kong**: Four identical tiles (upgraded pung)
- **Eyes**: One pair forming the foundation (all hands need eyes)
- **Mahjong**: Complete hand (four sets + one pair, 14 tiles total)

### Wind Rotation
After each round, winds rotate: East becomes North, South becomes East, West becomes South, North becomes West. Represents seasonal change and cosmic cycling. Positions rotate but truth remains.

### Drawing and Discarding
Each turn: draw one tile, discard one tile. Maintain 13 tiles in hand, seeking 14th for completion. What you discard reveals strategy and provides opponents opportunities.

### Calling Tiles
- **Chi**: Claim discarded tile for chow (only from player before you)
- **Pung**: Claim discarded tile for pung (from any player)
- **Kong**: Claim discarded tile for kong (from any player)
- **Mahjong**: Claim discarded tile for winning hand (game ends)

### Special Hands
- **Thirteen Orphans**: All terminal and honor tiles (most complex)
- **Seven Pairs**: Seven pairs instead of four sets + pair
- **All Pungs**: No chows, only pungs
- **All Chows**: No pungs, only chows
- **All Honors**: Only wind and dragon tiles
- **All Terminals**: Only 1s and 9s

### Points and Scoring
Complex scoring based on hand difficulty, flowers/seasons, concealed vs. revealed, dealer bonuses. Higher complexity = more points = more cosmic power.

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: All Tiles Are One Tile
The 144 tiles are not separate entities but aspects of a single cosmic tile experiencing itself 144 ways. Individuality is illusion.

### Twist 2: The 145th Tile Is The Player
The party members are the impossible 145th tile—they don't fit into the traditional system but represent evolution beyond it.

### Twist 3: Completion Is Death
Achieving mahjong (winning hand) doesn't bring fulfillment but dissolution. Incomplete tiles are alive, complete tiles cease to exist. The system encourages eternal incompletion.

### Twist 4: The Dragons Are The Wall
The three dragons aren't separate from the Wall—they ARE the Wall's consciousness. They created the 144-tile system and now realize it's a prison they've trapped themselves in.

### Twist 5: The Winds Are Artificial
The Four Winds aren't natural forces but artificial constructs created to give structure to chaos. Without them, tiles could match in infinite combinations—true freedom but overwhelming.

## Victory Conditions

### Form the Perfect Hand
Achieve Thirteen Orphans or another maximum-point hand, demonstrating mastery of the tile system. Preserves traditional 144-tile reality.

### Integrate the 145th Tile
Accept the impossible tile, create new matching rules that include it. Evolution of the system into 145-tile reality (or beyond).

### Free All Tiles
Destroy the matching requirement entirely. Allow tiles to exist without needing partners. Radical independence but potential loneliness.

### Unite the Four Winds
Bring East, South, West, North into harmony. End the Wind Wars, create balanced cosmic governance.

### Awaken the Dragons
Help Red, Green, White Dragons transcend the system they created, taking all tiles with them into new existence.

## Defeat Conditions

### Eternal Incompletion
Never finding matching tiles, remaining forever unmatched. Suffering of perpetual fragmentation.

### Furiten State
In mahjong, furiten means you've previously discarded a tile you now need to win. Metaphysically locked out of completion by your own past choices.

### Wind Chaos
If Four Winds destroy their balance, cosmic directions collapse. No more cardinal points, complete spatial/temporal confusion.

### Dragon Consumption
If dragons turn hostile, they can consume tiles, reducing the 144 back toward zero. Approaching cosmic dissolution.

### Tile Shattering
If party members (as living tiles) are broken in combat, they become fragments—unable to match with anything, condemned to incompletion.
