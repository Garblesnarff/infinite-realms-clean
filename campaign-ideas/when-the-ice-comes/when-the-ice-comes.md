# When the Ice Comes
*The world freezes. Society shatters. Survival is the only victory.*

## Campaign Overview

It began as an unseasonable cold snap in the far north. Within days, temperatures plummeted to record lows across the continent. Within weeks, glaciers advanced miles per day, flash-freezing entire cities in their path. Now, three months into what scholars call the Eternal Winter, the world faces extinction. The cause: an ancient frost titan imprisoned beneath the polar ice has begun to wake, and its dreams alone are enough to freeze the world solid.

The party must navigate an apocalyptic landscape where every breath could be their last, where entire nations migrate south ahead of the advancing ice wall, where food becomes more valuable than gold, and where fire is literally the difference between life and death. They must discover the truth about the frost titan, find a way to re-imprison it or destroy it, and save what remains of civilization—all while the thermometer drops another degree each week.

Time is measured in temperature. Currently: -40°F in temperate zones. Projected: -200°F across the entire continent in sixty days. At that temperature, the air itself will freeze. Nothing can survive. The countdown has begun, and the ice is coming.

## Core Themes

- **Survival Against Nature**: Cold as the ultimate enemy, resource scarcity, endurance
- **Southward Migration**: Desperate exodus, refugee caravans, abandoning homes
- **Warmth as Currency**: Fire magic and fuel become most valuable resources
- **Isolation Horror**: Communities cut off, supply lines frozen, alone against the ice
- **Adaptation vs. Extinction**: Those who change survive, those who don't freeze
- **Hope in Hopelessness**: Finding humanity and heroism in apocalypse

## Unique Mechanics

**Temperature Tracking System**
- Global temperature drops 5°F per week
- Starts at -40°F, reaches -200°F by campaign end
- Cold exposure mechanics:
  - Above 0°F: Minor discomfort
  - 0°F to -50°F: Constitution saves or exhaustion
  - -50°F to -100°F: Requires constant heat or damage per hour
  - -100°F to -150°F: Exposed skin freezes in rounds
  - Below -150°F: Even magical protection strained
  - -200°F: Air itself freezes, instant death without powerful magic

**Warmth Resources**
- Track fuel, firewood, magical heat sources
- Campfires require fuel
- Magical warming requires spell slots
- Some NPCs/creatures generate heat
- Sharing warmth = survival decision
- Run out of heat = death

**Frostbite System**
- Track body parts exposed to extreme cold
- Progressive stages: numb → frostbite → necrotic → lost
- Healing magic can reverse early stages
- Lost limbs = permanent unless high-level magic
- NPCs suffer too, create emotional moments

**Supply Scarcity**
- Food preserved by cold but also hard to find
- Water freezes—must melt ice
- Medicine scarce
- Metal becomes brittle in extreme cold
- Economy collapses, barter system
- Party must manage rations

**Cold Weather Survival Challenges**

- Keeping NPCs alive

**Ice Hazards**
- Thin ice (fall through, drowning/freezing)

- Ice storms (visibility zero, flying debris)
- Flash freeze (sudden temperature drop)
- Glacial crevasses (fall damage, trapped)
- Frost magic zones (anti-magic fields)

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Unjust Imprisonment** (Session 21)
- Vorgrimm was innocent of the crimes he was imprisoned for
- Ancient civilization scapegoated him for their own failures
- His "crime" was refusing to genocide another race
- Complicates moral framework—is he victim or threat?

**Twist 2: Pyrewood's Secret** (Session 14)
- Lord Pyrewood is Lord Aldric's son
- Using same fire magic that killed his father from exhaustion

- Price: Human sacrifices monthly
- Party must decide if genocide to save species is acceptable

**Twist 5: The Prison's Purpose** (Session 31)
- Vorgrimm's prison doesn't just contain him
- It seals a rift to the para-elemental plane of ice
- Destroying prison or freeing titan opens rift
- Might trade one apocalypse for another

**Complication: The Plague** (Session 12)
- Overcrowded Flamekeep spawns deadly disease
