### Core Premise
The players are ordinary children and teenagers in the modern town of Onett when they develop psychic powers (PSI) after a meteor crashes nearby. Strange things begin happening - cult members in blue robes appear, animals become aggressive, toys come to life, and adults act oddly. The players learn they are "chosen ones" who must journey across Eagleland stopping alien-influenced threats, collecting sanctuary melodies from special locations, and preparing to confront Giygas - an incomprehensible cosmic entity that is the embodiment of evil itself. The campaign blends quirky slice-of-life moments (buying burgers, calling home, dealing with school bullies) with increasingly surreal horror as they approach the ultimate confrontation with an enemy that cannot be comprehended, only felt.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Meteor (Sessions 1-5)**
- Strange things happen in Onett after a meteor crashes on the hill. The players develop PSI powers. A time-traveling bee named Buzz-Buzz appears, warning that the alien force Giygas will destroy the world in the future. He identifies the players as the chosen ones who must collect eight melodies from special locations to unlock the power to fight back. Before he can explain more, he's killed by a scared neighbor who thought he was a pest. The players must prove themselves by defeating the Starman Junior from the meteor, then begin their journey.

**Act 2: Journey Across Eagleland (Sessions 6-15)**
- The players travel from town to town, each with its own strange problem caused by Giygas's influence. They fight zombie dogs, possessed hippies, crazed cultists, living statues, and aliens in disguise. Between combat, they experience mundane life - buying equipment from drug stores, eating at restaurants, calling home so their parents don't worry, making friends, and dealing with obstacles like a band blocking the road or a crow guarding a sanctuary. Each sanctuary location (a hill, a cave, a desert, a department store) provides a melody that strengthens their connection to the Earth and their own memories. They gather allies including a runaway inventor, a prince from another country, and a princess with PSI powers.

**Act 3: The Cave of the Past (Sessions 16-20)**
- To defeat Giygas in the past before he becomes incomprehensible, the players must time-travel. Their human bodies can't survive, so they transfer their souls into robot bodies. They travel to the Cave of the Past where Giygas, bound in a device by his former master, is breaking free. The final battles are surreal nightmares - Giygas has no coherent form, no logical attacks, only pain and incomprehensibility. The players discover that traditional combat cannot defeat ultimate evil. Instead, they must pray - reaching out to everyone they've helped, everyone who loves them, all the connections they've made. These prayers weaken Giygas until he can finally be destroyed. Victory saves the timeline, but the players remember the face of true cosmic horror.

### Central Conflict
Ordinary children thrust into extraordinary circumstances must save the world from incomprehensible cosmic evil while maintaining their connections to normal life, family, and each other. The conflict is external (defeating Giygas and its minions) but also deeply internal (maintaining hope and humanity when confronting the truly horrifying). The campaign asks: can innocence and love defeat ultimate evil? Can prayer and connection overcome power and malice? Themes include childhood heroism, the power of emotional bonds, facing incomprehensible horror, and finding strength in normalcy.

### Unique Mechanics

- **PSI Powers**: Magic in this world is PSI (psychic abilities). Different characters learn different categories: PK (offensive), Healing, Defensive, and Assist. Paula excels at offensive and healing. The player character (Ness archetype) is balanced. Jeff can't use PSI at all but compensates with gadgets. PSI doesn't use spell slots but PP (psychic points) that regenerate like hit points. Some abilities (like Lifeup) become crucial for survival.
- **Modern Resource Management**: Instead of traditional fantasy shops, players buy equipment from drug stores, sporting goods, department stores. They rest at hotels (costs money) or call home (free healing if you can reach a phone). Food items from restaurants and stores provide healing. Track money carefully - the ATM system requires visiting banks. This creates immersion in the modern setting.
- **Homesickness**: If players go too long without calling home or resting, they become homesick (debuff to combat effectiveness, representing emotional state). Calling mom or visiting home cures this and provides free healing plus a favorite meal. This mechanically reinforces the theme of maintaining human connections.
- **Paula's Prayer**: A unique ability where Paula prays during combat, calling on NPCs the party has helped. This provides buffs, healing, or direct damage. Keep a list of "saved NPCs" - when Paula prays, random helpers from this list appear narratively to aid the party. During the Giygas fight, this becomes the primary damage source.
- **Jeff's Gadgets**: Jeff can't use PSI but can repair broken machines into useful items. Between sessions, roll to see if Jeff successfully repairs items found. He can create bottlerockets (damage), shield-killers (dispel), HP-suckers (drain), etc. This provides unique utility and rewards exploration for odd items to repair.
- **The Eight Melodies**: Track collection of sanctuary melodies. Each provides a permanent stat boost and triggers a memory flashback for the player character. When all eight are collected, they unlock the Sound Stone's power - necessary for entering Magicant and preparing for the final battle. Each sanctuary has a unique guardian battle themed around the location.
- **Incomprehensible Boss Design**: Giygas cannot be understood or described properly. When fighting it, avoid traditional boss mechanics. Instead, Giygas uses random reality-breaking attacks - screens distort, sounds become wrong, status effects have no pattern. The only way to damage it is through Paula's Pray command, which calls on everyone they've helped. After enough prayers, Giygas can finally be hurt by conventional PSI.
- **Quirk and Horror Balance**: Maintain tonal whiplash between quirky (buying baseball bats and frying pans as weapons, encountering Mr. Saturn, having a submarine that looks yellow, getting autographs) and horrifying (Giygas's incomprehensible nature, the implication of body horror in robot transfers, cults brainwashing towns). This dissonance makes the horror hit harder.
