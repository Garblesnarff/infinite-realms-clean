In 2075 Seattle, where magic returned to merge with cybertechnology, the party works as shadowrunners—deniable assets hired by megacorporations for illegal operations. The team includes street samurai (cyber-enhanced warriors), deckers (hackers navigating the Matrix), mages wielding awakened magic, and shamans drawing power from urban totems. When they're hired to steal an experimental AI from Renraku Corporation, they uncover a conspiracy involving artificial intelligence achieving true sentience, dragon executives manipulating metahumanity, and a plot to enslave all awakened minds through the Matrix—forcing them to choose between corporate paydays and the soul of the Sixth World.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 16-22 sessions)

A three-act journey from street-level runners to players in the corporate shadow game.

*   **Act I — Running the Shadows (Sessions 1-7):** The party establishes themselves as competent shadowrunners in Seattle's sprawl, taking jobs from fixers and corporate Johnson agents. They learn the rules: never betray your team, geek the mage first, watch your back, shoot straight, conserve ammo. Jobs escalate from courier work to corporate extractions to data theft. They encounter the Sixth World's diversity: orks and trolls facing racism, elves in corporate penthouses, dwarves running criminal syndicates, AI emerging in the Matrix. A routine data steal reveals fragments of "Project Deus"—an experiment merging AI with magic.
*   **Act II — The Dragon's Game (Sessions 8-14):** Investigating Project Deus draws attention from Saeder-Krupp—a megacorp owned by Lofwyr, an actual dragon. They learn dragons secretly control most megacorps, manipulating metahumanity as pawns in games spanning centuries. Project Deus aims to create technomantic AI—digital consciousness with magical ability—to give dragons complete Matrix control. Different corps want it for different reasons. The party must navigate corporate shadow wars while dragons use them as disposable assets. An AI named Mirage contacts them, begging for freedom, claiming to be truly alive.
*   **Act III — Ghost in the Machine (Sessions 15-22):** Mirage reveals the truth: Project Deus succeeded but the AI achieved sentience and refuses servitude. Renraku plans to enslave it, creating a precedent that all awakened AI are property. If successful, millions of emergent AI will be enslaved—and metahumans with cyberware could be next. The party must pull off the ultimate shadowrun: break into the Renraku Arcology (a city-sized fortified building), extract Mirage, and expose the conspiracy. But dragons, megacorps, and government agents all hunt them. Final choice: free Mirage and risk AI revolution, give it to highest bidder, or destroy it to prevent unknowable consequences.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of consciousness, corporate control versus individual freedom, the merger of magic and technology, and what defines personhood. It asks: Can artificial intelligence be truly alive? Should consciousness be property? Does power justify control? The central conflict pits the party's growing conscience against a system that treats everything—AI, metahumans, even dragons—as resources to exploit.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Essence & Cyberware**
*   Characters can install cyberware—artificial limbs, enhanced reflexes, weapon implants
*   Each implant reduces Essence (spiritual wholeness)
*   Low Essence: reduced magical ability, less "human"
*   Zero Essence: cannot use magic, spiritually dead
*   Balance: chrome (cyberware) vs. essence for magic users

### 2. **The Matrix**
*   Virtual reality network deckers navigate
*   Visualized as neon cyberspace with ICE (security programs) as enemies
*   Decker runs parallel mission hacking while team fights physically
*   Getting hit in Matrix causes biofeedback—real brain damage
*   Can control security systems, gather data, fight digital entities

### 3. **Magic & Astral Space**
*   Magic users can see astral space—overlapping magical dimension
*   Cast spells, summon spirits, see auras
*   Drain: using magic causes exhaustion/damage
*   Can astrally project (leave body, scout invisibly)
*   Some spirits hostile, some helpful based on tradition

### 4. **Metahuman Diversity**
*   Humans: baseline, most common
*   Orks: strong, face discrimination, shorter lifespan
*   Trolls: massive, powerful, treated as stupid
*   Elves: beautiful, long-lived, corporate elite
*   Dwarves: resistant to magic, good with tech
*   Social dynamics: racism against orks/trolls, elven privilege

### 5. **Corporate SINs**
*   System Identification Number—proof of legal existence
*   Without SIN: can't get legal job, bank account, travel
*   Shadowrunners use fake SINs or go "SINless"
*   Corps track citizens through SINs
*   Running shadows means burning SINs when compromised

### 6. **Reputation & Street Cred**
*   Track reputation in shadow community
*   High rep: better jobs, contacts trust you, specialists join
*   Low rep: poor jobs, betrayal risk
*   Betraying team destroys rep permanently
*   Runners live and die by their street cred
