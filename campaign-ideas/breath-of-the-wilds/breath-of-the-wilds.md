A century ago, the Calamity awakened—an ancient evil that corrupted the kingdom's guardian machines and laid waste to civilization. The party awakens from magical stasis with fragmented memories, finding Hyrule transformed into a beautiful but dangerous wilderness dotted with ruins and roaming mechanical beasts. They must explore freely across mountains, forests, deserts, and volcanoes, recovering lost memories, liberating the spirits of fallen Champions trapped in corrupted Divine Beasts, and preparing to face the Calamity sealed beneath Hyrule Castle. Through climbing, gliding, cooking, and improvisation, they'll restore the kingdom and fulfill an ancient prophecy.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A non-linear three-act arc of exploration, recovery, and confrontation with ancient evil.

*   **Act I — Awakening & The Plateau (Sessions 1-8):** The party awakens in the Shrine of Resurrection with no memories. An old man guides them across the Great Plateau, teaching survival and revealing the world's fate. They complete ancient shrines to gain powers (remote bombs, stasis, magnetism, cryonis). They learn of the Calamity, the fallen Champions, and their own forgotten role. They're tasked with freeing four Divine Beasts and recovering their memories before facing the Calamity.
*   **Act II — Liberation of the Divine Beasts (Sessions 9-19):** The party explores Hyrule in any order, visiting different regions (Zora's Domain, Goron City, Rito Village, Gerudo Town). They help each culture with regional problems, earn their trust, and assault massive corrupted Divine Beasts—dungeon-sized mechanical titans. Inside each Beast, they solve environmental puzzles, battle corrupted guardians, and free a Champion's spirit. Each liberation weakens the Calamity and restores memories of friendships, battles, and the day everything fell.
*   **Act III — Hyrule Castle & The Calamity (Sessions 20-25):** With all Divine Beasts freed or as many as they choose, the party assaults Hyrule Castle—now a fortress of corruption crawling with guardians and malice. They fight through memories made manifest, recover the Master Sword if they haven't, and descend to face Calamity Ganon. The final battle shifts through forms as the Divine Beasts provide support. In the end, they seal the darkness, and Hyrule begins its long restoration.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of perseverance after failure, the burden of prophecy, freedom versus duty, and restoring hope to a broken world. It asks: Can you succeed where you once failed? What is lost in 100 years of sleep? How do you mourn those you've forgotten? The central conflict pits the party's desire to restore Hyrule against the overwhelming power of the Calamity that already defeated them once.

### 3. **Cooking & Crafting System**

### 8. **Weapon Durability**
