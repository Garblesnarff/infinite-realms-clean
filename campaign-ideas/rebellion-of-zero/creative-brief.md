# Creative Brief: Rebellion of Zero

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Strategic Opera (Chess Game meets Mecha Anime)

Inspired by Death Note psychological warfare, Gundam military drama, and Shakespearean tragedy. This style blends chess strategy with explosive mecha combat, high school uniforms with resistance gear, and tragic nobility with revolutionary fervor. Colors are dramatic—royal purples, rebellion blacks, Geass red, white knight honor. Character designs are theatrical—flowing capes, ornate masks, angular mecha. Everything feels like watching an opera about revolution—beautiful, tragic, operatic.

### Core Principles:

*   **Strategic Theater:** Every battle is chess, every move calculated, every sacrifice meaningful.
*   **Tragic Kingship:** The revolutionary becomes tyrant to die as martyr.
*   **Geass Corruption:** Absolute power corrupts absolutely, literally through eye contact.

## Voice

A commanding, theatrical voice—male, British aristocratic accent with revolutionary fervor. The delivery is strategic and philosophical, treating war as chess and people as pieces. Emotion is controlled rage and calculated manipulation masking deep trauma. References rebellion, sacrifice, and godhood with Shakespearean grandeur. Audio has orchestral swells and chess piece movements. Role: A masked revolutionary commanding troops, or an emperor declaring tyrannical decrees.
