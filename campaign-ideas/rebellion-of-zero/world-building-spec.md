# World-Building Specification Brief: Rebellion of Zero

**Core Concept:** Players join the Black Knights rebellion led by Zero (Lelouch), fighting Britannian Empire occupation of Japan. Lelouch has Geass—absolute obedience through eye contact. Through strategic mecha battles, they watch him sacrifice morality for revolution, seize the throne, then plan his own martyrdom to unite the world. The campaign is strategic tragedy—chess games, mind control, and whether tyranny can create freedom through death.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Holy Britannian Empire—superpower based on social Darwinism, numbered colonies (Japan is Area 11).
*   Geass—supernatural power of kings, granted by C.C., represents contract with devil.
*   Knightmare Frames—humanoid mecha using sakuradite energy, primary weapon of warfare.
*   Zero Requiem—Lelouch's final plan to become world's villain then die as martyr.

**Factions:**
*   **Black Knights:** Resistance movement led by Zero, liberating Japan, eventually global revolution.
*   **Holy Britannia:** Imperialist superpower, social Darwinism, royal family feuds.
*   **Chinese Federation:** Major power, politically unstable, manipulated by Geass users.
*   **The Damocles Faction:** Schneizel's nuclear peace through mutually assured destruction.

**Locations:**
*   **Area 11 (Japan):** Colonized Japan, ghettos for Japanese, Britannian settlements, resistance bases.
*   **Ashford Academy:** School where Lelouch maintains double identity.
*   **Tokyo Settlement:** Capital, site of Black Rebellion battles.
*   **Pendragon:** Britannian imperial capital, throne room where Lelouch becomes emperor.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF Lelouch uses Geass recklessly, THEN it spirals out of control, causing tragedies.
*   IF Zero Requiem isn't executed, THEN Lelouch rules as immortal tyrant forever.
*   IF party opposes Lelouch, THEN they're Geassed or eliminated as obstacles.
*   IF Zero Requiem succeeds, THEN the world achieves peace through Lelouch's sacrifice.
