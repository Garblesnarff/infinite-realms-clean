# The Faction Protocol

*A Dystopian Identity / Conspiracy Thriller campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Faction Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dystopian Identity Crisis / Conspiracy Thriller / Faction Warfare
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** choice, identity, conformity, conspiracy, divergence, faction warfare, dystopian control, rebellion
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party lives in a post-war society divided into five factions, each dedicated to a specific virtue: Abnegation (selflessness), Amity (peace), Candor (honesty), Dauntless (bravery), and Erudite (knowledge). At age 16, citizens undergo an aptitude test and choose their faction for life—but some test results show aptitude for multiple factions, making them "Divergent," a dangerous secret that threatens the system. The party consists of Divergents who must hide their true nature while uncovering a conspiracy by Erudite to overthrow Abnegation leadership and control the city through mind-control serums and simulation warfare.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Faction initiation trials are brutal and sometimes lethal. Simulation battles pit the party against their worst fears. The conspiracy involves mind-controlled Dauntless soldiers.
*   **Investigation:** Players must decipher hidden Divergent networks, identify who can be trusted, and expose the Erudite conspiracy before the coup succeeds.
*   **Consequences:** Choosing the wrong faction can mean exile or death. Being discovered as Divergent means execution. The party's actions determine whether the faction system is reformed or destroyed.

---

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from faction initiates to revolutionaries challenging the system.

*   **Act I — Choosing Day (Sessions 1–4):** The party undergoes aptitude testing and discovers they're Divergent. They choose factions (often different ones), undergo brutal initiation trials, and learn to hide their Divergence while secretly communicating.
*   **Act II — Initiation Trials (Sessions 5–8):** The party faces faction-specific challenges—Dauntless combat and fear simulations, Erudite intellectual competitions, Abnegation service trials, etc. They uncover hints of an Erudite plot and encounter other Divergents in hiding.
*   **Act III — The Conspiracy Unveiled (Sessions 9–12):** Erudite launches a coup using mind-control serum distributed to Dauntless. The party, immune due to their Divergence, must infiltrate Erudite headquarters, free mind-controlled allies, and expose the conspiracy to the factions.
*   **Act IV — Faction War (Sessions 13–15):** The factions fracture into civil war. The party must decide whether to preserve the faction system (reformed) or abolish it entirely. They confront Jeanine Matthews, the Erudite leader, and choose the city's future.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Aptitude Test Day"

*   **Focus:** Introduction / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party members are 16-year-olds from different factions, preparing for their aptitude tests—simulations designed to reveal which faction suits them.
    *   The Test: Each party member enters a simulation controlled by a tester. Strange results emerge—multiple faction affinities appear (Divergent), not the expected single result.
    *   The Warning: Testers secretly tell Divergents to hide their results and manually log a single faction. Being Divergent is dangerous, but they don't explain why.

**Escalation:** The party attends the Choosing Ceremony the next day, where they must publicly select their faction for life.

### Session 2 — "The Choosing Ceremony"

*   **Focus:** Identity / Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Factions Gather: Abnegation in gray, Amity in red/yellow, Candor in black/white, Dauntless in black, Erudite in blue. Families sit in faction sections.
    *   The Choice: Each party member cuts their palm and lets blood fall into a faction's bowl (stones for Abnegation, earth for Amity, glass for Candor, coals for Dauntless, water for Erudite). Faction before blood—many choose differently than their birth faction.
    *   The Transfer: Party members who choose different factions from their families are now "transfers," leaving their old lives behind forever.

**Escalation:** The party separates to their chosen factions' initiation compounds, beginning brutal training.

### Session 3 — "Initiation Begins"

*   **Focus:** Trials / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Dauntless Initiation: If party members choose Dauntless, they jump onto a moving train, leap into a dark pit (landing in a net), and face combat ranking trials. Only the top 10 pass—failures become factionless (homeless outcasts).
    *   Erudite Initiation: Intellectual competitions, complex problem-solving under pressure, debates that determine ranking.
    *   Abnegation Initiation: Service trials, selflessness tests, learning to suppress individual desires.
    *   The Divergent Edge: Party members discover their Divergence gives them advantages—resisting simulations, adapting to unexpected challenges, thinking outside faction limits.

**Escalation:** An initiate dies during Dauntless trials. Leadership shows no sympathy—weakness is unacceptable.

### Session 4 — "The Fear Landscape"

*   **Focus:** Psychological Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Fear Simulations: Dauntless initiates face simulations of their worst fears (drowning, being buried alive, attacking loved ones). Normal initiates panic; Divergents can manipulate the simulation.
    *   The Suspicion: Four (a Dauntless instructor) notices the party's unusual simulation results and begins watching them closely. They must hide their abilities.
    *   Secret Network: The party discovers another Divergent hiding among initiates, creating a clandestine support network.

**Escalation:** Erudite publishes propaganda attacking Abnegation leadership, claiming corruption and hoarding resources.

### Session 5 — "Rankings and Rivalries"

*   **Focus:** Competition / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Stage One Results: Rankings determine who continues initiation. The party must balance performing well (to avoid failing) without being too exceptional (which draws attention to their Divergence).
    *   Faction Rivalry: Erudite and Abnegation tensions escalate. The party, if split between factions, must communicate secretly to share information.
    *   The Transfer Struggle: Born-faction initiates often bully transfers. The party must defend themselves without revealing their true abilities.

**Escalation:** A party member is attacked by jealous rivals and must choose whether to retaliate (risking exposure) or endure (maintaining cover).

### Session 6 — "The Serum Conspiracy"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Discovery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Suspicious Injections: Dauntless initiates receive "tracking serums" supposedly for security. Divergents feel the serum differently—they can resist its effects.
    *   Erudite Connection: The party discovers the serums were developed by Erudite scientists. Cross-faction communication reveals Erudite is distributing serums to multiple factions.
    *   Tris Prior and Four: The party encounters Tris (another Divergent hiding in Dauntless) and Four (a Divergent instructor secretly helping others). They form a fragile alliance.

**Escalation:** An initiate reveals themselves as Divergent in panic during a simulation—they're immediately taken away and never seen again.

### Session 7 — "Visiting Day"

*   **Focus:** Family / Loyalty
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Families Visit: Initiates can see their families for one day. Those who transferred face painful reunions—faction before blood means relationships are strained.
    *   Information Exchange: The party uses Visiting Day to pass information between factions. Abnegation family members whisper warnings about Erudite's growing aggression.
    *   The Factionless: The party encounters factionless (failed initiates, outcasts) who reveal they're being recruited by someone for an unknown purpose.

**Escalation:** Erudite publishes a manifesto demanding Abnegation step down from city leadership, accusing them of abuse of power.

### Session 8 — "Final Trials"

*   **Focus:** Climactic Tests
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Fear Landscape (Final): Dauntless initiates face all their fears in sequence while watched by faction leadership. Divergents must fake panic convincingly while navigating their fears.
    *   Erudite Debate Finals: Erudite initiates face final intellectual debates to prove their logic and knowledge.
    *   The Results: Rankings are finalized. Those who pass join their factions as full members. Those who fail become factionless.

**Escalation:** The party passes initiation but notices Erudite and Dauntless leadership meeting in secret—an unprecedented alliance.

### Session 9 — "The Simulation Attack"

*   **Focus:** Action / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Injection: All Dauntless members receive a "new tracking serum" injection. That night, they enter a synchronized simulation controlled by Erudite—mind control.
    *   The March: Mind-controlled Dauntless soldiers march to Abnegation sector to slaughter the faction and seize government control.
    *   The Immune: The party, being Divergent, is immune to the simulation. They're awake and aware while surrounded by controlled soldiers. They must blend in or be killed as anomalies.

**Escalation:** The party witnesses Abnegation civilians—including families—being executed by mind-controlled Dauntless. They must choose to hide, resist, or infiltrate.

### Session 10 — "Infiltrating Erudite"

*   **Focus:** Stealth / Sabotage
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Control Center: The party deduces the mind control is broadcast from Erudite headquarters. They must infiltrate the compound, disguised as controlled soldiers or captured prisoners.
    *   Jeanine Matthews: They encounter the mastermind—Erudite's leader, brilliant and ruthless, who plans to execute all Divergents once Abnegation is eliminated.
    *   The Choice: The party can destroy the control program (freeing Dauntless but alerting Erudite), steal data (exposing the conspiracy but leaving soldiers controlled), or confront Jeanine directly.

**Escalation:** The party discovers a second phase—Erudite plans to hunt and execute all Divergents using a serum that kills those with multiple faction affinities.

### Session 11 — "Freeing the Dauntless"

*   **Focus:** Rescue / Turning Point
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Shutting Down Control: The party destroys or hacks the simulation control system, freeing Dauntless from mind control. Chaos erupts as soldiers realize what they've done.
    *   The Backlash: Jeanine triggers her contingency—Dauntless headquarters is locked down, trapping soldiers inside with programmed kill-orders against Divergents.
    *   The Escape: The party must fight or sneak through controlled compound, freeing key allies (Tris, Four, other Divergents) while avoiding execution squads.

**Escalation:** The other factions—Amity, Candor, and remnants of Abnegation—learn of the coup and demand justice.

### Session 12 — "The Faction Summit"

*   **Focus:** Politics / Moral Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Emergency Council: Leaders from all factions meet to decide the city's future. Erudite's conspiracy is exposed, but trust is shattered.
    *   The Divergent Revelation: The party must decide whether to reveal they're Divergent publicly, risking persecution but proving the faction system is flawed.
    *   The Schism: Factions fracture—some demand Erudite's dissolution, others want reform, and radicals call for abolishing all factions and embracing Divergence.

**Escalation:** Jeanine escapes during the chaos, taking control of rogue Dauntless and Erudite loyalists for a final stand.

### Session 13 — "Faction War"

*   **Focus:** Urban Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The City Divides: Erudite and loyalist Dauntless fortify their sectors. Abnegation survivors, Amity, Candor, and rebel Dauntless form an alliance.
    *   The Siege: The party leads assaults on key positions—Erudite laboratories (where Divergent-killing serums are made), Dauntless armories, and control centers.
    *   The Factionless Rise: The factionless, led by Four's mother Evelyn, emerge as a third force, demanding the faction system be abolished entirely.

**Escalation:** The party must choose sides—preserve reformed factions, support the factionless revolution, or broker a new system entirely.

### Session 14 — "The Truth About Divergence"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Conspiracy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Founder's Files: The party infiltrates the city's original archives and discovers the truth—the faction system was an experiment by an outside authority to "fix" humanity's flaws. Divergents are proof the experiment succeeded—genetically "pure" humans.
    *   The Outside World: The city is enclosed. Beyond the walls lies a larger society that's been watching the experiment for generations.
    *   Jeanine's Motivation: Jeanine knew this truth and tried to seize control to prevent the outside world from deeming the experiment a failure and terminating it.

**Escalation:** The party must decide whether to reveal this truth (destabilizing society) or keep it secret (maintaining the status quo).

### Session 15 — "Beyond the Walls"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / New Beginning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Confronting Jeanine: The party faces Jeanine in a final confrontation—combat, debate, or moral persuasion. Her fate determines whether justice or revenge guides the new society.
    *   Opening the Gates: The party chooses whether to open the city to the outside world, remain isolated, or send ambassadors.
    *   The New System: The factions are reformed, abolished, or merged into a new structure based on the party's choices and alliances.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is identity versus conformity—the faction system demands total dedication to a single virtue, but Divergents embody complexity and choice. The conspiracy exposes the system's fragility and authoritarian control. The party must decide whether humanity needs structured virtue or freedom to be multifaceted, whether security justifies control, and whether the truth liberates or destroys.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Faction Affinities**

*   Each party member has affinities for multiple factions (usually 2-3), making them Divergent.
*   **Affinity Benefits:** When acting according to a faction's virtue (selfless, peaceful, honest, brave, knowledgeable), the party gains bonuses (advantage, skill boosts, etc.).
*   **Divergent Advantage:** Party members can switch affinities mid-scene, adapting to challenges that single-faction individuals cannot.

### 2. **Simulation Resistance**

*   Fear simulations and mind-control serums affect Divergents differently.
*   **Awareness Check:** Divergents can attempt to recognize they're in a simulation (Insight check). Success means they can manipulate the simulation's reality.
*   **Faking It:** Divergents must convincingly fake normal responses (Deception check) or be identified as Divergent.

### 3. **Initiation Ranking**

*   Each faction tracks initiate rankings (1-10 typically). Failing to rank in the top positions means becoming factionless.
*   **Ranking Actions:** Combat performance, simulation speed, intellectual challenges, service acts—all affect ranking.
*   **Balancing Act:** Performing too well draws suspicion (Divergent detection). Performing poorly risks failure.

### 4. **Faction Trust**

*   The party tracks trust with each faction (rated 1-10).
*   **High Trust:** Access to faction resources, insider information, safe havens.
*   **Low Trust:** Suspicion, investigations, potential exile or execution.
*   **Divergent Risk:** If a faction discovers the party is Divergent, trust drops to zero and they're marked for death.

### 5. **The Conspiracy Web**

*   Clues about the Erudite conspiracy are scattered across factions.
*   **Investigation Mechanics:** Players collect evidence (secret meetings, serum shipments, propaganda patterns) and piece together the plot.
*   **Time Pressure:** If the party doesn't uncover enough clues before Session 9, the coup succeeds with greater casualties.

---

## Themes and Moral Questions

*   **Can identity be reduced to a single virtue?** The faction system demands it, but Divergents prove complexity is natural.
*   **Is control necessary for peace?** Jeanine argues that without strict factions, society collapses. Is she right?
*   **What do we owe our community versus ourselves?** Faction before blood—but what if the faction system itself is wrong?
*   **Is ignorance better than dangerous truth?** Revealing the experiment destabilizes society. Should the party keep the secret?

---

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Reformed Factions:** The party preserves the faction system but removes authoritarian control, allowing transfers and Divergent acceptance.
*   **Factionless Victory:** The party supports Evelyn's revolution, abolishing factions entirely and creating egalitarian chaos.
*   **Outside Contact:** The party opens the city to the outside world, integrating into the larger society that created the experiment.
*   **Martyrdom:** The party is executed as Divergents, but their sacrifice inspires future generations to embrace complexity over conformity.
