# Wall of Titans: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
**Military Gothic with Baroque Architecture**
- European medieval meets steampunk technology
- Walls dominate every vista—omnipresent, oppressive, protective
- Urban density within walls contrasts with wilderness beyond
- Titans designed to be both humanoid and deeply wrong
- Constant visual reminder of vulnerability and imprisonment

### Environmental Design
- **Within the Walls:** Cramped, vertical cities built into wall structure. Cobblestone streets, gas lamps, crowded markets
- **The Walls Themselves:** Impossibly smooth stone (hiding their true nature), 200 feet tall, wide enough for buildings on top
- **Beyond the Walls:** Overgrown ruins, wild grasslands, destroyed villages reclaimed by nature
- **Titan Territory:** Deceptively peaceful landscapes made horrifying by the giants wandering through them

### Character Visual Direction
- **Recon Corps:** Green cloaked soldiers with "Wings of Freedom" emblem, leather harnesses for maneuvering gear, determined expressions
- **Garrison:** Stationary troops in dull brown, more casual attitude
- **Military Police:** Green jackets with gold trim, aristocratic bearing, corruption visible in their ease
- **Civilians:** Period-appropriate clothing (1800s European), visible class distinctions
- **Titan-Shifters:** Lightning crackling, steam rising, partial titan features when stressed

### Titan Design Principles
- **Uncanny Valley:** Human proportions but wrong—too-wide smiles, blank expressions, disproportionate features
- **Varied Sizes:** 3-15 meters most common, with occasional giants
- **No Genitals or Digestive Systems:** Emphasizes their unnatural existence
- **Regeneration:** Steam rising from wounds, flesh knitting itself together
- **Special Titans:** Female Titan (athletic build), Armored Titan (plated), Beast Titan (ape-like), Colossal Titan (skeletal, skinless)

## Color Palettes

### Primary Palette: Trapped Hope
- **Wall Gray:** Stone (#7D7F7D) dominates—walls, buildings, sky
- **Corps Green:** Military cloaks (#3B6B40) represent hope and duty
- **Blood Red:** (#8B0000) for capes, gore, urgency
- **Sepia Tones:** (#704214) for historical flashbacks and old districts
- **Sky Blue:** (#87CEEB) rare glimpses beyond walls, representing freedom

### Secondary Palette: Beyond the Walls
- **Grass Green:** (#7CFC00) vibrant, dangerous freedom
- **Titan Flesh:** Sickly pink (#FFB6C1) that looks wrong on humanoid shapes
- **Steam White:** (#F5F5F5) rising from Titan wounds and transformations
- **Lightning Yellow:** (#FFD700) when shifters transform
- **Ocean Blue:** (#006994) late campaign revelation

### Scene-Specific Palettes
- **Breach Scenes:** Saturated reds and oranges (fire, blood, sunset timing)
- **Expeditions:** Desaturated greens and browns (danger lurking in beauty)
- **Political Intrigue:** Dark interiors, candlelight, shadows and secrets
- **Transformation Sequences:** Bright yellows and whites cutting through darkness
- **The Rumbling:** Monochromatic destruction, everything crushed to gray

## Music and Sound Design

### Musical Themes

**Main Theme: "Guren no Yumiya" (Crimson Bow and Arrow)**
- Orchestral metal fusion
- German-language choir for gravitas
- Driving percussion suggesting march to death
- Triumphant despite hopelessness
- Emotional tone: Defiant rage against extinction

**Titan Approach Theme:**
- Low rumbling bass building slowly
- Discordant strings creating unease
- Footsteps becoming audible (rhythmic, wrong)
- Children's music box playing distorted melody
- Crescendo to silence, then screaming

**Maneuvering Gear Theme:**
- Fast-paced strings with mechanical percussion
- Whooshing sounds integrated into rhythm
- Building intensity as combat progresses
- Heroic brass when strikes land successfully
- Sudden stops when gas runs out

**Political Intrigue Theme:**
- Baroque harpsichord with ominous undertones
- Whispered vocals barely audible
- Clock ticking integrated into rhythm
- Slow, deliberate pacing
- Minor key suggesting hidden danger

### Ambient Soundscapes

**Within the Walls:**

- Garrison drills and marching
- Underground: dripping water, echoing voices
- Constant background hum of civilization

**Expedition Beyond Walls:**
- Wind through grass, eerily peaceful

**Titan Encounters:**
- Heavy footsteps shaking ground

- The wet sound of regeneration
- Screaming civilians
- Maneuvering gear gas-burst sounds
- Blades cutting flesh (distinct, sickening)

**The Breach:**
- Thunder-crack of wall being destroyed
- Cascading stone and dust
- Air displacement from Colossal Titan
- Mass panic—thousands screaming
- Bells ringing alarm across city

### Voice Direction for Key NPCs

**Commander Erwin Smith:**
- Voice: Deep, commanding, measured

- Final charge should be iconic, unforgettable

**Captain Levi:**
- Voice: Flat affect, slight rasp from combat
- Economical with words, every sentence has purpose
- Rare emotional moments hit harder because of usual stoicism
- Disgust clear when dealing with politics
- Combat dialogue terse, tactical

**Hange Zoë:**
- Voice: Enthusiastic, rapid-fire when discussing Titans
- Unhinged laughter at inappropriate times
- Genuine warmth when teaching or caring for squad
- Dramatic mood swings from comedy to dead serious
- Later becomes leader: struggles to match Erwin's gravitas

**Eren (Titan-Shifter):**
- Voice: Young, angry, gradually becomes colder
- Early: passionate idealism
- Middle: traumatized determination
- Late: frightening conviction about necessary evil
- Transformation scream should be primal, terrifying

**Mikasa Ackerman:**
- Voice: Calm, quiet, intense when protecting others
- Minimal dialogue, maximum impact
- Emotion leaks through in combat grunts and breathing
- Rare smiles should feel earned
- Battle cry when fully unleashed: terrifying
