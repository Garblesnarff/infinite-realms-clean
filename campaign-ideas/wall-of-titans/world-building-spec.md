# Wall of Titans: World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

- Reinforced blades designed to cut Titan flesh
- Horses bred for speed and endurance
- Signal flares (colored smoke for communication)
- Emergency supplies and rations

**Philosophy:** "Those who cannot sacrifice anything cannot change anything. To defeat monsters, we must abandon our humanity."

**Public Perception:** Heroes to commoners, madmen to aristocrats, necessary evil to government

### The Garrison

**Mission:** Defend the walls, maintain artillery, manage gates

**Structure:** Divided by wall (Maria, Rose, Sina), each with regional commands

**Personnel:** ~30,000 total

**Equipment:**
- Stationary cannons and ballistae
- 3DMG (used rarely, most members poorly trained)

- Prevent civil unrest through intimidation

**Relationship with Recon Corps:** Antagonistic, view them as troublemakers who ask dangerous questions

### The Walls Council (Government)

**Structure:**
- King (figurehead with erased memories, puppet of true royal family)

**Technology:** Advanced—airships, firearms, industrialization

**Titan Warfare:** Uses shifters as living weapons, sends them to destroy enemy nations

**Ideology:** Eldians (the party's people) are "devils" who must be controlled or exterminated

- Four districts extend from wall: Shiganshina (south), others at cardinal points
- Breached and lost 5 years before campaign begins

- Current outermost defense
- Contains majority of population (~250,000)
- Multiple districts: Trost, Karanese, Krolva, others

## Causality Chains

### The Origin of Titans (True History)

**2,000 Years Ago:**
- Ymir Fritz makes contact with "source of all living matter"
- Gains power of Titans
- Forced to serve Eldian King
- Dies, power splits into Nine Titans

**Eldian Empire (2,000 years of rule):**
- Nine Titans used to conquer world
- Eldian Empire commits atrocities globally
- Uses Titans for labor, warfare, genocide
- Other nations oppressed, enslaved

**The Great Titan War (107 years ago):**
- Internal conflict among nine Titan families
- Marley manipulates the conflict
- Seven Titans fall to Marley
- King Fritz takes Founding Titan and one other, flees to island

**King Fritz's Solution:**
- Uses Founding Titan to create Wall Titans
- Arranges millions of Colossals in three circles
- Memory wipes Eldians on island to forget history
- Vow: If attacked, will not resist—humanity deserves extinction for past crimes
- Leaves Marley free to act
- Creates false history of humans living in walls for centuries

**The Century of Peace:**
- Eldians in walls live in ignorance
- Marley uses Seven Titans as weapons
- Marley plans to eventually invade for Founding Titan
- Send infiltrators to breach walls and create chaos

**The Breach:**
- Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie sent as children to infiltrate
- Mission: Breach walls, locate Founding Titan, retrieve it
- Colossal and Armored Titans attack
- Unintended consequence: Grisha Yeager steals Founding Titan, gives to Eren
- Marley loses track of Founding Titan

### The Titan Curse

**Mechanics:**
- Nine special Titans exist: Founding, Attack, Colossus, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer
- Inheritors gain power by consuming previous holder
- All inheritors die 13 years after receiving power (Ymir's curse)
- Pure Titans created by injecting Eldians with Titan serum
- Pure Titans driven to consume humans, hoping to become shifters again
- Only Eldians can become Titans (genetic)

**The Founding Titan:**
- Can command all Titans
- Can alter Eldian biology and memories
- Requires royal blood to use fully
- Non-royal with Founding can use if touching royal-blooded Titan
- First King's will overrides user unless certain conditions met

**Moral Implications:**
- Every Pure Titan was a person
- Marley creates Titans as punishment
- Thousands of transformed Eldians wander mindlessly
- Killing them is both mercy and murder

## Cultural and Social Dynamics

### Class Structure

- Most motivated to fight back

**Underground:**
- Criminals and forgotten poor
- Survival of fittest
- Outside normal social structure
- Source of unconventional talent

### Religion and Ideology

**Wall Cultists:**
- Worship the walls as divine
- Forbid any modifications to walls
- Actually correct—walls are Titans
- Seen as fanatics but protect an important secret

**Military Ideology:**
- Recon Corps: Freedom at any cost
- Garrison: Protect what we have
- Military Police: Maintain order and power

**Late Campaign Ideologies:**
- Yeagerists: Eldian supremacy, use Rumbling
- Peace Faction: Negotiate with Marley

### Daily Life

**Food:**
- Rationed in outer walls
- Abundant in inner wall
- Military gets priority
- Sasha steals food constantly (running gag and commentary)

**Entertainment:**
- Simple pleasures—taverns, festivals
- Propaganda plays
- Underground fighting rings
- Life goes on despite existential threat

**Education:**
- Military academy teaches Titan combat
- Civilian schools teach false history
- Truth emerges slowly, causing societal upheaval

**Economy:**
- Military-industrial complex
- Agriculture primary industry
- Trade with who? (Question that exposes lies)
- Technology suppressed by government

This deep lore reveals that the simple "humanity vs. monsters" premise is actually a complex story of historical crimes, justified revenge, and the question of whether cycles of hatred can ever be broken.
