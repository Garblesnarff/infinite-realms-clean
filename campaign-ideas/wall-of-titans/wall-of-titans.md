# Wall of Titans
**Tagline:** *Humanity's last bastion stands behind stone. Beyond the walls, giants walk.*

## Campaign Overview

For 107 years, humanity has lived inside three concentric walls, each 200 feet tall and wide enough that homes and farms are built into their structure. Beyond the walls, the Titans roam—giant humanoid creatures ranging from 15 to 60 feet tall, mindless and hungry, with only one apparent purpose: to devour humans. The walls have held for over a century, and an uneasy peace has settled over the interior territories. Most citizens have never seen a Titan. The walls are all they've ever known.

The players begin as members of the Recon Corps, an elite military unit tasked with venturing beyond the walls to map territory, study Titans, and search for resources. While the Garrison defends the walls and the Military Police maintain order within, the Recon Corps faces near-certain death every time they ride out. Casualty rates are above 60%, yet volunteers continue to join, driven by hope that one day humanity might reclaim the world beyond.

Everything changes when a Colossal Titan—60 feet tall, taller than the walls themselves—appears at the outermost gate. In seconds, it kicks through the reinforced barrier, allowing hundreds of smaller Titans to flood into the outer district. The party witnesses the horror firsthand: civilians devoured, soldiers torn apart, and the realization that the walls are not impregnable. As the outer district falls and refugees flood inward, the party discovers evidence suggesting the Titans are not natural creatures at all—and that the truth about humanity's imprisonment has been hidden by those in power for generations.

## Core Themes

- **Survival Against Overwhelming Odds:** Every mission could be the last
- **Mystery and Conspiracy:** What are Titans really? Why are we trapped here?
- **Sacrifice and Duty:** The Corps knows most of them will die, yet they serve
- **Hope vs. Despair:** Can humanity ever be free, or is existence within walls all there is?
- **Class Warfare:** Inner wall aristocrats vs. outer wall refugees
- **The Price of Safety:** How much freedom are you willing to sacrifice for security?
- **Identity and Transformation:** Discovering the horrifying truth about Titans

## Session Breakdown

### Arc 1: The Fall (Sessions 1-8)
**Sessions 1-2: Fresh Recruits**
The party completes their training and joins the Recon Corps. They meet fellow cadets, form bonds, and learn the reality of life beyond the walls through training exercises. Introduction to the three-dimensional maneuvering gear and the terrifying efficiency of Titans.

**Sessions 3-4: First Expedition**
The party's first mission beyond Wall Rose. They witness Titans firsthand—the unsettling human-like appearance, the grotesque smiles, the horrifying efficiency with which they hunt. Half their squad dies. The survivors barely make it back.

**Session 5: The Colossal Titan**
During a day of rest in the outer district, the Colossal Titan appears. The party witnesses the breach. Chaos, evacuation, desperate fighting. NPCs they've come to know are devoured before their eyes.

**Session 6-7: Defense of the District**
The party joins the desperate defense as smaller Titans flood through. Using their maneuvering gear in an urban environment, they save civilians and fight a retreating action. The outer district is lost. Tens of thousands die.

**Session 8: Aftermath and Questions**
In the refugee crisis that follows, the party notices inconsistencies. Garrison soldiers whisper about the Armored Titan that destroyed a second gate. The Military Police confiscate evidence and silence witnesses. Commander Erwin approaches the party with a secret mission.

### Arc 2: Beyond the Walls (Sessions 9-16)
**Sessions 9-10: The Secret Expedition**
Erwin tasks the party with investigating the Forest of Giant Trees, where Titans are strangely less active. They discover an abandoned village outside the walls—evidence that humans once lived beyond. The official history is a lie.

**Sessions 11-12: Capture Protocol**
The Corps attempts to capture a Titan alive for study. The party is key to the operation. They succeed, barely. Study of the living Titan reveals disturbing facts: it doesn't need to eat to survive, it actively seeks humans, and it regenerates injuries impossibly fast.

**Sessions 13-14: The Female Titan**
A strange Titan appears during an expedition—female, intelligent, and hunting specific people. It fights with martial skill and can harden its skin. The party realizes some Titans are different. The Female Titan nearly wipes out the expedition before retreating.

**Session 15: Betrayal Within**
Investigation reveals the Female Titan is one of the Corps members, able to transform. The party must hunt down the traitor while processing the revelation that Titans can be human. Multiple candidates are suspected. Trust shatters.

**Session 16: Revelation and Capture**
The Female Titan is captured. Under interrogation (she refuses to speak), the party learns there's a faction of titan-shifters working against humanity. But to what end? And why do they look human?

### Arc 3: Conspiracies and Lies (Sessions 17-24)
**Sessions 17-18: Political Intrigue**
The party is drawn into conflict between the Recon Corps, Military Police, and the aristocratic Walls Council. The Council wants the titan-shifter executed and all research halted. They fear what the truth might reveal. The party must navigate political machinations while people continue to die.

**Sessions 19-20: The Basement**
A cryptic clue suggests answers lie in a specific location in the lost outer district—now Titan territory. The party leads a desperate mission to retrieve documents from a sealed basement. What they find: photographs (impossible—the technology was supposedly lost), journals, and evidence of an advanced civilization beyond the walls.

**Sessions 21-22: Coup d'État**
Commander Erwin and the Recon Corps move against the corrupt government. The party must choose sides. If they support Erwin, they help overthrow the Military Police in a tense urban operation. The new government declassifies hidden information.

**Sessions 23-24: The Truth of the Walls**
Classified documents reveal the horrifying truth: the walls themselves are made of Titans—thousands of Colossal Titans standing in concentric circles, hardened into immobility. If they ever wake, the walls fall and humanity is crushed. The king who built the walls knew this. It was the only way to create barriers fast enough.

### Arc 4: The Ocean Beyond (Sessions 25-32)
**Sessions 25-26: Titan Serum**
The party discovers a serum that can transform humans into Titans. Experiments reveal that a human who becomes a Titan can return to human form if they consume another titan-shifter. The implications are horrifying: every mindless Titan was once a person, transformed and trapped in that state.

**Sessions 27-28: Reaching the Wall**
The party leads the Recon Corps on the most ambitious expedition ever: reaching the outer wall of the world, mentioned in ancient texts. They fight through Titan hordes, lose many comrades, but finally reach it. Beyond: the ocean. Humanity's prison extends farther than anyone knew.

**Sessions 29-30: The Enemy Nation**
Exploration beyond the ocean wall reveals the truth: there's another civilization across the sea. They sent the Titans. The walls weren't to keep Titans out—they were to keep a persecuted people in. The party's ancestors were imprisoned here a century ago for crimes committed by their forebears.

**Sessions 31-32: Return and Reckoning**
Returning with this knowledge, the party must decide: reveal the truth (causing panic and possible civil war) or keep the secret? They learn that the enemy nation plans a full-scale invasion, using Titan-shifters as weapons. The imprisoned civilization must prepare for war.

### Arc 5: The Rumbling (Sessions 33-40)
**Sessions 33-34: Preparing for War**
With invasion imminent, the party helps militarize their society. They train titan-shifters from volunteers (knowing many will die in the transformation). They plan to awaken the Wall Titans as a deterrent. Moral questions abound: is genocide acceptable to prevent genocide?

**Sessions 35-36: The Invasion Begins**
Enemy forces land with hundreds of Titan-shifters, modern weapons, and airships. The party leads defensive operations, using their superior knowledge of Titans but facing enemies with superior technology. Cities burn. The walls are breached in multiple places.

**Sessions 37-38: The Rumbling Protocol**
In desperation, the new government activates the Rumbling: waking the Wall Titans. Thousands of Colossal Titans begin to march. The party witnesses the power of extinction-level force. The Wall Titans crush everything in their path, heading for the enemy nation. Millions will die.

**Session 39: The Impossible Choice**
The party learns they can stop the Rumbling, but only by killing the person who activated it—a friend, ally, or loved one who believes genocide is the only way to ensure survival. The party must choose between saving the world and saving their own people.

**Session 40: Dawn After Darkness**
Final confrontation. Whether they stop the Rumbling or let it complete, consequences are catastrophic. Potential endings: peace through mutually assured destruction, pyrrhic victory with most of humanity dead, or a new beginning where former enemies must coexist knowing the horrors they've committed.

## Major Locations

**Wall Maria (Outermost Wall)**
Breached 107 years ago (in backstory) and recently breached again. Outer districts now Titan territory. Retaking this wall becomes major objective. Built from dormant Colossal Titans.

**Wall Rose (Middle Wall)**
Current primary defense. Most of the population lives here. Agricultural heartland. Less developed than inner wall but more populous. Where the party is initially stationed.

**Wall Sina (Innermost Wall)**
Aristocratic center. The capital sits here. Military Police headquarters. Corrupt government operates from this wall. Only the wealthy and politically connected live here. The party will infiltrate during the coup.

**The Forest of Giant Trees**
Strange woodland with trees over 200 feet tall. Titans behave differently here, less aggressive. Excellent terrain for maneuvering gear. Site of crucial battles. Hides secrets about the world's past.

**Shiganshina District**
Outer district where the breach occurred. The party's hometown for some. Now ruins inhabited by Titans. The basement with crucial evidence is here. Retaking this district becomes symbolic and strategic necessity.

**The Underground City**
Beneath the capital, a sprawling slum where the poor live in darkness. Captain Levi's origin. Represents class inequality. Hideout during the coup. Dangerous criminal element that can be recruited or fought.

**The Ocean**
Mythical destination. Ancient texts mention it but it was believed fictional. Reaching it proves the world extends beyond the walls. First time seeing it is transformative moment for characters. Beyond it: the enemy nation.

**Marley Empire**
Enemy nation across the sea. Technologically advanced. Uses Titans as weapons of war. Imprisoned the party's civilization as punishment for ancient genocide. Plans invasion to secure resources. Final arc's primary setting.

## Unique Mechanics

### Three-Dimensional Maneuvering Gear
- **Equipment:** Gas-powered grappling hooks and retractable cables attached to waist
- **Gameplay:** Allows aerial mobility when there are anchor points (buildings, trees, Titans)
- **Skill Checks:** Dexterity (Acrobatics) for complex maneuvers, Constitution for extended use (physically exhausting)
- **Gas Management:** Limited fuel, must manage usage during missions
- **Combat Applications:** Allows attacks from any angle, specifically targeting Titan weak points
- **Risk:** Miscalculation means crashing, falling, or being caught by Titans

### Titan Combat
- **Weak Point System:** Only the nape of the neck (1-foot wide, 4 inches deep) is lethal
- **Regeneration:** Titans heal all other damage within minutes
- **Size Categories:** 3-15 meters (small), 15-30 meters (medium), 30+ meters (Colossal)
- **Abnormal Titans:** Some move faster, smarter, or unpredictably
- **Combat Flow:** Players must create openings, coordinate strikes, and execute perfectly
- **Titan-Shifters:** Boss-fight Titans with intelligence, can harden skin, require sustained assault

### Titan Transformation (Late Campaign)
- **Trigger:** Self-inflicted wound with specific intention
- **Forms:** Each shifter has unique Titan form (15-60 feet)
- **Duration:** Limited by stamina, approximately 30 minutes
- **Strain:** Physical and mental exhaustion afterward, potential for losing control
- **Mortality:** Human body is at Titan's nape, remains vulnerable
- **Inheritance:** Shifter powers transfer to another if current holder is consumed

### Expedition Mechanics
- **Formation System:** Recon Corps uses specific travel formations, roles assigned
- **Supply Management:** Track rations, gas, spare blades, horses
- **Random Encounters:** Titans appear based on distance from walls and terrain
- **Objectives:** Mapping, resource gathering, rescue missions, strategic targets
- **Return Protocol:** Must calculate if resources allow safe return before venturing farther

### Political Influence
- **Reputation Tracks:** Recon Corps, Military Police, Aristocracy, Commoners
- **Decisions Impact:** Mission outcomes, NPC deaths, and ethical choices affect standing
- **Resources:** Higher reputation grants better equipment, more mission autonomy
- **Coup Mechanics:** During political arc, players must secure support from factions

### Morale and Trauma
- **Casualty Impact:** Each NPC death affects party morale
- **Trauma Events:** Witnessing Titan consumption, losing squad members, discovering truths
- **Mechanical Effects:** Disadvantage on checks after traumatic events, must pass Wisdom saves
- **Recovery:** Downtime, therapy, and comradery restore mental health
- **Breaking Points:** Characters can snap, requiring intervention or becoming liabilities

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Titans Were Human**
Discovery that every Titan was once a person, transformed by injection or inherited curse. Killing them becomes morally complex.

**Twist 2: The Walls Are Titans**
The protective barriers are thousands of dormant Colossal Titans. If they wake, they'll crush everything between the walls.

**Twist 3: Allies Are Enemies**
Several recruits are enemy infiltrators with Titan-shifting abilities. Trust within the Corps shatters.

Only those with royal lineage can command Pure Titans or activate the Rumbling. Historia's heritage makes her key to everything.

**Twist 7: The Ackerman Bloodline**
Certain families were genetically modified in the past. Levi and Mikasa possess superhuman abilities, making them living weapons.

**Twist 8: The Thirteen-Year Curse**
All Titan-shifters die exactly thirteen years after gaining their power. Becoming a weapon means accepting death sentence.
