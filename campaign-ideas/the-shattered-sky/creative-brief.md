# The Shattered Sky - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Multiversal Surrealism** - Reality warping visually. Multiple planes visible simultaneously. Impossible geometry. MC Escher meets Alex Grey. Beautiful and terrifying overlap of dimensions.

## Color Palettes
- **Material Plane**: Normal colors distorting, breaking down
- **Fire Plane Bleed**: Orange/red overwhelming reality
- **Feywild Bleed**: Oversaturated magical colors, dreams
- **Shadowfell Bleed**: Desaturated greys, eternal twilight
- **Far Realm**: Colors that shouldn't exist, sanity-breaking hues

## Music & Sound
**Main Theme**: "Reality Fractures" - Multiple genre/styles playing simultaneously (ordered chaos), shifts between dimensions musically. **Planar Themes**: Each plane has signature sound that bleeds through. **Combat**: Multi-dimensional echoes, sounds from wrong places.

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 1**: Sky literally cracking, rift opening, fire raining down
- **Session 21**: Far Realm first view—geometry impossible, colors wrong, sanity breaking
- **Session 33**: All planes visible at once, reality kaleidoscope, beautiful chaos
