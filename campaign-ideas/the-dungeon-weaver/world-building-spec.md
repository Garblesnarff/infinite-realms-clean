### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Dungeon Weaver**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party awakens transformed into weak monster creatures in the deepest levels of the Abyssal Grotto, a lethal dungeon created by a mad archmage. They must survive by consuming other monsters to evolve, climbing from the deadliest depths to the surface while deciding whether to embrace monstrous power or cling to fading humanity. The campaign explores survival, evolution, and the cost of power.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the creation of the Abyssal Grotto by Archmage Velthara and her transformation experiments.
    *   Explain the ecology of the dungeon—how monsters sustain themselves, natural predator-prey relationships, and the evolution phenomenon.
    *   Write the history of previous expeditions into the Grotto and what happened to them.
    *   Describe the transformation magic—how it works, why it creates human-intelligent monsters, and whether it's reversible.
    *   Chronicle Velthara's background—why she became obsessed with creating perfect monster-soldiers.
    *   Detail the surface kingdoms and why they haven't destroyed the Grotto.
    *   Explain the evolution chamber phenomenon—natural magical formations that facilitate rapid evolution.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Party maintains high Humanity scores: Easier to negotiate with Transformed, harder time with monster tribes, better ending options available.
    *   **IF:** Party drops to low Humanity: Stronger in combat, monster tribes respect them, risk losing player agency, harder to reverse transformation.
    *   **IF:** Party allies with Skulltakers: Gain martial training, access to their territory, forced to participate in raids, Velthara views them as threats.
    *   **IF:** Party allies with Web Collective: Gain web-crafting abilities, ambush tactics, but Whisper may betray them to Velthara.
    *   **IF:** Party helps the Transformed: Gain allies for final assault, slows their own evolution, earns Velthara's interest.
    *   **IF:** Party consumes rare/powerful creatures: Unlock unique evolution paths, gain power quickly, risk indigestion and Humanity loss.
    *   **IF:** Party reaches surface as monsters: Captain Elara hunts them, must prove their humanity or fight surface forces.
    *   **IF:** Party chooses to serve Velthara: Become apex forms, gain power, lose freedom, bad ending for surface kingdoms.
    *   **IF:** Party reverses transformation: Return to human, lose all monster powers, but keep souls intact, bittersweet ending.
    *   **IF:** Party defeats Velthara and takes her research: Become monstrous but free, create sanctuary for Transformed, forge new path.

**7. Evolution System Specifics**
*   **Directive:** Define the mechanical implementation.
*   **Evolution Points:** Gained from consuming monsters (1 EP per CR), major milestones (5 EP), quest completion (3-10 EP).
*   **Evolution Tiers:** Cost 5/10/20/40 EP for Tiers 1/2/3/4.
*   **Evolution Paths:** Each base form has 3-4 specialization branches (combat, stealth, magic, utility).
*   **Humanity Cost:** Each evolution past Tier 1 costs 1-3 Humanity based on how monstrous the form.
*   **Special Traits:** Consuming specific creature types grants unique abilities (flight from bats, poison from venomous creatures, magic from spell-casters).

**8. Dungeon Ecology**
*   **Directive:** The dungeon is a functioning ecosystem.
*   **Food Chain:** Small creatures feed on dungeon moss/fungi, medium creatures hunt small ones, apex predators hunt medium creatures, party fits in middle initially.
*   **Territory:** Each species controls specific areas. Intruding risks combat.
*   **Evolution Pressure:** Creatures naturally evolve over time, making the dungeon increasingly dangerous.
*   **Safe Zones:** Evolution chambers, certain myconid groves, hidden alcoves—necessary for resting.

**9. Timeline (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Without learning to hunt, party starves or is killed by Abyssal Crawler.
*   **Session 2:** Without evolution, party cannot advance to next level.
*   **Session 3:** Fungal Warrens become inhospitable as war escalates.
*   **Session 4-5:** Monster tribes eliminate each other, survivors grow extremely powerful.
*   **Session 6:** Velthara completes her army and invades surface.
*   **Session 7-8:** Surface kingdoms fall. Velthara transforms entire populations. The world becomes a monster-ruled nightmare.

This specification creates a living dungeon ecosystem where survival requires constant adaptation and player choices determine whether they remain human in mind while becoming monsters in body.
