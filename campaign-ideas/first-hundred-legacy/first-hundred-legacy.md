---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** First Hundred Legacy
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Hard Sci-Fi / Political Factions / Terraforming / Colony Building
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14–16**
**Tone (keywords):** hard science, terraforming, political factions, resource scarcity, ideological conflict, building civilization, Red vs. Green
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of members of the First Hundred—the initial colonists sent to terraform Mars into a habitable world—each bringing different expertise (geology, biology, engineering, medicine, politics). As they build humanity's first Martian civilization, they fracture into ideological factions: the Reds (preserve Mars pristine), the Greens (terraform aggressively), and various political movements (scientific utopians, corporate capitalists, revolutionary anarchists). Through decades of construction, scientific challenges, political betrayals, and eventually violent revolution, the party must decide what kind of civilization Mars will become and whether they can prevent Earth's corrupt systems from infecting their new world.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Abbreviated)

### Sessions 1-4 — "First Landing"
*   Arrival on Mars, establishing base camp, initial scientific surveys, forming relationships and factions within the First Hundred.

### Sessions 5-8 — "The Great Projects"
*   Building the first permanent settlements, beginning terraforming (orbital mirrors, greenhouse gas factories), political tensions emerge.

### Sessions 9-12 — "The Fracturing"
*   Earth's megacorporations arrive with immigrant waves, Red vs. Green conflict intensifies, assassination of John Boone (leader figure).

### Sessions 13-16 — "The Revolution"
*   Underground resistance against corporate control, sabotage of terraforming projects, violent uprising across Martian settlements.

### Sessions 17-20 — "The New Mars"

    *   First human on Mars, charismatic leader, seeks unity but is assassinated midway through campaign.

2.  **Frank Chalmers** — *The Politician*
    *   Pragmatic, manipulative, rivals with Boone, represents realpolitik over idealism.

3.  **Arkady Bogdanov** — *The Revolutionary*
    *   Anarchist engineer, believes Mars should be free from Earth's hierarchies.

4.  **Hiroko Ai** — *The Eco-Mystic*
    *   Geneticist who creates hidden colony, believes Mars has spiritual value, founder of Areophany (Mars religion).

5.  **Ann Clayborne** — *The Red Leader*
    *   Geologist fiercely opposed to terraforming, sees it as destruction of pristine alien world.

6.  **Sax Russell** — *The Green Leader*

## Key Locations

1.  **Underhill:** First permanent Martian base, starting settlement.
2.  **Olympus Mons:** Largest volcano in solar system, site of major projects.
3.  **Valles Marineris:** Massive canyon system, eventual site of water introduction.
4.  **The Hidden Colony:** Hiroko's secret eco-sanctuary.
5.  **Burroughs:** Major city built by corporate interests.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is preservation versus transformation, independence versus corporate control, and what values should guide a new civilization. It explores whether Mars belongs to itself or humanity, whether nature has inherent rights, and if revolution can create better societies or just repeats old mistakes.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Terraforming Progress Tracker**
*   Campaign tracks atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water presence over decades.
*   **Player Choices:** Scientific projects directly affect Mars' environment.

### 2. **Faction Influence**
*   Party members align with factions (Red, Green, Corporate, Anarchist). High influence unlocks resources but creates enemies.

### 3. **Longevity Treatments**
*   Characters receive anti-aging therapy, allowing them to live through decades of campaign time, but with psychological costs.

### 4. **Scientific Challenges**
*   Players must solve real engineering problems (heat retention, water sources, crop growth) using actual science.

### 5. **Time Skips**
*   Campaign spans 40+ years, with time jumps between major events showing Mars' transformation.
