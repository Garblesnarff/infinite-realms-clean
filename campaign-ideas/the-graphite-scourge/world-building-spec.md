# World-Building Specification Brief: The Graphite Scourge

**Core Concept:** Players respond to a magical reactor explosion at the Tower of Radiance. The government lies about the disaster's scope. They must contain catastrophic radiation while being lethally exposed. Every hour shortens their lives. Heroism means choosing to die saving thousands. The campaign explores sacrifice, truth versus coverup, and ordinary people becoming martyrs.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   The Tower of Radiance—magical reactor tapping planar energy for power.
*   The safety test that went catastrophically wrong, exposing the core.
*   Radiation as invisible, cumulative death—roentgens, rads, exposure limits.
*   Soviet-style government prioritizing image over lives, systematic coverup.

**Factions:**
*   **The Liquidators:** Workers (party) cleaning up disaster, knowingly dying.
*   **The Government:** Officials covering up disaster scope, silencing truth.
*   **The Scientists:** Researchers fighting bureaucracy to reveal truth.
*   **The Civilians:** Evacuees and victims, unaware of true danger.

**Locations:**
*   **The Tower of Radiance:** Magical reactor, exposed core, ground zero.
*   **The Control Room:** Where disaster began, radioactive, bodies.
*   **The Roof:** Covered in radioactive graphite, 90-second lethal exposure.
*   **Hospital 6:** Where first responders die from radiation sickness.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party refuses suicide missions, THEN disaster escalates—steam explosion contaminates half the realm.
*   IF the party exposes the coverup publicly, THEN the government silences them through imprisonment or assassination.
*   IF radiation exposure exceeds limits, THEN characters develop ARS (Acute Radiation Syndrome) and die slowly.
