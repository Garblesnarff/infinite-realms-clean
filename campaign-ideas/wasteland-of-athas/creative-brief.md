# Creative Brief: Wasteland of Athas

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Post-Apocalyptic Desert Fantasy (Dark Sun-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal sun-scorched aesthetics of *Dark Sun*, *Mad Max*, and ancient Near Eastern civilizations fallen to ruin. This style captures the harsh beauty of endless deserts, the desperation of dying worlds, gladiatorial brutality, and the decadent cruelty of immortal sorcerer-kings.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Brutal Survival:** Scarred bodies, weathered equipment, visible desperation
*   **Desert Dominance:** Endless sand, scorching sun, no green life except rare oases
*   **Ancient Decadence:** Crumbling ziggurats, opulent palaces amid poverty, bronze age aesthetics
*   **Alien Races:** Insectoid warriors, giant-blooded beings, unique fantasy races adapted to extremes

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Harsh, brutal, dying world, sun-scorched, desperate survival, gladiatorial, ancient corruption, no mercy
*   **Feeling:** The weight of the sun pressing down on everything. Beauty found in stark landscapes and defiant survival. Cruelty as normal. Freedom as impossible dream.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Desert Dominance:** Ochre, burnt sienna, sand yellow, bleached bone white
*   **Sky:** Perpetual harsh sun, deep crimson at dawn/dusk, purple-black at night
*   **City-States:** Bronze, tarnished gold, dried blood red, shadow black
*   **Rare Life:** Sickly green when magic defiles, vibrant green at precious oases
*   **Character Tones:** Tanned skin, weathered leather, bone armor, minimal metal
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette dominated by ochre desert sands and bleached bone white. The sky burns crimson-orange near the horizon. Bronze and tarnished gold architecture. Characters wear sand-colored wraps and leather with bone armor plates. A rare patch of green plants looks sickly and wrong. No reflective metal anywhere."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Gladiators:** Muscular, scarred bodies, minimal armor (bone, chitin, hide), tribal tattoos, brands of ownership
*   **Slaves:** Ragged clothing, slave brands visible, desperate eyes, survival adaptations
*   **Templars:** Ornate bronze armor with ceremonial elements, masks, symbols of authority
*   **Sorcerer-Kings:** Ancient, inhuman features showing draconic transformation—scales, elongated features, reptilian eyes
*   **Desert Races:** Muls (stocky, hairless), thri-kreen (mantis features, four arms, chitin), half-giants (enormous but simple)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A mul gladiator—hairless, stocky, powerful build with human and dwarf features. Numerous scars across bronze-tanned skin. Wears minimal armor made of giant insect chitin plates. Bone sword in hand. Slave brand on shoulder. Determined, desperate eyes. Stands on sandy arena floor under brutal sun."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Arena:** Massive sandy pit surrounded by stone tiers, noble boxes shaded by silk, blood-stained sand
*   **City-States:** Ziggurats and mudbrick buildings, bronze gates, grand but showing age, clear wealth divide
*   **The Wastes:** Endless dunes, rocky badlands, salt flats, dead trees petrified, brutal emptiness
*   **Oases:** Rare green spots guarded jealously, palm trees, precious water
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive gladiatorial arena carved from red sandstone. Tiered seating rises high, with opulent silk-shaded boxes for nobles at the top. The arena floor is sand stained dark with old blood. Bone weapons and chitin armor litter one corner. The brutal sun beats down mercilessly. In the distance, a bronze ziggurat rises above mudbrick buildings."

**5. Magic and Defilement:**
*   **Defiling Magic:** Visible destruction—plants wither to ash, concentric circles of death spreading outward
*   **Life Drain:** Victims age rapidly, skin graying, essence visibly pulled toward caster
*   **Preserving Magic:** Normal spell effects but careful, deliberate, no environmental damage
*   **Elemental Clerics:** Fire, earth, water, and air manifestations (no divine light)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A defiler wizard casting a spell. Energy crackles around their hands as a circle of destruction spreads outward. The few desert plants within thirty feet wither to gray ash instantly. The sandy ground turns black and dead. Nearby slaves age visibly, skin graying, screaming as their life force is drained. The wizard's eyes glow with stolen vitality."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Harsh Sun:** Strong top-down lighting, deep black shadows, extreme contrast
*   **Heat Shimmer:** Visible distortion in distance, mirages
*   **Interior Darkness:** Deep shadows in buildings, contrast with brutal exterior light
*   **Fire Light:** Orange and red at night, casting dramatic shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by brutal overhead sunlight creating harsh shadows and extreme contrast. Heat shimmer distorts the distant horizon. Skin glistens with sweat. Deep black shadows offer no relief. Everything looks bleached and sun-scorched. At night, firelight casts orange-red illumination with dancing shadows."

## Voice

A weathered survivor's voice, gravelly from sand and sun, speaking with hard-won wisdom. The pacing is measured but intense, like someone rationing strength. The tone shifts between cynical observation and fierce determination. Occasional harsh laughs at bitter ironies. Underlying theme of defiance against impossible odds. The voice carries the weight of slavery and the fire of rebellion. Sparse with words—in the desert, everything is rationed. Role: The voice of desperate survival and revolutionary hope.
