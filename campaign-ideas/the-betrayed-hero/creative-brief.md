# Creative Brief: The Betrayed Hero

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy with Heroic Undertones

Inspired by *The Rising of the Shield Hero*, combining dark, gritty realism with moments of genuine heroism and hope. This style should convey both the harsh injustice the players face and their determination to rise above it. Beauty exists but is often tainted by corruption or prejudice.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Duality of Perception:** Show the contrast between how the players are perceived (villainous, threatening) versus who they actually are (protective, determined).
*   **Defensive Aesthetic:** Shields are the visual centerpiece - show them as both protection and symbol. Make them beautiful and formidable.
*   **Growth from Darkness:** Visual progression from despair to determination. Early scenes darker, later scenes showing earned hope.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dark, determined, gritty, unjust, resilient, gradually hopeful, tactical, protective, bitter but noble.
*   **Feeling:** The world is unfair but worth protecting. Isolation and determination coexist. Beauty earned through hardship means more. Trust must be built carefully.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Detailed, somewhat realistic anime style. Emphasis on worn, practical equipment that shows use. Shields should be intricate and imposing.
*   **Textures:** Rough and real - worn metal, practical leather, scarred wood. As campaign progresses, equipment becomes more refined but never pristine.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Detailed anime-style illustration with realistic textures. Focus on worn, practical equipment showing signs of hard use. The shield is intricately detailed with absorbed materials visible in its design..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Initially desaturated and dark, gradually becoming warmer as hope builds. Heavy use of greens for shields, browns for practicality, dark blues for night and isolation.
*   **Accent Colors:** Green for shield abilities, red for rage and Waves, gold for rare moments of recognition, warm oranges for found family moments.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a somewhat desaturated color palette dominated by dark greens, browns, and grays, with warm orange-gold light providing contrast in moments of hope and companionship."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic proportions with anime influence. Characters should look capable and scarred by experience. Shield Heroes wear practical armor that integrates shields.
*   **Clothing:** Practical adventuring gear that improves over time. Raphtalia grows from rags to warrior's garb. Companions show visual progression.
*   **Expression:** Guarded, determined, showing both pain and resolve. Rare smiles mean something. Trust must be earned and shown carefully.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An anime-style character portrait of a young person in practical adventuring gear, holding an ornate shield. Their expression shows both exhaustion and fierce determination, with guarded eyes that have seen betrayal."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Medieval fantasy with emphasis on social stratification. Show the divide between rich castle districts and poor demi-human slums.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often overcast or harsh lighting. Demi-human villages are humbler but warmer. Waves feature dimensional distortion and horror elements.
*   **Details:** Include visual signs of prejudice - segregated areas, hostile glances, wanted posters, contrasted with the genuine gratitude of those the players help.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval fantasy town with clear social division - the wealthy district in the background with castle walls, and the foreground showing the humble demi-human quarter where the party finds allies."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and harsh in hostile environments, softer and warmer in safe spaces with companions. Use lighting to show emotional state.
*   **Light Sources:** Often harsh daylight showing no mercy, or dim firelight in camps. Shield abilities create green magical light. Wave scenes have unnatural, distorted lighting.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and present, suggesting both threat and the need for vigilance. Lighter shadows in moments of safety with trusted companions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...harsh, unforgiving daylight creating sharp shadows that emphasize isolation. The only warmth comes from the subtle green glow of shield abilities protecting others."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often shows the party as alone or outnumbered. Use composition to show isolation, then gradually show them surrounded by allies. Shields frame and protect.
*   **Techniques:** Frame players separate from hostile crowds. Show them back-to-back with trusted companions. Use shields as compositional elements that divide or protect.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition showing the shield hero standing alone in a crowded marketplace, hostile faces in the background out of focus. The ornate shield is prominently displayed, separating the hero from the crowd."

## Voice

A voice marked by quiet determination and suppressed anger. There's a roughness there, like someone who's learned not to trust easily but still chooses to protect. Pacing is measured and controlled - they've learned to think before speaking. Emotion is carefully guarded but breaks through in moments of genuine connection or righteous anger. The overall tone suggests someone who's been hurt but refuses to break, who protects others precisely because they know what it's like to be abandoned. Audio quality is clear but has an edge, like someone always ready for the next betrayal. Role: A hero who chooses to be one despite having every reason not to.

## Music Direction

Orchestral dark fantasy with gradual progression toward hope. Main theme should be melancholic but determined - strings and low brass suggesting both pain and resolve. Battle music is tactical and intense. Wave encounters feature horror-influenced distortion. Character themes reflect journeys: Raphtalia's grows from fearful to heroic, Filo's is energetic and innocent. Found family moments use warm acoustic instruments. The overall sound should support the journey from bitter isolation to hard-won trust and earned heroism.
