# Kingsmen of the Crystal Crown - Creative Brief

## Art Style: Bespoke Ultraviolence

**Refined Brutality** - Savile Row meets John Wick. Every frame should look like fashion photography until someone's skull gets crushed with an umbrella. Slow-motion for style, frenetic chaos for impact. Color grading: rich, saturated, expensive-looking.

## Color Palettes

- **Kingsmen**: Navy, charcoal, burgundy, gold accents
- **Valentine**: White, gold, high-tech chrome, clinical
- **Action**: Explosive contrast, blood against tailored suits
- **Statesman**: Browns, leather, whiskey amber, stars and stripes

## Music

**Main Theme**: Classical orchestral meets modern electronic. Gentleman's refinement with contemporary edge.
- **Action**: Driving rock/electronic, Free Bird-style classics
- **Formal**: Classical music juxtaposed with violence
- **Training**: Military drums with posh strings
- **Valentine**: Unsettling pleasant music for horror

## Voice Direction

**Lord Arthur**: Colin Firth's perfect received pronunciation, unflappable
**Merlin**: Scottish brogue, pragmatic, warm underneath
**Valentine**: Samuel L. Jackson's lisp-affected charm, Silicon Valley enthusiast
**Gazelle**: Minimal speech, let actions speak (Sofia Boutella's physicality)
**Whiskey**: Southern gentleman drawl, charming and dangerous

## Cinematic Moments

- **Pub Fight**: "Manners maketh man" leading to stylized brawl
- **Skydive**: Gentlemen falling through sky in formal wear
- **The Church**: Single-take ultraviolence nightmare sequence
- **Gentleman's Duel**: Formal combat, choreographed perfection
- **Final Battle**: Simultaneous worldwide Kingsmen operations
