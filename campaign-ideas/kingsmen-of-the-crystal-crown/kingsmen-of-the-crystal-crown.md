# Kingsmen of the Crystal Crown
## *"Manners Maketh Man"*

### Campaign Overview

The Kingsmen—an ancient order of gentleman spies operating from a tailor shop—protect the realm through impeccable manners, devastating violence, and bespoke magical equipment. When a tech-revolutionary noble plans to distribute mind-control crystals disguised as communication devices to every citizen ("free thought is obsolete"), the Kingsmen must stop a conspiracy that weaponizes the very progress everyone celebrates.

Players are new recruits trained in the elegant art of sophisticated espionage: formal combat, social infiltration, and the proper way to deploy an explosive bow tie. From high society balls to underground fight clubs, from diplomatic summits to street-level brawls, the Kingsmen operate where courtesy meets lethality. Because a gentleman can kill you in seventeen ways with an umbrella, but will offer tea first.

This is a campaign about class, style, and the responsibility that comes with power. Where a perfectly tailored suit is armor, a well-turned phrase is a weapon, and the difference between civilization and chaos is choosing to be polite while being absolutely deadly.

**The Church Scene**: Rogue Kingsman under mind control massacres civilians—horror and guilt.

**Kingsmen Destroyed**: Headquarters bombed, most agents killed, order nearly extinct.

**Statesman Betrayal**: Whiskey's personal loss makes him compromise mission for revenge.

**Princess Surprise**: Captured royal becomes agent, subverts damsel trope.

**Poppy's Hostages**: Millions of innocent drug users held hostage, president refuses ransom.

**The President's Choice**: Leader willing to let citizens die to win drug war.

**Golden Circle Scale**: Not just criminals, legitimate businesses involved.

**The Final Test**: Each player faces impossible choice revealing true character.

**Rebuilding**: Campaign ends with creating new Kingsmen for new era.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Stop Valentine's global activation; prevent millions of deaths; destroy mind-control network.

**Secondary**: Preserve Kingsmen order and ideals; protect innocents; maintain secret.

**Personal**: Each player proves worthy of Kingsman title; earns code name; honors mentor.

**Moral**: Stop villains without becoming them; maintain standards even under pressure.

**Perfect**: Save all hostages; reform not just defeat villains; rebuild order stronger than before; create international alliance of gentleman spies.

### Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic**: Global activation succeeds, humanity self-destructs, Valentine's plan works.

**Organizational**: Kingsmen destroyed permanently, ideals lost, chaos wins.

**Personal**: Players become assassins without honor, just killers in suits.

**Moral**: Win through methods that betray everything Kingsmen represent.

**Tragic**: Save the day but lose themselves, become monsters fighting monsters.

### Campaign Tone

This is Kingsman films directly—ultraviolence wrapped in sophistication, class warfare commentary with action movie spectacle, found family of gentleman spies. Balance crude humor with genuine emotion, over-the-top action with real stakes.

Fight scenes should be balletic and brutal. Social scenes should matter as much as combat. Characters should have depth beneath style. Make players feel genuinely cool when they nail the perfect gentleman spy moment—saving the world while looking absolutely magnificent.

Embrace the contrast: incredibly polite while incredibly deadly. Let players be both street-level real and impossibly stylish. Every mission should have both formal infiltration and explosive action. Most importantly: manners maketh man, even when man maketh corpses.
