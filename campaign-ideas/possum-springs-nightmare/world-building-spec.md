**Possum Springs Nightmare**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Mae returns to dying hometown Possum Springs after dropping out of college. Reconnecting with friends Bea, Gregg, and Angus, she discovers people are disappearing. Investigation reveals a cult of desperate townsfolk sacrificing people to a cosmic entity beneath the abandoned mines, believing it will restore economic prosperity. The party must balance slice-of-life friendship moments with creeping horror, ultimately confronting both cosmic insignificance and economic despair. Victory isn't defeating the horror but maintaining human connection despite it.

**7. Mundane Horror**
*   The cosmic entity is terrifying but abstract.
*   The real horror is economic despair driving neighbors to murder.
*   Cultists are teachers, shop owners, parents—banality of evil.
*   Can't defeat capitalism or cosmic horror—both are too big.
*   Victory is small—friendship enduring despite impossible odds.
*   Theme: Sometimes you can't fix the world, only be there for each other.

**8. Mental Health Representation**
*   Mae has anxiety and dissociation—portrayed respectfully.
*   Gregg likely has untreated bipolar disorder—manic episodes, crashes.
*   Bea has depression from crushing responsibility.
*   Angus has PTSD from childhood abuse.
*   Mental health is present but not "solved"—ongoing struggle.
*   Friendship helps manage, not cure—realistic portrayal.

**9. Quarter-Life Crisis Themes**
*   Mae's return represents failure (in her mind)—dropped out, back home, no plan.
*   Bea represents being trapped—couldn't leave, stuck with responsibility.
*   Gregg represents desperate escape—will do anything to get out.
*   Angus represents quiet endurance—finding peace in small things.
*   All facing the question: What do we do with our lives when the world is broken?
*   No easy answers—just keep going, support each other, find meaning where you can.
