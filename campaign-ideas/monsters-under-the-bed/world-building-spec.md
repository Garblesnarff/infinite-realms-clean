## Hidden Lore

### The First Child's Story
Once, long ago, first human child feared the dark. That fear was so pure, so primal, it created the Boogeyman. Every subsequent child's fear has fed it. It's as old as human consciousness.

### The Parent Connection
Shadow Parents exist because real parents were afraid too—of failing their children, of monsters hurting their babies. Parent fear created protective energy that twisted into these entities.

### The Teddy Truth
Original Teddy was made by First Child to fight First Fear. Has been fighting for millennia. Worn down but never defeated. If Teddy falls, no comfort objects can resist anymore.

### The Growing Up Curse
Dream Children are adults who never fully processed childhood fear. That unresolved trauma keeps connection open. Healing childhood wounds might close portal but also mean confronting what they've avoided for decades.

### The Cycle
There have been previous Dream Children. They either: Stayed as protectors (Teddy Bears), were consumed (became monsters), escaped (closed their portal only), or transcended (became Night Light Keepers). The party is latest in long line.
