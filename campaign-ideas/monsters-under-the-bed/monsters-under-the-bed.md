# Monsters Under the Bed
## "Your Childhood Fears Remember You"

### Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a world where childhood fears are real and hunting them. Every monster under the bed, every shadow in the closet, every nightmare that made you pull the covers tight—they all exist in the Realm of Forgotten Terrors, and they remember the children who feared them. Now those children are adults, and the monsters are coming for them.

The party members are pulled into this realm when their forgotten childhood fears manifest and attack. They discover they're Dream Children—adults who never fully outgrew their night terrors, maintaining a psychic connection to the fear realm. The Boogeyman Supreme, a entity formed from every child's fear of the dark, is gathering an army to invade the waking world and feast on adult terrors, which are so much richer than children's simple fears.

This campaign explores childhood trauma, facing buried fears, the transition from innocent terror to complex anxiety, and what it means when your childish nightmares become real. Players will confront personalized manifestations of what scared them as kids and learn that some monsters are scarier as adults.

### Key NPCs

**The Boogeyman Supreme** (Antagonist)
The amalgamation of every child's fear of the dark. Appears as shifting darkness with too many eyes and not enough form. Feeds on fear, grows stronger on terror. Genuinely terrifying but also tragic—it exists only because children are afraid. Can't be killed while fear exists. Wants to invade waking world because adult fears are more complex and filling. Speaks in whispers from under beds.

**The Closet King** (Elite Monster)
Ruler of the things-that-hide-in-small-spaces. Aristocratic, refined, predatory. Appears as whatever fits in your closet but shouldn't. Feeds on shame and secrets. More sophisticated than simple fear. Represents things children hide—and what adults hide from.

**Teddy** (Unexpected Ally)
An old teddy bear given life by a child's love and need for protection. Now leads the Teddy Bear Resistance—protectors trying to defend against fear monsters. Worn, missing an eye, stuffing leaking, but brave. Represents childhood comfort and safety. Kind but battle-scarred.

**The First Frightened Child** (Ancient Victim)
The first human child who ever feared the dark, trapped here for millennia. Appears as a primitive child who never aged mentally. Both innocent and alien. Created this realm through primal fear. Holds the key to ending or transforming it.

**Your Childhood Self** (Reflection)
Each party member meets themselves as a child—the version that was afraid. Innocent, terrified, looking to adult self for protection. Represents who they were before trauma/fear shaped them. Must be protected or embraced.

**The Imaginary Friend** (Ambiguous)
Manifested protector some party member had as a child. Helpful but increasingly unsettling as you realize they're powered by fear too. May be ally or eventual enemy. Blurs line between comfort and terror.

**Shadow Parents** (Twisted Familiar)
Wrong versions of party members' childhood parents. Sometimes protective, sometimes neglectful, sometimes monstrous—depends on childhood experience. Represent authority figures that both protected and frightened. Complex encounters.

**The Night Light Keepers** (Neutral Faction)
Entities that exist in the small safe zones created by night lights. Neither monster nor protector—they are the boundary itself. Can offer sanctuary but can't leave their circles of light. Led by the Warm Glow, a manifestation of comfort.

### Major Locations

**The Bedroom Endless** (Starting Zone)
An infinite version of childhood bedrooms—every kid's room exists here. The bed is huge from child's perspective. The closet door always creaks. Under the bed is impossibly deep. Windows show eternal night. Familiar and wrong. The party's specific rooms are here, exactly as remembered (with additions that weren't there).

**Under the Bed** (Underworld)
The space beneath beds has become a vast network of tunnels and caverns. Dark, cramped, claustrophobic. Where lesser fear monsters dwell. Dust bunnies the size of dogs. Lost toys animated. Sounds of breathing that isn't yours. The Boogeyman's domain starts here.

**The Closet Labyrinth** (Hostile Territory)
An maze of closets, all interconnected. Each opens to different nightmares. Some have monsters. Some have skeletons. Some lead to nowhere. The Closet King rules here. Everything hidden is here—secrets, shame, forgotten things. Adults' closets have darker contents than children's.

**The Hallway of Doors** (Navigation)
Infinite hallway with bedroom doors. Each leads to different fear scenario. Some doors have light underneath. Others breathe. A few are locked. Navigation challenge—finding right door among thousands. The bathroom door is always the scariest for some reason.

**The Basement of Primal Dark** (Deepest Layer)
Where the Boogeyman dwells. Absolute darkness that consumes light. Sounds without source. Touch without entity. The fear that predates language. Where terror began. Only accessible through facing all other fears first. The First Frightened Child is here too, curled in a corner.

**The Attic of Forgotten Things** (Repository)
Where lost childhood items go. Broken toys, abandoned games, outgrown clothes. Sad but safe. The Teddy Bear Resistance headquarters. Contains memories of happiness mixed with nostalgia's melancholy. Shows what was left behind growing up.

**The Night Light Sanctuaries** (Safe Zones)
Circles of warm light in the darkness. Monsters can't enter. Temporary safety. But the lights are failing one by one as the Boogeyman grows stronger. Children's laughter echoes here—memories of when fear was defeated by comfort.

**The Schoolyard After Dark** (Social Fears)
Where social childhood fears manifest—bullies, embarrassment, rejection. Different from monster fears. Shows the transition from simple "what's in the dark" to complex "what people think of me." More painful for some party members than monsters.

### Unique Mechanics

**Fear Rating** (Track Terror Level)
Players accumulate fear points from:
- Encountering childhood monsters
- Exploring dark spaces
- Failing to protect Childhood Self
- Witnessing trauma reenactments

At high fear: Paralyzed by terror (like child)
At medium fear: Empowered by adrenaline (like survivor)
At low fear: Vulnerable (monsters target the brave)
Balance is key

**Childhood Regression**
High fear causes temporary mental regression:
- Think like child
- Tactics become simple
- Magic works differently
- But gain access to childhood logic and rules

**Monster Vulnerability**
Each childhood fear has specific weakness:
- Dark monsters: Light (but not all light)
- Closet things: Exposure (open the door)
- Under-bed crawlers: Standing tall (literally)
- Must remember what worked as child

**Comfort Items**
Objects from childhood provide power:
- Teddy bears: Protection
- Night lights: Safe zones
- Blankets: Armor
- Parent's voice: Banishment
Must be genuine from memory

**Growing Up Mechanic**
Can temporarily become adult to:
- Use adult logic against child-fear monsters
- Resist terror through rationalization
- But lose ability to use childhood rules
- Some things only work if you believe like a kid

**The Innocence Save**
Channeling childhood innocence for power:
- Believing in magic
- Trusting imaginary friends
- Following fairy tale logic
- Costs adult cynicism/knowledge

**Personalized Fears**
Each party member has unique childhood terror:
- Arachnophobia: Giant spiders
- Darkness fear: Living shadow
- Stranger danger: Wrong adults
- Abandonment: Empty house
These are their boss fights

### Plot Twists

**Twist 1: The Monsters Were Always Real**
Childhood fears weren't irrational—these entities always existed. Children are more psychically sensitive. Growing up means losing ability to see them, not them ceasing to exist.

**Twist 2: Adult Fears Feed Them Better**
The Boogeyman discovers adult anxieties (failure, mortality, meaninglessness) are richer than childhood terrors (dark, monsters, strangers). He's evolving to feed on complex fear.

**Twist 3: One Party Member Is a Monster**
Someone's "childhood self" is actually a fear entity in disguise, feeding information to the Boogeyman. Not malicious—just following nature. Must be saved or destroyed.

**Twist 4: The Teddy Bears Are Powered by Fear Too**
Comfort objects only exist because fears do. Destroying all fear means losing all comfort. The Resistance knows this and is protecting balance, not children.

**Twist 5: Your Parents Put You Here**
The party's childhood homes are here because their parents were afraid too—and passed trauma to children. The Shadow Parents are their real parents' fears made manifest. Breaking the cycle is the real quest.

**Twist 6: Becoming a Protector**
The party can choose to stay as new Teddy Bear Resistance, protecting future children from fear monsters. Trade adult life for eternal childhood guardianship.

### Victory Conditions

**Destroy the Boogeyman**: Kill the supreme fear, risk destroying fear entirely
**Tame the Monsters**: Integrate fears, they become protective rather than harmful
**Seal the Realm**: Close connection between childhood terror and adult world
**Become the Night Light**: Replace the Boogeyman with benevolent protector

### Defeat Conditions

**Consumed by Fear**: Regress to terrified children permanently, trapped in terror
**The Invasion**: Boogeyman succeeds, waking world overrun by childhood nightmares
**Lost Innocence**: Become so jaded fighting monsters they lose all wonder, hollow victory
**The New Boogeyman**: Party members become fear entities themselves, feeding on others' terror
