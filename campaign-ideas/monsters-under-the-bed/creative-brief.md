# Monsters Under the Bed - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Aesthetic:** Child's perspective horror—everything from low angle, spaces too big, darkness too deep. Tim Burton meets Guillermo del Toro meets Where the Wild Things Are.

**Color Palette:**
- **Safety**: Warm yellows, soft blues, night light amber
- **Fear**: Deep purples, monster blacks, shadow greys
- **Monsters**: Depends on type—closet things are dusty browns, under-bed crawlers are darkness-black
- **Innocence**: Pastel childhood colors
- **Corruption**: These pastels twisted dark

## Art Direction
- **Perspective**: Low camera angles showing world as child sees it
- **Scale**: Beds enormous, closets endless, hallways forever
- **Monsters**: Shapes that suggest horror without clear form (fear of unknown)
- **Comfort Items**: Glowing, warm, safe haven aesthetic
- **Childhood Homes**: Familiar but wrong—uncanny valley domestic

## Music and Sound
**Main Theme:** Lullaby twisted into minor key, music box horror
**Fear Theme:** Breathing under the bed, scratching in walls
**Safety Theme:** Warm acoustic, gentle parental humming
**Boogeyman Theme:** Absence of sound except whispers
**Boss Themes**: Personalized to each player's fear

**Sound Design**:
- Creaking floorboards
- Closet doors opening slowly
- Breathing that isn't yours
- Children's laughter (eerie context)
- Teddy bears' synthetic voice (comfort turned unsettling)

## Voice Direction
**Boogeyman Supreme**: Whisper-voice, layered, from everywhere/nowhere
**Teddy**: Warm but scratchy (old toy voice box)
**Childhood Self**: Appropriate age voice, terrified innocence
**The Closet King**: Sophisticated, predatory, aristocratic menace
**Shadow Parents**: Familiar voices twisted wrong

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Monster Attack**: Childhood fear made flesh
- **Under the Bed**: Descent into claustrophobic darkness
- **Meeting Childhood Self**: Mirror scene with younger you
- **Boogeyman Reveal**: Darkness coalescing into form
- **Final Confrontation**: Facing personalized ultimate fear
