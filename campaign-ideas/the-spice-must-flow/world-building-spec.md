### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Spice Must Flow**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** On the desert world of Ar'akis, the party arrives as part of a noble house's retinue to oversee the harvesting of shimmer-spice, the most valuable substance in the multiverse that grants prescience and enables planar travel. They must survive brutal politics, colossal sandworms, assassination plots, and an ancient prophecy that speaks of one who will unite the desert tribes and reshape the cosmic order.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Ar'akis. How did it become a desert world? What ancient civilization lived here before the current era?
    *   Write the story of the shimmer-spice. How was it discovered? Why is it essential for planar travel and what are its mystical properties?
    *   Describe the ecological cycle of the sandworms. How do they create spice? Why would changing Ar'akis's environment kill them?
    *   Explain the political structure of the Imperium. How do the Great Houses, the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, and the Sisterhood of the Seeing Eye interact?
    *   Detail the prophecy of the "One Who Walks Between Worlds" and the Dust Walker legends surrounding it.
    *   Write the history of House Kavrin and their generations-long feud with House Moritani.
    *   Describe the breeding program of the Sisterhood of the Seeing Eye and their genetic manipulation spanning centuries.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **House Kavrin** (Major, later Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To secure spice production rights and restore their house's fortunes after decades of Imperial disfavor.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Feudal. Lord at the top, supported by advisors, military officers, and the party as special operatives.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To efficiently manage spice harvesting and maintain order on Ar'akis.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Lord Kavrin suspects the Emperor's betrayal and has hidden weapon caches and contingency plans.
        *   **Assets:** Military forces, advanced technology, political connections (initially), the party's expertise.
        *   **Relationships:** Destroyed by House Moritani in Act II; survivors become key players in the Dust Walker alliance.
    *   **House Moritani** (Major - Primary Antagonist)
        *   **Goals:** To seize Ar'akis for themselves and eliminate House Kavrin permanently.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Militaristic meritocracy with Lady Jessamine as supreme commander.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To bring "civilization and order" to Ar'akis and suppress the "dangerous religious extremism" of the Dust Walkers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To terraform Ar'akis into a garden world, killing the sandworms and creating synthetic spice they can monopolize.
        *   **Assets:** Imperial Sardaukar support, superior military forces, advanced atmospheric processors, spice-enhanced strategic precognition.
        *   **Relationships:** Primary antagonist; secretly manipulated by the Emperor and opposed by all Dust Walker tribes.
    *   **The Dust Walkers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To preserve their way of life, protect the sandworms (which they view as sacred), and fulfill the ancient prophecy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Tribal confederation. Each sietch has autonomous leadership but respects the wisdom of the eldest seers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be left alone by off-worlders.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Various factions within have different interpretations of the prophecy—some seek violent jihad, others seek coexistence, others want to destroy all off-worlders.
        *   **Assets:** Perfect desert survival knowledge, ability to ride sandworms, extensive underground sietch network, limited but growing access to modern weapons.
        *   **Relationships:** Initially hostile to all outsiders; become the party's key allies after Act II.
    *   **The Sisterhood of the Seeing Eye** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To guide human evolution through careful genetic manipulation and to control those with prescient abilities.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Religious order with a secret inner circle of Reverend Mothers led by the Mother Superior.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To serve as truthsayers, advisors to noble houses, and preservers of ancient knowledge.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To create the ultimate prescient being they can control, integrating bloodlines across millennia. The prophetic party member is an unplanned variable in their breeding program.
        *   **Assets:** Networks of agents in every great house, the ability to use The Voice (compulsion technique), ancient texts and forbidden knowledge, and spice agony rituals.
        *   **Relationships:** Appear as potential allies but are manipulating everyone; will support whoever serves their long-term genetic goals.
    *   **The Spacing Guild** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain their monopoly on interstellar travel and ensure the spice flow never ceases.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Corporate structure with Guild Navigators (spice-mutated prescient pilots) at the top.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Political neutrality; they transport anyone who pays.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prevent any outcome that threatens spice production; willing to support coup against the Emperor if necessary.
        *   **Assets:** Complete control of all interstellar transport, immense wealth, precognitive navigators who can see safe paths through folded space.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral arbiters who will intervene if spice production is genuinely threatened; potential allies in the endgame.
    *   **The Imperial Throne** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain the Emperor's absolute authority and eliminate any threat to imperial stability.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Absolute monarchy supported by the Sardaukar (fanatical super-soldiers) and the bureaucracy of a thousand worlds.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To ensure peace and prosperity across the Imperium.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Emperor Shaddam IX fears the Dust Walker prophecy could create a power to rival his own; he secretly backs House Moritani's takeover and is willing to destroy Ar'akis if necessary.
        *   **Assets:** The Sardaukar legions, vast fleets, the authority of millennia, the ability to grant or revoke fiefs.
        *   **Relationships:** Puppetmaster behind House Moritani; ultimate obstacle to the party's success until they force a political checkmate.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party successfully saves workers during the sandworm attack in Session 1.
    *   **THEN:** Those workers become loyal informants, providing warnings about sabotage attempts in Session 2.
    *   **IF:** The party uncovers who sabotaged the sandworm detection in Session 1.
    *   **THEN:** They can prevent Lord Kavrin's assassination in Session 2, gaining his deep trust and better resources for the desert expedition in Session 3.
    *   **IF:** The party fails to protect Lord Kavrin in Session 2.
    *   **THEN:** His heir, a more ruthless and paranoid leader, takes command and distrusts the party, making Session 3-4 more difficult.
    *   **IF:** The party shows respect and understanding for Dust Walker customs in Session 3.
    *   **THEN:** Their sietch trial in Session 5 is less deadly, and key NPCs like Kylar become genuine friends rather than just allies of convenience.
    *   **IF:** The party attempts to fight rather than flee House Moritani's assault in Session 4.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a heroic last stand sequence, but significantly reduce surviving Kavrin forces, making later sessions harder due to fewer allies.
    *   **IF:** The prophetic party member refuses the Water of Life in Session 8.
    *   **THEN:** Another NPC (Kylar or Reverend Mother Kalitha) takes it instead, shifting the power dynamic and creating new tensions about who controls the prophetic visions.
    *   **IF:** The party executes the Sisterhood spy in Session 10 rather than turning them.
    *   **THEN:** The Sisterhood becomes overtly hostile, deploying agents to sabotage the party during the final battles. If they turn the spy, gain valuable intelligence about Imperial movements.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to destroy the spice cycle (kill all sandworms) in the final sessions.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an "economic collapse" ending where the Imperium fragments without FTL travel, but Ar'akis becomes a garden world and the Dust Walkers must adapt to a radically different existence.
    *   **IF:** The party accepts the Emperor's marriage bargain in Session 14.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an ending where they rule but are trapped in Imperial politics, their descendants becoming the new threat to freedom they once opposed.
    *   **IF:** The party finds the "narrow path" the prescient character sees in Session 12 (avoiding both defeat and bloody jihad).
    *   **THEN:** Generate the most difficult final sessions, requiring perfect execution of political, combat, and social challenges, but resulting in the best possible ending where Ar'akis gains autonomy without galactic war.
