# Creative Brief: The Spice Must Flow

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cinematic Desert Epic (Denis Villeneuve's Dune-inspired)

Inspired by the sweeping, monumental aesthetic of Denis Villeneuve's Dune films, this style emphasizes the scale and brutality of the desert environment, the ornate beauty of high culture contrasted with survival gear, and the mystical elements of prophecy and spice. The visual language should feel simultaneously ancient and futuristic, with practical, worn technology and ceremonial grandeur.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** The desert should feel infinite and oppressive. Characters should often be dwarfed by massive dunes, enormous sandworms, or imposing architecture.
*   **Warm Desert Palette:** Dominant colors are amber, ochre, burnt orange, bone white, and deep desert browns. Accent with the electric blue of spice-touched eyes and the occasional metallic gleam of advanced technology.
*   **Texture and Wear:** Everything should feel weathered by sand and time. Fabric is rough, metal is tarnished, skin is sun-darkened or pale from underground living.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, arid, mystical, monumental, prophetic, brutal, ornate, resource-scarce, ancient-futuristic, contemplative.
*   **Feeling:** A world where survival is paramount but destiny looms. Every image should evoke the weight of history and the vastness of space and time. Beauty exists but is harsh and earned.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, realistic forms with sharp edges for technology and architecture. Flowing, organic shapes for the desert, sandworms, and tribal clothing.
*   **Textures:** Rough-woven fabric (stillsuits, desert robes), brushed metal, sand-blasted stone, and the strange crystalline quality of spice blooms.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hyper-realistic digital painting in the style of Denis Villeneuve's Dune. A lone figure in a stillsuit stands on a massive sand dune, the desert stretching endlessly behind them."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm earth tones dominate. Amber skies at dawn and dusk, ochre sand dunes, bone-white limestone rock formations, deep burnt umber shadows.
*   **Accent Colors:** Electric blue (spice-touched eyes, shield technology), metallic bronze and copper (technology, ornithopters), deep crimson (House Moritani colors), midnight blue (Sisterhood robes), and the rare brilliant orange-gold shimmer of spice itself.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...bathed in the amber light of a setting binary sun, casting long shadows across ochre dunes. The only bright color is the electric blue glow of the character's eyes, enhanced by spice."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical, functional desert wear dominates: full-body stillsuits with moisture reclamation tubes, desert cloaks (dishdashas), face masks (nose plugs and sand goggles). For nobility, flowing robes with intricate embroidery, ceremonial armor with house sigils.
*   **Silhouettes:** Desert dwellers are lean and efficient. Nobility carry themselves with rigid formality. Dust Walkers move with fluid, practiced grace.
*   **Expression:** Eyes are crucial—spice-blue eyes mark the transformed. Expressions are weathered, stoic, but intensity burns beneath the surface.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Dust Walker warrior in a worn stillsuit, face partially wrapped in desert cloth, only their intense spice-blue eyes visible. Weathered by sand and sun, they carry a crysknife at their hip."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Endless desert dominates—massive dunes, rock outcroppings, spice blooms creating orange patches on the sand. Strongholds are brutalist architecture carved from desert rock. Sietches are underground networks lit by captured sunlight.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heat shimmer distorts distant horizons. Sand particles hang in the air. Binary suns create harsh, directional light with deep, cool shadows.
*   **Details:** Thumpers creating rhythmic vibrations, ornithopters with insect-like wings, massive spice harvesters with shield technology creating faint distortion halos.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive spice harvester, industrial and brutal, dwarfed by an approaching sandworm—a mountain of segmented flesh rising from the dunes. Ornithopters flee like insects against the vast amber sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, directional lighting from binary suns creates stark contrasts. Midday light is bleached and overexposed. Dawn and dusk create dramatic golden hours. Underground sietches use soft, diffused light from bio-luminescent sources.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and cool, offering respite from the heat. Shadows are survival.
*   **Purpose:** Light defines the harshness of the environment and the precious nature of shade and water.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh midday binary suns, creating bleached highlights on the sand and deep, cool shadows in the rock crevices where the characters shelter."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide, cinematic shots emphasizing the epic scale. Low angles make characters seem heroic against the vast sky. Aerial views show the geometric patterns of dunes and the terrifying scale of sandworms.
*   **Techniques:** Use of negative space (empty desert) to create isolation. Leading lines (dune ridges, spice harvester tracks) draw the eye. Symmetry in architecture contrasts with organic chaos of the desert.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ultra-wide cinematic shot from a low angle, showing a line of Dust Walker riders on the ridge of a massive dune, silhouetted against the amber sky. The desert stretches infinitely below them."

## Voice

A resonant, weathered voice with Middle Eastern and North African vocal textures, like windswept desert stones worn smooth by millennia. The accent carries hints of Arabic and Berber influences, with a measured, contemplative pacing that evokes vast distances and deep time. The emotion is mystical reverence mixed with harsh pragmatism—water is life, the desert is death, and prophecy is both blessing and curse. Audio quality is pristine, with subtle layered harmonics that suggest spice-enhanced perception. Occasionally, the voice seems to whisper multiple timelines simultaneously. Role: The voice of a Dust Walker elder recounting the legends that will become history.

## Music Style

Instrumentation blending Hans Zimmer's Dune score approach: deep, processed female vocals creating otherworldly harmonics, pulsing electronic bass drones representing sandworms, and Middle Eastern traditional instruments (oud, ney, duduk, frame drums) creating cultural texture. The music should feel ancient and futuristic simultaneously, with rhythmic patterns that evoke both heartbeats and the rhythmic walking that attracts sandworms. Combat music erupts with brutal, industrial percussion. Mystical scenes feature ethereal, reverb-drenched vocals that seem to exist outside of time.
