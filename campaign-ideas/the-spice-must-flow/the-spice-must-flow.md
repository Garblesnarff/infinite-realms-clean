# The Spice Must Flow

*A Political Intrigue / Survival campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Spice Must Flow
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Political Intrigue / Survival / Desert Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** arid, prophetic, cutthroat, mystical, resource-scarce, grand political machinations
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
On the desert world of Ar'akis, the party arrives as part of a noble house's retinue to oversee the harvesting of shimmer-spice, the most valuable substance in the multiverse. This precious powder grants limited prescience, extends life, and is essential for planar travel—but it exists only in the deep deserts where colossal sandworms hunt. The party must navigate brutal house politics, forge alliances with the native Dust Walkers, and survive assassination plots while an ancient prophecy speaks of one who will unite the desert tribes and reshape the cosmic order.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Resource Management:** Water is the ultimate currency. Every decision about supplies, combat expenditure, and travel must be carefully weighed. Characters face exhaustion, dehydration, and environmental hazards constantly.
*   **Political Complexity:** The web of alliances between noble houses, merchant guilds, the Imperial throne, and religious orders creates a complex landscape where every action has far-reaching consequences.
*   **Deadly Combat:** Enemies are highly trained, use shield technology that blocks fast-moving projectiles, and employ poison and assassination. Sandworms are near-mythical threats that can swallow entire harvesting operations.
*   **Prophecy and Prescience:** Some NPCs and potentially players can glimpse possible futures, making deception and surprise incredibly difficult to achieve.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from outsiders to key players in a cosmic power struggle.

*   **Act I — Arrival in the Wasteland (Sessions 1–3):** The party arrives on Ar'akis as representatives of House Kavrin, tasked with securing spice production. They must learn to survive the desert, establish relationships with local factions, and uncover the sabotage threatening their operations.
*   **Act II — The Desert Awakens (Sessions 4–7):** After a devastating betrayal by rival House Moritani, the party must flee into the deep desert. They encounter the Dust Walkers, the native people who ride sandworms and know the desert's secrets. One party member begins experiencing prophetic visions.
*   **Act III — Gathering Storm (Sessions 8–11):** The party learns they are pawns in a greater game involving the Emperor, the Sisterhood of the Seeing Eye, and ancient powers buried in the desert. They must unite the fractured Dust Walker tribes while preparing for an inevitable confrontation with House Moritani and their Imperial backers.
*   **Act IV — The Prophecy Fulfilled (Sessions 12–15):** Open warfare erupts across Ar'akis. The party must lead combined forces against overwhelming odds, potentially unleashing the power of mass sandworm assaults, while confronting the truth of the prophecy and deciding the fate of the spice, the desert, and the cosmic order itself.

## Key Locations

1.  **Ar'akis Stronghold:** A massive fortress-city built of desert stone, designed to preserve every drop of water. Once House Kavrin's seat of power, now occupied by House Moritani.
2.  **The Deep Desert:** An endless expanse of dunes where sandworms hunt, spice accumulates, and the Dust Walkers survive using ancient techniques.
3.  **Sietch Ishtar:** The largest underground Dust Walker settlement, a maze of carved rock chambers with moisture-sealed doors and ancient water reservoirs.
4.  **The Spice Fields:** Vast desert expanses where spice blooms to the surface, guarded by detection equipment and harvester crews in constant danger.
5.  **The Imperial Flagship:** A massive cathedral-ship in orbit, representing the overwhelming might of the Emperor.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is survival versus prophecy. The party must survive brutal desert conditions, political assassination, and open warfare while grappling with a prophecy that promises victory at the cost of millions of lives. They face the question: Is it better to die free or live as gods who have unleashed horror? The spice grants vision of the future, but is seeing destiny the same as being able to change it?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Water Debt**

*   Every character tracks water as a critical resource. One unit of water per day per person is required. Running low imposes exhaustion levels. Water can be recovered from defeated enemies (their body's water), found in rare desert caches, or earned from allies.

### 2. **The Spice Trance**

*   Characters who consume spice can make Wisdom saving throws to experience brief flashes of prescience, granting advantage on initiative or saving throws once before the effect ends. Overuse risks addiction and madness.

### 3. **Prescient Dueling**

*   When the prophetic party member faces another precognitive opponent, both players/DM secretly write down their next three actions. Actions that match are canceled out. This creates a unique rock-paper-scissors style meta-duel.

### 4. **Sandworm Encounters**

*   Sandworms are not fought traditionally. When one is attracted by rhythmic movement, the party must make a series of skill checks to either escape, hide on rock formations, or (later) attempt to hook and ride it. Failure means being swallowed—not death, but a desperate combat inside the worm.

### 5. **Political Influence**

*   The party tracks influence with major factions (Houses, Guilds, Sisterhood, Emperor). High influence unlocks resources and allies. Low influence brings assassination attempts and embargoes.

### 6. **The Voice**

*   Certain NPCs (Sisterhood members) can use The Voice—a command technique that forces Wisdom saves or compulsion. Players can learn this technique if they earn the Sisterhood's trust.
