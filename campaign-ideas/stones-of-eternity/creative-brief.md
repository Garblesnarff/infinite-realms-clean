# Creative Brief: Stones of Eternity

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
Zen minimalism meets cosmic vastness. The Goban floats in infinite void like a mandala of possibility. Clean lines, perfect intersections, and the stark contrast of black and white dominate. Influence is visualized as flowing energy patterns, like ink in water or qi flows. The aesthetic draws from Japanese sumi-e painting, stone gardens, and meditation spaces.

### Visual Principles
- **Minimalist Purity**: Remove all unnecessary elements—only grid, stones, and void
- **Flowing Influence**: Abstract energy patterns showing territorial claims
- **Sacred Geometry**: The 19x19 grid as mandala, each intersection a point of potential
- **Contrast**: Absolute black versus pure white, with gray existing only in transgression
- **Emptiness as Subject**: Negative space is as important as positive space
- **Go Aesthetics**: Inspired by traditional Go boards (kaya wood), slate and shell stones

### Character Design

**Black Stones**: Perfect spheres of polished obsidian, slightly larger than human head. When anthropomorphized, they appear as figures carved from single pieces of black stone—smooth, reflective, with minimal features. Eyes glow faintly from within. They radiate dark energy like heat waves.

**White Stones**: Perfect spheres of luminous shell or alabaster, glowing softly. Anthropomorphic forms are carved from white stone, slightly translucent, with light bleeding through. They cast no shadows. Cool to the touch, radiating calm energy.

**Free Stones** (The Party): Show cracks in their perfect surfaces—black stones with white veins, white stones with black swirls. These imperfections mark their free will. More humanoid than standard stones, walking on grid lines rather than sitting static.

**Seki Stones**: Gray stones, color drained from existing in eternal mutual life. Covered in frost or dust from stillness. Locked in position, moving only their eyes.

**Dead Eye Stones**: Corrupted stones with zero liberties that still exist. Pulsing with wrong-colored energy (black stones with white auras, white stones with black cores). Surface cracking, leaking void-energy.

**Influence Manifestations**: Not physical entities but visible energy—black influence appears as ink spreading through water, white influence appears as light rays through mist.

### Environmental Design

**The Goban**: A massive grid of glowing golden lines suspended in void. Each intersection is a point of light where stones can be placed. The board is semi-transparent, showing depth beneath—layers of previous games, ghost stones from captured groups.

**The Void**: Not black space but absolute nothing—eyes cannot focus on it. Looking into the void too long causes vertigo. Occasionally, distant lights suggest other Gobans in infinite multiverse.

**Intersection Glow**: Empty intersections glow pale gold. Occupied intersections pulse with the stone's color. Contested intersections flicker between black and white influence.

**Territory Shading**: Claimed territory is shaded (Black areas darker, White areas brighter) but still shows the grid. Unclaimed territory is neutral gold.

**Eyes (Empty Spaces)**: Within living groups, the two eyes appear as perfectly circular voids—windows into deeper reality. Gazing into a group's eyes shows their soul/consciousness.

### Color Palettes

**Primary Colors**
- Black: #000000 (absolute)
- White: #FFFFFF (pure)
- Board Lines: #D4AF37 (golden)
- Void: Cannot be rendered (represented by empty canvas)

**Influence Gradients**
- Black Influence: #000000 fading to #404040 (charcoal)
- White Influence: #FFFFFF fading to #E8E8E8 (pearl)
- Neutral Zone: #808080 (perfect gray)

**Corruption Colors** (Violations of Natural Order)
- Dead Eye Corruption: Sickly green #228B22
- Liberty Drain: Fading to transparency
- Ko Madness: Flickering purple #9370DB
- Off-Board Stones: Impossible red #FF0000

**Emotional States**
- Atari (Danger): Red glow around stones with one liberty
- Safety (Two Eyes): Blue shimmer around unconditionally alive groups
- Seki (Mutual Life): Gray freeze effect
- Capture: Stones fragment and dissolve into light/shadow

## Music and Sound Design

### Main Theme: "The Placing"
Minimalist composition featuring:
- **Instruments**: Single wooden Go stones being placed on kaya board (main percussion), shakuhachi flute (breath/liberties), koto strings (grid lines), meditation bowl (resonance)
- **Structure**: Built on silence—notes separated by pauses, emphasizing emptiness
- **Rhythm**: Irregular, matching contemplative stone placement rather than steady beat
- **Philosophy**: Music is the space between notes, not the notes themselves

### Factional Themes

**Black Territory**: Deep, resonant tones—taiko drums, low strings, male vocal drones. Aggressive but controlled. Expansion and acquisition.

**White Territory**: High, clear tones—bells, crystal bowls, female vocal harmonics. Defensive but strong. Efficiency and precision.

**Neutral Zones**: Balanced frequencies—neither high nor low, no dominant instrument. Perfect sonic gray.

**The Void**: Absolute silence that feels heavy—anti-sound that creates pressure on the ears.

### Location Soundscapes

**The Goban**: Constant subtle hum of the grid—electromagnetic field sound. Occasionally, the "click" of stones being placed in distant territories echoes across the board.

**Star Points**: Each emits a unique frequency. When all nine resonate together, they create a harmonic chord.

**The Tengen**: Silence at the center, but paradoxically the loudest silence—absence so profound it becomes presence.

**Influence Fields**: Sound of flowing water (black) or flowing air (white)—subtle directional audio showing territorial claims.

**The Void Beyond**: Occasionally, sounds from other games/dimensions leak through—stone placements in parallel realities.

### Combat Music

**Capturing Sequences**: Percussion building—each atari is a drum hit, final capture is cymbal crash followed by silence.

**Ko Fights**: Repetitive musical phrase that loops with variations—representing the eternal back-and-forth.

**Life-and-Death Problems**: Tense, minimal music—single note held, slowly building tension until the problem is solved (resolution) or failed (dissonance).

**Influence Wars**: Layers of black and white themes competing—when territories overlap, the music creates intentional discord.

### Sound Effects

**Stone Placement**: The signature "pak" sound of slate stone on wooden board—satisfying, resonant
**Walking on Grid**: Soft footsteps on hollow wood
**Atari Warning**: Single sharp bell
**Capture**: Stone shattering followed by echo fading into void
**Creating Eyes**: Hollow resonant tone—emptiness that protects
**Liberty Decrease**: Subtle tightening sound, breath becoming restricted
**Seki Formation**: All sound stops—frozen audio
**Influence Spread**: Water or wind flowing across wood

## Cinematic Moments

### Opening: The First Dying Group
**Visual**: Wide shot of the Goban floating in void, peaceful. Camera descends to a living group of white stones (8+ liberties). Suddenly, without warning, they begin to crack. The stones shatter and fall into void, leaving empty intersections. Black influence spreads across the space.
**Audio**: Peaceful meditation interrupted by sudden cracking—silence—falling stones echoing into infinite distance
**Camera**: Slow approach becomes handheld shake during the death, then stillness

### The Atari Warning
**Visual**: Close-up on a stone as its liberties are occupied one by one. Four empty adjacent points... three... two... one. The stone glows red. The character's eyes widen—they know death is one move away.
**Audio**: Each liberty loss is a heartbeat. Final liberty creates sustained alarm tone.
**Camera**: Tight close-up on stone, pull out to show surrounding enemies closing in

### The Capture
**Visual**: Slow motion as an enemy stone occupies the final liberty. Time stops. The surrounded stone/group glows brilliant white (if black) or shadow-black (if white)—inverse coloration. They shatter like glass, fragments dissolving into light particles that flow into the capturing stones.
**Audio**: Silence. Then crystalline shattering. Then absorption sound—energy being consumed.
**Camera**: 360-degree rotation around the dying stone, freeze frame on the moment of shattering

### Creating Two Eyes
**Visual**: The party arranges stones in perfect formation, creating two separate enclosed empty spaces within their group. The moment the second eye forms, both empty spaces glow with deep blue light. The group is now immortal—unconditionally alive.
**Audio**: Two resonant tones (one per eye) that harmonize into a protective chord
**Camera**: Overhead shot showing the geometric perfection of the shape, then dive into one of the eyes

### The Ko Fight
**Visual**: Rapid cutting between captures—black captures white, white captures black, black captures white, white captures black. The same intersection flickers—stone present, absent, present, absent. Reality itself stutters.
**Audio**: Alternating stone placement sounds creating a rhythm—pak-pak-pak-pak—building in intensity
**Camera**: Split screen showing both players' hands reaching toward the ko point simultaneously

### Influence Storm
**Visual**: Black influence and White influence collide in neutral territory. The ink-like energy (black) and light-ray energy (white) crash together like waves, creating turbulent patterns. Territory claims shift visibly—shading flows across intersections like tide.
**Audio**: Storm sounds—wind, thunder—but made from stone and silence
**Camera**: Low angle looking up as the influence waves crash overhead

### The Perfect Jigo
**Visual**: Final count sequence. Camera pans across the entire Goban as territories are measured. Black territory glows darkly, white territory glows brightly. The count numbers appear (180.5 vs 180.5). Perfect tie. The entire board pulses with balanced harmony.
**Audio**: Counting voice (neutral, mathematical) calling out territories. Final numbers announce. Then—perfect harmonic chord of balance.
**Camera**: Start at one corner, sweep across all 361 intersections, pull out to see the entire balanced board

### The Empty Board Ending
**Visual**: All stones—black, white, party members—rise slowly from the board. They hover for a moment, suspended. Then dissolve into light and shadow, flowing into the void. The Goban remains—pristine golden grid, all 361 intersections empty and glowing. Pure potential.
**Audio**: All sound fades. Absolute silence. Then, after ten seconds, a single stone placement—pak—echoing forever.
**Camera**: Wide shot holding on the empty board for uncomfortable length—the emptiness is the subject
