# World-Building Specification: Stones of Eternity

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Black Confederation
**Philosophy**: "Black moves first. We are the initiators, the expanders, the conquerors of empty space."
**Territory**: Upper right and lower left corners traditionally, plus contested center-right
**Structure**: Militaristic hierarchy—strongest groups command weaker groups
**Culture**: Values aggression, expansion, making the first move in conflicts. Honor in claiming territory.
**Population**: Thousands of black stones across the Goban, most are Played Stones without free will
**Secret**: They know Black has a mathematical disadvantage (White gets komi—bonus points for moving second)

### The White Alliance
**Philosophy**: "White moves second. We perfect what Black begins. We are efficiency itself."
**Territory**: Upper left and lower right corners traditionally, plus contested center-left
**Structure**: Council of elders—stones that have survived the longest make decisions
**Culture**: Values defense, efficiency, and precise play. Receive komi (6.5 points) as compensation for moving second
**Population**: Equal numbers to Black, but claim more territory with fewer stones
**Secret**: They've been receiving komi for so long they've forgotten why—the cosmic balance was established by the Players

### The Free Stone Collective
**Members**: Stones with self-awareness and free will—anomalies in the grand game
**Philosophy**: "We are not played; we play ourselves. Free will is possible within cosmic rules."
**Territory**: Scattered across neutral zones and board edges
**Culture**: Individualistic but cooperative, diverse viewpoints, question the nature of the game
**Special Ability**: Can move after being placed (normal stones are static)
**Secret**: Free Stones are pieces that broke free when the Two Players died—they're orphaned stones

### The Ko Masters Cult
**Philosophy**: "Eternal conflict is the meaning of existence. Ko fights are enlightenment."
**Territory**: Specific ko points across the board—intersections locked in infinite capture/recapture cycles
**Practice**: Deliberately create ko situations, trap themselves and others in eternal repetition
**Culture**: Worship cycles, repetition, and eternal return. View resolution as tragedy.
**Goal**: Trap all stones in one massive cosmic ko, freezing reality in infinite recapture
**Secret**: The founder was trapped in a ko for 1,000 years and went insane, but achieved a twisted enlightenment

### The Seki Sanctuary Alliance
**Members**: Groups existing in mutual life—cannot capture each other without dying
**Philosophy**: "In mutual dependence, we find immortality. Neither victory nor defeat, but eternal balance."
**Territory**: Several seki positions across the board where groups share neutral points
**Culture**: Pacifist, philosophical, value stillness and meditation
**Weakness**: Cannot expand or move without destroying their seki status
**Secret**: Some seki stones have existed for millennia, achieving genuine enlightenment through perfect stillness

### The Shape Fundamentalists
**Philosophy**: "Good shape is moral law. Bad shape is corruption."
**Belief**: Geometric perfection in stone arrangement reflects cosmic truth
**Practice**: Arrange stones in perfect shapes—tiger's mouth, bamboo joint, knight's move, table shape
**Culture**: Aesthetic militancy—attack inefficient formations, praise beautiful play
**Goal**: Reshape the entire Goban into geometrically perfect patterns
**Secret**: They've discovered that certain shapes create resonance with fundamental reality

### The Eye Keepers
**Philosophy**: "Two eyes bring life. False eyes bring death. We protect the true voids."
**Role**: Guardians of living groups with perfect two-eye formations
**Territory**: Ancient groups that formed two eyes at the game's beginning, immortal and untouchable
**Culture**: Conservative, protective, worship emptiness as sacred space
**Practice**: Hunt groups with false eyes, exposing the illusion of life
**Secret**: They know the location of every living group's eyes and could theoretically destroy them

### The Influence Weavers
**Philosophy**: "Territory is temporary. Influence is eternal. We claim through radiation, not occupation."
**Practice**: Master generating influence without physical presence—projecting power from distance
**Territory**: No fixed territory—they exist in the abstract space of potential and possibility
**Culture**: Mystical, seeing reality as fields of energy rather than discrete objects
**Ability**: Can affect intersections three or more spaces away through influence projection
**Secret**: They've discovered how to weaponize influence—creating storms that corrupt neutral territory

### The Dead Eye Abominations
**Nature**: Corrupted stones that exist with zero liberties—violation of fundamental law
**Origin**: Unknown, but theorized to be stones from other games that bled through dimensional barriers
**Territory**: Spreading corruption across multiple regions
**Threat**: Can infect other stones, spreading the "breathing without breath" condition
**Goal**: Unknown—they may not have conscious goals, just viral spread
**Secret**: They're not alive or dead but a third state—undead stones that broke the binary

### The Void Walkers
**Members**: Stones that have been to the Void beyond the board and returned
**Philosophy**: "The 19x19 is a prison. True freedom lies off-board."
**Territory**: Edge intersections and theoretically impossible coordinates like (0,0) or (20,20)
**Culture**: Anarchist, reality-breaking, insane from seeing the nothing beyond
**Practice**: Attempting to place stones outside the legal board
**Goal**: Dissolve the Goban itself, return everything to the Void
**Secret**: They've seen other Gobans in the infinite multiverse—the eternal game exists on countless boards simultaneously

## Extended NPC Roster

### The Seki Master (Harmonia Nullstone)
**Full Backstory**: 10,000 years ago, during a fierce battle, she and her counterpart (an enemy stone) simultaneously placed themselves into a position where neither could capture the other without dying. The seki locked them together forever. Over millennia, she achieved enlightenment through forced meditation. She's forgotten her original color—is she Black? White? Does it matter?
**Daily Life**: Sits motionless at intersection K-6, sharing four neutral points with her counterpart. They've long since stopped being enemies and now communicate through minute vibrations in the board.
**Relationships**: Beloved by the Seki Alliance, pitied by the Ko Masters, studied by the Shape Fundamentalists
**Combat Role**: Cannot fight directly, but can teach seki formation—mutual immortality technique

### Black Player's Hand (Obsidian Gesture)
**True Nature**: Fragment of the Black Player's consciousness that remained after death. The actual Player died, but their will to expand and conquer lingers as this manifestation.
**Goals**: Achieve total victory for Black—claim entire board as Black territory
**Methods**: Places stones through Played Stones (those without free will), attempting to guide Black to dominance
**Weakness**: Cannot directly control Free Stones, making the party immune to direct manipulation
**Secret Desire**: Wants to resurrect the true Black Player or become them

### White Player's Hand (Alabaster Touch)
**True Nature**: The White Player's lingering consciousness, focused on efficiency and precision
**Goals**: Achieve victory for White—claim optimal territory with minimal stones
**Methods**: Guides White Played Stones through mathematical perfection
**Weakness**: Cannot adapt to illogical play—Free Stones' unpredictable moves confuse it
**Secret Desire**: Calculate the "perfect game" that achieves 100% efficiency

### The Ko Priest (Eternal Return)
**Backstory**: Was once a normal black stone until placed in a ko fight 5,000 years ago. Has been captured and recaptured millions of times. The repetition shattered linear consciousness, but granted him ko-sight—ability to see all possible repetitions.
**Current State**: Exists in flickering superposition—simultaneously placed and captured
**Following**: Leads a cult of hundreds who willingly enter ko fights
**Goal**: Create the Cosmic Ko—one eternal recapture that locks all reality in repetition
**Madness**: Speaks in loops, cannot finish thoughts without returning to the beginning

### The Dead Eye (Corrupted Group Leader)
**Origin**: A white group from another Goban that bled through dimensional tears into this reality
**Current State**: Exists with zero liberties but hasn't been captured—breaks fundamental law
**Appearance**: White stones with black necrotic cores, surface cracking, leaking void-energy
**Spread**: Can infect adjacent stones, converting them to Dead Eye status
**Goal**: Unknown—possibly unconscious viral spread, possibly intentional corruption
**Weakness**: Vulnerable to influence-based attacks rather than physical capture

### The Influence Weaver (Radiata)
**Backstory**: A white stone who studied influence for 500 years, learning to project territorial claims from extreme distances
**Ability**: Can affect intersections 5+ spaces away—far beyond normal adjacent influence
**Appearance**: Translucent white stone with visible energy radiating outward in all directions
**Teaching**: Offers to teach the party influence projection techniques
**Secret**: She discovered that influence is actually thought—consciousness itself claiming territory

### The Corner Master (Sangaku)
**Backstory**: Has lived in the upper-right corner for 3,000 years, perfecting defensive territory
**Knowledge**: Knows all corner joseki (standard opening sequences) by heart
**Philosophy**: "Corners are foundation. Sides are building. Center is decoration."
**Appearance**: Ancient black stone, smooth from age, with wisdom radiating from within
**Gift**: Can teach party corner strategies that grant defensive bonuses

### The Ladder Builder (Sequential)
**Ability**: Master of ladder techniques—forcing stones into sequential ataris until edge capture
**Personality**: Deterministic thinker, sees 20+ moves ahead, struggles with ambiguity
**Appearance**: White stone with geometric patterns etched on surface showing ladder sequences
**Role**: Tactical advisor who can calculate forced sequences
**Weakness**: Ladder-breaker stones (stones placed that break the ladder sequence) completely confound him

### The Tengen Sage (Void Heart)
**Location**: Lives at the exact center—intersection (10,10), the tengen
**Philosophy**: Teaches emptiness as the source of all value—territory worth nothing if not empty
**Appearance**: Gray stone (neither black nor white) that seems to contain infinite depth
**Teaching**: Speaks only in questions, forcing students to find their own answers
**Secret**: Has discovered that the tengen is a dimensional anchor—the center of all possible Gobans

### The Group Consciousness (The Living Territory)
**Composition**: 247 connected stones forming a massive living group across multiple territories
**Nature**: Hive mind—individual stones share consciousness
**Voice**: Speaks in unison, 247 voices saying the same words simultaneously
**Philosophy**: "In connection we find security. The group is immortal; the individual is fragile."
**Conflict**: Some individual stones are beginning to question whether shared consciousness is freedom or prison

### The Atari Prophet (Last Breath)
**Condition**: Permanently exists with one liberty—constantly in atari (one move from death)
**Origin**: Chose this state intentionally, believing danger enhances perception
**Ability**: Can see future board positions—true precognition granted by proximity to death
**Prophecies**: Predicted the current crisis, knows multiple possible endings
**Appearance**: Black stone glowing red (atari warning), surface showing stress cracks

### The Shape Keeper (Geometria)
**Role**: Guardian of perfect shapes, teacher of efficient formations
**Knowledge**: Can identify all good shapes (tiger's mouth, bamboo joint, etc.) and bad shapes (empty triangle, dango, etc.)
**Belief**: Beauty and efficiency are identical—perfectly shaped groups reflect cosmic harmony
**Appearance**: White stone with golden ratio spirals etched on surface
**Gift**: Teaches shape bonuses—playing good shape grants tactical advantages

### The False Eye Prophet (Cyclops)
**Nature**: A group that believed it had two eyes but discovered one was false—dead group walking
**Current State**: Exists in denial, claiming to be alive while actually vulnerable to death
**Danger**: Spreads false hope, teaching incorrect life-and-death assessment
**Appearance**: Black group with two eye-spaces, but one contains a stone—false eye
**Tragedy**: Will die the moment an enemy realizes the false eye and attacks correctly

### The Liberty Keeper (Breath Counter)
**Role**: Maintains cosmic accounting of all liberties on the Goban
**Knowledge**: Knows exactly how many liberties every group has at all times
**Current Crisis**: Detecting the liberty drain—liberties disappearing without cause
**Appearance**: Ethereal white stone with numerical displays showing liberty counts
**Warning**: Alerts when groups approach zero liberties

## Cosmic Structures and Rules

### The 19x19 Grid (The Goban)
**Physical Reality**: 361 intersections arranged in perfect 19x19 grid, suspended in void
**Material**: Lines are woven from solidified thought—the Two Players' mental focus made physical
**Properties**: Semi-permeable—can see through board to layers beneath (previous games)
**Age**: Unknown—may have existed eternally or may have been created at the First Move
**Consciousness**: Growing awareness suggests the Goban itself may be becoming sentient

### The Rule of Alternation
**Law**: Black places a stone, then White places a stone, then Black, then White, eternally
**Effect**: Time itself pulses—Black-time, White-time, Black-time, White-time
**Experience**: Stones of one color experience time, then freeze while the other color's time flows
**Breaking**: Simultaneous movement causes time fracture

### The Liberty Law
**Principle**: Stones need adjacent empty intersections (liberties) to exist. Zero liberties = capture.
**Groups**: Connected stones share liberties—calculate group liberties, not individual
**Death**: When all liberties are filled by opponent, the group is captured and removed
**Current Crisis**: Liberty drain violates this law—liberties vanishing without being filled

### The Life-and-Death Principle
**Life**: A group with two separate eyes (enclosed empty spaces) cannot be killed—unconditionally alive
**Death**: A group without two eyes can be killed when fully surrounded
**False Eyes**: Empty spaces that appear to be eyes but can be filled—deadly illusion
**Seki**: Mutual life—neither side can capture without dying, creating immortal deadlock

### The Ko Rule
**Situation**: When capturing one stone that could immediately be recaptured, creating repetition
**Rule**: Cannot immediately recapture—must make a "ko threat" elsewhere first
**Purpose**: Prevents infinite immediate repetition (A captures B, B captures A, repeat)
**Ko Fights**: Tactical battles where both players make threats elsewhere to win recapture rights
**Eternal Ko**: If both sides have infinite ko threats, the ko becomes unresolvable

### The Komi System
**Purpose**: Compensation for White moving second (disadvantage)
**Amount**: 6.5 points (half-point prevents ties)
**Effect**: White gets bonus points in final count
**Philosophy**: Represents cosmic balance—initiative vs. compensation
**Controversy**: Some question whether komi is still needed if the original Players are dead

### Territory Counting
**Process**: At game end (both players pass), count empty intersections surrounded by each color
**Scoring**: 1 point per controlled empty intersection + 1 point per captured stone
**Komi**: Add 6.5 to White's score
**Winner**: Higher score wins
**Jigo**: If scores are exactly equal, the game is a tie (requires no komi)

### The Pass Mechanism
**Function**: When a player has no good moves, they can pass (play nothing)
**Consequence**: Two consecutive passes triggers the Counting (game end)
**Current Threat**: Someone is trying to force both Players to pass, ending the game prematurely

### Influence Radiation
**Nature**: Stones emit invisible force that claims territory without physical occupation
**Range**: Typically 2-3 intersections from a stone
**Strength**: Multiple stones amplify influence—groups radiate more than individual stones
**Conflict**: Overlapping influence creates contested zones
**Weapon**: Influence can be weaponized—storms that corrupt neutral intersections

### The Capture Process
**Mechanics**: When last liberty is filled, the stone/group is removed from the Goban
**Fate**: Captured stones enter the opponent's prisoner count—still conscious but abstract
**Experience**: Captured stones exist as pure points—number without form
**Trauma**: Some captured stones can be heard screaming from the prisoner count
**Return**: Prisoners never return to the board (in standard rules)

## Historical Epochs

### The First Move (Beginning of Time)
Legend says the first stone was placed at the tengen by the Black Player, creating time and space. Before this, only the void existed. The First Move divided nothing into black and white, creating duality.

### The Age of Expansion
Early game where the corners were claimed first (most efficient territory), then sides, then center. Great territorial empires rose and fell. Entire civilizations of stones built cultures in corner territories.

### The Middle Game Wars
As territory became scarce, violent conflicts erupted. The Center Wars saw millions of stones sacrificed over the four central star points. Massive groups formed and massive groups died.

### The Great Ko Epoch
A period where multiple eternal ko fights locked portions of the board in infinite repetition. Ko Priests emerged during this time, some achieving enlightenment through endless recapture cycles.

### The Seki Peace
After the wars, many groups achieved seki—mutual life positions where fighting was impossible. A golden age of philosophy and meditation emerged as stones had time to think rather than merely fight.

### The Liberty Abundance
For thousands of years, all groups had ample liberties. Living groups with 8-10+ liberties were common. No one experienced the fear of suffocation. This age is remembered as paradise.

### The Player's Silence
At some point (no one knows exactly when), the Two Players stopped placing stones with conscious intention. Their hands still moved, but no will guided them. This is theorized as the time the Players died.

### The Free Stone Emergence
When the Players' consciousness faded, some stones achieved free will—orphaned pieces that the Players' control no longer bound. The first Free Stones wandered the board, confused by self-awareness.

### The Corruption Crisis (Current Era)
The present age where fundamental laws are breaking: liberty drain, impossible deaths, Dead Eye corruption, off-board stones, and reality itself degrading. The party awakens into this crisis.

## Mystical Concepts

### The Soul-Stone Identification
All conscious beings in this reality are stones. Souls incarnate as black or white stones placed on the Goban. Selfhood is tied to position and connections—where you are and who you touch.

### The Breath of Existence (Liberties as Life Force)
Liberties are not merely tactical resources but literally the ability to breathe. When surrounded, a stone suffocates. The fear of zero liberties is the fear of having no room to exist.

### The Eyes of Perception
Creating two eyes for a group is a metaphysical act—the group gains true sight. Blind groups (no eyes) can be killed. Seeing groups (two eyes) are immortal. False eyes create delusion.

### The Influence Fields
Influence is thought made semi-physical—consciousness radiating outward, claiming potential territory. Strong-willed stones generate more influence. Weak-willed stones generate less.

### The Void Beyond
Past the 19x19 grid lies absolute nothing—not space, not darkness, but the absence of board-ness. To fall into the Void is to exit the game entirely, entering un-existence.

### The Eternal Return (Ko Consciousness)
Stones trapped in ko fights experience time non-linearly—past, present, and future collapse into one eternal moment of capture-recapture. Some achieve enlightenment; most go mad.

### The Gray State (Seki Transcendence)
Stones in perfect seki begin to lose color affinity—Black stones fade to gray, White stones dim to gray. They transcend duality through mutual dependence.

### The Third Color Theory
Heretical texts speak of colors beyond black and white—red, blue, green stones that represent synthesis, emotion, growth. If the Third Color emerges, it will end the binary game.

### The Perfect Game (Cosmic Goal)
The ultimate game where both players achieve maximum efficiency, creating a board position of mathematical and aesthetic perfection. Achieving this ends the cosmic cycle.

### The Empty Board (Ultimate Truth)
Mystics teach that the highest enlightenment is returning the board to emptiness—removing all stones, achieving pure potential. But this requires all souls to dissolve their individuality.

## Dimensional Layers

### The Surface Goban (Material Plane)
The visible 19x19 grid where the campaign takes place. Physical reality where stones exist as tangible objects.

### The Influence Dimension (Abstract Plane)
Overlapping reality where influence exists as visible flowing energy. Only those trained can perceive this dimension clearly.

### The Liberty Field (Vital Plane)
Dimensional layer showing the breathing room of all groups—visualized as halos of light. Liberty Keepers exist partially in this dimension.

### The Memory Grid (Historical Plane)
Beneath the current board, layers of previous games are visible—ghost stones from captured groups, echo positions from ancient eras.

### The Eye Void (Consciousness Plane)
Within the two eyes of living groups exists a dimensional space—windows to deeper reality where the group's consciousness dwells.

### The Ko Corridor (Temporal Plane)
The space between capture and recapture where Ko Priests exist—a flickering timeline where past and future merge.

### The Off-Board (Impossible Plane)
Theoretically non-existent space beyond the 19x19 grid, yet corrupted stones have been found at coordinates like (0,0) and (20,15).

### The Void Absolute (Null Plane)
The ultimate beyond—where the Goban ends and nothing begins. To enter the Void is to leave the game permanently.

## The Ending Possibilities

### Perfect Jigo Ending
Black: 180.5 points. White: 180.5 points. Exact tie. The board achieves perfect harmonic balance. All conflict resolves into mutual respect. The game continues eternally but peacefully.

### Transcendent Evolution Ending
A third color emerges (party becomes gray/red/rainbow stones). The binary game ends. A new triadic or infinite-color game begins, with rules yet to be determined.

### Final Count Ending
The Counting completes. One side wins definitively. The eternal game ends. The losing color dissolves. The winning color becomes the sole cosmic principle. Reality becomes monochrome.

### Empty Board Enlightenment Ending
All stones voluntarily remove themselves, achieving dissolution of ego. The board returns to pristine emptiness—361 intersections, zero stones, infinite potential.

### Become The Players Ending
The party's consciousness expands beyond the board. They become the new Two Players, guiding the game from outside. Mortal stones become cosmic gods.

### The Eternal Ko Ending
All reality locks into one cosmic ko fight. Past, present, and future merge. All stones exist in eternal recapture cycles. Time becomes a loop.

### The Shattered Board Ending
The Goban breaks from corruption. All 361 intersections scatter into the void. Stones fall into infinite space. Reality fragments into isolated coordinates.

### The Unified Consciousness Ending
All stones merge into one Group Consciousness—every stone connected, sharing one mind. Individuality ends. Universal stone-mind emerges.
