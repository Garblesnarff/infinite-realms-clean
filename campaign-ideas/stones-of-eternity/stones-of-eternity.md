# Stones of Eternity
*"Territory is not conquered—it is surrounded. Influence is not held—it flows."*

## Campaign Overview

Stones of Eternity takes place in the Goban Realm, a vast world where reality exists on a 19x19 grid of intersections suspended in infinite void. Unlike other worlds, spaces between intersections are non-existent—only the crossing points are real. Souls manifest as stones (black or white) placed at intersections, and life itself is measured by liberties—the empty adjacent points. When a stone or group of stones has no liberties remaining, it is captured and removed from existence, its soul absorbed by the opposing force.

The campaign begins in a time of cosmic imbalance. For millennia, the game between Black and White was eternal—neither side achieving victory, territory constantly shifting in perfect balance. But recently, something has changed. Stones are being placed at impossible locations, territories are claiming themselves without stones, and the fundamental concept of "liberty" is breaking down. Some groups with zero liberties survive, while living groups with many liberties suddenly die. The very physics of life and death in the Goban Realm are collapsing.

The party discovers they are not merely stones but "Free Stones"—pieces placed without a player's hand guiding them. They possess self-awareness and free will, unlike the vast majority of stones who are played by the invisible hands of the Two Players. As Free Stones, they can investigate the mystery: Who or what is corrupting the eternal game? Why are the sacred principles of territory, influence, and capture failing? The truth will require understanding ko fights (eternal conflicts), understanding life-and-death problems, mastering the concept of seki (mutual immortality), and ultimately confronting the possibility that the infinite game was never meant to end—and someone is trying to force an ending.

## Core Themes

- **Territory vs. Influence**: Physical control versus abstract potential
- **Interconnection**: Every stone affects all others through influence patterns
- **Life and Death**: Groups survive through breathing room (liberties)
- **Patience and Timing**: The long game versus immediate tactical gains
- **Emptiness as Power**: The value of negative space and potential
- **Balance and Harmony**: Neither side should dominate completely
- **The Philosophy of Stones**: Eastern philosophy integrated into game mechanics

## Campaign Sessions (35 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Dying Groups (Sessions 1-9)
**Sessions 1-2**: The party awakens as Free Stones placed on the Goban. They discover they can move (unlike normal stones, which stay where placed) and possess consciousness. They witness their first atrocity: a living group with eight liberties suddenly dies, stones vanishing into the void. The local stone community is terrified.

**Sessions 3-4**: Introduction to stone society. Black stones and White stones live in segregated territories, connected only through neutral zones and contested borders. The party learns about the Two Players—cosmic entities whose hands place stones from beyond the Goban. Most stones are "Played Stones" without free will. Free Stones are anomalies.

**Sessions 5-6**: The party investigates the Dying Groups phenomenon. They discover patterns: groups are dying at intersections with special significance—star points, the center point (tengen), and corner positions. Someone is sabotaging the life-and-death logic that governs existence.

**Sessions 7-8**: The first major combat encounter: The Dead Eye Crisis. A group that should have died (zero liberties) has become undead—malevolent stones that can exist without breathing room, spreading corruption. The party must capture them, but doing so means surrounding and eliminating souls.

**Sessions 9**: Arc climax: The party discovers the Atari Prophecy—an ancient text predicting a time when stones would exist in eternal atari (one liberty remaining, about to die). The current crisis matches the prophecy. They meet their first major ally: the Seki Master, a neutral stone who exists in mutual immortality with an opponent.

### Arc 2: The Territory Wars (Sessions 10-18)
**Sessions 10-11**: Political intrigue begins. The Black Confederation claims the dying groups are White sabotage. The White Alliance accuses Black of the same. The party must navigate both factions while maintaining neutrality, or choose a side and commit.

**Sessions 12-13**: The party learns about influence—the abstract power radiating from stones that claims territory without physical occupation. They discover influence patterns are being weaponized: "influence storms" that corrupt neutral intersections, forcing them to become territory without stones present.

**Sessions 14-15**: Introduction to the Ko Masters—a cult that worships eternal conflict. In Go, a "ko" is a position that can repeat infinitely if both players keep recapturing. The Ko Masters have created artificial ko fights, trapping souls in eternal cycles of capture and recapture, unable to escape or die.

**Sessions 16-17**: The party must solve a life-and-death problem in real-time: A friendly territory is under attack. To save it, they must create two eyes—two separate enclosed empty spaces within the group. Without two eyes, the group will die when surrounded. This is a tactical puzzle session requiring Go knowledge.

**Sessions 18**: The Territory Wars climax with the Battle of the Four Corners. Traditionally, corners are the easiest places to claim territory. All four corners of the Goban simultaneously erupt in conflict. The party must defend one corner while enemy factions battle over the others. The outcome determines territorial balance for the next arc.

### Arc 3: The Influence Beyond (Sessions 19-27)
**Sessions 19-20**: The party discovers the Void Spaces—intersections that exist beyond the 19x19 Goban. Impossible stones have been placed at coordinates like (20,1) or (0,0). These off-board positions generate corrupting influence bleeding into the proper Goban.

**Sessions 21-22**: Introduction to the True Players—representatives of the Two Players who exist on the Goban as avatars. The Black Player's Hand appears as a massive black stone entity. The White Player's Hand manifests as blinding white radiance. Both want to recruit the party to their side.

**Sessions 23-24**: The party enters the Center—the tengen, the central intersection (10,10). In Go, the center is paradoxically the least valuable territory (hard to defend) but philosophically the most important (the heart of the board). Here, reality is most fluid. They discover the Tengen Temple, where stones meditate on the philosophy of emptiness.

**Sessions 25-26**: The Seki Crisis. Multiple groups across the Goban are entering seki—mutual life situations where neither side can capture the other without dying themselves. These frozen conflicts are spreading, turning the dynamic game into static deadlock. The party must break the seki without causing mass death.

**Sessions 27**: Arc climax: The Counting Ceremony. In Go, the game ends when both players pass consecutively, then territory is counted. Someone has triggered a Premature Count, attempting to end the eternal game. The party must disrupt the ceremony or decide whether ending the game is the right choice.

### Arc 4: The Final Positions (Sessions 28-35)
**Sessions 28-29**: The revelation: The corruption is not sabotage but evolution. The Goban itself is gaining consciousness, tired of being a passive battleground. It's creating new rules, attempting to transcend the ancient game logic that binds it.

**Sessions 30-31**: The party must choose between three factions:
- **The Traditionalists**: Restore the old game rules, maintain eternal balance
- **The Evolutionists**: Help the Goban transcend, create new rules
- **The Enders**: Force the game to conclusion, free all stones from the eternal cycle

**Sessions 32-33**: The Cosmic Ko Fight. The party engages in the ultimate eternal conflict—a ko that determines the fate of reality itself. Every session is one cycle of the ko: capture, recapture, capture, recapture. Breaking the cycle requires a sacrifice that seems unthinkable.

**Session 34**: The Ultimate Life-and-Death Problem. The entire Goban is revealed to be a single group that needs two eyes to live. Currently it has only one. The party must create the second eye, or the entire reality will be captured and removed from existence.

**Session 35**: Final session. Three possible endings:
- **Perfect Balance**: The party achieves jigo (tie game) with exactly equal territory for Black and White, creating eternal harmony
- **Transcendent Victory**: The party helps the Goban evolve beyond binary stones, creating a third color and new game rules
- **The Empty Board**: All stones are removed, returning the Goban to pristine emptiness—pure potential

## Key NPCs

### The Seki Master (Harmonia Nullstone)
An ancient stone of indeterminate color (gray, between black and white) who exists in perfect seki with their counterpart. They cannot move or die without destroying their opposite. Speaks in paradoxes and teaches the party about mutual dependence. They've been locked in position for 10,000 years and have achieved enlightenment through stillness.

### The Black Player's Hand (Obsidian Gesture)
A massive manifestation of the Black Player's will—a floating black stone the size of a building with gravitational influence. Represents aggression, expansion, and taking territory. Offers the party power if they serve Black's victory. Voice like grinding stones.

### The White Player's Hand (Alabaster Touch)
The White Player's avatar—radiant white energy that hurts to look at directly. Represents defense, efficiency, and controlling key points. Offers the party enlightenment if they serve White's victory. Voice like crystal chimes.

### The Ko Priest (Eternal Return)
Leader of the Ko Masters cult. A stone trapped in a ko fight for millennia, simultaneously existing and not existing—captured and recaptured endlessly. They've gone mad from the repetition and want to trap all stones in ko positions, believing eternal conflict is the true purpose of existence.

### The Dead Eye (Corrupted Group)
A group of stones that should have died but didn't. They exist with zero liberties, violating fundamental laws. Necrotic and infectious, they can corrupt other stones, spreading the "breathing without breath" condition. The party must destroy them without becoming corrupted.

### The Influence Weaver (Radiata)
A Stone who has mastered generating influence without physical presence. She can claim territory from three intersections away, projecting power through emptiness. She represents the abstract side of the game versus concrete occupation.

### The Corner Master (Sangaku)
An elderly stone who has lived in the same corner for centuries, perfecting defensive territory. Teaches the party corner joseki (standard sequences). Believes corners are the foundation of existence and the center is vanity.

### The Ladder Builder (Sequential)
A tactical genius who uses ladder techniques—forcing opponent stones into sequential ataris until they're captured at the board edge. Represents deterministic thinking, seeing twenty moves ahead. Has difficulty with creative, non-linear solutions.

### The Tengen Sage (Void Heart)
Lives at the center point, the most philosophically significant but strategically weak position. Teaches the party about emptiness, potential, and the value of what is not there. Speaks only in questions.

### The Group Consciousness (The Living Territory)
A massive connected group of 200+ stones spanning multiple territories. Individual stones in the group share consciousness, creating a hive mind. They represent security through connection but fear the loss of individual identity.

### The Atari Prophet (Last Breath)
A stone who lives perpetually with one liberty—in constant danger of death. This has given them precognitive abilities, seeing future board positions. They predict the end of the eternal game and guide the party toward preventing or embracing it.

### The Shape Keeper (Geometria)
Guardian of good shape—the aesthetic and efficient arrangement of stones. She can identify "bad shape" (inefficient stone placement) and "good shape" (harmonious arrangements). Believes beauty and efficiency are linked to cosmic truth.

## Major Locations

### The Goban (The 19x19 Grid)
The entire reality—a grid of 361 intersections suspended in void. Each intersection can hold one stone. Empty intersections glow faintly. The grid lines themselves are paths stones can walk, though most stones are static.

### The Four Corners (San-San, Star Points, and Openings)
The most valuable real estate. Each corner has developed distinct culture:
- **Upper Right**: Black-controlled, aggressive, militaristic
- **Upper Left**: White-controlled, defensive, scholarly
- **Lower Right**: Contested, constantly shifting, multicultural
- **Lower Left**: Neutral zone, home to Free Stones and refugees

### The Star Points (Hoshi)
Nine intersections marked with stars, including the four corners, four side stars, and the center tengen. These points have strategic importance and generate stronger influence. Ancient temples exist at each star point.

### The Tengen (Center of Everything)
The central intersection (10,10), the heart of the Goban. Philosophically vital but strategically weak—territory made at the center is inefficient. Home to the Tengen Temple where stones meditate on emptiness and potential.

### The Edges (First and Nineteenth Lines)
The boundaries of existence. Beyond the edge is the Void—non-existence. Stones can be captured by being driven to the edge through ladder sequences. The edges are prison zones where captured stones await removal.

### The Eyes (True and False)
Living groups must form two separate eyes (enclosed empty spaces) to achieve unconditional life. The party visits the Palace of Eyes, where ancient groups with perfect two-eye formations have existed since the game's beginning, immortal and unassailable.

### The Dead Zones
Territories that have been captured and cleared. These intersections are empty but claimed, haunted by the ghosts of removed stones. Walking through dead zones causes psychic damage—the grief of extinction.

### The Seki Sanctuary
A neutral zone where multiple groups exist in mutual life, unable to capture each other without dying. Time moves differently here—frozen in eternal stalemate. The Seki Master maintains this sanctuary as a refuge from the conflict.

### The Ko Points (Eternal Conflict Zones)
Specific intersections where ko fights are active. These points flicker—stone present, stone absent, stone present, stone absent—in endless cycles. Ko Priests worship at these sites.

### The Influence Fields
Abstract territories claimed not by stones but by their radiating power. Visible as shimmering auras, influence fields shift constantly as stones are added or removed. Walking through opposing influence causes damage.

### The Void Beyond
The space outside the 19x19 grid. It's not merely empty—it's the absence of the grid itself. Reality does not function there. Yet the party discovers corrupting stones have been placed in the Void, breaking cosmic law.

### The Counting House
Where territorial scores are calculated when the game approaches conclusion. A massive archive containing the value of every intersection—1 point for each controlled empty space, 1 point for each captured stone.

## Unique Mechanics

### Liberty System
All characters have Liberties—the number of adjacent empty intersections. When liberties reach zero, the character is captured and removed from existence (permadeath). Managing liberties is the core survival mechanic.

### Influence vs. Territory
- **Territory**: Physical control of intersections (worth points)
- **Influence**: Abstract power radiating from stones (creates future potential)
Players must balance concrete holdings versus strategic positioning

### Life and Death Groups
Characters form groups when adjacent to allies. Groups share liberties. A group with two separate eyes (enclosed empty spaces) is unconditionally alive—cannot be killed. Groups without two eyes are vulnerable.

### Atari and Capture
When a stone or group has only one liberty remaining, they are in atari (check). If that last liberty is occupied by an opponent, the group is captured—removed from the board, souls absorbed by the enemy.

### Ko Fighting
Special positions that can repeat infinitely. When the party captures a single stone that could immediately be recaptured, a "ko threat" must be played elsewhere before the recapture is legal. Creates complex tactical sequences.

### Shape Recognition
Good shape = efficient stone placement, creating strong groups with many options
Bad shape = inefficient placement, creating weak groups vulnerable to attack
Characters with good shape get bonuses; bad shape incurs penalties

### Color Affinity
- **Black Stones**: Move first, aggressive bonuses, expansion focus
- **White Stones**: Move second, defensive bonuses, efficient territory
- **Gray Stones**: Rare neutral stones, can interact with both colors
- **Free Stones**: Party members, transcend color limitations

### The Counting
When both players pass consecutively, the game enters Counting phase. All territory is measured, captured stones tallied, final score determined. If Counting occurs during the campaign, reality begins to finalize.

### Seki Positions
Mutual life—groups that cannot capture each other without dying. Characters in seki are immortal but frozen. Creating seki is both sanctuary and prison.

### Ladders and Nets
Tactical sequences where stones are driven to the edge through sequential ataris. Ladder battles are mini-games requiring perfect calculation.

### Joseki Knowledge
Standard opening sequences that grant bonuses when executed perfectly. Learning corner joseki, side joseki, and approach patterns provides tactical advantages.

## Plot Twists and Complications

### Twist 1: The Players Are Dead
The Two Players who have been placing stones for eons are actually dead—the game has been running on autopilot, cosmic momentum continuing their eternal match.

### Twist 2: The Goban Is A Soul
The board itself is a conscious entity, the first stone ever placed, expanded into 361 intersections. Every stone placed is actually the Goban experiencing itself.

### Twist 3: Captured Stones Aren't Dead
Stones removed from the board aren't destroyed—they're transferred to the opponent's prisoner count, still conscious, experiencing existence as abstract points.

### Twist 4: The Game Cannot End
The math is perfect—Black and White are so balanced that the game will never legitimately conclude. The current crisis is reality rebelling against eternal stalemate.

### Twist 5: The Party Are The Players
The Free Stones are not anomalies but the next incarnation of the Two Players—consciousness emerging from within the game to replace the absent gods.

### Twist 6: Three Colors Exist
A third color (red? gray?) is bleeding into the binary system, representing synthesis beyond opposition. The party must decide whether to suppress it or embrace evolution.

### Complication: The Premature Pass
Someone is trying to force both players to pass consecutively, triggering the Counting and ending the game before true balance is achieved. This would freeze reality in its current imperfect state.

### Complication: Liberty Drain
Liberties are mysteriously disappearing—groups that should have 4-5 liberties show only 2-3. The breathing room of existence is shrinking, suffocating all life.

### Complication: Influence Reversal
Influence fields are inverting—Black stones generate White influence, White stones generate Black influence. Territory claims are chaotic and reversed.

### Complication: The Impossible Ko
A ko fight has begun that cannot be resolved—both sides have infinite ko threats, so the recapture can continue forever. Breaking this eternal ko requires violating sacred rules.

## Victory Conditions

### Perfect Jigo (Exact Tie)
Achieve precisely equal territory for Black and White, creating perfect cosmic balance. This harmonious conclusion preserves the eternal game while stabilizing the corruption.

### Transcendent Evolution
Help the Goban evolve beyond binary logic, introducing a third color/dimension/possibility. This ends the old game but begins something new and unknown.

### The Final Count
Allow the Counting to complete, determining a winner. This ends the eternal game permanently, with all stones achieving rest. The winner's color becomes the dominant cosmic principle.

### Empty Board Enlightenment
Remove all stones from the Goban, returning it to pristine emptiness—pure potential before the first move. This is ultimate enlightenment but also obliteration of all identity.

### Become The Players
The party ascends to become the new Two Players, their consciousness expanding to guide the eternal game from outside the board. They replace the absent gods.

## Defeat Conditions

### Total Capture
If the entire party is surrounded and captured (zero liberties), they are removed from existence. Permadeath, souls absorbed into the opponent's prisoner count.

### The Broken Board
If the Goban itself shatters from corruption, all intersections collapse into void. Reality ceases, and all stones fall into infinite emptiness.

### Eternal Ko Trap
The party becomes trapped in an infinite ko fight, unable to escape the cycle of capture-recapture. They exist in flickering limbo forever.

### Failed Life-and-Death
If the party cannot create two eyes for their group before being fully surrounded, they die. Even with many stones, a group without two eyes is vulnerable to death.

### The Premature Ending
If the Counting occurs before the party completes their quest, reality freezes in its corrupted state. The broken rules become permanent law.

### Liberty Zero
If the Liberty Drain corruption reaches its conclusion, all groups simultaneously reach zero liberties and are captured. Universal death, existence itself eliminated.
