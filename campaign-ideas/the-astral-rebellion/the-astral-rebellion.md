The Celestial Imperium—a tyrannical empire spanning a thousand worlds—has crushed freedom across the planes. The party joins the Starlight Rebellion, a ragtag alliance fighting against impossible odds. When an ancient prophecy reveals that one among them may be the "Voidborn Champion" destined to restore balance to the cosmic Weave, the party must master the mysterious Astral Arts, unite fractured resistance cells, and strike at the heart of the Imperium before the Emperor completes a superweapon capable of severing entire worlds from the Weave itself.

*   **Investigation:** The party must gather intelligence, recruit allies, and locate ancient Astral temples while being hunted by Imperial Inquisitors.
*   **Consequences:** The party's successes and failures directly impact the war. Planets can be saved or destroyed. Allies can live or die. The fate of countless worlds rests on their shoulders.

## Key Locations

1.  **Stellara Prime:** The party's home world—a beautiful planet of crystal forests and floating cities, now under Imperial occupation.
2.  **The Rebel Base (Asteroid Belt):** A hidden fortress carved into asteroids, serving as the Rebellion's primary headquarters until its destruction.
3.  **The Astral Temple of Yven:** A remote jungle world where an ancient hermit trains the party in the ways of the Astral Arts.
4.  **The World-Breaker:** A moon-sized superweapon capable of severing entire planets from the Weave, effectively erasing them from existence.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is the eternal struggle between freedom and tyranny, between balance and domination. The Celestial Imperium believes that only through absolute control can order be maintained across the planes. The Rebellion fights for the right of all beings to choose their own destiny. Underlying this is the metaphysical conflict between the Astral Arts (balance and connection to the Weave) and the Void Arts (control and severing from the Weave). The party must not only defeat the Empire militarily but also restore philosophical and spiritual balance to the cosmos.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Astral Arts (Force Powers)**

*   Party members can learn to manipulate the Weave through meditation, training, and discovery.
*   **Abilities:** Telekinesis (Mage Hand at-will), Precognition (bonus to Initiative), Astral Blade (conjure a weapon of pure Weave energy), Mind Influence (enchantment magic), Astral Leap (teleportation).
*   **Dark Side Temptation:** Using Void Arts (domination, life drain, fear) is powerful but corrupts the user over time.

### 2. **Space Combat**

*   Ship-to-ship battles using simplified rules—pilot checks, gunner attacks, engineer repairs.
*   **Special Maneuvers:** Barrel rolls for evasion, targeting specific ship systems, coordinated squadron tactics.

### 3. **Rebellion Resources**

*   The party's actions affect the Rebellion's resources (troops, ships, supplies, morale).
*   **Effects:** High resources mean better equipment and reinforcements. Low resources mean desperate missions and tough choices.

### 4. **Destiny Points**

*   The party shares a pool of Destiny Points representing the will of the Weave.
*   **Usage:** Spend to turn failure into success, survive lethal damage, or trigger heroic moments. Refresh when fulfilling the prophecy or achieving major victories.
