**Curse of the Sorcerer King**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Negative emotions create cursed spirits that kill humans. The party enrolls in jujutsu school, one becoming Sukuna's vessel. They master cursed techniques and Domain Expansion to prevent Sukuna's resurrection and face conspiracy within the corrupt jujutsu world during the catastrophic Shibuya Incident.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Heian Era when Sukuna ruled as Sorcerer King.
    *   Write the history of jujutsu society and its conservative traditions.
    *   Describe how curses form from collective negative emotions.
    *   Explain the classification system (Grade 4 to Special Grade).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:** Tokyo Jujutsu High (progressive reformists), Kyoto Jujutsu High (conservative traditionalists), Curse Users (humans using curses for evil), Special Grade Curses (organized intelligent curses).

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Vessel consumes more Sukuna fingers → **THEN:** Gains power but possession risk increases, more enemies target them.
*   **IF:** Party masters Domain Expansion → **THEN:** Can face special-grade curses, recognized as first-grade sorcerers.
*   **IF:** Gojo is sealed → **THEN:** Power balance collapses, curse users act openly, emergency martial law.
*   **IF:** Sukuna fully manifests → **THEN:** Fights vessel for control, may temporarily aid party against common enemy, ultimate threat if not resealed.
