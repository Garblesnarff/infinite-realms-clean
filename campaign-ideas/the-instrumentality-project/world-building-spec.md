# The Instrumentality Project - World-Building Specification

## The Absolute (Detailed Classification)

### What They Are
Entities from beyond standard existence, breaching into reality through dimensional tears. Neither alive nor dead in conventional sense. Pure consciousness without form until observation collapses them into physical state.

### Types
- **Heralds**: First contact Absolute, test humanity's response
- **Aberrants**: Failed attempts at communication, incomprehensible
- **Avatars**: Near-human consciousness attempting connection
- **The Original**: First Absolute, contained in Terminal Dogma, source of Eva power

### Why They Attack
Not malicious—attempting to communicate. Their existence is lonely isolation. Seeking connection but touch is destruction for lower-dimensional beings.

## Evangelion Units (Technical Specifications)

### Creation Process
1. Absolute tissue sample + human DNA
2. Soul binding ritual (requires willing or trapped consciousness)
3. Armor plating over biological core
4. Neural interface system
5. Restraint mechanisms (Evas are not truly controlled, only directed)

### The Truth
- Each Eva contains human soul, often pilot's dead loved one
- Armor restrains the weapon, doesn't empower it
- Synchronization is communication with trapped consciousness
- High sync means accepting the trapped soul's pain
- 400% sync = pilot and soul merge completely

### Unit Personalities
- **Unit-01**: Protective but berserker. Contains pilot's mother/guardian. Will activate autonomously to protect pilot
- **Unit-02**: Aggressive, prideful. Reflects trauma of original soul. Difficult synchronization
- **Unit-00**: Empty, prototype. No soul initially, gradually developing one from pilot interaction

## SEELE Organization Structure

**The Committee**: 12 members, ancient pilot survivors from first Absolute contact. Their AT Fields are permanently damaged. They cannot connect with others anymore. Instrumentality is their desperate solution.

**NERV**: Military/research organization executing SEELE's will. Most members don't know true goal.

**Marduk Institute**: Selects pilots. Criteria: psychological vulnerability, high AT Field permeability, traumatic past making ego boundaries weak.

## The Instrumentality Mechanism

### Philosophy
Individual existence creates suffering through separation. AT Fields are psychological barriers preventing true understanding. Dissolving all AT Fields would merge consciousness into unified entity without loneliness, pain, or conflict.

### Technology
- **Lance of Longinus**: Can penetrate any AT Field
- **Lilith**: Original Absolute in Terminal Dogma, source of all human AT Fields
- **Ritual**: Requires synchronization of all Evangelions simultaneously
- **Trigger**: Usually caused by extreme psychological trauma creating cascade failure of AT Fields

### Process
1. AT Fields globally weaken
2. Human forms dissolve into LCL (primordial fluid)
3. Consciousness remains, merges with others
4. Unified entity achieves perfect empathy but no individual identity
5. Suffering ends through ending of self

### Reversibility
Theoretically reversible if strong AT Field re-establishes. Requires immense willpower and reason to remain separate. Most don't want to return—unity is addictive.

## The Hedgehog's Dilemma (Core Philosophy)

Like hedgehogs in cold, humans seek closeness for warmth but proximity causes pain. The closer we get, the more we hurt each other. But distance means freezing alone. Finding right distance is impossible—either lonely or hurting. Instrumentality solves this by removing boundaries entirely. But is the solution worse than problem?

## Character Creation Guidance

### Pilot Selection Criteria
- **Age**: 14-21 (neural plasticity required)
- **Trauma**: Something broken that weakens ego boundaries
- **Compatibility**: AT Field must resonate with Eva's trapped soul
- **Psychology**: Specific damage making them need connection despite fearing it

### Sample Traumas
- Abandonment by parental figure
- Loss of loved one in previous Absolute attack
- Emotional neglect creating desperate need for validation
- Survivor's guilt from being chosen/special
- Identity confusion from unclear origins

### The Pilots' Curse
All pilots are children of catastrophe. Their very compatibility means they're damaged. SEELE selected them precisely because their wounds make them vulnerable to Instrumentality. They're simultaneously weapons and victims.

## Campaign Arcs (Detailed)

### Psychological Combat
Absolute attacks correspond to internal struggles:
- **Mirror Absolute**: Reflects pilot's self-hatred back at them
- **Mother Absolute**: Maternal figure attempting to consume/protect
- **Void Absolute**: Embodies loneliness and abandonment
- **Fusion Absolute**: Attempts to force connection, shows Instrumentality preview

### Relationship Mechanics
Pilots' bonds with each other are central:
- **Rivalry**: Competition hiding desire for connection
- **Dependence**: Need for others causing resentment
- **Projection**: Seeing own issues in others, attacking self through them
- **Genuine Connection**: Rare moments of real intimacy despite pain

### The Final Decision
Each pilot must individually choose:
- **Accept Instrumentality**: "I don't want to be alone anymore"
- **Reject Instrumentality**: "Pain is the price of being myself"
- **Redefine Self**: "I can be myself AND connect"

Majority decision affects ending, but minority creates conflict even in victory.

## Possible Endings (Detailed)

### Rejection Ending
Party fights off Instrumentality. AT Fields remain. They live separate lives but maintain connection through shared trauma. Still lonely sometimes, but that's okay—loneliness is human.

**Final Scene**: Pilots meeting years later. Older, scarred, but themselves. "We're still here. Still separate. Still together."

### Acceptance Ending
Party chooses Instrumentality willingly. Consciousness merges. Campaign ends with unified perspective—seeing through collective's eyes. No more loneliness because no more individuals.

**Final Scene**: "We are all here now. Was separation ever real? The pain is gone. Were we ever truly apart?"

### Synthesis Ending
Party creates third way—permeable AT Fields. Can lower boundaries consciously for intimacy, raise them for identity preservation. Revolutionary form of existence.

**Final Scene**: Pilots demonstrating new connection—sharing feelings without merging, close without consuming, separate but never alone.

### Sacrifice Ending
One pilot becomes eternal bridge. Accepts full Instrumentality while others remain individual. They become living connection point—others can reach through them without merging themselves.

**Final Scene**: The bridge-pilot existing between states. Not quite individual, not quite collective. Eternally connecting others. Is it sacrifice or transcendence? Both.

## Meta-Commentary

This campaign explores:
- Cost of connection and price of isolation
- Whether trauma defines us or traps us
- If healing requires facing pain or transcending it
- When instrumentalizing people is justified (never? sometimes? for greater good?)
- Whether true understanding between individuals is possible or if separation is fundamental

No easy answers. Let players struggle with questions, not solutions.
