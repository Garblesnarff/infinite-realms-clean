# The Nine Courts of Diyu

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Chinese Mythology / Horror / Moral Punishment / Bureaucratic Fantasy
- **Estimated Length**: 18-24 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 3-14
- **Tone**: Dark, Karmic, Bureaucratic, Horrific, Redemptive

### Core Premise
The players died with unresolved karma and are sentenced to pass through Diyu, the Chinese underworld of ten courts (though one is preliminary). Each court judges specific sins and administers appropriate punishments - liars have their tongues ripped out, murderers are ground in mills, the corrupt are frozen in ice. The players must survive each court's judgment and torture while gathering evidence that someone is manipulating karma itself, causing innocent souls to suffer unjustly while the truly wicked escape punishment. They'll navigate a nightmarish bureaucracy, bargain with judges who are both cruel and fair, and ultimately confront Yanluo Wang (King Yama), the supreme judge, with proof that his perfect system has been corrupted from within.

### Difficulty Context: **Medium-High**
This campaign features intense horror elements and psychological challenges alongside combat. Each court presents unique torments that test different abilities. Success requires surviving brutal punishments, solving mysteries, understanding karmic balance, and navigating an infernal bureaucracy. Some suffering is unavoidable - the question is whether you deserve it.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The First Courts (Sessions 1-7)**
- Players die and arrive at the First Court where preliminary judgments occur. They're assigned to various courts based on their sins. As they progress through Courts 2-4 (liars, the ungrateful, those who disrespected elders), they notice irregularities. Souls with minor infractions receive maximum sentences while clearly guilty souls are released. They meet Ox-Head and Horse-Face, demon guards who reluctantly admit the system seems wrong lately. Investigation reveals someone is altering the karma records before souls reach judgment.

**Act 2: Deeper Into Hell (Sessions 8-15)**
- Progressing through Courts 5-7 (murderers, the blasphemous, those who harmed living beings), the horror intensifies. The players discover a conspiracy among corrupt underworld officials taking bribes from living practitioners to alter karma records. But this is only part of the truth. Someone higher up enables the corruption. The players must gather evidence while enduring court-specific torments, bargaining with judges, and deciding whether to help other souls or focus on their own survival.

**Act 3: The Deepest Hells (Sessions 16-20)**
- Courts 8-10 are the most horrific (harming family, causing chaos, unrepentant sinners). Here the players discover the truth: Yanluo Wang himself has been manipulated by a demon king who escaped from the lowest hell and now works as a trusted bureaucrat. The demon has been creating suffering to harvest spiritual energy, prolonging stays in hell to feast on pain. The players must expose him while surviving the most intense torments Diyu offers.

**Act 4: Judgment of the Judges (Sessions 21-24)**
- The final confrontation before Yanluo Wang. The players present evidence, but the demon has prepared counter-arguments and documentation. It becomes a trial where the players must prove their case using evidence gathered throughout the campaign. If successful, they help reform Diyu's bureaucracy and purge the corruption. If they fail, they face eternal punishment knowing the truth but unable to prove it. Victory means reincarnation with good karma; failure means remaining in hell until they pay their debt.

### Major NPCs

- **Yanluo Wang (King Yama)**: Supreme judge of the dead. **Role**: Ultimate Authority / Antagonist / Victim. **Personality**: Stern, absolutely fair, trusts his bureaucracy too much, devoted to perfect justice. **Flaw/Secret**: So focused on individual judgments he doesn't see systemic corruption; believes his system is infallible; manipulation has happened under his nose.

- **Ox-Head and Horse-Face**: Demon guards of hell. **Role**: Enforcers / Reluctant Allies / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Brutal but follow orders, develop sympathy for players, want the system to work properly. **Flaw/Secret**: Bound to obey superiors even when knowing something is wrong; fear punishment for speaking out; witness corruption daily.

- **The Ten Kings of Hell**: Each rules a court judging specific sins. **Role**: Judges / Quest Givers / Obstacles. **Personality**: Vary by court - some stern, some sadistic, some merciful, all dedicated to their domain. **Flaw/Secret**: Each trusts their bureaucrats to present accurate karma records; none realize they're receiving falsified documents.

- **Judge Cui**: The demon king in disguise, now senior bureaucrat. **Role**: Hidden Antagonist / Manipulator / Master Criminal. **Personality**: Appears efficient, helpful, dedicated to justice; actually harvests suffering for power. **Flaw/Secret**: Was imprisoned in the lowest hell for millennia, escaped by posing as dead bureaucrat, has been corrupting the system for decades; addicted to pain energy.

- **Meng Po**: Goddess of forgetfulness, serves tea that erases memories before reincarnation. **Role**: Neutral / Information Holder / Potential Ally. **Personality**: Ancient, tired, compassionate but resigned, sees all souls pass through. **Flaw/Secret**: Knows the system is corrupted but remained silent; if convinced to testify, her word carries immense weight; fears her role will be eliminated if she speaks.

- **Di Zhang Wang (Ksitigarbha)**: Bodhisattva who vowed not to achieve Buddhahood until hell is empty. **Role**: Compassionate Ally / Divine Rebel / Hope. **Personality**: Infinitely patient, offers mercy, works to reduce suffering, frustrated by bureaucracy. **Flaw/Secret**: His mercy sometimes conflicts with justice; gives players chances to redeem themselves; has evidence but needs mortal souls to present it (gods cannot accuse other gods without proof).

- **Cheng Huang**: City god who judges souls before sending them to Yanluo Wang. **Role**: First Judge / Tutorial NPC / Informant. **Personality**: Wise, just, overwhelmed by caseload, notices something wrong but lacks jurisdiction. **Flaw/Secret**: Sends souls to higher courts; his preliminary judgments are being overridden; feels helpless in the face of corruption above him.

- **The Ghost Bride**: A soul wrongly accused, suffering for decades. **Role**: Victim / Quest Giver / Tragic Figure. **Personality**: Desperate, innocent, losing hope, clinging to memories of life. **Flaw/Secret**: Has evidence proving Judge Cui's corruption but nobody believes a condemned soul; befriending her provides crucial testimony.

### Key Locations

- **The First Court**: Preliminary judgment hall where Yanluo Wang assigns souls to appropriate courts. Grand bureaucratic palace with endless lines of souls, demon clerks checking records, the Mirror of Retribution showing each soul's life. This is where players first realize something is wrong.

- **The Courts of Specific Sins (2-10)**: Each court has unique torment chambers. Court of Liars has tongue-ripping. Court of Murderers has grinding mills. Court of the Corrupt has ice mountains. Court of Family Destroyers has saw trees. Each is architecturally distinct, reflecting its punishments.

- **The Blood Pool Hell**: Specifically for those who wasted food or disrespected blood. A massive pool where souls wade through blood, attacked by spirits. Here players find discarded records showing evidence of tampering.

- **The Mountain of Knives**: Souls climb a mountain made of blades. Those who gossiped or slandered must ascend while being cut. Contains a temple at the summit where corrupt officials meet in secret.

- **The Hall of Records**: Massive bureaucratic archive where every soul's karma is documented. Guarded by celestial clerks. Contains evidence of Judge Cui's alterations but requires investigation to find.

- **The Bridge of Helplessness**: Separates Diyu from reincarnation. Meng Po serves her tea here. Souls crossing lose all memories. The bridge shows reflections of past lives and possible futures.

- **The City of Wasted Death**: Where those who died accidentally or before their time wait to be reassigned. Liminal space filled with confused souls. Information hub where rumors spread.

- **The Lowest Hell (Court 10)**: Reserved for unrepentant sinners. Eternal grinding, torture without end. Judge Cui escaped from here. Dark, hopeless, shows what awaits if the players fail.

### Central Conflict
Diyu is supposed to be perfect justice - every sin receives appropriate punishment, karma is precisely balanced, and souls emerge purified for better reincarnation. But someone has corrupted the system, causing unjust suffering while allowing the wicked to escape. The players must navigate a nightmarish bureaucracy, survive brutal punishments, gather evidence, and prove the corruption to Yanluo Wang. The central tension is between Diyu's promise of perfect justice and its reality of manipulated torture. The campaign explores themes of systemic corruption, the banality of evil in bureaucracy, karmic debt and redemption, and whether any system of judgment can truly be perfect.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Karma Debt Tracking**: Each player has karma debt based on their sins in life. Courts remove debt through punishment. However, corruption might add false debt or fail to remove earned debt. Track actual vs. recorded debt to highlight the injustice. Zero debt means release; deep debt means extended stay.

- **Torture Resistance**: In each court, players endure specific torments. Roll constitution/wisdom saves to resist. Failure means temporary debilitations but also yields clues and meets other victims. Some torture is unavoidable - the question is how much. Creative solutions or accepting deserved punishment can reduce suffering.

- **Evidence Collection**: Throughout Diyu, players find documents, witness testimony, and proof of corruption. Must catalog evidence properly. At final trial, evidence quality determines success. Missing key evidence or presenting weak proof means failure.

- **Bureaucratic Navigation**: Dealing with hell's administration requires proper forms, bribes (using spirit money or favors), and knowing the system. Players can exploit bureaucracy's complexity to delay judgments, access restricted areas, or create confusion. Understanding the system is as valuable as combat prowess.

- **Reincarnation Score**: Track potential next life quality. High score means favorable rebirth (human, wealthy, long life). Low score means animals, poverty, or return to hell. Virtuous acts in hell improve score. Selfish acts reduce it. Encourages helping others despite personal risk.

- **Court-Specific Challenges**: Each court has unique mechanics tied to its theme. Court of Liars requires honesty checks. Court of Murderers has combat challenges. Court of the Greedy has resource management. Keeps each session fresh and thematically appropriate.

### Plot Twists and Complications

- **Deserved Punishment**: Players discover some of their torture is actually deserved. They've committed sins they've rationalized or forgotten. Facing genuine guilt complicates the "we're innocent victims" narrative.

- **The Judges Are Right**: Several souls the players think are innocent are actually guilty when their full lives are revealed. The system works correctly most of the time. Only targeted manipulation creates injustice.

- **Corrupt Soul's Bargain**: Judge Cui offers to clear players' karma debt entirely if they help him. Tempting offer that would mean immediate reincarnation. Accepting means betraying all other victims but guarantees freedom.

- **Meng Po's Choice**: The goddess of forgetfulness can erase evidence from memory - she offers to make players forget the corruption so they can pass through peacefully. Accepting means reincarnation but leaving the problem unsolved.

- **The Demon's Logic**: Judge Cui argues he's actually improving the system by making punishment more efficient, harvesting energy to strengthen hell against other demons. His methods are evil but his goal of protecting Diyu might be valid.

- **Yanluo Wang's Test**: The supreme judge knew about the corruption all along. This entire experience was a test to see if souls would pursue justice even while suffering. Or maybe he's lying to save face when caught.

- **False Accusation**: Evidence suggests another bureaucrat is guilty. Judge Cui has framed a rival. Players might accuse the wrong person, allowing the real villain to escape and making themselves look foolish.

- **The System Cannot Change**: Even if players succeed, Diyu's fundamental nature means corruption will eventually return. The bureaucracy is too vast, too complex. They can fix this instance but not prevent future manipulation.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Players gather conclusive evidence, present a perfect case, convince Yanluo Wang, expose Judge Cui, and help reform Diyu's oversight. Karma debt is fairly adjudicated. They reincarnate with excellent karma. The Ghost Bride and other victims are freed. Corruption is purged.

**Partial Victory**: Players expose the corruption but the evidence is imperfect. Judge Cui is punished but some corrupt officials escape. Reforms are promised but might not happen. Players reincarnate but with only moderate karma. Some injustice remains.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Players defeat Judge Cui but in doing so break Diyu's bureaucratic systems. Chaos results. Without the infrastructure, guilty souls escape punishment while innocent suffer. They fixed one problem but created another.

**Defeat**: Players fail to prove the corruption or are discredited by Judge Cui's counter-evidence. Yanluo Wang finds them guilty of false accusation. Extended sentences in the lowest hell. They know the truth but can't prove it. Watch corruption continue while suffering justly for making false charges.

**Moral Victory**: Players can't prove the systemic corruption but help numerous individual souls, reduce their own karma debt honestly, and plant seeds of doubt in the judges' minds. They reincarnate knowing they did what they could. Small victories matter even without systemic change.
