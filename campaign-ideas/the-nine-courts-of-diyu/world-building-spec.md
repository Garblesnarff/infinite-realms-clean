# World-Building Specification: The Nine Courts of Diyu

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Nine Courts of Diyu**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players have died and entered Diyu, the Chinese underworld of ten courts (nine main plus preliminary). Each court judges specific categories of sin and administers proportionate punishment to balance karma before reincarnation. However, the system has been corrupted - innocent souls suffer while guilty ones escape. The players must navigate this nightmarish bureaucracy, survive court-specific torments, investigate the corruption, gather evidence, and ultimately present their case to Yanluo Wang. This campaign explores systemic corruption in supposedly perfect justice, the horror of bureaucratic evil, karmic debt and redemption, and whether any judgment system can truly be infallible.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the concept of karma in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism - how deeds in life affect death and rebirth.
    *   Explain the structure of Diyu: the ten courts, what each judges, and their specific punishments.
    *   Write the history and authority of Yanluo Wang (King Yama) as supreme judge of the dead.
    *   Describe the process a soul undergoes: death, judgment by city god, assignment to courts, punishment, purification, crossing the Bridge of Helplessness, drinking Meng Po's tea, and reincarnation via the Wheel of Transmigration.
    *   Detail the bureaucratic nature of Chinese underworld - celestial hierarchy, demon officials, record-keeping, appeals process.
    *   Explain specific sins judged in each court: Court 1 (preliminary), Court 2 (thieves, corrupt officials), Court 3 (ungrateful, disrespectful), Court 4 (tax evasion, rent dodgers), Court 5 (murderers, manslaughter), Court 6 (blasphemers, tomb robbers), Court 7 (those who harm living beings), Court 8 (filial impiety, family destroyers), Court 9 (arsonists, abortion, pornographers), Court 10 (unrepentant sinners).
    *   Describe Di Zhang Wang (Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva) and his vow not to achieve Buddhahood until hell is empty.
    *   Write the mythology of Ox-Head and Horse-Face as hell's enforcers.
    *   Explain Meng Po and the tea of forgetfulness at the Bridge of Helplessness.
    *   Detail the concept of hungry ghosts and how some souls fail to proceed properly through the system.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Ten Kings and Their Courts** (Major - Judicial Authority)
        *   **Goals:** Judge souls fairly according to karma, administer appropriate punishment, purify souls for reincarnation, maintain cosmic justice.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Yanluo Wang as supreme judge (Court 1), nine other kings ruling specific courts, demon officials administering each court, Ox-Head and Horse-Face as enforcers, celestial clerks maintaining records.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Perfect justice - every sin receives proportionate punishment, karma is precisely balanced.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Maintain authority and order; some judges are cruel beyond necessity; bureaucratic self-preservation; unwilling to admit the system can be corrupted.
        *   **Assets:** Complete authority over souls, The Mirror of Retribution showing all deeds, Hall of Records documenting all karma, torture implements for each specific sin, armies of demon guards.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve the Jade Emperor; respect Di Zhang Wang's compassion but maintain their authority; employ demon bureaucrats (including the infiltrator); trusted by the living who make offerings.

    *   **Judge Cui's Conspiracy** (Minor - Hidden Corruption)
        *   **Goals:** Harvest suffering energy to increase personal power, maintain disguise as loyal bureaucrat, eventually escape Diyu permanently or overthrow Yanluo Wang.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Judge Cui (demon king in disguise) as leader, corrupted clerks as accomplices, bribed officials turning blind eyes, demon messengers carrying falsified documents.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None - operates in secret.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Alter karma records to extend suffering unjustly, harvest the resulting pain energy, accept bribes from living practitioners to release specific souls (generating more resources), gradually corrupt more officials.
        *   **Assets:** Position within bureaucracy giving access to records, intimate knowledge of the system's weaknesses, ability to forge documents, bribes and blackmail material, harvested pain energy as power source.
        *   **Relationships:** Pretends loyalty to Yanluo Wang; manipulates other officials; exploits living practitioners; commands the souls he falsely condemns; fears discovery but grows arrogant.

    *   **Di Zhang Wang's Mercy Network** (Minor - Compassionate Rebels)
        *   **Goals:** Reduce suffering in hell, help souls achieve redemption faster, protect innocents, expose corruption when possible, work toward emptying hell entirely.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Di Zhang Wang (Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva) as spiritual leader, sympathetic minor deities, reformed souls working as helpers, Meng Po as reluctant ally.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Offer spiritual guidance and mercy within the system's rules.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Subvert excessive punishments, gather evidence of corruption, help worthy souls prove innocence, support players if they pursue justice.
        *   **Assets:** Divine authority (though subordinate to the Ten Kings), spiritual power, knowledge of loopholes in the system, respect from many souls, ability to witness without direct interference.
        *   **Relationships:** Technically subordinate to the Ten Kings but morally superior; frustrated by bureaucratic rigidity; cannot act directly but can help those who pursue justice; Meng Po knows more than she says.

    *   **The Suffering Souls** (Major - Victims and Possibly Guilty)
        *   **Goals:** Survive punishment, reduce karma debt, achieve purification, eventually reincarnate with favorable karma.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy - united by suffering but divided by courts and sins.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Endure deserved punishment and emerge purified.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some are innocent and desperate to prove it; others accept deserved punishment; many don't know if they're justly sentenced due to memory loss; willing to help players if offered hope.
        *   **Assets:** Numbers, knowledge of their courts, potential testimony, desperation that makes them brave.
        *   **Relationships:** Fear the judges and demon guards; cling to Di Zhang Wang's mercy; some form alliances; the Ghost Bride and other innocents are key witnesses; guilty souls might oppose investigation fearing system collapse means no redemption.

    *   **The Living Practitioners** (Minor - External Influence)
        *   **Goals:** Help deceased relatives escape hell faster, reduce their own future suffering, gain favor with underworld powers, exploit the system.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Buddhist monks and Taoist priests, wealthy families making offerings, common people praying, corrupt practitioners bribing officials.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Proper rituals and offerings to help the deceased.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some corrupt practitioners bribe Judge Cui to alter karma; creates resource for the conspiracy; their offerings and prayers can influence the underworld; might be enlisted as allies if they learn of corruption.
        *   **Assets:** Offerings, rituals, prayers, spirit money, connection to mortal world.
        *   **Relationships:** Interact with Diyu through offerings and prayer; some know corrupt channels exist; Di Zhang Wang receives many prayers; the system depends partly on mortal ritual support.

Taste (The tea erases everything - memories dissolving into sweetness and loss).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**

    *   **IF:** Players endure court punishments honestly and without complaint.
    *   **THEN:** Reduce karma debt legitimately. Gain respect from judges and demon guards. Di Zhang Wang notices their acceptance. Generate redemption narrative.

    *   **IF:** Players resist or try to escape punishment.
    *   **THEN:** Extended sentences, additional karma debt, loss of sympathy from authorities. Generate harsher treatment and more difficult investigation.

    *   **IF:** Players discover and document evidence of corruption.
    *   **THEN:** Judge Cui becomes aware and attempts to discredit or eliminate them. Evidence tracking increases. Generate conspiracy escalation.

    *   **IF:** Players help other souls unjustly condemned.
    *   **THEN:** Improve Reincarnation Score. Gain allies and testimony. Di Zhang Wang offers more support. Generate heroic narrative and moral weight.

    *   **IF:** Players act selfishly, abandoning others to reduce their own suffering.
    *   **THEN:** Increase karma debt. Lose potential allies. Moral isolation. Generate consequences of selfishness.

    *   **IF:** Corruption level reaches critical point (Judge Cui feeling threatened).
    *   **THEN:** Open attempts to eliminate players, frame them for new crimes, destroy evidence. Generate high-stakes chase and investigation climax.

    *   **IF:** Players gain Meng Po's testimony.
    *   **THEN:** Major evidence boost. Yanluo Wang must take case seriously. Judge Cui desperate. Generate turning point toward victory.

    *   **IF:** Players present case to Yanluo Wang with strong evidence.
    *   **THEN:** Trial sequence begins. Quality of evidence determines outcome. Generate courtroom drama and judgment scenes.

    *   **IF:** Players fail to prove corruption or are discredited.
    *   **THEN:** Extended sentences in lowest hell. Watch corruption continue. Generate tragic defeat where truth is known but unprovable.

    *   **IF:** Players successfully expose Judge Cui and reform begins.
    *   **THEN:** Purification of Diyu's bureaucracy, rescue of wrongly condemned, favorable reincarnation for players. Generate victory celebration and rebirth.

**7. Mechanics & Systems**
*   **Karma Debt Tracking:** Numerical measure of sins requiring punishment. Courts reduce debt. Corruption falsifies debt. Track actual vs recorded.
*   **Torture Resistance:** Constitution/wisdom saves against court-specific torments. Failure causes debilitations but yields information.
*   **Evidence Collection:** Document corruption proof. Quality matters at final trial. Must be organized and presented properly.
*   **Bureaucratic Navigation:** Use proper forms, bribes (spirit money), and system knowledge to access areas and delay judgments.
*   **Reincarnation Score:** Track quality of next life. Affected by virtuous/selfish acts in hell. Visible consequence for moral choices.
*   **Court-Specific Challenges:** Each court has unique mechanics tied to its theme. Keeps gameplay varied.

**8. Theme & Tone Consistency**
*   **Core Themes:** Systemic corruption in supposedly perfect justice, the banality of evil in bureaucracy, karmic debt and redemption, whether perfect justice is possible, suffering with and without purpose, the horror of systematic cruelty.
*   **Tone Guidance:** Dark and horrific but not hopeless. Bureaucratic horror - evil as paperwork. Suffering is real but redemption is possible. Beautiful architecture housing horror. The question is whether you deserve what happens to you.
*   **Avoid:** Making it torture porn without meaning, simplifying karma into simple good/evil, ignoring the philosophical complexity, making all judges purely evil (most are doing their job), losing the bureaucratic absurdity that makes it distinctly Chinese hell.
