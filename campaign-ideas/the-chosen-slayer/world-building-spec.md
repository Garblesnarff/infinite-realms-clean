This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Chosen Slayer**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players include the Slayer—a teenage girl chosen to fight vampires and demons—and her Scooby Gang of friends and mentors. Their town sits atop a Hellmouth portal attracting supernatural evil. They must balance high school life with nightly patrols and apocalypse prevention, learning that growing up is its own monster—but literal monsters help put it in perspective. The campaign explores the burden of being chosen, found family, and whether one person should save the world alone.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Slayer line—created by ancient Shadow Men who infused the First Slayer with demon essence, creating mystical warriors.
    *   Write the history of the Watchers' Council—an organization that trains and guides Slayers, sometimes manipulatively.
    *   Describe the Hellmouth beneath Sunnydale—a convergence point where demon dimensions can breach into reality, attracting evil.
    *   Explain vampire creation and mythology—demons animating human corpses, no soul, can only be killed by stake, sunlight, beheading, or fire.
    *   Detail the First Evil—the incorporeal source of all evil, existing since before time, which seeks to end all good in the universe.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The Slayer dies permanently (not resurrected).
    *   **THEN:** Generate a new Slayer being called elsewhere in the world. The party must find and train her while dealing with grief and power vacuum. Villains become emboldened.
    *   **IF:** Willow succumbs to dark magic permanently.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where she becomes a villain—immensely powerful but corrupted. The party must find a way to stop her without killing her.
    *   **IF:** The party destroys the Watchers' Council before the First Evil does.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where Slayers worldwide lose guidance and resources. Some turn to evil, others die unprepared. The party must build new support networks.
    *   **IF:** The party prevents Angel from losing his soul.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an alternate timeline where Angel remains ally, but a different betrayal occurs—perhaps Spike turns against them, or another friend is compromised.
    *   **IF:** The party activates all Potential Slayers early (before the finale).
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where hundreds of newly empowered teenagers emerge worldwide. Some become heroes, others villains, many die unprepared. The mystical balance of one Slayer is shattered.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully negotiates peace with a vampire faction (like Spike's gang).
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where other vampires see them as traitors. Create opportunities for uneasy alliance against greater threats (demons, The First).
    *   **IF:** The party destroys the Hellmouth completely before the finale.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where supernatural activity in Sunnydale plummets, but other Hellmouth locations become more active. The First Evil shifts focus to Cleveland or another site.
