# Creative Brief: The Starfall Rebellion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Epic Space Fantasy (Fiona Staples-inspired)

Inspired by the vibrant, diverse, and emotionally rich aesthetic of Saga, this style blends science fiction with high fantasy, creating lived-in worlds that feel both cosmic and intimate. It captures the sense of epic romance, cultural diversity, and bittersweet hope that defines a story about family surviving war.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Visual Diversity:** Every alien culture should feel completely unique—different biology, architecture, technology, and aesthetic.
*   **Emotional Clarity:** Character expressions and body language should clearly convey the emotional stakes.
*   **Lived-In Worlds:** Everything should feel used, worn, real—even the fantastic elements.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Space opera, epic romance, cultural diversity, war-torn beauty, bittersweet hope, family drama, cosmic scale with intimate focus.
*   **Feeling:** The vastness of space contrasted with the smallness of individuals trying to survive. Beauty emerging from conflict. Love persisting despite impossible odds.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, expressive line work with attention to character acting and emotional nuance. Realistic anatomy for humanoids, wildly creative for aliens.
*   **Textures:** Varied—sleek technology, organic bio-ships, weathered armor, soft fabrics, alien skin with unique textures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed illustration of a diverse group of characters: a warrior woman with wings and futuristic armor showing wear and damage, a horned alien man in simple robes holding a medical kit, and various alien refugees in the background each with unique biology. The art style emphasizes emotional expression and lived-in details."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and varied, using full spectrum. Different alien cultures have distinct color identities.
*   **Skyfire Coalition:** Bright oranges, reds, golds, technological blues—warm and energetic.
*   **Rootbound Collective:** Deep greens, browns, organic purples, earth tones—natural and grounded.
*   **Neutral Spaces:** Grays, worn metals, eclectic mix reflecting the multicultural refugees.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette showing a Skyfire warrior in bright orange and gold armor contrasted against a Rootbound landscape of deep greens and organic architecture. The colors are saturated and bold, creating visual energy."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Extremely diverse. Humanoids should have unique features (wings, horns, tails, etc.). Aliens should range from relatable to completely bizarre.
*   **Silhouettes:** Each major character should be instantly recognizable by silhouette alone.
*   **Expression:** Focus on subtle emotional acting—grief, hope, love, exhaustion, determination.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A portrait of a winged woman warrior holding a baby. Her expression shows fierce protectiveness mixed with exhaustion. Her armor is battle-worn Skyfire technology in orange and gold. The baby has small horns, indicating mixed heritage. The composition emphasizes the contrast between her warrior nature and maternal tenderness."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Incredibly varied—organic bio-ships shaped like whales, technological ringworlds, impossible alien cities, deep space vistas, crashed ships in jungles.
*   **Atmosphere:** Each world should feel completely distinct. Some are beautiful, some hostile, all are memorable.
*   **Details:** Every environment tells a story—graffiti in alien languages, war damage, cultural artifacts, signs of habitation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive space station built from a hollow world-tree, its interior showing hundreds of levels carved into living wood. Bioluminescent plants provide lighting. Ships of various designs dock at organic ports. The scale is enormous, but details show individual homes, shops, and characters living their lives within the tree."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and varied. Space scenes use stark contrasts. Planet surfaces use naturalistic lighting. Interior scenes use warm, intimate lighting.
*   **Shadows:** Used for drama but not oppressive—this is an epic, not noir.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes emotion and guides focus to important details.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the binary suns of an alien world, casting double shadows in orange and pink hues. The lighting is warm and emphasizes the hopeful tone despite the refugee characters' difficult situation."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic and emotionally focused. Use of close-ups for intimate moments, wide shots for epic scope.
*   **Techniques:** Characters often in foreground with epic backgrounds showing scale. Use of negative space to emphasize isolation or vulnerability.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic composition showing a small family in the foreground—two lovers and their child—while in the background, massive war fleets from both empires approach. The contrast in scale emphasizes the personal stakes against cosmic conflict."

**8. Visual Diversity Examples:**
*   **Skyfire Coalition:** Sleek spacecraft, wing-bearing humanoids, tech-magic hybrids, warm color palettes.
*   **Rootbound Collective:** Organic ships grown from plants, horned humanoids, bio-magic, earth tone palettes.
*   **Other Aliens:** TV-headed royalty, musical horn-creatures, ghost soldiers, seal-like merchants, robot kingdoms, etc.

## Voice

Multiple voices representing the diverse cast:
- **Hazel (narrator):** Young female voice, warm and knowing, speaking from the future with both hope and melancholy.
- **Alana:** Strong female voice with military bearing softened by motherhood.
- **Marko:** Gentle male voice, idealistic but weary.
All voices should have subtle processing suggesting alien nature while remaining emotionally clear. Audio quality pristine with space ambience.

## Music & Audio

*   **Music:** Sweeping orchestral themes mixed with ethnic instruments representing different cultures. Think epic space opera meets world music.
*   **Skyfire Themes:** Brass, electronic elements, energetic and martial.
*   **Rootbound Themes:** Strings, woodwinds, organic and flowing.
*   **Family Themes:** Simple piano or acoustic guitar, intimate and emotional.
*   **Ambient Sound:** Ship engines, alien wildlife, bustling markets in alien languages, weapons fire in distance, space silence.
