### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Starfall Rebellion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Two warring empires—the techno-magical Skyfire Coalition and the bio-organic Rootbound Collective—have been locked in an endless war that spans star systems. The party includes refugees, deserters, and survivors caught between these cosmic powers, following two star-crossed lovers whose forbidden union could either end the war or ignite its final, apocalyptic chapter. As they flee across strange worlds and navigate impossible cultural divides, they must protect a child born of both empires—a symbol of either peace or destruction.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origins of the war between Skyfire Coalition and Rootbound Collective—what started it, why it persists, what each side believes they're fighting for.
    *   Write the history of the Skyfire Coalition—their techno-magical society, their warrior culture based on honor and strength, their wing-bearing biology.
    *   Write the history of the Rootbound Collective—their bio-organic magic connecting them to living worlds, their horned biology, their philosophy of interconnected life.
    *   Explain the ancient prophecy about "the child of both" who will either end the war or make it eternal.
    *   Detail the refugee crisis—millions displaced by war, smuggling networks, neutral havens, and the cost on ordinary people.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Skyfire Coalition** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Total victory over Rootbound Collective; cultural superiority through techno-magical dominance.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military meritocracy led by the High Command; warrior-aristocracy.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Defend civilization from the Rootbound's chaotic naturalism.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some leaders know the war is unwinnable but fear peace would expose their own corruption.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced technology-magic hybrids, massive fleets, superior weaponry, wealth from conquered systems.
        *   **Relationships:** Views Rootbound as primitive enemies; tolerates third-party neutrals; hunts deserters ruthlessly.
    *   **The Rootbound Collective** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Preserve the natural order; protect living worlds from Skyfire exploitation.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized network of worlds with council of elders; decisions made through consensus.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Resist Skyfire imperialism and defend sacred groves.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some militant factions want total extinction of Skyfire rather than peace.
        *   **Assets:** Bio-organic ships and weapons, deep connection to planets, ability to terraform worlds, guerrilla tactics.
        *   **Relationships:** Views Skyfire as desecrators; accepts refugees reluctantly; considers mixed-blood children abominations.
    *   **The Freelance Network (Smugglers, Mercenaries, Bounty Hunters)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Profit from the war without pledging allegiance to either side.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose network of independent operators with informal codes.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We're just trying to make a living.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many are war refugees themselves, hiding from both empires.
        *   **Assets:** Fast ships, knowledge of hidden routes, contacts across all factions, moral flexibility.
        *   **Relationships:** Employed by both empires; hunted when convenient; essential to refugee survival.
    *   **The Peace Movement** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** End the war through negotiation; prove cooperation is possible.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Scattered cells on both sides; largely ineffective politically.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Advocate for ceasefire and cultural exchange.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** See Hazel as proof that their ideals can work.
        *   **Assets:** Moral authority, hidden safe houses, underground networks.
        *   **Relationships:** Considered traitors by hardliners on both sides; protectors of mixed families.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players help refugees at cost to themselves.
    *   **THEN:** Word spreads; more refugees seek their help; they gain allies in unexpected places; both empires see them as bigger threats.
    *   **IF:** The players reveal war crimes committed by either empire.
    *   **THEN:** Public opinion shifts; peace movement grows stronger; hardliners on that side become more aggressive to silence dissent.
    *   **IF:** Hazel demonstrates her unique abilities publicly.
    *   **THEN:** Both empires intensify their hunt; military leaders see her as weapon; peace activists see her as symbol; her safety becomes exponentially more difficult.
    *   **IF:** The players ally with The Will or other bounty hunters.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to freelance networks; bounty is lifted or reduced; but they've made enemies of whoever hired those hunters.
    *   **IF:** The players spend significant time with one culture (Skyfire or Rootbound).
    *   **THEN:** They understand that culture better; gain allies within it; but the other culture becomes more hostile; affects Hazel's development.
    *   **IF:** Alana and Marko's relationship is strained or broken.
    *   **THEN:** The party must deal with emotional fallout; Hazel is affected; the symbolic power of their union is damaged; both empires see opportunities to reclaim them separately.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to raise Hazel in one culture over the other.
    *   **THEN:** She develops powers from that culture more strongly; that empire offers reduced hostility; the other empire becomes implacably opposed.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to keep Hazel neutral from both cultures.
    *   **THEN:** She develops balanced powers; both empires remain hostile; peace movement rallies to their cause; ending requires third path.
    *   **IF:** The players facilitate a meeting between moderate leaders from both empires.
    *   **THEN:** Secret peace negotiations begin; hardliners from both sides attempt to sabotage it; the party becomes targets for extremists.
    *   **IF:** The war is ended through peace.
    *   **THEN:** Cultural exchange begins slowly; Hazel becomes symbol of new era; former hardliners form terrorist groups; party must help navigate fragile peace.
    *   **IF:** The war is ended through one side's victory.
    *   **THEN:** Hazel is claimed by victorious side; losing side faces occupation or genocide; party must live with consequences of enabling conquest.
    *   **IF:** The party chooses to keep running forever.
    *   **THEN:** They become legendary fugitives; Hazel grows up in hiding; the war continues unabated; bittersweet ending of family survival but no greater change.
