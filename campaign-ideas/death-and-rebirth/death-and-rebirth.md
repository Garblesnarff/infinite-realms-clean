# Death and Rebirth
## "Every Ending Is a Beginning Wearing a Mask"

### Campaign Overview

The party dies in the opening scene. Killed by forces they barely comprehend, they awaken in the Gray Wastes—the realm of Death, where all things come to end so they may begin again. Here, death is not punishment but transformation. The skeletal Lord Terminus welcomes them not as victims but as students, explaining that they have entered the most profound mystery: the cycle of death and rebirth that sustains all existence.

But something is wrong with the cycle. Souls are getting stuck between death and rebirth, creating undead abominations. The Judgement Realm, where souls should be evaluated and reborn, has gone silent. No angel trumpets call. No resurrection occurs. The dead pile up in the Gray Wastes, unable to move forward. Lord Terminus tasks the party with a sacred mission: journey through the transformational realms of Death and Judgement, discover why rebirth has ceased, and restore the eternal cycle.

As the party investigates, they discover a horrifying truth—someone is deliberately breaking the cycle, hoarding souls to achieve immortality. The necromancer-god Eternal seeks to live forever by preventing anyone from being reborn, creating an empire of undeath. To stop Eternal and restore the cycle, the party must embrace death in all its forms, die again and again, transforming with each ending until they achieve the ultimate rebirth.

### Core Themes

- **Transformation Through Endings**: Growth requires letting go of what was
- **The Natural Cycle**: Death as necessary part of life
- **Fear vs. Acceptance**: Fighting death vs. embracing transformation
- **Identity Across Lives**: What persists through death and rebirth
- **Necessary Sacrifice**: Giving up the self to become something greater
- **Undeath as Stagnation**: Refusing to change is the true death
