# Death and Rebirth - World-Building Specification

## The Cosmic Cycle

### How Death Works
Death is a realm and a process. When beings die, their consciousness transfers to the Gray Wastes where Lord Terminus guides them through transformation. The body remains in the mortal realm while the soul processes the ending in Death's domain.

### The Transformation Process
1. **Arrival**: Soul enters Gray Wastes through Skeletal Gates
2. **Processing**: Review of life, understanding of ending
3. **Dissolution**: Ego and identity begin breaking down in transformation pools
4. **Judgement**: Angel evaluates worthiness and determines rebirth form
5. **Rebirth**: Soul returns to life, transformed and renewed

### When It's Broken
Currently, steps 4-5 are blocked. Souls can arrive and process but cannot be judged or reborn. They accumulate in the Boundary, going mad from stagnation.

## The Realms

### The Gray Wastes (Death's Domain)
- Twilight realm of gentle endings
- Landscape of erosion and potential

## Historical Timeline

**The First Death**: Original mortality, accepted naturally, cycle began simply
**Age of Balance**: Death and rebirth worked smoothly for eons
**Eternal's Mortal Life**: Born, lived in terror of death, studied necromancy
**The Breaking**: Eternal achieved immortality, began hoarding souls
**The Silence**: Angel of Judgement captured, rebirth ceased
**Present**: Cycle failing, party arrives, restoration needed

## Philosophy and Culture

### Death Realm Philosophy
- Endings are necessary
- Change is growth
- Clinging creates suffering
- Let go to become more
- The cycle sustains existence

### Undeath Empire Philosophy
- Change is loss
- Preservation is victory
- Death is the enemy
- Immortality is achievement
- The cycle can be escaped

### Judgement Approach
- Every soul has worth
- All deserve evaluation
- Fairness in rebirth assignment
- No soul truly ends
- Transformation is divine gift

## The Undying Question

What makes identity persist across death and rebirth? If you transform completely, are you still you? This philosophical question underlies the campaign. Eternal says preservation is the only way to maintain self. Death says transformation IS self. Judgement evaluates which transformations honor the original soul. Party must decide their answer.

## Mysteries

- Can Death himself die?
- What was the First Death?
- Is the cycle eternal or will it end?
- What happens if no one is reborn?
- Is Eternal right that preservation beats transformation?
- What lies beyond rebirth?
