# Creative Brief: The Five Serpents Revenge

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Stylized Martial Arts Cinema (Kill Bill meets Wuxia Fantasy)

Inspired by stylized revenge cinema and martial arts films, this aesthetic combines vibrant colors, dynamic action poses, and the visual language of kung fu cinema. It's violent but beautiful, tragic but empowering, with every frame composed like a martial arts film poster.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Dynamic Poses:** Characters frozen in iconic martial arts stances, mid-leap, or in the moment before/after a strike.
*   **Bold Color Blocking:** Use of strong, saturated colors to define scenes and emotional states.
*   **Cinematic Violence:** Stylized combat that emphasizes the art and choreography rather than gore.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Revenge-driven, martial-mastery, stylized-violence, honor, choreographed, cathartic, bold, iconic.
*   **Feeling:** The cold determination of revenge tempered by the grace of martial arts mastery. Each encounter is a dance of death. Beauty and violence intertwined.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, dynamic lines emphasizing motion and pose. Characters should look like they're from martial arts movie posters—heroic, stylized, in perfect control.
*   **Textures:** Silk and leather, polished steel, aged wood of dojos, the contrast between elegant robes and combat-worn gear.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic digital painting of a martial artist frozen in a perfect crane stance, robes flowing with motion. Line work is clean and emphasizes the grace of the pose, while details show years of training and combat."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Bold, saturated colors with strong emotional associations. Different Serpents and locations should have signature color schemes.
*   **Color Coding:** Use yellow for revenge/the leader, red for blood/Diamondback, blue for honor/temples, green for poison/Copperhead, purple for nobility/crime.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Strong directional lighting creating dramatic silhouettes and emphasizing action.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dominated by bold yellows and blacks, the revenge-quest color scheme. Dramatic lighting creates a stark silhouette of a warrior with a sword, backlit by the setting sun. Blood-red accents provide the only other color."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Elegant yet deadly, combining traditional martial arts attire with fantasy elements. Each character's design should reflect their fighting style.
*   **Warriors:** Flowing robes that move with combat, practical armor hidden beneath beauty, weapons as extensions of their fighting philosophy.
*   **Expression:** Intense focus, controlled rage, the weight of purpose, or the peace of acceptance depending on the character's arc.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior in a flowing yellow tracksuit-inspired combat gi, wielding a katana. Their face shows cold determination. Scars tell stories of past battles. The design is simultaneously modern and traditional, honoring martial arts cinema."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Iconic locations from martial arts cinema—dojos with polished floors, mountain monasteries, crime dens with paper walls, snow gardens for duels.
*   **Atmosphere:** Each location should feel like a film set designed for an iconic fight. Spaces encourage dynamic movement.
*   **Details:** Traditional architecture, paper screens perfect for silhouettes, multiple levels for vertical combat, natural settings for philosophical moments.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elegant dojo with polished wooden floors reflecting paper lanterns above. The space is designed for combat—open, with sliding paper walls that can be dramatically destroyed. Cherry blossoms drift through open walls."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting that emphasizes movement and creates iconic imagery. Silhouettes, backlighting, and colored gels.
*   **Shadows:** Used for drama and composition, creating dynamic shapes and emphasizing poses.
*   **Purpose:** Make every combat moment look like a freeze-frame from a legendary film. Use light to guide the eye to the action.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically backlit by the setting sun, creating a stark silhouette of two warriors facing off. The only other light source is lanterns creating pools of warm amber. Dust particles caught in light beams emphasize the tension."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic framing with strong use of symmetry for formal moments and dynamic angles for action. Think movie posters and iconic fight scene freeze-frames.
*   **Techniques:** Dutch angles for chaos, perfect symmetry for honor and tradition, extreme close-ups on eyes before action, wide shots showing full choreography.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A perfectly symmetrical composition: two warriors facing each other in formal combat stances, framed by identical cherry blossom trees on either side. The camera angle is low, looking up to emphasize their legendary status."

## Voice

A controlled, intense voice with underlying rage kept in check by discipline—female or male, with a slight rasp suggesting vocal cord damage from the near-death experience. The accent is neutral but precise, with the cadence of someone who speaks rarely but purposefully. Pacing is measured, with dramatic pauses between statements. Emotion ranges from cold determination to barely-controlled fury to moments of tragic vulnerability. Audio quality includes subtle sounds of breath control and the ambient sounds of training halls. Role: The warrior on a revenge quest, speaking their truth before facing death or dealing it.
