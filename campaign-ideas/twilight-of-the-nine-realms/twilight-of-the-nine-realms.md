## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions)

A five-act epic journey through Norse cosmology as the end times approach.

*   **Act I — The Winter That Doesn't End (Sessions 1–4):** Fimbulwinter descends upon Midgard. The party discovers they're marked by the Norns and must seek answers in Asgard. They learn the signs of Ragnarok are manifesting and are tasked with investigating disturbances across the Nine Realms.
*   **Act II — The Broken Chains (Sessions 5–8):** They discover Loki is orchestrating events from his prison, attempting to break free early. The party must navigate Jotunheim and Svartalfheim, forging alliances with dwarves and confronting giants while investigating threats to the divine order.
*   **Act III — The Serpent Stirs (Sessions 9–12):** Jormungandr awakens in the ocean depths. The party must journey to Helheim to seek knowledge from the dead, face the goddess Hel herself, and discover that some gods are secretly preparing for Ragnarok by hoarding power rather than defending the realms.
*   **Act IV — The God-Betrayer (Sessions 13–16):** Loki escapes and begins gathering his armies of the dead and monstrous. The party must rally the gods, einherjar, and mortal heroes to Asgard's defense while confronting the reality that some prophesied events cannot be stopped—only met with courage.

Their choices throughout the campaign determine which gods survive, what is preserved after the world-fire, and whether a new world can grow from Yggdrasil's roots.

## Central Conflict

Fate versus free will in the face of inevitable apocalypse. The prophecy of Ragnarok says the gods will fall and the world will burn, but the party's existence was not foretold. They represent the possibility that destiny can be changed—not by avoiding the end, but by shaping what comes after. The gods are bound by prophecy and pride; the party is not. Their choices can determine which gods survive, what knowledge is preserved, and whether the cycle of violence continues or breaks.
