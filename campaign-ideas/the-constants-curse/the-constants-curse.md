**Campaign Type / Genre:** Gothic Survival Horror / Sanity Management / Dimensional Prison / Dark Whimsy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions

**Tone (keywords):** whimsical-yet-dark, unsettling, resource-scarce, sanity-eroding, cyclical nightmare
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party awakens in the Constant, a nightmarish pocket dimension where the laws of nature are twisted into a gothic, Tim Burton-esque parody of reality. To survive, they must gather strange resources, craft bizarre contraptions, and manage their deteriorating sanity as shadows whisper and monstrous creatures emerge from the darkness. The Constant is ruled by the Shadow King, an entity that feeds on despair, and the party must endure increasingly harsh seasonal cycles—culminating in the Eternal Winter, when the Deerclops and worse nightmares hunt them. Escape requires unlocking the secrets of the ancient Gateways scattered across the land and confronting the Shadow King in his throne room at the heart of the Nightmare dimension.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A cyclical struggle through increasingly harsh seasons, leading to a final confrontation with the source of the curse.

*   **Act I — Autumn & First Winter (Levels 3–7):** The party awakens in the Constant during Autumn, a relatively mild season. They must learn to survive by gathering food (berries, carrots, rabbits), crafting tools and weapons, and building a base before Winter arrives. They discover that their sanity is fragile here—darkness, strange creatures, and certain foods erode it, causing hallucinations and shadow attacks. The first Winter tests them with freezing temperatures and the arrival of the Deerclops, a massive, one-eyed abomination. They must either fight it, flee, or distract it to survive. They discover the first Gateway, an ancient portal structure that hints at escape.
*   **Act II — Spring & Summer (Levels 8–11):** Having survived Winter, the party faces new challenges. Spring brings constant rain, flooding, and aggressive tree guardians. Summer brings scorching heat and spontaneous fires, forcing them to stay cool or risk heatstroke. They explore deeper into the Constant, discovering other trapped souls (some friendly, some mad), and learn about Maxwell, the previous ruler, who made a deal with the Shadow King and created the Constant. They activate Gateways by finding rare artifacts (Wooden Things, Shadow Essences), which reveal that escape requires five Gateways to be activated in a specific pattern.
*   **Act III — The Eternal Winter & The Nightmare (Levels 12–13):** With most Gateways activated, the Constant shifts into its final phase: the Eternal Winter, a never-ending blizzard where even the bravest freeze and starve. The Shadow King sends his most powerful servants—the Terrorbeak, the Crawling Horror, and finally, the Ancient Fuelweaver. The party must gather the final Gateway components from the most dangerous areas (the Ruins, the Atrium), confront the Shadow King in the Nightmare dimension, and choose: defeat him to free everyone (a near-impossible fight), or take his place on the Nightmare Throne, becoming the new warden of the Constant and allowing everyone else to escape.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "Awakening in the Constant"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Survival Basics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens in a strange, shadowy forest. The colors are muted, the trees are twisted, and everything has a hand-drawn, gothic aesthetic.
    *   They have nothing. They must quickly gather basic resources: twigs, grass, flint, and berries.
    *   As night falls, they realize the darkness itself is deadly. Without a fire, shadow hands emerge to attack them, dealing necrotic damage and draining sanity.
**Escalation:** One party member's sanity drops dangerously low, causing them to see shadow creatures that aren't there. They may attack allies or flee in terror.

### Sessions 2-4 — "Building the Hearth"
*   **Focus:** Base Building / Crafting / Sanity Management
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party establishes a base camp, building a fire pit, chests for storage, and crude walls to keep out hostile creatures (Hounds, Spiders).
    *   They learn to craft Science Machines and Alchemy Engines, unlocking new recipes for better tools, armor, and sanity-restoration items (Top Hats, Garlands, Taffy).
    *   They encounter their first friendly NPC: Wilson, a trapped gentleman scientist who teaches them the basics of the Constant's rules.
    *   They must manage hunger, sanity, and health constantly. Eating strange foods (Monster Meat, Mandrakes) has unpredictable effects.
**Escalation:** The first Hound attack. A pack of red-eyed, demonic hounds descends on the base. The party must fight or lure them away.

### Sessions 5-7 — "The Coming of Winter"
*   **Focus:** Resource Preparation / Boss Encounter
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Wilson warns that Winter is approaching. The party must stockpile food, fuel for fires, and warm clothing (Winter Hats, Thermal Stones) or they will freeze.
    *   Winter arrives. The world becomes a frozen wasteland. Food is scarce, and the cold drains health rapidly.
    *   On the 30th day of Winter, the Deerclops arrives—a towering, cyclops-like beast that destroys structures and hunts the party. They hear its bellowing roar from afar.
    *   The party must decide: fight the Deerclops (very dangerous at this level), lead it away from the base, or hide and hope it leaves.
**Escalation:** If the base is poorly defended, the Deerclops destroys it, forcing the party to rebuild from scratch in the frozen wilderness.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Wilson — The Gentleman Scientist** — *The Guide*
    *   **Role:** A fellow trapped soul, one of the first to arrive in the Constant. He helps the party understand the rules.
    *   **Personality:** Polite, nervous, and overly optimistic despite the circumstances. He grows a magnificent beard in Winter (which keeps him warm) and is obsessed with science and reason.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Wilson knows the truth: he was tricked here by Maxwell, a deceptive "magic man." He fears he can never truly escape, and this fear is eroding his sanity.

2.  **Maxwell — The Puppet Master** — *The Fallen Tyrant*
    *   **Role:** The former ruler of the Constant, now freed from the Nightmare Throne but forever bound to the dimension.
    *   **Personality:** Sarcastic, bitter, and deeply guilty. He made a deal with the Shadow King for power and immortality, but it backfired, trapping him on the throne for decades. Now free, he wanders the Constant, offering cryptic advice.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He can manipulate shadows and is still partially connected to the Nightmare. He wants the party to defeat the Shadow King so he can finally die, but he won't admit it.

3.  **The Shadow King** — *The Nightmare Sovereign*
    *   **Role:** The entity that rules the Constant, feeding on the fear and despair of those trapped within.
    *   **Personality:** Incomprehensible and malevolent. It speaks through shadows, whispers, and nightmares. It delights in tormenting souls and turning them against each other.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Shadow King cannot exist without subjects to feed on. If the Constant is empty, it will starve and cease to exist. This is why it always leaves an "escape" option—the Nightmare Throne—to ensure a new warden takes over.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Meadow (Starting Zone):** A relatively safe, grassy area with plentiful berries and rabbits. The party's first base is usually here.
2.  **The Pig Village:** A settlement of pig-men who are friendly by day but transform into savage Were-Pigs during full moons.
3.  **The Ruins:** Ancient, underground structures filled with deadly traps, Clockwork monsters, and rare treasures.
4.  **The Atrium:** The deepest part of the Ruins, where the Ancient Fuelweaver, a skeletal necromancer, guards the final Gateway component.
5.  **The Nightmare Dimension:** A twisted, shadowy realm where the Shadow King resides on the Nightmare Throne.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about enduring an endless cycle of suffering while clinging to hope and sanity. It captures the dark whimsy of *Don't Starve*: a world that is simultaneously charming and horrifying, where even the smallest mistake can be fatal. The central conflict is the party's struggle against the oppressive, cyclical nature of the Constant, where seasons turn, monsters spawn, and sanity frays. Escape is possible, but it requires sacrifice, cleverness, and the willingness to face the source of all nightmares.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity as a Resource**
*   Every character has a Sanity score (starts at 100, max 200 with items).
*   Sanity is drained by: being in darkness, encountering certain monsters, eating "bad" food, witnessing horrific events, or being near shadow creatures.
*   Sanity is restored by: wearing fancy clothing (top hats, garlands), eating specific foods (taffy, jerky), sleeping in a tent, or picking flowers.
*   **Low Sanity Effects:** Below 50 Sanity, shadow creatures (Terrorbeak, Crawling Horror) become visible and attack. Below 25, hallucinations occur, imposing disadvantage on Perception and Insight checks.

### 2. **Seasonal Survival**
*   The Constant cycles through four seasons, each with unique challenges:
    *   **Autumn:** Mild. Good for gathering and preparing.
    *   **Winter:** Freezing. Characters take cold damage without heat sources or warm clothing. Food is scarce.
    *   **Spring:** Rainy. Constant wet debuff (disadvantage on fire-making). Aggressive tree guardians spawn.
    *   **Summer:** Scorching. Characters take heat damage without cooling items. Fires spontaneously ignite, destroying resources.

### 3. **Hunger & Health**
*   Hunger depletes over time. At 0, characters begin losing Health.
*   Health is regained slowly through rest and specific foods. Dying means respawning at a Meat Effigy or Touch Stone (if built/found), but with penalties.

### 4. **Crafting Complexity**
*   The Constant requires constant crafting. Recipes are discovered through experimentation or taught by NPCs.
*   Key crafted items: Science Machine (unlocks basic recipes), Alchemy Engine (advanced recipes), Crock Pot (combines foods into better meals), Ice Box (preserves food), Thermal Stone (heat/cold management).

### 5. **The Gateway Puzzle**
*   To escape, the party must find and activate five Gateways by inserting specific, rare components (e.g., a Wooden Thing piece, a Shadow Essence, a Living Log).
*   Each Gateway is in a dangerous location, guarded by powerful enemies or environmental hazards.
*   Activating all five opens a portal to the Nightmare Dimension for the final confrontation.
