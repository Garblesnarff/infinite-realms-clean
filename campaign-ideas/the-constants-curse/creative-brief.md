# Creative Brief: The Constant's Curse

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Tim Burton-esque Survival (Don't Starve-inspired)

Inspired by the dark, whimsical aesthetic of *Don't Starve*, blending Tim Burton's gothic art style with survival horror. This style emphasizes hand-drawn, sketchy linework, muted colors, and a world that is simultaneously charming and deeply unsettling.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Hand-Drawn Gothic:** Everything should look hand-sketched with visible, energetic linework. Nothing is perfectly smooth or realistic.
*   **Dark Whimsy:** Cute and creepy coexist. A rabbit can be adorable, but also have unsettling, too-large eyes. A tree can be charming, but also twisted and menacing.
*   **Muted, Desaturated Colors:** The world is drained of vibrant color, using grays, browns, dark greens, and pale yellows, with occasional pops of red or shadow-black.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Whimsical-yet-dark, unsettling, resource-scarce, sanity-eroding, gothic, hand-drawn, cyclical nightmare.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of being trapped in a twisted storybook, where everything is slightly wrong. The mood is tense but tinged with dark humor.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Sketchy, energetic, hand-drawn lines. Thick outlines for characters and objects, with cross-hatching for shading.
*   **Forms:** Exaggerated, slightly distorted proportions. Characters have large heads, thin limbs. Creatures are both cute and grotesque. Trees are gnarled and twisted.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hand-drawn, gothic illustration in the style of Don't Starve. Sketchy, energetic black ink lines define the forms. Cross-hatching creates shading. The proportions are slightly exaggerated and whimsical."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated, and monochromatic with occasional color accents.
*   **Primary Colors:** Grays, charcoal blacks, sepia browns, sickly greens, pale yellows.
*   **Accent Colors:** Deep reds (blood, eyes), shadow-black (nightmare creatures), the warm orange glow of firelight.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted, desaturated color palette dominated by grays, charcoal blacks, and sepia browns. The only bright color is the warm orange glow of a campfire in the center, surrounded by deep, oppressive shadows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers reimagined in a Tim Burton style—thin, elongated limbs, large eyes, exaggerated features.
*   **Constant Natives:** Wilson has a pompadour and grows a comically large beard. Maxwell is tall, gaunt, and dressed in a Victorian suit. Creatures are adorable-yet-wrong (spider-pigs, cyclops deer).
*   **Expression:** Wide, expressive eyes showing fear, madness, or determination. Mouths are often simple lines or exaggerated grimaces.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer in the style of Don't Starve: thin, elongated limbs, a large, expressive head with wide, fearful eyes. They wear tattered, Victorian-era clothing and clutch a crudely crafted spear. Their proportions are exaggerated and whimsical."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Hand-drawn, sketchy landscapes with twisted trees, rolling hills, and ominous shadows.
*   **Atmosphere:** The world feels like a living storybook illustration—charming but deeply wrong. Shadows are long and dark. The sky is often overcast or twilight.
*   **Details:** Twisted, leafless trees, scattered bones, crudely built structures (stick walls, stone fire pits), ominous clouds, and the ever-present threat of encroaching darkness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hand-drawn, gothic landscape in the style of Don't Starve. Twisted, bare trees with gnarled branches fill the foreground. The ground is covered in dry grass and scattered bones. The sky is a muted, overcast gray. Long, dark shadows stretch across the land."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast between light and shadow. Cross-hatching and stippling create texture and depth.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, oppressive shadows that seem to move. Firelight creates warm, safe pools of light in an otherwise dark world.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the importance of fire (safety) and the danger of darkness (shadow monsters).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the warm, flickering glow of a campfire. Deep, cross-hatched shadows stretch into the background, hinting at unseen horrors lurking just beyond the light."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Centered, symmetrical compositions for calm moments (a character by a fire). Tilted, asymmetrical compositions for moments of tension (a monster approaching).
*   **Techniques:** Use exaggerated perspective and foreshortening to make threats seem larger and more imposing. Frame characters against vast, empty landscapes to emphasize isolation. Show the contrast between light (safety) and dark (danger).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tilted, asymmetrical composition in the style of Don't Starve. In the foreground, a tiny adventurer with wide, fearful eyes holds up a torch. In the background, a massive, one-eyed Deerclops looms, its form sketched with thick, ominous lines, dwarfing the character."

## Voice

A theatrical, male voice with a slight British accent, reminiscent of an old-timey radio announcer or narrator from a 1930s horror serial. The pacing is deliberate and dramatic, with pregnant pauses for effect. The emotion is a mix of dark amusement and genuine unease, as if the narrator finds the horrors both entertaining and disturbing. Audio quality has a slight vintage radio crackle, adding to the old-world, storybook atmosphere. Role: The voice of the Constant itself, or a sardonic narrator recounting the party's doomed struggle.
