# The Good Giant's War - World Building Specification

## World History
**Ancient Era**: Giants and humans coexisted peacefully. Giants protected humans, humans shared knowledge.

**The Hunger**: Unknown event (curse, famine, corruption) caused some giants to begin eating humans. Those who refused were exiled. Society split.

**500 Years Ago**: The Peacemaker tried to stop man-eating, failed, was imprisoned in The Fissure. Man-Eaters became dominant culture.

**Present**: Only BFG remains openly good giant. Others hide or isolated. Man-Eaters hunt nightly.

## Geography
**Giant Country**: Hidden realm, accessible through specific mountain pass or magic. Terrain hostile—rocky, barren, little natural food (why Snozzcumbers exist). Man-Eaters' territory central. BFG lived on periphery.

**Dream Country**: Adjacent magical realm, accessed through special rituals. Sky filled with dreams. Surreal physics—time flows differently, gravity optional, imagination influences reality.

**Human Kingdoms**: Standard D&D medieval fantasy. Multiple nations, but Man-Eater threat unites them (common enemy).

**The Fissure**: Deep canyon in Giant Country where rebels imprisoned. Contains ancient giant artifacts, history.

## Magic System
**Dream Magic** (Unique School):
- **Capture**: Dreams exist physically in Dream Country. Must hunt/collect them.
- **Storage**: Dreams kept in bottles. Fragile—breaking releases dream into nearby minds.
- **Application**: Blow dream toward target using dream-trumpet. Target experiences dream vividly.
- **Effects**: Good dreams heal, inspire, give visions. Nightmares terrify, exhaust, drive mad.
- **Creation**: Advanced technique—craft dreams from imagination (difficult).

**Giant Magic** (Innate Racial):
- All giants have minor magical abilities (enhanced strength beyond size, durability, long life).
- Good giants often develop specialized magic (BFG's dream affinity, Gardener's plant growth, Singer's beast speech).

**Corruption**: Theory that Man-Eaters' behavior is magically induced. Possible cure exists but requires breaking ancient curse.

## Inhabitants
**Man-Eaters** (9 Named in Canon, Expandable):
- Fleshlumpeater (leader, cruelest)
- Bonecruncher
- Meatdripper
- Gizzardgulper
- Maidmasher
- Manhugger
- Childchewer
- Butcherboy
- Bloodbottler
- Others as needed

**Good Giants**: BFG, Gentle Gardener, Silent Singer, Small Thinker, The Peacemaker, potentially more discovered during campaign.

**Humans**: Various kingdoms. Queen Gloriana represents enlightened ruler. Others more skeptical/corrupt.

## Cultural Details
**Man-Eater Society**: Brutal hierarchy. Strongest leads. Cruelty valued. No art, no philosophy, only hunting and eating. Language crude.

**BFG's Culture** (Remnant of Old Giant Way): Values dreams, stories, kindness. Vegetarian (Snozzcumbers). Pacifist by preference, warrior if necessary. Speaks uniquely (malapropisms hint at different language structure).

**Giant Measurements**: Use unique units—
- Distance: "Squiggling miles," "whizzpopping leagues"
- Time: "Witching hour," "dawn-dance"
- Volume: "Globberfuls," "whizzfizzing amounts"

**Dream Types**:
- Golden: Pure good
- Scarlet: Nightmares
- Blue: Sad but beautiful
- Green: Prophetic
- Multi-color: Complex, unpredictable

## Key Secrets
- BFG was originally named something else, changed name after choosing to be good (symbolic rebirth)
- Man-Eaters were cursed by ancient human mage (revenge for unknown giant crime)
- Dream Country is sentient, chooses BFG as champion
- Snozzcumbers are magically sustained—only food that grows in Giant Country (test of character: will you eat disgusting food or hunt humans?)
- Other dimensions exist beyond Dream Country (potential sequel hooks)
- Fleshlumpeater has eaten giant who opposed him (cannibalism even among Man-Eaters)
- Human kingdoms have attempted genocide against ALL giants (morally gray past)
- Giants age slowly—BFG is 400+, Fleshlumpeater 350+, Peacemaker 900+
- Original giants were created by dreams (metaphysical origin)

## Appendix
**BFG's Vocabulary**: Malapropisms follow patterns—
- "Human beans" (beings)
- "Delumptious" (delicious)
- "Whoppsy-whiffling" (whoppping)
- "Sumpthums" (something)
- Players encouraged to create own

**Frobscottle Recipe** (In-Game):
- Carbonation goes down instead of up
- Tastes like vanilla + raspberries + cream + violets
- Causes whizzpoppers (bubbles exit opposite direction from carbonation)
- Effects: Buoyancy, flight, extreme happiness

**Dream Crafting**: Mechanics for players to create custom dreams. Imagination check + materials (dream fragments) = unique spell effects.

This world is **fairy-tale made D&D mechanics**—whimsical surface, dark undercurrent, clear morality, hope always present. BFG's kindness isn't weakness—it's revolutionary act in cruel world. Party helps prove goodness can win.
