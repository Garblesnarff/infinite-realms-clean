# The Good Giant's War - Creative Brief

## Visual Art Direction
**Style**: Roald Dahl's illustration style meets fairy-tale fantasy. Quentin Blake's scratchy, expressive line work as inspiration. Whimsical but with underlying darkness.

**BFG Design**: Large ears, kind wrinkled face, shabby clothing (patched), gentle eyes. Contrast with Man-Eaters (brutal features, scarred, cruel expressions).

**Dream Visualization**: Glowing orbs with swirling colors—golden good dreams, dark purple nightmares, mixed colors for complex dreams. Bottled in jars.

**Giant Country**: Barren, rocky, oppressive. BFG's cave (before destruction) colorful exception—warm, cluttered, dream bottles everywhere creating rainbow light.

## Music and Sound Design
**BFG Theme**: Warm, gentle, woodwinds and strings, slightly sad but hopeful.

**Man-Eaters**: Harsh percussion, discordant brass, grinding sounds, heavy footsteps.

**Dream Country**: Ethereal, magical, wind chimes, harp, sense of floating.

**Combat**: Mix of whimsy (Frobscottle sounds, comedic floating) and genuine danger.

## Voice Acting
**BFG**: Elderly, warm, malapropism-filled ("What a whoppsy-splunkers idea!" "Don't be so absurdulous!"). Kind but occasionally firm. Mark Rylance in Spielberg film is perfect reference.

**Fleshlumpeater**: Deep, cruel, intelligent menace. Enjoys own cruelty. Articulate (contrast with BFG).

**Other Good Giants**: Each distinct personality through voice—Gardener philosophical, Singer wordless humming, Thinker nervous rambling.

## Atmosphere
**Tonal Balance**: Whimsy and danger coexist. BFG's malapropisms bring levity, but Man-Eaters represent real threat. Don't undercut darkness, but don't lose charm.

**Roald Dahl Tone**: Children's literature that respects readers—doesn't shy from darkness but finds hope and humor. Adults can appreciate depth.

This campaign should feel like **Roald Dahl novel made playable**—charming, dark, hopeful, linguistically playful, morally clear but thoughtful.
