# Creative Brief: Guardians of the Last Light

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Mythic Science Fantasy (Destiny-inspired)

Inspired by Destiny's unique blend of science fiction and fantasy—a style that presents advanced technology with mythical, almost magical qualities. This style captures both the sleek sci-fi of Golden Age remnants and the mystical, paracausal nature of Light and Darkness.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Mythic Technology:** Advanced technology should feel ancient, powerful, and almost religious.
*   **Light and Dark:** Emphasize glowing Light effects and ominous Darkness manifestations.
*   **Cosmic Scale:** Show the vast scope of space, massive alien architectures, and god-like beings.

## Voice

A resonant, inspirational voice with gravitas and hope. The tone is mythic and legendary, speaking of immortal warriors and cosmic battles, yet grounded in the weight of eternal duty. Slight echo suggesting vast spaces—the Last City or cosmic voids. The emotion balances triumph with the burden of resurrection and endless war. Audio quality is pristine with subtle sci-fi processing. Role: The voice of a Ghost companion, or a historian recording the legends of Guardians.
