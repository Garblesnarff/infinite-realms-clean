**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Humanity's Golden Age ended when the Collapse came, and the mysterious sphere called the Traveler fell silent above the Last City. The players are Guardians—undead warriors resurrected by Ghosts, small AI constructs made from the Traveler's Light. They wield paracausal powers that defy physics and cannot truly die, making them humanity's last defense. They must fight alien threats, uncover the mystery of the Darkness that opposes the Light, and ultimately choose which cosmic force—if either—deserves their allegiance.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 17+ sessions)

A tale of resurrection, cosmic war, and the burden of immortal guardianship.

*   **Act I — Rise of the Guardian (Sessions 1–6):** The party is resurrected by their Ghosts in the ruins of Old Earth. They must fight through the Fallen alien scavengers to reach the Last City. There, they join the Vanguard and learn they are pawns in an ancient war between Light and Darkness that predates humanity.
*   **Act II — The Hive Gods (Sessions 7–12):** The party ventures to the Moon to stop Crota, a Hive god of destruction. They discover the Hive worship the Darkness through a philosophy of Sword Logic—only the strong deserve to exist. They must navigate the World's Grave, fight through hell-moons and dreadnoughts, and ultimately slay gods.
*   **Act III — The Witness (Sessions 13–17+):** The party learns the truth: both Light and Darkness are tools, neither wholly good nor evil. The true enemy is the Witness, a being seeking to use the Darkness to achieve the "Final Shape"—a universe of absolute stasis. The Guardians must master both Light and Dark powers, unite warring alien factions, and confront the Witness in a battle beyond reality.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of resurrection and purpose, the nature of good and evil, and whether endless struggle or eternal peace is preferable. The central conflict evolves from defending humanity to choosing what kind of universe should exist.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Guardian Resurrection**
*   When killed, Guardians resurrect automatically if their Ghost is safe (once per short rest).
*   If the Ghost is threatened, resurrection requires a death saving throw from an ally to stabilize the Ghost.
*   Certain enemies (Hive magic, Taken power) can inflict "Final Death"—no resurrection.
*   This makes Guardians fearless but creates dramatic tension around Ghost safety.

### 2. **Light Powers (Subclasses)**
*   Guardians choose a class and element:
    *   Titan (Tank): Solar (fire/healing), Arc (lightning/melee), Void (shields/defense).
    *   Hunter (DPS): Solar (blades/precision), Arc (speed/daggers), Void (stealth/bow).
    *   Warlock (Mage): Solar (healing/support), Arc (chain-lightning/mobility), Void (debuffs/void bombs).
*   Powers recharge on short rests and have daily limited uses.
*   Later, Darkness subclasses become available (Stasis-ice, Strand-psychic threads).

### 3. **Sword Logic**
*   Hive enemies become stronger by killing. Each Guardian they kill permanently increases their stats.
*   This creates urgency—allowing Hive to farm kills makes them exponentially dangerous.
*   Conversely, killing Hive champions using their own Sword Logic grants temporary power boosts.

### 4. **Paracausal Loot**
*   Weapons and armor can have "paracausal" properties that defy normal rules.
*   Examples: A gun that creates ammo from nothing, armor that heals allies when you die, grenades that rewind time.
*   Loot rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Exotic (one equipped at a time).

### 5. **Darkness Temptation**
*   Using Darkness powers grants powerful abilities but accumulates Corruption.
*   High Corruption grants bonuses but risks losing control or being contacted by the Witness.
*   Players must balance power with the risk of becoming what they fight.
