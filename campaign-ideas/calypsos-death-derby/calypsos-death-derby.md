## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of vehicular carnage, twisted wishes, and confronting a devil's game.

*   **Act I — Enter the Tournament (Sessions 1-6):** The party receives mysterious invitations to Twisted Metal, each promising their heart's desire. They build war machines and compete in preliminary rounds across the city, learning the brutal rules: destroy all opponents or die trying. They discover other contestants' tragic backstories and wishes, and that previous winners are mysteriously absent or have met horrible fates.
*   **Act II — The Wish Curse Investigation (Sessions 7-13):** As advanced competitors, the party fights through increasingly deadly arenas while investigating Calypso's true nature. They discover he's a demon bound by an ancient contract that requires him to grant wishes—but he's compelled to twist them cruelly. Previous winners became living nightmares: one wished for family reunion and was merged with their corpses, another wished for fame and was immortalized as a suffering statue.
*   **Act III — Breaking the Cycle (Sessions 14-20):** The finals approach as the party faces Calypso's champions—previous winners he's enslaved. They must choose: win and risk a twisted wish, lose and die, or find the original contract binding Calypso and end Twisted Metal forever. The final battle occurs simultaneously across multiple realms as reality fragments, requiring them to fight while solving the wish-curse puzzle.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of desperate desires, Faustian bargains, the cost of wishes, and whether ends justify means. It asks: What would you sacrifice for your heart's desire? Can there be victory in a rigged game? Is it better to refuse power or try to use it righteously? The central conflict pits the party's desperate wishes against the certainty that Calypso will twist them into nightmares.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Vehicle Combat System**
*   Vehicles are character extensions with their own HP, armor, and weapon mounts
*   Multiple weapon types: machine guns (rapid fire), missiles (explosive), flamethrowers (area), special weapons
*   Vehicle classes: light (fast/fragile), heavy (slow/armored), special (unique abilities)
*   Ramming attacks, environmental destruction, and vehicle-specific special moves
*   Characters can bail out but are vulnerable on foot

### 2. **Wish Motivation Mechanic**
*   Each character has a desperate wish driving their tournament entry
*   Wish provides mechanical bonus when pursuing it (bonus to actions related to wish motivation)
*   Calypso tempts players with partial wish fulfillment for betrayals or sacrifices
*   Final wish wording determines outcome—must be precise to avoid curse

### 3. **Salvage and Upgrade System**
*   Destroyed enemy vehicles can be looted for parts during arena downtime
*   Weapons, armor, special abilities added to player vehicles
*   Risk/reward: search battlefield for upgrades but expose yourself to remaining enemies
*   Unique weapons from boss vehicles grant signature abilities

### 4. **Arena Hazards**
*   Each battleground has environmental dangers: collapsing structures, fires, floods, electrified zones
*   Hazards can be triggered tactically or avoided strategically
*   Some hazards are Calypso's direct interference—reality warping, sudden rule changes
*   Knowledge of arenas provides advantages in repeat matches

### 5. **The Curse Investigation**
*   Between matches, party can investigate previous winners and Calypso's history
*   Clues gathered affect understanding of wish mechanics and potential solutions
*   Investigation reveals contract loopholes and possible escape routes
*   Time spent investigating is time not upgrading—strategic choice

### 6. **Moral Opponent System**
*   Not all contestants are evil—many are desperate people making impossible choices
*   Party can ally with, betray, or mercy-kill opponents
*   Some opponents can be saved from Calypso's curse if approached correctly
*   Killing sympathetic contestants has psychological consequences

### 7. **Reality Fragmentation**
*   As wish-magic accumulates from investigation, reality becomes unstable
*   Arenas begin overlapping multiple planes—medieval castle merging with modern city
*   Unpredictable effects: gravity shifts, time loops, opponent duplicates
*   Party must adapt combat tactics to reality-warping battlegrounds

### 8. **The Perfect Wish Challenge**
*   Final confrontation includes opportunity to make wish and word it perfectly to avoid curse
*   DM and players must carefully word wishes to close loopholes
*   Alternative: wish for Calypso's freedom (unselfish wish breaks curse logic)
*   Creative solutions rewarded—thinking outside typical "defeat final boss" paradigm
