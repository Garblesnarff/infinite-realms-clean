# Powder Revolution - World-Building Specification

## The Yuki-Onna

**Nature**: Spirit embodiment of winter, snow, and ice across Frostpeak range

**Powers**: Weather control (blizzards, avalanches), snow manipulation, choosing champions, granting cold immunity, crystallizing thoughts into ice

**Personality**: Neither good nor evil—winter personified. Demands respect, rewards excellence, punishes disrespect. Ancient and alien perspective. Values authentic experience over safety.

**Physical Form**: Appears as beautiful pale woman in kimono made of falling snow, but can manifest as storm, avalanche, or gentle snowfall

**History**: Existed since first snowfall on these mountains. Has chosen champions for millennia. Previous conflicts with humans who sought to control weather.

## Glacier Crown Corporation

**Public Face**: "Making winter accessible and safe for everyone through climate innovation"

**Reality**: Attempting to monopolize winter sports by controlling weather, eliminating natural unpredictability

**Leadership**: Director Frost (CEO), board of investors who don't know about spiritual conflict

**Technology**:
- Weather machines (create artificial snow)
- Climate stabilizers (suppress storms)
- Resort infrastructure
- Security forces (ski patrol + PMCs)
- Propaganda network

**Motivation**: Profit primarily, but Frost personally wants revenge on nature for his injuries

## The Powder Collective

**Structure**:
- Atlas (leader)
- Elder Hana (spiritual guide)
- Various rider crews (boarders, skiers, hybrid)
- Support staff (mechanics, medics)

**Operations**: Underground resistance, sabotage missions, preserving sacred descents, training new riders

**Philosophy**: "Respect the mountain, honor the powder, ride with soul"

**Base**: Hidden lodge in backcountry, accessible only by unmarked trail

## Seven Sacred Descents

Each represents aspect of winter and tests rider worthiness:

1. **Peak of Eternity** (Courage): Highest point, complete exposure, tests nerve
2. **Avalanche Run** (Control in Chaos): Surfing deliberate slide
3. **Crystal Forest** (Precision): Weaving through ice formations
4. **Dream Powder** (Surrender): Deep powder requiring trust
5. **Wind Spine** (Balance): Ridge in hurricane winds
6. **Heart of Winter** (Endurance): Underground caves, darkness and cold
7. **Yuki-Onna's Chamber** (Worthiness): Final test in spirit's domain

Completing all seven grants champion status and ability to channel Yuki-Onna's full power.

## Grand Prix Circuit

Seven events in corporate propaganda tour:
1. Qualifier (Alpine slalom)
2. Big Air (jump tricks)
3. Freestyle (terrain park)
4. Boardercross (race with obstacles)
5. Half-pipe (vertical tricks)
6. Freeride (backcountry style)
7. Championship (combined)

Winning all seven while completing Sacred Descents secretly = ultimate challenge

## Magic System

**Snow Magic** (granted by Yuki-Onna):
- **Powder Manipulation**: Shape snow into ramps, paths
- **Avalanche Command**: Summon/control slides
- **Ice Creation**: Rails, jumps, obstacles anywhere
- **Wind Riding**: Enhanced speed via currents
- **Cold Immunity**: Survive extreme temperatures
- **Spirit Vision**: See through storms

**Trick Enhancement**: Each trick type channels different effect (grabs = ice, spins = wind, etc.)

**Limitations**: Blocked by artificial snow, requires natural winter environment, draining with overuse

## Artificial vs Natural Snow

**Natural Snow**:
- Magical, responsive to riders
- Unpredictable but rewarding
- Connected to Yuki-Onna
- Perfect for spiritual growth

**Artificial Snow**:
- Consistent, safe, dead
- Blocks magic access
- Toxic to spirit-touched riders
- Corporate controlled

**Mixed Conditions**: Unstable, dangerous, can cause magical backlash

## Cultural Details

**Rider Culture**:
- Respect for local knowledge
- Sharing fresh tracks ethos
- Secret spots protected
- Mentorship traditions
- Trick naming rights
- Memorial for riders lost to mountains

**Winter Spirituality**:
- First snowfall ceremony
- Equipment blessing rituals
- Avalanche awareness as sacred knowledge
- Respecting mountain's moods
- Understanding winter's cycles

## Equipment

**Snowboards**: Various shapes for different terrain, can be enchanted with frost runes
**Skis**: Twin-tip for tricks, traditional for speed, magical tuning possible
**Safety Gear**: Avalanche beacons (also detect magic), airbags, radios
**Modifications**: Yuki-Onna's blessing carved into equipment grants bonuses
