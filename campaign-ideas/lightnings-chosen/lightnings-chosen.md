# Lightning's Chosen
**The Storm Decides Who Is Worthy**

## Campaign Overview

For centuries, lightning was random—until it learned to choose. Now, across the world, lightning strikes those it deems worthy, granting incredible power but demanding service. The Lightning-Touched become champions of the storm, wielding electrical magic and hearing the Thunder Voice—the collective consciousness of every lightning bolt that ever struck.

The party begins when one or more members are struck and chosen. They wake with crackling power in their veins, silver scars mapping lightning paths across their skin, and a voice in their minds demanding they prove their worth. Other Chosen become allies and rivals in completing the Thunder Trials—divine quests to earn permanent power. But not all Chosen are heroes, and the storm's definition of "worthy" doesn't always align with human morality.

As the campaign progresses, they'll discover the truth: Lightning is conscious, ancient, and at war with the other weather phenomena. Being "chosen" isn't an honor—it's conscription in a celestial conflict. The storm needs champions because it's losing a secret war against the Darkness Between—the void that exists in the space between lightning strikes, and it's growing hungry.

## Core Themes

- **Divine Selection vs. Free Will**: Chosen by power or enslaved by it?
- **Worthiness**: Who decides what makes someone worthy?
- **Power's Price**: Every gift has hooks
- **Champion Culture**: Competition for divine favor
- **Cosmic War**: Pawns in battles between elemental forces
- **Identity**: Are you still yourself when carrying godly power?

## Plot Twists

- Being Chosen isn't honor—it's conscription in ancient war
- "Worthiness" means useful to Lightning, not morally good
- Some Chosen are villains with divine backing
- The Darkness Between isn't evil—it's necessary rest between strikes
- Lightning is losing the war and getting desperate
- One PC was chosen by mistake, has unusual resistance to Thunder Voice
- Rejecting the power is possible but painful

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

Victory: Force treaty between Lightning and Darkness, or embrace service and win war, or successfully rebel and free all Chosen

Defeat: Consumed by power, become Thunder Voice puppets, or Darkness wins and lightning ceases permanently

## Campaign Notes

Explores divine selection, free will vs. predestination, and being used by cosmic forces. Players wield godly power but pay the price of service. The Thunder Voice isn't evil but it's not a friend—it's a general conscripting soldiers. Best with players who enjoy power fantasies with moral complications and don't mind eventually fighting against their power source.
