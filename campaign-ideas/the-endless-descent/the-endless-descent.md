**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The Abyss is a massive chasm descending into the earth—each layer stranger and more dangerous than the last. The party are young Delvers (orphan adventurers) drawn into its depths seeking treasure, lost loved ones, or the Abyss's deepest secret. But the Abyss has a curse: ascending from deep layers causes horrific body transformations and death. The deeper you go, the harder it is to return. The campaign is a one-way journey into wonder and horror, exploring themes of sacrifice, the cost of knowledge, and whether some mysteries should remain buried.

## What "Very High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **The Curse of the Abyss:** Ascending from deep layers causes progressive body horror—bleeding from orifices, organ failure, loss of humanity, death. Going deep enough means you can never return.
*   **Resource Depletion:** Limited supplies, no easy resupply deep in the Abyss. Every resource spent may be irreplaceable.
*   **Escalating Danger:** Each layer is exponentially more dangerous. Early layers are tough; deep layers are nightmare realms.
*   **Body Horror:** Graphic descriptions of curse effects and abyssal creatures. Not for squeamish players.
*   **Permanent Consequences:** Character death is likely. Transformations are permanent. No easy resurrections deep down.
*   **The Point of No Return:** Eventually the party crosses a threshold—they can never go home. Must accept this or die trying to ascend.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 14–17 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Upper Layers (Sessions 1–5):** Party begins as novice Delvers exploring Layers 1-3. Learn the Abyss's beauty and danger, the curse mechanics, and encounter first major mystery—a legendary White Whistle Delver descended years ago and never returned. Party decides to follow her trail deeper.
*   **Act II — The Depths (Sessions 6-11):** Descend through Layers 4-6 where the curse becomes lethal. Encounter horrifying creatures, lost civilizations, and the Abyss's impossible ecology. Discover the White Whistle's fate and the secret of the Abyss—it may be a living organism, and going deeper means becoming part of it.
*   **Act III — The Bottom (Sessions 12-17):** Layer 7 and beyond. The point of no return. The party can never ascend without dying horribly. They must confront the Abyss's heart, ancient secrets, and their own transformations. Multiple endings based on whether they embrace becoming part of the Abyss, sacrifice themselves to escape, or find mythical "Cradle of Greed" that might allow return.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **curiosity versus survival** and **the cost of knowledge**. The Abyss calls to those who seek its secrets, but it demands total sacrifice—your body, your humanity, your life. The party wants to explore, find treasure, or rescue someone, but the curse ensures the deeper you go, the more you lose. Eventually they reach the point where returning means certain death—the Abyss becomes a prison. The campaign questions: is knowledge worth any cost? Should some mysteries remain buried? When you can't go back, how do you move forward? And most powerfully: what are you willing to sacrifice—your body, your friends, your humanity—for the truth?
