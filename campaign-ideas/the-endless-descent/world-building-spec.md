### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Endless Descent**

**1. Core Concept:** The Abyss is a massive chasm with deadly ascending curse. Party are young Delvers descending to find treasure, lost loved ones, or truth. The deeper they go, the harder to return until they reach point of no return and can never go home.

**2. Lore Primer:** The Abyss appeared 1900 years ago, descends at least 20,000m, each layer has unique ecology and dangers, curse prevents ascending (worse in deeper layers), ancient civilization may exist at bottom, relics are remnants of that civilization, White Whistles are legendary Delvers who reached deepest, Delvers are orphans trained from childhood.

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Delvers (Players):** Orphan adventurers exploring the Abyss.
*   **The Orphanage/Training Institution:** Raises Delvers; exploitative but necessary.
*   **White Whistles:** Legendary solo explorers of deepest layers.
*   **The Abyss Itself:** May be living organism or alien entity.
*   **Natives of Deep Layers:** Creatures and hollows born in darkness.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Lyza (lost legend), Reg (Abyss-born), Ozen (hollow mentor), Bondrewd (mad scientist), Nanachi (blessed survivor).
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Delver," "Abyss Creature," "Hollow," "Orphan," "Relic Dealer."

**5. Locations:** Surface town, each of 7+ layers (distinct ecosystems), Ozen's outpost, Bondrewd's Ido Front, ancient ruins, the theoretical bottom.

**6. Triggers:**
*   **IF ascend from deep layer:** Curse triggers based on depth.
*   **IF reach Layer 6/7:** Point of no return; cannot return to surface.
*   **IF exposed to curse repeatedly:** Risk transformation into hollow.
*   **IF use powerful relic:** Gain power but accelerate curse or corruption.
*   **IF encounter Bondrewd:** Face choice to use his knowledge despite his atrocities.
