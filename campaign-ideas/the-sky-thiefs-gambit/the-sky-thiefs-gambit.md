**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dark Fairy Tale / Heist Fantasy / Giant Horror
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** magic beans, cloud kingdoms, giant's castle, golden treasures, fee-fi-fo-fum, theft versus reclamation, size horror, beanstalk destruction
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The magic beans don't grow random beanstalks but create temporary bridges to the Cloud Kingdom where exiled giants live in poverty after being driven from the surface world centuries ago by human expansion, and "Jack" is actually a serial thief who's been stealing their heirlooms and selling them as magical artifacts while framing giants as monsters. The party, hired to investigate why valuable magical items are flooding the market and causing political instability, discovers the beanstalk operation and must decide whether to stop Jack's profitable theft ring, help giants reclaim their homeland, or broker peace between species before the Cloud Kingdom collapses and giants rain down on the surface world in desperate invasion.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Giants aren't monsters but refugees, Jack is thief not hero.
*   **Size Differential:** Combat and stealth against creatures 20+ feet tall with different physics.
*   **Beanstalk Instability:** Temporary bridges can collapse stranding party in clouds.
*   **Political Consequences:** Success or failure affects giant-human relations for generations.
*   **Resource Theft:** Party must navigate whether "reclaiming" is theft or justice.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–16 sessions)

A four-act heist thriller that questions hero and villain roles.

*   **Act I — The Bean Trade (Sessions 1–4):** Magical artifacts are flooding markets—golden eggs, singing harps, self-playing instruments—causing economic chaos and political tension. The party traces these to "Jack," a charming trader who grows magic beanstalks to reach the Cloud Kingdom above. They either join his latest heist or are hired to stop him. Their first climb reveals the Cloud Kingdom is real—a realm of giants living in poverty, their treasures being systematically stolen. Early encounters show giants are intelligent, civilized, and terrified of the "small thieves" from below.

*   **Act II — The Giant's Perspective (Sessions 5–8):** They learn the true history—centuries ago, giants lived on the surface until human expansion drove them to the clouds through systematic genocide disguised as monster-slaying. The "treasures" Jack steals are family heirlooms and necessary magical items keeping the Cloud Kingdom stable. The golden goose provides food for giant communities. The singing harp maintains gravity magic preventing cloud realm from falling. They meet giant families mourning stolen items and living in increasing desperation. Jack is revealed as descendant of original giant-slayers, continuing "family business" of theft.

*   **Act III — The Crumbling Kingdom (Sessions 9–12):** Jack's theft of the gravity-maintaining harp is causing Cloud Kingdom to destabilize—chunks breaking off and falling to surface world as "sky stones" that devastate human settlements. Giants face choice between slow starvation in clouds or desperate invasion of surface world. Previous beanstalks Jack cut down actually trapped giant rescue parties on surface where they were killed as "monsters." The party discovers Jack's mother isn't impoverished widow but wealthy fence selling stolen goods. Political factions on both sides want war—human nobles seeking giant lands, giant warriors wanting revenge for genocide.

*   **Act IV — Bridge or Battleground (Sessions 13–16):** Final crisis emerges—Cloud Kingdom is falling apart. Giants are preparing desperate descent. Jack plans one final heist for the gravity engine itself (ensuring collapse but making him rich). The party must choose: help Jack complete theft (surface world safe, giants doomed), stop Jack and help giants descend peacefully (requires convincing fearful humans), destroy all beanstalks (trapping giants to die but preventing war), or find third option that addresses historical injustice while preventing mutual destruction. Success means brokering peace between species that have been enemies for generations, returning stolen items while establishing new trade relations, and possibly creating permanent safe bridges between worlds.

## Central Conflict

Theft versus reclamation and the weight of historical injustice. Jack sees himself as hero recovering treasures from monsters, but he's actually stealing from desperate refugees driven to clouds by his ancestors' genocide. Giants want their homeland back but surface world is now full of humans with nowhere else to go. The stolen items seem like treasures to humans but are necessities to giants—the golden goose feeds communities, the harp maintains gravity, each theft brings Cloud Kingdom closer to collapse. The party must navigate whether returning stolen goods justifies displacing current humans, if historical crimes deserve modern reparations, and whether peace is possible when built on genocide.
