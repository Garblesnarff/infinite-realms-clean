## Central Conflict

Unity versus division in a dying world. Barsoom's resources dwindle and civilizations war over scraps while ancient threats loom. Green and red Martians hate each other despite being products of same world. The party, as outsiders, can see past cultural divides. They must prove that cooperation offers survival where division brings extinction. Personal relationships bridge chasms of prejudice. Love, honor, and courage transcend species.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Low Gravity Prowess**
*   Earth-born characters have enhanced Strength and can make incredible leaps. Jump distances tripled, carrying capacity increased.

### 2. **Radium Weapons**
*   Barsoomian firearms use radium bullets and energy. Powerful but rely on ancient technology requiring maintenance.

### 3. **Airship Combat**
*   Battles aboard and between flying ships. Boarding actions, aerial maneuvers, ray gun exchanges.

### 4. **Tribal Honor**
*   Green Martians respect strength and courage above all. Must prove worth through combat and displays of bravery.

### 5. **Royal Politics**
*   Red Martian kingdoms use marriage, alliance, and courtly intrigue. Reputation and honor matter as much as combat prowess.

### 6. **Dying World Resources**
*   Water and air are precious. Control of atmosphere factories and canal systems drives politics.

### 7. **Beast Mastery**
*   Can befriend and ride exotic Martian creatures: thoats (eight-legged steeds), calots (guard hounds), fliers (flying mounts).

## Tone and Atmosphere

Romantic planetary adventure on a dying world. Mars is beautiful but harsh—red deserts under twin moons, ancient ruins testifying to lost grandeur, desperate civilizations clinging to existence. Honor and courage matter more than complex morality. Combat is frequent and personal—swords over guns when possible. Romance is passionate and drives action. The green Martians are savage but capable of honor. The red Martians are civilized but capable of cruelty. Party as outsiders can bridge divides. The world is exotic and dangerous but worth saving.

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Enemy defeated but at terrible cost. Many die including beloved NPCs. Barsoom stabilized but scarred. Party can return to Earth but leave pieces of heart on Mars.

**Bittersweet:** Threat defeated but party must choose—return to Earth and forget Mars, or stay on Barsoom forever, never seeing home again. Love and duty conflict. Either choice brings loss.
