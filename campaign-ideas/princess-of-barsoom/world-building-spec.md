### **World-Building Specification Brief: Princess of Barsoom**

**1. Core Concept:**
Mysteriously transported to dying Mars (Barsoom), party with enhanced strength must navigate alien cultures, rescue princesses, battle in arenas, and unite warring factions against ancient threats on a world of red deserts and lost glory.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Barsoom's history—ancient golden age, slow decline, drying oceans, thinning atmosphere
*   Explain the origin of green and red Martians—same ancestors, divergent evolution
*   Describe the atmosphere factories and canal systems keeping Barsoom habitable
*   Write about ancient races—white Martians (Therns), black Martians, yellow Martians, their rise and fall
*   Detail the egg-laying reproduction of green Martians and emotional suppression culture
*   Explain why low gravity grants Earth-born superhuman abilities

**3. Factions:**
*   **Green Martian Hordes** (Major) - Tribal, nomadic, four-armed warriors, occupy ancient ruins
*   **Helium (Red Martian Kingdom)** (Major) - Twin cities, advanced technology, airship navy
*   **Zodanga (Red Martian Kingdom)** (Major) - Predatory mobile city, expansionist
*   **The Tharks** (Major) - Specific green Martian tribe, more honorable than most
*   **The Holy Therns** (Minor) - Ancient white Martians, religious manipulation
*   **The First Born** (Minor) - Black Martians, hidden in polar regions
