# The Cipher Identity
## *"Who Am I?"*

### Campaign Overview

The players wake up in a burning safehouse with no memories, only fragments: training they don't remember receiving, languages they didn't know they spoke, and skills that feel like muscle memory from another life. Someone powerful enough to erase elite agents' memories is hunting them. Their only clues are a list of names (all crossed out except theirs), a code phrase—"The Chimera Protocol"—and the knowledge that they were onto something world-shattering before their minds were wiped.

Racing across the realm while recovering scattered memories, the party must discover who they were, what they knew, and why multiple intelligence agencies want them dead or captured. Every recovered memory brings them closer to the truth and deeper into danger. They were assassins, spies, and weapons—but whose? And what did they discover that made their own handlers erase them?

This is a campaign about identity, redemption, and uncovering a conspiracy so deep that erasing the best agents was preferable to letting them talk. The question isn't just "Who am I?" but "Do I want to be that person again?"

### Core Themes

- **Identity and Memory**: Who are you without your past?
- **Found Family**: Creating new bonds to replace forgotten ones
- **Paranoia and Trust**: Not knowing who to trust, including yourself
- **Skills Without Context**: Being deadly but not knowing why
- **Fragmented Truth**: Piecing together narrative from scattered clues
- **Redemption**: Atoning for a past you don't remember
- **Becoming vs. Being**: Choosing who you'll be, not who you were

### Plot Twists and Complications

**False Memories**: Some recovered memories are implanted fakes, can't tell which without expertise.

**One Player Was Mole**: In past life, one PC betrayed the others—who and why is revealed dramatically.

**The Handler Lives**: Faked death to protect players, now working against them to keep them safe.

**Chimera Isn't Evil**: Protocol designed to stop worse threat; players were stopping it when wiped.

**Players Aren't Human**: Memory wipe revealed they're constructs, clones, or extraplanar entities.

**The Architect Is Right**: Their dark timeline is real; players failing is what saves the world.

**Recovered Memories Are Curse**: Full recovery brings back psychological trauma that breaks mind.

**Multiple Timelines**: Different players remember different pasts—all real from alternate timelines.

**The Real Enemy**: The ones who wiped them are trying to prevent Architect's manipulation.

**You Were The Villain**: Players' original mission was assassination of innocent reformer.

**Loved Ones Are Assets**: People who "love" them are handlers maintaining cover.

**The Choice Is Lie**: Whether they remember or not, they're still being controlled.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Stop Chimera Protocol activation; prevent assassinations; survive.

**Personal**: Each player resolves identity crisis, decides who they want to be.

**Redemption**: Atone for past actions (if remembered) or prevent them from mattering.

**Truth**: Discover complete truth about past, regardless of cost.

**Freedom**: Break free from all handlers and agencies, become independent.

**Perfect**: Save sleeper agents from activation; stop Architect without killing them; recover only beneficial memories; create new identity that honors past without being bound by it.

### Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic**: Sleeper agents activate, political structure collapses, The Architect wins.

**Personal**: Players lose themselves to recovered identity, cease being individuals.

**Moral**: Commit atrocities while claiming they're different from past-self.

**Broken**: Party fractures from inability to trust each other or themselves.

**Lost**: Never discover truth, remain tools of others forever.

### Campaign Tone

This is Bourne Identity meets Memento in D&D. Paranoid action thriller where every answer creates more questions. Balance intense action (chase scenes, fighting highly-skilled opponents) with psychological horror (who am I? Can I trust my own mind?). Use flashbacks liberally—let players play as their past selves in key moments, creating dramatic irony as they discover who they were.

Every NPC is potentially friend or foe. Every memory could be real or false. Trust is the ultimate currency and the ultimate risk. The campaign should feel like watching a puzzle assemble itself while someone actively tries to destroy it. Fast-paced when running, contemplative when hiding, always tense.

Make identity crisis real by letting players shape their past through choices. The person they were is dead—will they resurrect or replace them?
