*   **Act II — Continue? (Sessions 8-13):** The difficulty escalates as the party faces increasingly powerful Evil Exes, each with unique abilities and themed boss arenas. Between boss fights, they navigate the Toronto indie scene, deal with relationship drama, and compete in major musical showdowns. They unlock special moves, gain extra lives, and discover that defeating enemies grants experience and loot. The party learns about Ramona's past and the mysterious Gideon who controls the League.
*   **Act III — Final Boss (Sessions 14-20):** Gideon reveals his master plan to control Ramona through an implanted chip and dominate the Toronto scene. The party faces the entire League in boss rush mode, unlocks their ultimate power-ups, and must defeat Gideon in his nightclub fortress.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of emotional growth, dealing with partners' pasts, the power of self-respect vs. romantic love, and growing up within indie culture. It asks: Can you fight for love? How do you compete with someone's exes? Is changing for someone the same as self-improvement? The central conflict pits the party's desire for both romance and band success against the League of Evil Exes, with the meta-conflict being about earning happiness through actual growth rather than just defeating obstacles.
