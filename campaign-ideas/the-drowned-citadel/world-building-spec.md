## Causality Chains

### The Splice Cascade
1. Thalassor creates city free from surface regulation
2. Scientists develop Splice without ethical oversight
3. Market competition drives increasingly extreme variants
4. Fontaine monopolizes production through criminal means
5. Civil war erupts over Splice access and power
6. Mass addiction leads to mutations and madness
7. Society collapses into warring factions
8. City infrastructure fails without maintenance
9. Survivors become desperate, morality erodes
10. Party arrives during final death throes

### The Little Sister Economy
1. ADAM discovered in sea slugs on ocean floor
2. Dr. Tenenbaum discovers children's bodies process ADAM efficiently
3. Orphans kidnapped and surgically altered
4. Little Sisters harvest ADAM from corpses
5. Big Daddies created to protect valuable assets
6. ADAM scarcity drives conflict and murder
7. Splicers hunt Little Sisters for ADAM
8. Tenenbaum's guilt drives redemption arc
9. Party must choose harvest (power) vs rescue (morality)
10. Eleanor's final philosophy influenced by party's choices

### The Control Phrase Conspiracy
1. Fontaine funds orphanage, gains access to children
2. Dr. Suchong develops mental conditioning
3. Test subjects respond to trigger phrases
4. Fontaine uses technique on sleeper agents
5. Party unknowingly conditioned before arrival
6. "Would you kindly" activates mission programming
7. Party completes Fontaine's objectives thinking they choose
8. Discovery moment: All choices were illusion
9. Breaking conditioning requires confronting lack of agency
10. Final act: Truly free choices determine ending

## Aquatic Ecology

### The ADAM Ecosystem

**Sea Slugs (Paraplasmid Luminus)**
- Original source of ADAM, endemic to ocean trenches
- Bioluminescent, fist-sized, sessile filter feeders
- Excrete raw ADAM as metabolic byproduct
- Require extreme pressure and specific minerals
- Cannot be raised in captivity successfully

**ADAM Processing Chain**
1. Slugs harvested from trench depths
2. Implanted in human hosts (Little Sisters most efficient)
3. Hosts develop ability to recycle and refine ADAM
4. Refined ADAM harvested for Splice production
5. Used ADAM from corpses can be recycled by Little Sisters
6. Process is horrifically exploitative but incredibly valuable

**Invasive Species**
- Surface creatures brought for food now mutated by leaked ADAM
- Aggressive behaviors, unnatural growth, bioluminescence
- Schools of fish now hunt in coordinated attacks
- Octopi demonstrating tool use and problem-solving
- Coral growth accelerated, forming maze-like structures

### Pressure Zones and Depth

**Zone 1: Surface to 200 feet** (Grand Promenade, Market, Frolic)
- Moderate pressure, normal humans can survive with basic gear
- Most flooded sectors remain accessible
- Life support systems maintain livable conditions
- Water clarity varies: Clear in maintained areas, murky in Splicer territory

**Zone 2: 200-500 feet** (Medical, Residential, Commercial)
- Increased pressure requires magical assistance or enhanced gear
- Some sectors deliberately flooded for defense
- Structural integrity weakening from depth stress
- Bioluminescence more prevalent, darker overall

**Zone 3: 500-1000 feet** (Industrial, Hephaestus, Persephone)
- Significant pressure, specialized protection mandatory
- Designed for heavy industry, utilitarian construction
- Access to geothermal vents and mineral deposits
- Big Daddies operate here without additional gear

**Zone 4: Below 1000 feet** (The Abyss, Secret Areas)
- Crushing depths, only most protected can survive
- Ancient ruins from pre-Aquaria civilization
- Source of sea slugs and ADAM
- Something vast stirs in the darkness (potential secret)

### Bioluminescence and Light

**Natural Sources**
- Colonizing algae on all surfaces (blue-green glow)
- Mutated fish emit light from organs
- Deep sea creatures drawn to warmth of city
- ADAM contamination causes environmental glow

**Artificial Sources**
- Neon signs still powered by backup systems
- Emergency lighting in critical areas
- Plasmid use creates bright elemental effects
- Big Daddy helmet lights cutting through murk

**Darkness Zones**
- Unpowered sectors in absolute black
- Splicers adapted to darkness (ambush advantage)
- Navigation requires light sources (risk of detection)
- Psychological impact of crushing dark water

## Additional World History

- Arts and sciences flourish without regulation
- Surface refugees arrive seeking freedom
- Aquaria becomes legend on surface

**Years 6-15: The Gilded Age**

### Philosophical Foundations

**Thalassor's Objectivism (Corrupted)**
- Original: Individual achievement is highest good, no sacrifice of self to others
- Reality: Becomes justification for exploitation and tyranny
- Hypocrisy: Thalassor demands others sacrifice for his vision

**Fontaine's Nihilism**
- Philosophy: Nothing matters except power and pleasure
- Method: Exploit any ideology to manipulate believers
- Irony: Destroys the system he was profiting from
- Endgame: Ultimate power is ultimate loneliness

**Lamb's Collectivism (Extreme)**
- Original: Community needs outweigh individual desires
- Reality: Suppression of identity and free will
- Methods: Psychological manipulation and forced unity
- Danger: Love and control become indistinguishable

**The Player's Choice**
- Campaign asks: What is the relationship between freedom and responsibility?
- Examination: Can utopia exist, or does it always corrupt?
- Ultimate question: Is power worth the cost to humanity?

### Mysteries and Unanswered Questions

**What Really Caused the Collapse?**
- Was it truly just Fontaine's ambition?
- Did Thalassor deliberately allow it to purge "weakness"?
- Was external interference from surface governments involved?
- Could it have been prevented?

**What Lies in the Abyss?**
- Sea slugs imply larger ecosystem
- Ancient ruins suggest prior civilization
- Something massive detected on sonar
- Is it watching? Waiting? Hungry?

**Who Activated the Distress Beacon?**
- Thalassor wants fresh victims/subjects?
- Fontaine luring salvage teams to harvest?
- Lamb seeking converts and surface contact?
- Genuine survivors hoping for rescue?
- Something else entirely?

**What Happened to Surface World?**
- 50 years since descent—has surface changed?
- Do they know Aquaria's fate?
- Are there other underwater cities?
- Will surface accept the survivors?

These mysteries can be resolved as DM prefers or left ambiguous for horror effect.
