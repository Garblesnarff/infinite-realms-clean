# The Drowned Citadel
**Tagline:** *Where Ambition Sank Beneath the Waves*

## Campaign Overview

Fifty years ago, the brilliant archmage Thalassor the Visionary descended beneath the ocean waves with ten thousand followers to build humanity's greatest achievement: Aquaria, the Drowned Citadel. Free from the tyranny of surface kingdoms, this underwater metropolis would be a paradise of magical innovation, artistic expression, and unbridled freedom. For thirty years, Aquaria thrived—a glowing jewel in the crushing darkness, powered by harvested planar energy and protected by impossible engineering.

Then came the Collapse. Communication ceased. The few who escaped told tales of madness, mutation, and civil war. The survivors spoke of "the Splice"—a magical serum that granted aquatic adaptations but drove users to violent insanity. They whispered of children transformed into weapons, of artists becoming monsters, and of Thalassor himself descending into megalomania, convinced he had become a god of the deep.

Now, a distress beacon has activated from the depths. An expedition is being assembled to investigate Aquaria's ruins, rescue any survivors, and recover the lost magical technology. But the Citadel's airlocks still function, its wards still glow with eerie light, and something vast moves through its flooded corridors. The players must descend into a drowned dystopia where humanity's greatest ambitions have curdled into an underwater nightmare, where the line between salvation and damnation is measured in drops of Splice, and where the true horror may be discovering that Aquaria's dream hasn't died—it's evolved into something far worse.

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Sleeper Agent Reveal**: Party discovers they were mind-controlled from the start, mission briefing included "would you kindly" trigger phrase planted by Fontaine

2. **Atlas is Fontaine**: The friendly survivor helping them is actually the criminal mastermind who started the civil war, faked his own death years ago

3. **Thalassor's Humanity**: In his final moments, Thalassor reveals he never wanted the city to fall—his madness was a response to Fontaine's betrayal

4. **The Surface Conspiracy**: The expedition company that hired the party works for Fontaine, sent them to eliminate Thalassor and recover Splice

5. **Lamb's Daughter**: Eleanor is revealed to be the party's most valuable ally or deadliest enemy depending on how they treated the Little Sisters

6. **The Lighthouse Trap**: The escape route is actually a final test—only those who prove worthy of Aquaria's ideals are meant to survive

7. **Patient Zero**: One party member may be secretly a former Aquaria citizen, returning with suppressed memories
