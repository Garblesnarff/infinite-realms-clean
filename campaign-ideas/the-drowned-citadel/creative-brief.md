# The Drowned Citadel - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
**Art Deco Dystopia Under Water**
- Primary inspiration: 1950s-60s futuristic optimism corrupted by decay
- Art deco architecture with sweeping curves and geometric patterns
- Brass, copper, and bronze fixtures now corroded and covered in sea growth
- Contrast between intended luxury and current desolation
- Bioluminescent organisms colonizing once-pristine surfaces

### Visual Tone Progression
**Early Game: Eerie Beauty**

**Mid Game: Descent into Madness**
- Increasingly disturbing scenes of violence and mutation
- Graffiti messages revealing psychological deterioration
- Splicer camps showing desperate survival
- Beauty corrupted into something grotesque

**Late Game: Apocalyptic Grandeur**
- Sectors flooding and collapsing in real-time
- Electrical storms from damaged power systems
- Massive structural failures revealing ocean outside
- Final confrontations in spaces of terrible beauty

### Environmental Details
- **Water Quality**: Varies from crystal clear near life support systems to murky and blood-tinged in Splicer territories
