## Kaiju Biology

**Structure:**
- Silicon-based life, not carbon
- Dual-brain system (backup if primary damaged)
- Armor-plated hide, regenerates slowly
- Kaiju Blue blood (toxic, ammonia-based)

**Reproduction:**
- Grown in Precursor facilities, not born
- Purpose-designed for specific tasks
- Share genetic hive-mind through Breach
- Each death teaches Precursors how to improve next generation

**Weaknesses:**
- Specific kill zones (brain, heart)
- Vulnerable to extreme heat/cold
- Chemical composition allows tracking
- Cannot adapt to completely novel tactics instantly

## Location Details

### The Shatterdome (Hong Kong)
**Jaeger Bay:** Cathedral-sized hangar, multiple Jaegers on racks
**Conn-Pod Drop:** Where pilots descend into neural interface
**Kwoon Room:** Training hall, combat practice, Drift testing
**Laboratories:** K-Science research, preserved Kaiju samples
**Living Quarters:** Barracks, mess hall, recreation areas
**Command Center:** LOCCENT (Logistics Command Center), holographic displays
**Bone Slums:** Refugee settlement built on Kaiju carcass outside base

### The Breach
**Location:** Challenger Deep, Pacific Ocean
**Depth:** 36,000 feet below surface
**Properties:** Dimensional rift, "lock and key" mechanism (requires Kaiju DNA to pass)
**Instability:** Growing more stable, will soon allow permanent invasion
**Appearance:** Glowing portal, biomechanical edges, reality distortion

### Hong Kong Coastal Wall
**Height:** 300 feet
**Composition:** Reinforced concrete and steel
**Status:** Ineffective—Kaiju breach it easily
**Political Symbol:** Represents leadership's loss of faith in Jaegers

### Precursor Dimension
**Environment:** Toxic atmosphere, crushing pressure, extreme temperature
**Structures:** Biomechanical hive architecture, Kaiju birthing pods
**Inhabitants:** Precursors (never seen directly), Kaiju in various growth stages
**Purpose:** Terraforming staging ground, has conquered other worlds

## Timeline of Kaiju War

**Year 0 (K-Day):** Trespasser emerges, destroys San Francisco
**Year 1:** Conventional military proves useless, PPDC formed
**Year 2:** First Jaeger deployed, humanity fights back
**Years 3-8:** Golden Age of Jaegers, multiple victories
**Years 9-12:** Kaiju adapt, casualties mount, public support wanes
**Year 13:** Wall of Life proposed, Jaeger program defunded
**Year 14:** Multiple Shatterdome closures, few Jaegers remain
**Year 15 (Campaign):** Final desperate mission to close Breach

## The Drift - Deep Mechanics

**Neural Load:**
- Two pilots share burden—solos would die from strain
- Synchronization percentage (75%+ required for combat)
- Compatibility based on emotional connection and neural structure

**Drift Side Effects:**
- Random Access Brain Impulse (RABIT): Flashbacks that break synchronization
- Memory Bleed: Partners gradually share all memories
- Personality Convergence: Long-term partners think alike
- Neural Scarring: Trauma damages Drift capability

**Chase the RABIT:**
- When strong memory surfaces, pilot relives it
- Partner experiences it too
- Can cause Jaeger to freeze in combat
- Training teaches control, but trauma can break through

**Precursor Drift Technology:**
- Kaiju share hive-mind through similar system
- Humans adapted alien tech without knowing
- Explains why it works at all
- Allows Drifting with Kaiju brain (dangerous)

## Kaiju Cult Ideology

**Beliefs:**
- Kaiju are divine punishment for humanity's sins
- Worshipping them will spare believers
- Precursors are gods from beyond
- Humanity should not resist fate

**Activities:**
- Sabotage Jaegers and detection equipment
- Ritual sacrifice in Kaiju's path
- Preserving Kaiju remains as holy relics
- Growing membership as war worsens

**Leadership:** Charismatic prophets claiming Kaiju visions

**Truth:** Drifting with Kaiju blood causes hallucinations, false revelations

## Black Market Economy

**Kaiju Organs:**
- Liver, eyes, brains worth fortunes
- Traditional medicine claims (false but profitable)
- Scientific research (legitimate but illegal without permits)
- Biotechnology applications

**Harvesting Operations:**
- Dangerous work in toxic Bone Yards
- Organized crime controls territories
- Violence between rival operations
- PPDC technically forbids but tacitly allows (needs the parts too)

**Hannibal Chau's Empire:**
- Largest dealer, ruthless businessman
- Can source rare components for Jaeger repairs
- Information broker about Kaiju
- Questionable ethics but reliable

## Military Structure

**Command Hierarchy:**
- Marshal (Supreme commander)
- Field Marshal (Regional Shatterdomes)
- Ranger (Pilot rank)
- Support staff ranks (standard military)

**Jaeger Teams:**
- Minimum two pilots (co-pilots)
- Some Jaegers require three (Crimson Typhoon)
- Support crew: 200+ per Jaeger
- J-Tech specialists, medical staff, logistics

**Operational Doctrine:**
- Kaiju emergence detected via sensors
- Deploy nearest Jaeger(s) for intercept
- Engage offshore when possible
- Prevent landfall at all costs
- Disposal of carcass (environmental hazard)

## Environmental Impact

**Kaiju Blue Contamination:**
- Toxic blood poisons water, soil
- No-go zones around death sites
- Long-term ecological damage
- Humans exposed develop illness

**Urban Destruction:**
- Cities abandoned after attacks
- Millions displaced
- Economic collapse in affected regions
- Refugee crisis ongoing

**The Bone Yards:**
- Where carcasses are processed
- Toxic wastelands
- Poor and desperate work there despite danger
- Mutations in exposed populations

This rich world-building supports a campaign where giant robot battles are the spectacle, but human drama, political maneuvering, and the cost of war provide depth and meaningful choice.
