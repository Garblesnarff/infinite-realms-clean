# Jaeger Protocol
**Tagline:** *To fight monsters, we became giants*

## Campaign Overview

Fifteen years ago, a dimensional rift tore open beneath the ocean—the Breach. Through it came the Kaiju: massive bio-engineered creatures designed for one purpose—extinction of humanity. Conventional militaries were useless. Cities fell in days. Humanity stood on the brink of annihilation. Then came the Jaegers.

Giant mechanized war machines, 250 feet tall and piloted by neural-linked teams, the Jaegers were humanity's answer to extinction. Through neural handshake technology—the Drift—two pilots merge their minds to control the massive mechs. The burden of piloting is too great for one mind, but together, pilots can match the Kaiju blow for blow.

The players are Jaeger pilots stationed at the Shatterdome, one of humanity's last coastal defense installations. They've trained together, mastered the Drift, and piloted their Jaeger through multiple engagements. But Kaiju attacks are intensifying. The creatures are evolving, adapting, becoming more frequent and more deadly. Intelligence suggests something is coordinating them from beyond the Breach.

As the campaign unfolds, the party discovers the truth: the Kaiju are not random attacks but a terraforming vanguard. An alien intelligence is testing humanity's defenses, studying our tactics, and preparing for final colonization. The party must venture into hostile waters, face Category V Kaiju never before encountered, and ultimately take the fight to the Breach itself. But neural linking comes at a cost—each Drift erodes the boundary between pilots, bleeding memories and emotions between them. Victory may require the ultimate sacrifice: closing the Breach from the other side, knowing they'll never return.

## Core Themes

- **Unity Through Connection:** The Drift forces absolute trust and vulnerability
- **Sacrifice for the Greater Good:** Individual lives vs. species survival
- **Humanity's Resilience:** Building giants to fight gods
- **Cost of War:** PTSD, radiation exposure, neural damage from Drifting
- **Found Family:** Pilots, mechanics, and command staff become family
- **Hope Against Despair:** Facing extinction with defiant heroism
- **The Burden of Violence:** What does fighting monsters do to your humanity?

## Session Breakdown

### Arc 1: Defenders of the Shatterdome (Sessions 1-8)
**Sessions 1-2:** Party completes their first official Jaeger deployment. Routine Kaiju emergence (Category II) becomes complicated when creature displays new behavior. They win but barely. Introduction to Shatterdome personnel and other Jaeger teams.

**Sessions 3-4:** Increased Kaiju activity. Two emergences in one week. Party's Jaeger sustains damage. While in repairs, they're paired with another team's Jaeger. Incompatibility during Drift creates dangerous situations. Exploration of what happens when neural handshake fails.

**Sessions 5-6:** Category III Kaiju makes landfall. Party deployed with two other Jaegers. Coordinated combat introduces team tactics. One allied Jaeger is destroyed; pilots killed. Party witnesses firsthand the cost of their war. Funeral sequence and reckoning with mortality.

**Sessions 7-8:** Investigation reveals Kaiju are evolving specifically to counter Jaeger tactics. Science division scrambles to upgrade mechs. Party participates in testing new weapons systems. Political pressure mounts to abandon Jaegers for alternative strategies (coastal wall construction). Party must prove Jaegers are still viable.

### Arc 2: Into the Deep (Sessions 9-16)
**Sessions 9-10:** Category IV Kaiju emerges—largest ever encountered. All operational Jaegers deployed. Massive battle in coastal waters. Multiple Jaegers damaged or destroyed. Party's mech takes critical damage but they secure the kill. Base decimated. Shatterdome faces closure.

**Sessions 11-12:** With resources scarce, party investigates black market for rare components to repair their Jaeger. They encounter underground Kaiju worship cults and illegal organ harvesting operations. Moral complexity of desperate times.

**Sessions 13-14:** Science Officer Gottlieb proposes theory: Kaiju share hive-mind through dimensional link. If they can "drift" with a Kaiju brain sample, they might gain intelligence about the Breach. Party must obtain fresh sample during next emergence. Extremely dangerous mission.

**Sessions 15-16:** Double event—two Category III Kaiju emerge simultaneously. Party splits their attention while attempting to preserve one Kaiju's brain. They succeed but at cost: one pilot suffers neural contamination from Kaiju secondary brain. Now experiencing Kaiju memories and impulses.

### Arc 3: Drift Space (Sessions 17-24)
**Sessions 17-18:** Drifting with Kaiju brain reveals horrifying truth: they're bio-weapons created by alien Precursors. Earth is being terraformed for invasion. Kaiju are testing defenses and poisoning environment with their toxic blood. The party now knows the enemy but feels insignificant against alien civilization.

**Sessions 19-20:** Marshal proposes desperate plan: create nuclear weapon delivery system via Jaeger. Carry bomb through Breach, detonate on other side, close dimensional rift. Certain death for pilots. Party must decide if they volunteer. Meanwhile, infiltrate rival Shatterdome to steal specifications for needed modifications.

**Sessions 21-22:** Category V Kaiju emerges—unprecedented size and power. All remaining Jaegers scramble. Battle spans multiple sessions as creature demonstrates terrifying abilities. It's winning. Party must make impossible tactical decisions—sacrifice civilians to create opportunity, or lose everything trying to save them?

**Sessions 23-24:** Victory against Category V but at catastrophic cost. Only three Jaegers remain operational worldwide. The Breach is becoming more stable—soon it will allow multiple simultaneous emergences. Timeline accelerated. The suicide mission must launch immediately or never.

### Arc 4: Closing the Breach (Sessions 25-32)
**Sessions 25-26:** Preparation for final mission. Upgrading Jaeger with experimental technology. Personal goodbyes and unfinished business. Each pilot records final messages. Drift compatibility tested one last time—years of partnership have made them nearly one mind. Bittersweet realization that if they survive, they'll never be whole apart again.

**Sessions 27-28:** Launch sequence. Journey to Breach location in ocean's deepest trench. Kaiju swarm attacks en route. Running battle while protecting nuclear payload. Allied Jaegers provide escort, sacrificing themselves to clear the path. Entering the Breach.

**Sessions 29-30:** Beyond the Breach—alien dimension. Witnessing Kaiju creation facilities and Precursor civilization. Everything is hostile. The temperature, atmosphere, creatures—all designed to kill humans. Fighting through to reach detonation point. Jaeger systems failing in alien environment.

**Sessions 31-32:** Final confrontation with Precursor forces. Setting up nuclear device. Explosion countdown. Desperate escape attempt vs. accepting death. Potential twist: discovering dimensional anomaly that might allow survival if they risk trusting alien technology. Final choice: certain noble death vs. uncertain survival that might doom Earth. Campaign ends with Breach closing—pilots' fate player-determined.

## Unique Mechanics

### Neural Handshake (The Drift)
- **Compatibility Checks:** Pilots must pass Wisdom saves to synchronize
- **Shared Memories:** Each Drift bleeds memories between pilots—learn each other's secrets involuntarily
- **Combat Bonuses:** Successful Drift grants advantage on coordinated actions
- **Ghost Drifting:** Solo piloting causes massive strain—disadvantage and psychic damage
- **Drift Compatibility Score:** Tracks how well pilots sync—improves over time or degrades with trauma

### Jaeger Combat System
- **Scale Combat:** Jaegers fight at massive scale—damage tracked in categories
- **Component Damage:** Target specific Jaeger parts (arm, leg, power core, head)
- **Weapon Systems:** Each Jaeger has unique loadout (plasma cannon, chain swords, etc.)
- **Environmental Use:** Grab ships, buildings, containers as improvised weapons
- **Team Coordination:** Multiple Jaegers can execute combination attacks
- **Kaiju Blue:** Kaiju blood is toxic—environmental hazard during combat

### Kaiju Categories and Evolution
- **Category I-II:** Early war, 200-300 feet, basic tactics
- **Category III:** Current standard, 350 feet, increased intelligence
- **Category IV:** Rare, 400+ feet, unique abilities
- **Category V:** Unprecedented, 500+ feet, multiple special attacks
- **Adaptation:** Kaiju learn from defeats—future encounters counter previous tactics

### Resource Management
- **Jaeger Repairs:** Limited resources for fixing damage between battles
- **Power Core:** Jaegers run on nuclear reactors—manage power during combat
- **Ammunition:** Some weapons have limited shots—tactical decisions
- **Support Personnel:** Engineers, medics, scientists—their morale affects performance
- **Political Capital:** Public support determines funding and operational freedom

### Radiation and Neural Damage
- **Exposure Tracking:** Pilots accumulate radiation from reactor proximity
- **Neural Strain:** Each Drift causes mental fatigue—track exhaustion levels
- **Long-term Effects:** Cancer risk, memory degradation, personality blending
- **Medical Treatment:** Downtime required to recover, limited healing resources

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1:** Kaiju share hive mind—killing them sends data back to Precursors who adapt

**Twist 2:** One NPC pilot is Precursor agent, sabotaging Jaegers from within

**Twist 3:** The Drift technology was based on reverse-engineered Precursor tech—humanity's salvation came from the enemy

**Twist 4:** Closing Breach from this side is impossible—must enter Precursor dimension

**Twist 5:** Party member contaminated with Kaiju DNA begins transformation—loyalty vs. survival

**Twist 6:** Precursors attempted invasion before (dinosaur extinction)—Earth is being reclaimed

**Twist 7:** Some Kaiju are sentient prisoners forced into service—killing them is mercy killing

**Twist 8:** Alternative to suicide mission exists but requires sacrificing a major city as bait

**Twist 9:** Successful Breach closure will strand party in alien dimension

**Twist 10:** Precursors offer ceasefire in exchange for Earth's oceans—impossible choice

## Victory Conditions

**Heroic Victory:** Breach closed, pilots survive through daring escape, Earth saved, new era begins

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Breach closed, pilots die heroes, Earth saved but at terrible cost

**Tactical Victory:** Breach temporarily closed, bought time for permanent solution

**Bittersweet Victory:** Mission succeeds but half the party dies or transformed beyond saving

## Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic Defeat:** Breach becomes permanent, unlimited Kaiju invasions, humanity extinct

**Mission Failure:** Party dies before reaching Breach, no one else can complete mission

**Contamination:** Party contaminated/converted, become enemies of humanity

**Political Collapse:** Jaeger program defunded, walls fail, civilization falls slowly
