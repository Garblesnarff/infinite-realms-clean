# Creative Brief: Conquistadors of the New World

## Art Style: Epic Exploration (1492: Conquest of Paradise meets Apocalypto)

Inspired by the grand scope of *1492: Conquest of Paradise* and the native perspective of *Apocalypto*. This style captures oceanic voyages, first contact wonder, sophisticated native civilizations, and the tragedy of conquest and disease.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Two Worlds:** Show both European and native perspectives equally.
*   **Disease Apocalypse:** Visualize invisible killers destroying populations.
*   **Cultural Sophistication:** Portray Aztec/Inca civilizations' actual advancement.

### Color Palette:
Ocean blues of exploration, the gold that drove conquest, Aztec jade and feather work, Spanish steel and crosses, the earth tones of native civilizations, the reds of both Aztec sacrifice and Spanish violence.

### Character Design:
Conquistadors in steel armor with crosses, Aztec warriors in elaborate feather costumes, native emperors in sophisticated regalia, priests carrying both gospel and judgment, disease victims showing the invisible apocalypse.

## Voice

A voice capturing both the wonder of discovery and the horror of conquest. Respectful of exploration's daring while unflinching about colonialism's brutality. The narrator speaks with the weight of knowing how this moment shaped the modern world—for better and worse. Audio: Ocean waves, native languages, Spanish commands, disease-ravaged cities, gold being extracted, church bells in the New World, cultural destruction and synthesis.
