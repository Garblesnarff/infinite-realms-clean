## Central Conflict

This campaign explores European colonization of the Americas through discovery, disease, and conquest. The central conflict is the players' participation in a system that brings them glory and gold while causing civilizational genocide through disease and exploitation. They must navigate between genuine religious mission and gold-driven conquest, between respecting sophisticated native cultures and destroying them, and between individual morality and complicity in colonial systems. The campaign asks: Can individuals be moral within immoral systems? How did disease change history more than military might? What's the difference between exploration and invasion? And how do we reckon with history's moral complexity? The answer: the Age of Exploration created the modern world through a process that enriched some and destroyed others—participants must choose what they become within that reality.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Disease Tracker**
*   European diseases spread exponentially among native populations with no immunity.
*   This tracker shows civilizations collapsing from invisible killers before conquest begins.
*   Players witness genocide they're causing unintentionally—complicating morality.

### 2. **Gold vs. Gospel**
*   Track whether expeditions prioritize Christian mission or gold extraction.
*   Gold focus increases wealth but decreases moral justification.
*   Gospel focus may actually help some natives but enables conquest.

### 3. **Native Alliance System**
*   Conquistadors succeed by allying with native groups against native empires.
*   Players can build genuine alliances or cynically exploit native divisions.
*   These choices determine whether some native cultures survive through alliance.

### 4. **The Moral Reckoning**
*   Track players' choices: Did they oppose atrocities, participate, or stay neutral?
*   The epilogue shows whether they became Las Casas (protesting) or typical conquistadors (exploiting).
*   There's no wholly moral option—only degrees of complicity.

### 5. **The Columbian Exchange**
*   Show how both worlds transform: Europe gains crops and gold, Americas gain livestock and disease.
*   This mechanic emphasizes that history pivoted—neither continent would be the same.
*   Players see they participated in the creating of the modern world.
