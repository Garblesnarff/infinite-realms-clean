# Breach Runners

*A Time-Traveling Mech / Kaiju Defense / Timeline Preservation campaign — Medium Campaign (15-20 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Breach Runners
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time-Traveling Mechs / Kaiju Defense / Timeline Preservation / Tactical Combat
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **14-16**
**Tone (keywords):** time loop urgency, tactical precision, kaiju threats, protecting civilians, timeline manipulation, desperate last stands
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In the year 2089, Earth's last cities are protected by massive walls against the Vek—kaiju that emerge from underground to destroy humanity. The party are Breach Runners, elite pilots of time-traveling mechs called Chronowrights, able to reset timeline branches when missions fail catastrophically. Each "run" sees them defending a different island chain's cities from Vek assaults, protecting power grid and civilians while learning more about the Vek's true origin. When they discover the Vek are being controlled by an extradimensional intelligence using time itself as a weapon, they must make a final run to the origin point and seal the breach in spacetime before humanity's timeline is erased across all possible futures.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of defense, discovery, and ultimate prevention.

*   **Act I — The Defense Runs (Sessions 1-7):** The party completes their first successful run defending cities from Vek. They protect power grids, evacuate civilians, and fight emerging kaiju with tactical precision. Each session is a different island or timeline branch. Between runs, they upgrade mechs and discover fragments of lore. They meet other Breach Runner teams and learn the organization's history. A catastrophic failure forces a timeline reset—their first experience with "starting over."
*   **Act II — Pattern Recognition (Sessions 8-14):** The party notices patterns: Vek attacks target specific locations, almost as if guided. They investigate Vek hives and discover crystalline structures that shouldn't exist—evidence of intelligence. A recovered Vek core reveals memory data: the kaiju are being controlled. The party tracks the signal to temporal anomalies. They must defend cities while simultaneously investigating the mystery, racing against time before the Vek overwhelm all defenses.
*   **Act III — The Origin Point (Sessions 15-20):** The party discovers the Architect—an extradimensional entity trying to erase humanity across all timelines by sending Vek backward through time. The only way to stop it is traveling to Timeline Zero—the first moment the breach opened. They make a final run, knowing they may not return. Fighting through hordes of Vek to the breach, they confront the Architect and must seal the rupture in spacetime, potentially trapping themselves outside normal time. The epilogue shows Earth in a timeline where Vek never emerged, but the Breach Runners are legends lost to time.

    *   Fight through Vek hordes in proto-timeline
    *   Confront the Architect at the breach in spacetime

    *   Ultimate sacrifice: mechs overload to seal breach, pilots may be lost to time
    *   Epilogue: Earth in new timeline never experienced Vek; Breach Runners exist only as fragmented legends
**Resolution:** Breach sealed across all timelines; humanity safe; heroes become myth

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of determinism vs. free will, the weight of impossible choices, protecting the present by changing the past, and sacrifice across timelines. It asks: If you could reset time, what would you change? Is it right to erase timelines to save others? What defines success when failure can be undone? The central conflict pits humanity's determination to survive against an enemy weaponizing time itself.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Timeline Reset Mechanic**
*   When mission fails catastrophically (multiple cities destroyed), party can reset timeline
*   Return to mission start with full memory of "failed timeline"
*   Can make different tactical choices to achieve different outcome
*   Resets have psychological cost: accumulated trauma, identity questions
*   Limited resets per arc; eventually must commit to a timeline

### 2. **Grid-Based Tactical Combat**
*   Combat occurs on 8x8 grid representing island terrain
*   Mechs and Vek occupy tiles; positioning is crucial
*   Environmental hazards: mountains (block movement), water, lava, buildings
*   Attacks have knockback and push mechanics: position enemies into hazards
*   Objective: Protect power grid buildings and civilians, not just kill Vek

### 3. **Collateral Damage Matters**
*   Destroying buildings damages power grid and kills civilians
*   Success measured by: cities protected, civilians saved, power maintained
*   Can win fights but fail missions if civilians die
*   Perfect runs (no casualties) earn bonus rewards
*   Failed civilian protection haunts party in future timelines

### 4. **Mech Customization**
*   Three mech types: Punch (melee), Cannon (ranged), Science (support/control)
*   Upgrade weapons, armor, and special abilities between runs
*   Limited upgrade resources: must choose specialization
*   Pilot skills unlock through successful missions
*   Mech loadout determines tactical options

### 5. **Vek Emergence System**
*   Vek emerge from ground in specific patterns each turn
*   Tiles glow one turn before emergence (telegraph system)
*   Knowing emergence points allows preemptive positioning
*   Some turns show "future emergence" in failed timelines
*   Advanced Vek types appear in later sessions: Fireflies, Beetles, Scorpions, Bosses

### 6. **Perfect Information Tactical Puzzle**
*   Party sees all enemy actions before committing their moves
*   Vek attack patterns are visible: which tiles they'll target
*   Challenge is finding optimal solution to minimize damage
*   Like chess: know all moves, must find winning sequence
*   Timeline resets allow trying different solution approaches

### 7. **Reputation & Island Unlocks**
*   Successful missions earn Reputation points
*   Reputation unlocks new islands with unique challenges
*   Each island has distinct biome, Vek types, and mission objectives
*   Final island only available with maximum reputation
*   Failed missions reduce reputation; repeated failures lock harder content
