### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Breach Runners**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In 2089, Earth's last cities are protected from Vek kaiju by time-traveling mechs called Chronowrights. The party are Breach Runners defending island cities through tactical combat, resetting timelines when failures occur. They discover Vek are controlled by an extradimensional Architect weaponizing time, requiring a final run to Timeline Zero to seal the breach in spacetime before humanity is erased across all possible futures.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the 2050 Breach Event when spacetime ruptured and first Vek emerged.
    *   Write the history of the Chronowright Project—development of time-traveling mechs.
    *   Describe the Collapse—when 90% of Earth's landmass fell to Vek control.
    *   Explain timeline mechanics: how resets work and why memories persist.
    *   Detail the discovery that Vek attacks aren't random but controlled by external intelligence.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Breach Runners** (Major): Elite mech pilots defending humanity's last cities with timeline resets.
    *   **The Archive** (Major): Command organization coordinating defense across all timelines.
    *   **Vek Swarm** (Major Enemy): Kaiju controlled by external signal, emerging from underground.
    *   **The Architect** (Major Enemy): Extradimensional entity weaponizing time to erase humanity.
    *   **Timeline Refugees** (Minor): People from failed timelines existing as temporal echoes.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Commander Chen (mission control), Dr. Yasmin Kosta (timeline scientist), Pilot Ramirez (veteran runner), The Architect (extradimensional entity), Timeline Ghost (failed self from alternate timeline).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Breach Runner Pilot" (mech operators), "Archive Technician" (support crew), "Vek Firefly" (flying kaiju), "Vek Scorpion" (armored kaiju), "Temporal Anomaly" (timeline breach entity).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Archive:** Headquarters existing between timelines, clean sci-fi aesthetic, mech bays, holographic mission control, timeline navigation chambers.
*   **Rust Island:** Industrial island chain with factories, power plants, urban grid, first training ground.
*   **Vek Hives:** Underground tunnel networks where kaiju spawn, crystalline control structures receiving Architect's signals.
*   **Temporal Anomaly Sites:** Locations where multiple timelines overlap, reality glitches, see "ghost" events from other timelines.
*   **Timeline Zero / The Breach:** 2050 moment when spacetime first ruptured, origin point for all Vek invasions.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Mission fails catastrophically → **THEN:** Timeline reset triggers, party remembers failed attempt, can try different approach.
*   **IF:** Multiple cities destroyed → **THEN:** Power grid collapses, human population reduced, future missions harder.
*   **IF:** Perfect run achieved → **THEN:** Maximum reputation earned, civilian morale high, bonus upgrades unlocked.
*   **IF:** Temporal anomaly investigated → **THEN:** Fragment of truth revealed, closer to understanding Architect's plan.
*   **IF:** Too many timeline resets → **THEN:** Pilot psychology fractures, identity questions emerge, effectiveness reduces.
*   **IF:** Reach Timeline Zero → **THEN:** Can prevent Breach at origin, stop Vek across all timelines, but may sacrifice selves.
*   **IF:** Breach sealed successfully → **THEN:** New timeline where Vek never emerged, but Breach Runners become lost legend.
