# The Dreaming City - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Dream Architects (Oneiropoioi)

**History**: Founded by Somnus the First approximately 3,000 years ago, shortly after he made contact with the Ur-Dream. The original seven Architects were dreamers who could consciously navigate the collective unconscious. Somnus taught them the binding rituals that imprisoned the Ur-Dream and erected Oneiros above it.

**Current Structure**:
- **The Circle of Seven**: Current leadership, each specializing in one dream domain
  - Master Morpheus Grey (Chief Architect, Deep Dreams specialist)
  - Architect Theron Voss (Shallow Dreams, Memory preservation)
  - Architect Kalista Rem (Nightmare containment)
  - Architect Hypnos Dusk (Sleep cycle maintenance)
  - Architect Nyx Whisper (Borderlands patrol)
  - Architect Phantasos Mirror (Dream Market regulation)
  - Architect Oneiros Prime (City infrastructure, named for the city)

**Ranks**:
1. **Master Architects**: The Seven, centuries old, partially transformed by long exposure to dream energies
2. **Senior Architects**: 50-100 years experience, can navigate Deep Dreams safely
3. **Journeyman Architects**: 10-50 years, work primarily in Shallow Dreams
4. **Apprentice Architects**: 1-10 years, learning dream navigation
5. **Initiates**: Less than 1 year, still training

**Total Membership**: Approximately 300 active Architects, 500 support staff

**Abilities**:
- Conscious dream navigation without losing identity
- Can close minor breaches through ritual
- Lucid dreaming as natural ability
- Resistance to psychic attacks and possession
- Can read dream-signs and symbolic language

**Resources**:
- The Dreaming Spire (headquarters, built over the Ur-Dream's prison)
- Dream Anchor artifacts (allow non-Architects to navigate dreams)
- The Archives of Sleep (every dream recorded for 3000 years)
- Funding from city taxes and wealthy patrons who pay for pleasant dreams

**Secret Schisms**:
- **Traditionalists** (led by Morpheus Grey): Maintain the prison at all costs
- **Reformists** (led by Theron Voss, secretly): Believe the truth should be revealed gradually
- **Fatalists** (led by Kalista Rem): Think the prison's failure is inevitable, focus on damage control
- **Unknown Faction**: Some Architects have gone missing, believed to have joined Sleepless Cult

### The Sleepless Cult (The Awakened)

**Origin**: Started 10 years ago when Lucia Nightsend, a scholar researching dreams, accidentally accessed the Ur-Dream directly. The contact "woke" her to reality's constructed nature. She began recruiting others, using forced awakening techniques.

**Philosophy**:
- Reality is a shared hallucination enforced by the Architects
- True freedom requires awakening from the "consensus dream"
- Suffering in the false reality is worse than the chaos of awakening
- Individual identity is a cage; dissolution into the Ur-Dream is liberation

**Structure**:
- **The Prophet of Waking**: Lucia Nightsend, exists between dream and reality
- **The Partially Awake**: Her inner circle, 12 lieutenants who have undergone partial awakening
- **Believers**: 200+ cult members who understand philosophy but haven't awakened
- **Sleepwalkers**: People the cult has forcibly awakened, unstable and dangerous

**Methods**:
- Sabotaging the prison bindings
- Creating artificial breaches
- Kidnapping people and forcing awakening experiences
- Spreading propaganda about the Architects' lies
- Suicide attacks where cultists dissolve themselves into pure dream energy

**Abilities (Partially Awake members)**:
- Phase between dream and reality
- Don't need sleep, sustained by direct connection to Ur-Dream
- Can manifest dream-logic powers in waking world (limited)
- Immune to normal mental effects (already fractured psyches)
- Share thoughts across dream-space (hive mind tendencies)

**Hideouts**:
- **The Waking House**: Their headquarters, a building existing in the Borderlands
- **Cell Locations**: Throughout Oneiros, in citizens' dreams without their knowledge
- **The Prophet's Sanctum**: Lucia's personal space, a stable pocket in the Deep Dreams

**Internal Conflict**:
- Some cultists want gradual awakening
- Others want immediate, catastrophic release of the Ur-Dream
- A few have doubts but are too deep to leave

### The Memory Merchants' Guild

**Nature**: Not a faction with goals, but an organization of beings who trade in consciousness-commodities. Existed before Oneiros, as old as dreaming itself.

**Membership**:
- **True Merchants**: Beings made entirely of traded memories, like Cassidy
- **Travelers**: Those who discovered the Dream Market and stayed to trade
- **Collectors**: Obsessive hoarders of specific memory types
- **Brokers**: Middle-beings who connect buyers and sellers

**Services Offered**:
- Memory purchase and sale
- Identity modification
- Emotion trading
- Skill implantation
- Experience rental (temporary memories)

**Ethics**:
- Completely amoral, view consciousness as pure commodity
- Will sell anything to anyone for the right price
- Honor contracts absolutely (breaking deals causes dissolution)
- Neutral in the Architect vs. Cult conflict

**The Market's Rules**:
1. Payment must be in kind (memory for memory, emotion for emotion, etc.)
2. Once traded, original owner loses what was sold
3. No violence in Market proper (enforced by the Market itself)
4. The Market appears only to those ready to trade
5. Stolen memories are forbidden (consensual trade only)

**Notable Merchants**:
- **Cassidy the Composite**: Main NPC contact, made of others' memories
- **The Grief Collector**: Only trades in sadness and loss
- **Mnemosyne's Echo**: Claims to be a fragment of the goddess of memory
- **The Blank**: A being who sold everything and now offers "fresh start" packages

### The Forgotten

**Who They Are**: Citizens who fell through cracks in reality, existing in spaces between dream and waking without being aware of either. They're not asleep or awake, just... stuck.

**Numbers**: Unknown, possibly thousands over the centuries

**Locations**: Found in overlooked spaces—alley corners no one looks at, doors that seem like they should lead somewhere but don't, the gap between seconds

**Condition**:
- Semi-conscious, respond to direct interaction but forget immediately after
- Appear normal but slightly translucent
- Repeat the same actions endlessly
- Can be "rescued" but rarely want to be (they're not suffering, just not experiencing)

**Significance**: They represent what happens when someone exists without choosing either reality or dream. A warning of what dissolution looks like on an individual scale.

### The Dream Constructs

**Nature**: Beings created from concentrated dream energy, thought to be alive but not "real" in the traditional sense.

**Types**:
- **Archetypes**: Universal symbols given form (The Wise Old Man, The Trickster, The Mother, etc.)
- **Nightmares**: Fear made manifest
- **Personal Constructs**: Created unconsciously by powerful dreamers
- **Intentional Creations**: Made by Architects or advanced dreamers

**Master Morpheus Grey's Secret**: He is a construct created by Somnus, not a real person. This revelation is devastating because:
- His entire identity is artificial
- He has "memories" that are implanted
- He questions if his feelings and choices are real
- Other Architects may also be constructs

**Rights and Treatment**:
- Architects treat them as tools
- Some progressive citizens argue for construct rights
- The Sleepless Cult claims constructs prove reality's false nature
- Constructs themselves have varying degrees of self-awareness

**Levels of Descent**:

**Level 1 - Surface Self**:
- Reflections show you as others see you
- Relatively stable, identity intact
- Echoes of your own voice

**Level 2 - Social Masks**:
- See yourself in different roles (worker, friend, child, parent)
- Voices ask "which is the real you?"
- Start feeling fragmented

**Level 3 - Alternate Choices**:
- Mirrors show lives you didn't live
- "What if" scenarios play out
- Begin questioning if current self is "correct"

**Level 4 - Childhood Echoes**:
- Younger versions of yourself appear
- Questions about when "you" really started
- Memories become unreliable

**Level 5 - Fundamental Traits**:
- Personality aspects separate and become independent
- Your courage, fear, joy, anger walk around as separate beings
- Identity feels like collection of parts, not unified whole

**Level 6 - Pre-Verbal Self**:
- Wordless existence, pure sensation
- Memories before language
- Sense of "I" becomes very weak

**Level 7 - Dissolution Threshold**:

- No gravity, time feels strange, causality is loose

**The Ur-Dream's Appearance**:
- Constantly shifting between forms
- Sometimes human, sometimes animal, sometimes pure symbol
- Made of archetypal imagery: all mothers, all warriors, all lovers, all deaths
- Size is relative to observer's perception
- Surrounded by nimbus of impossible color

**Binding Methods**:
- **Sigil Network**: 10,000 binding marks, each maintained by ritual
- **Anchor Pillars**: Seven pillars representing the original Architects
- **The Sleeper's Chain**: Metaphysical restraint made of forgotten dreams
- **Consensus Reality**: The collective belief that it should be imprisoned helps bind it

**Weakening Signs**:
- Sigils fading or cracking
- Pillars leaning or crumbling
- Chain links dissolving
- The Sleeper moving more in sleep

**Accessing the Prison**:
- Through Dreaming Spire basement (heavily guarded)
- Via the deepest part of Abyss of Self
- Through major breaches if they penetrate deep enough
- Cult knows secret ways through the Borderlands

## Causality Chains and Metaphysical Mysteries

### The Origin Question: What Created the Ur-Dream?

**Theories**:

1. **Primordial Consciousness Theory**: The Ur-Dream is the first conscious thought in the universe, predating physical reality

2. **Collective Origin Theory**: It emerged naturally when enough beings developed consciousness and started dreaming

3. **Ouroboros Theory**: The Ur-Dream created itself in a time loop, its current existence ensuring its past creation

4. **Fragment Theory**: It's a broken piece of a greater cosmic consciousness

5. **The Truth** (revealed late campaign): The Ur-Dream is the universe's unconscious mind. Reality is the universe's waking thoughts, dream is its sleep. The prison doesn't contain it—it prevents the universe from waking fully.

### The Somnus Paradox

**The Mystery**: Somnus the Founder's records are contradictory. He:
- Founded the Architects 3,000 years ago
- Made first contact with the Ur-Dream
- Created the prison bindings
- Built Oneiros

**The Paradox**:
- Some archives suggest Somnus was a Dream Architect BEFORE founding them
- He describes events before the city existed from a position inside the city
- His own journals contain memories he shouldn't have

**The Truth**: Somnus experienced a time loop. He will/did/is:
1. Make contact with Ur-Dream in the future
2. Be sent backward in time by the experience
3. Found Oneiros in the past
4. Create the conditions for his own future contact
5. The loop is eternal unless broken

**Implications**: If party stops the crisis, they might prevent Somnus's original contact, creating a paradox. If they free the Ur-Dream, the loop might break, erasing Oneiros from history retroactively.

### The Dream Construct Question

**The Mystery**: Are dream constructs "real"?

**Philosophical Positions**:
- **Architects**: They're tools, useful but not persons
- **Cult**: They prove all reality is constructed, all identity is arbitrary
- **Merchants**: They're as real as anyone—consciousness is consciousness
- **Constructs themselves**: Divided, some believe they're real, some don't

**The Test Case - Master Morpheus Grey**:
- When he learns he's a construct, how should party treat this?
- His feelings, memories, choices—were they ever his?
- If they help him, are they patronizing him by affirming his constructed nature?
- If they treat him as real, are they lying to make him feel better?

**The Answer** (if party digs deep enough): The distinction between "real" and "construct" is false. All consciousness is self-constructed. Morpheus is as real as anyone because reality itself is a form of consensus dreaming.

### The Memory Continuity Problem

**The Mystery**: Cassidy exists entirely as traded memories. What are they?

**Questions Raised**:
- Is Cassidy the memories themselves, or something that holds them?
- If all memories were removed, would Cassidy still exist?
- Do the original owners of the memories still exist in Cassidy?
- When Cassidy says "I remember," who is the "I"?

**Party Investigation May Reveal**:
- Cassidy contains memories from thousands of beings
- Some memories contradict others (being in two places at once)
- Cassidy's personality is emergent from the collection, not any single source
- They fear being discovered as "fake" but also don't know what "real" would mean for them

**Philosophical Implications**:
- All people are just collections of memories and experiences
- Identity is narrative continuity, not essential self
- Perhaps everyone in Oneiros is like Cassidy—collections of traded dreams

### The Bootstrap Reality Problem

**The Mystery**: If the Ur-Dream creates reality through dreaming, what is the Ur-Dream made of?

**The Paradox**:
- Reality needs consciousness to observe/create it
- Consciousness needs reality to exist in
- Which came first?

**Architect Explanation**: The Ur-Dream exists outside cause-effect. It's self-creating, self-sustaining.

**Cult Explanation**: There is no "outside" reality. It's dreams all the way down. The question is meaningless.

**The Actual Answer**: Both are right. The Ur-Dream is a strange loop—it creates the reality that creates consciousness that dreams it into existence. There is no "before" or "outside." The loop IS reality.

**Implications**: If the loop breaks, either:
- Reality stabilizes into a fixed state (no more dreams)
- Reality dissolves completely (no consciousness to sustain it)
- Something new emerges (conscious reality)

### The Prophet's Awakening

**The Mystery**: What did Lucia Nightsend actually experience when she "woke up"?

**Her Account**: She saw through the illusion of solidity, understood that reality is collaborative imagination, realized she'd been asleep her whole life.

**Evidence For**:
- She gained impossible powers
- She exists between states
- Her predictions often come true
- She has knowledge she shouldn't

**Evidence Against**:
- She's clearly mentally unstable
- Her fractured consciousness could be damage, not enlightenment
- The Ur-Dream says she "woke incorrectly"
- She can't maintain coherent identity

**The Truth**: Lucia is half-awakened—she broke through consensus reality but did it alone and unprepared. Like waking from sleep paralysis, she's caught between states. She's both right (reality is constructed) and wrong (awakening shouldn't destroy you). Her tragedy is that partial awakening is worse than staying asleep or fully waking.

## Additional Lore and World History

### The Time Before Oneiros

**3,500+ Years Ago**: Scattered dream-walkers existed across the multiverse. They navigated dreams instinctively, shamans and mystics. Dreams were wild, untamed, dangerous.

**The Crisis of Nightmares**: A period when nightmares became so prevalent and powerful that they began manifesting in waking reality spontaneously. Civilizations fell to dream-plagues.

**Somnus's Discovery**: A dreamer named Somnus (name possibly adopted later) found the source—the Ur-Dream was stirring, moving toward waking. Its unconscious movements caused the nightmare crisis.

**The Choice**: Somnus realized full awakening would transform reality unpredictably. He chose to create a prison, stabilizing dream and reality as separate states.

**The Price**: To create the prison, Somnus had to:
- Sacrifice his own ability to wake (became immortal but trapped)
- Convince six other powerful dreamers to join him
- Build a city on the threshold between states
- Accept that he was preventing evolution, not just containing danger

### The Dream Architect Wars (500 Years Ago)

**The Schism**: A faction of Architects called the Liberators believed the Ur-Dream should be freed. They argued imprisonment was tyranny.

**The Conflict**: Fought in dream-space and reality simultaneously. Cities burned with symbolic fire. People's consciousnesses were weaponized.

**The Resolution**: The Liberators were defeated and imprisoned in eternal sleep. Their bodies are kept in a secret vault beneath the Spire.

**The Cover-Up**: This history is redacted from official records. Most current Architects don't know it happened.

**The Relevance**: The Sleepless Cult is, unknowingly, repeating this conflict. History cycles in the dreamscape.

### Other Cities of the Threshold

**The Question**: Is Oneiros unique?

**The Answer**: No. Evidence exists of other cities built on the threshold between dream and reality:
- **Morphos** (fallen 1,000 years ago, now ruins in Deep Dreams)
- **Hypnopolis** (may still exist, no contact in centuries)
- **The City of Endless Night** (rumored, possibly cult fabrication)

**What Happened to Them**:
- Some fell to nightmare invasions
- Some achieved awakening and transformed beyond recognition
- Some may have succeeded where Oneiros is failing
- Some might be dreams of Oneiros itself

**Implication**: The crisis isn't unique. It may be inevitable for all threshold cities.

### The Nature of the Multiverse

**Structure**:
- **Physical Reality**: The waking world, material physics
- **Shallow Dreams**: Personal unconscious, individual dreams
- **Deep Dreams**: Collective unconscious, archetypal space
- **The Ur-Dream**: Primordial consciousness underlying all dreams
- **The Source** (theoretical): What the Ur-Dream might dream of

**Travel Between Layers**: Normally requires being asleep or in trance. Dream Architects can navigate consciously. The crisis makes barriers permeable.

**Other Beings**:
- **Nightmare Lords**: Powerful fear-entities from Deep Dreams
- **Muses**: Inspiration-beings that grant creativity
- **The Endless** (rumored): Beings that personify fundamental concepts
- **Dream Gods**: What the Architects might become if they live long enough

### Cultural Elements of Oneiros

**Languages**:
- **Common Oneiran**: Everyday language, mix of multiple root tongues
- **Dream-Script**: Symbol language used in dream navigation
- **Sigil-Tongue**: Binding magic language, known only to Architects
- **The Wordless Language**: Pure concepts, how the Ur-Dream communicates

**Holidays**:
- **Festival of Deep Sleep**: Annual celebration when barriers are strongest (session 1 occurs during this)
- **The Waking Day**: Midyear festival celebrating consciousness
- **Nightmare's End**: Commemorates a major nightmare containment from centuries ago
- **The Long Dreaming**: Week-long meditation and rest period

**Social Structure**:
- **The Architects**: Ruling class, respected and feared
- **The Awakened Elite**: Wealthy citizens who can afford dream services
- **The Sleeping Masses**: Common citizens, mostly unaware of dream politics
- **The Drowsy**: Lowest class, those who sleep too much, seen as lazy
- **Constructs**: Legally property, no rights

**Economics**:
- Currency: **Dream-marks**, crystallized dream energy
- Major industry: Pleasant dream provision services
- Exports: Dream artifacts, memories (through Memory Merchants)
- Imports: Reality anchors (from waking worlds), physical resources

**Religion**:
- **Orthodoxy**: Worship of Somnus as savior-figure
- **Dream Pantheon**: Ancient gods of sleep and dream
- **Awakened Philosophy**: Cult belief system spreading
- **Architect Veneration**: Some citizens treat the Circle as living saints

### Magic System Details

**Dream Magic**:
- Based on symbolic understanding, not formulas
- Stronger in dream-space, weaker in reality
- Costs: Mental energy, memory, identity stability
- Types: Illusion, emotional manipulation, memory editing, construct creation

**Reality Magic**:
- Traditional arcane magic works normally
- Competes with dream logic in unstable areas
- Can be used to anchor reality or dispel dreams

**Hybrid Magic**:
- The Architects' specialty
- Combines dream symbolism with reality anchoring
- Can affect both states simultaneously
- Very difficult, requires years of training

**Forbidden Magic**:
- Direct communion with Ur-Dream
- Forced awakening spells
- Identity theft/switching
- Reality erasure

### The Transformation Process (If Party Chooses That Path)

**What Happens**:
1. Volunteer becomes the Anchor
2. Their consciousness expands to touch all sleeping minds
3. They experience every dream simultaneously while maintaining core self
4. Reality becomes malleable but conscious—everyone aware they're creating it
5. The Ur-Dream evolves from sleeping to lucid

**Effects on the World**:
- Physics becomes suggestion, not law
- Thoughts manifest but don't cause chaos (conscious control)
- Death becomes transition rather than ending
- Identity remains stable through choice and will

**Effects on the Anchor**:
- They experience all consciousness but remain distinct
- Can communicate with anyone through dreams
- Essentially become a god, but retained humanity
- Must maintain balance forever (or until replacement found)

**Who Could Be The Anchor**:
- Any character with strong Identity Anchors
- Master Morpheus Grey (redemption for being construct)
- Lucia Nightsend (completing her failed awakening)
- The Ur-Dream itself (transforming itself)
- Collective choice (entire party merges)

### Potential Sequel Hooks

**If Prison Restored**:
- Signs of another threshold city failing
- Liberator faction returning from eternal sleep
- Somnus's time loop beginning to close
