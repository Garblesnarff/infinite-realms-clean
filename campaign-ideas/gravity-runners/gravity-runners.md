# Gravity Runners
## *When the city becomes your canvas, and every rooftop is a battlefield*

### Campaign Overview

In the sprawling vertical metropolis of Zenith Prime, gravity is negotiable and momentum is currency. The city's impossible architecture—towers that pierce the clouds, inverted districts hanging from crystalline cables, and streets that loop through dimensional folds—demands a new breed of hero: the Gravity Runners. These death-defying parkour artists have discovered that the ancient city's architecture resonates with their movements, turning sick tricks into actual magic spells and wall-runs into reality-bending phenomena.

The Runners aren't just athletes—they're freedom fighters. The Stasis Syndicate, a corporate coalition that controls Zenith Prime's gravity generators, has begun implementing "Flow Restrictions" that limit movement through certain districts, creating invisible walls that cage the city's lower classes. Only those who can master the forbidden art of Momentum Magic can breach these barriers and discover the truth: the city itself is alive, and it's been slowly dying as the Syndicate drains its kinetic essence to power their empire.

Players take on the roles of up-and-coming Runners who stumble upon an ancient technique called the "Perfect Line"—a legendary route through the city that, if completed without breaking flow, could restore Zenith Prime's freedom and awaken its slumbering consciousness. But the Syndicate's elite enforcers, the Stillborn Guard, have orders to capture or kill any Runner who gets close to the truth. This is Mirror's Edge meets Assassin's Creed meets Doctor Strange, where every parkour session is a heist, every rooftop chase is a battle for the soul of the city, and style points literally save lives.

**Vertical Combat**
- Initiative determined by elevation (higher = faster)
- Movement is more important than direct damage
- Environmental hazards are primary threats
- Boss fights require running/fighting simultaneously

**Crew Dynamics**
- Players can perform combo moves if coordinating
- Tag-team wall-runs, assisted jumps, human catapults
- Synchronized Flow States grant party-wide bonuses
- Rivalries with other crews provide ongoing side conflicts

### Plot Twists & Complications

1. **The City Dreams**: Zenith Prime isn't just alive—it's dreaming. Flow Restrictions are causing it nightmares.

2. **Cipher's Betrayal**: The mentor was the one who taught the Syndicate about Momentum Magic; now seeks redemption.

3. **Velocity's Truth**: The rival reveals his sister was killed by a reckless Runner—his motivation is personal, not ideological.

4. **The Perfect Line Paradox**: Completing the Line might not save the city—it might cause it to ascend and leave everyone behind.

5. **Player's Past**: One party member unknowingly caused a famous tragedy that killed dozens—the secret could destroy the crew.

6. **The Stillborn King's Identity**: He's actually Cipher's former partner, transformed by the Syndicate into their perfect weapon.

7. **Mother Static's Gambit**: She wants the Perfect Line completed—but to weaponize it and control the city absolutely.

8. **The Outside World**: Revelation that Zenith Prime is actually a mega-prison, and Runners are inmates with memory wipes.

9. **Gravity Generator Collapse**: If players don't act fast, random districts will experience catastrophic gravity failure.

10. **The Final Choice**: Awaken the city and potentially doom its residents, or keep it sleeping and preserve the status quo.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Complete the Perfect Line and awaken Zenith Prime's consciousness, breaking the Syndicate's control and restoring freedom of movement to all districts.

**Secondary Victories**:
- Rescue Cipher and other imprisoned Runners
- Unite the rival crews under a common cause
- Redeem Velocity and turn him against the Syndicate
- Preserve the Freerunner's Haven for future generations
- Destroy enough gravity generators to create permanent free zones

**Personal Victories**:
- Each player achieves their own Perfect Line moment
- Earn legendary status in the Runner community
- Have signature moves named after them
- Create lasting art/graffiti that inspires others

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: The Syndicate completes the Stasis Protocol, freezing all kinetic energy in the city. Everyone becomes living statues. Game ends.

**Partial Defeats**:
- Cipher executed publicly, demoralizing the Runner movement
- Perfect Line fragments destroyed, making the ancient route impossible
- Freerunner's Haven discovered and demolished
- Key crew members captured and converted to Stillborn Guards
- Zenith Prime's consciousness dies permanently

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Complete the Perfect Line but at cost of most NPCs' lives, or awaken a city that immediately begins to crumble.

### Campaign Tone

This campaign blends the kinetic intensity of parkour with the wonder of urban fantasy. Every session should feel like a mix of high-stakes heist, extreme sports highlight reel, and philosophical journey about freedom versus security. The DM should emphasize:

- **Momentum over combat**: Most conflicts solved through movement, not violence
- **Environmental storytelling**: The city itself tells the story through architecture
- **Constant motion**: Even social encounters can happen while running
- **Style matters**: Describe actions cinematically, reward creative solutions
- **Stakes escalation**: Each act raises both danger and player capabilities
- **Found family**: Emphasize crew bonds and underground community
- **The flow state is real**: Moments where everything clicks should feel transcendent

This is a campaign where you don't just roll dice—you soar.
