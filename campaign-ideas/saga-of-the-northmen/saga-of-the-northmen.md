## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act epic from raiding to kingdom-building.

*   **Act I — Raiders (Sessions 1-6):** The party earns their place in Ragnar's crew through courage in battle and cunning in raids. They strike monasteries, coastal towns, and trade routes, learning Viking warfare and culture. They discover that raiding brings wealth but no lasting power. Ragnar dreams of something greater—permanent settlement in the rich lands of England.

*   **Act II — The Great Army (Sessions 7-14):** Ragnar assembles the Great Heathen Army to invade England. The party participates in conquering Saxon kingdoms, facing shield-walls and Christian champions. They must navigate Viking politics—rival jarls, internal feuds, and the question of whether they conquer or settle. Ragnar's capture and execution by King Aelle creates succession crisis.

*   **Act III — Sons of Ragnar (Sessions 15-20):** Ragnar's sons lead revenge invasion. The party must choose which son to support or forge their own path. They carve out territories, defend against Saxon counterattacks, and negotiate with Christian kings. The party's choices determine whether Vikings become conquerors, settlers, or both. Question of conversion vs. Norse gods emerges.

*   **Act IV — Legacy (Sessions 21-25):** The party faces ultimate challenges—unifying Viking territories, defending against Alfred the Great's resurgence, deciding whether to embrace Christian England or remain Norse. Their final battles and political choices determine whether they're remembered as raiders who faded or conquerors who changed history. Saga ends with their deeds sung in halls for generations.
