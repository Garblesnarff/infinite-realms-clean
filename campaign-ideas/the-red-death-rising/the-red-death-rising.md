# The Red Death Rising
*A plague without cure. A world without hope. A race against death itself.*

## Campaign Overview

Patient Zero collapsed in the marketplace of Port Meridian three weeks ago, bleeding from eyes and pores, covered in crimson lesions. Within hours, dozens showed symptoms. Within days, thousands. Within three weeks, Port Meridian is a mass grave and the Red Death has spread to twelve major cities. Mortality rate: 95%. Incubation period: 24-72 hours. Transmission: Airborne, contact, possibly magical. No known cure. Estimated time until global pandemic: 60 days.

The plague is not natural—it's the awakening of the Blood Titan, an ancient disease entity imprisoned beneath the earth, now seeping through into the world. Each infected person becomes a vector for its corruption. As more die, it grows stronger. If unchecked, it will consume every living thing, transforming the world into a realm of disease and death.

The party must navigate a plague-ravaged world, avoid infection, find Patient Zero's origin, discover the truth about the Blood Titan, develop a cure, and stop the pandemic before there's no one left to save. They race against exponential spread, social breakdown, and the growing power of disease incarnate.

## Core Themes

- **Pandemic Horror**: Invisible killer, anyone could be infected
- **Medical Mystery**: Scientific investigation under pressure
- **Social Breakdown**: Quarantine, riots, scapegoating, breakdown of order
- **Contamination**: Constant risk of infection, paranoia
- **Sacrifice**: Healthcare workers dying to save others
- **Exponential Growth**: Plague spreads faster than efforts to stop it

## Session Breakdown (24-32 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Outbreak (Sessions 1-6)
**Sessions 1-2**: Campaign opens in Port Meridian as first cases appear. Party witnesses Patient Zero's death, horrific symptoms. City implements quarantine—too late. Plague spreads exponentially. Must escape quarantine or be trapped with infected. Introduction to contamination mechanics, symptoms, fear.

**Sessions 3-4**: Fled to neighboring city, bringing infection with them unknowingly. Second outbreak begins. Authorities trace party, blame them. Must clear names while helping medical response. Meet Dr. Vita Healer, plague expert. Together investigate origin—backtrack Patient Zero's movements.

**Sessions 5-6**: Trail leads to abandoned temple outside city. Discovery: Patient Zero disturbed ancient site, released dormant plague. Temple contains records of the Blood Titan—ancient disease entity imprisoned millennia ago. Prison is breaking. Each infected person feeds it power.

### Arc 2: Pandemic (Sessions 7-15)
**Sessions 7-9**: Return to civilization to find multiple cities quarantined, thousands dead. Dr. Healer establishes research facility, attempts to develop cure. Party assists: Gathering rare ingredients, rescuing infected test subjects, protecting facility from mobs. Discover plague is partially magical—requires magical AND medical cure.

**Sessions 10-12**: Plague Cult emerges—Death Prophet believes disease is judgment, spreads it intentionally. They're immune (discovered resistance ritual). Infiltrate cult, learn their secrets. Discover Blood Titan is whispering to infected, driving some mad. Cult worships it as death god.

**Sessions 13-15**: Society collapsing. Healthy flee, leaving infected to die. Crematoriums burn day and night. Economy collapses. Martial law declared. General Quarantine believes only solution is: Burn infected cities, everyone inside. Party must stop genocide while plague spreads.

### Arc 3: The Cure (Sessions 16-24)
**Sessions 16-18**: Dr. Healer identifies cure components: Blood of immune individual, essence from Blood Titan's prison, rare alchemical compounds, divine magic. Multi-pronged quest to gather. Racing against time—plague reaching critical mass, millions infected.

**Sessions 19-21**: Journey to Blood Titan's prison deep underground. Place reeks of disease, walls weep pus, air itself is toxic. Fight through plague-mutated creatures, infected guardians. Reach prison chamber—see Blood Titan partially emerged: Massive tumor-like entity, pulsing, covered in lesions, beautiful and revolting.

**Sessions 22-24**: Blood Titan is sentient, communicates through disease. Offers bargain: Willing sacrifice can carry plague forever, sparing others. Otherwise it will consume world. Must choose: Take disease into self, destroy Titan (hard), re-imprison it (requires components), negotiate different terms.

### Arc 4: Patient Zero Billion (Sessions 25-32)
**Sessions 25-27**: Return with cure components. Dr. Healer begins synthesis. But plague has mutated—multiple strains now. Cure works on some, not all. Blood Titan adapting. Must create multiple cures simultaneously. Resource crisis, time running out.

**Sessions 28-30**: Death Cult attempts to sabotage cure, believing in their twisted faith. Military wants to seize cure for elites only. Population desperate for treatment. Party must mass-produce and distribute while fighting faction warfare. Triage decisions—who gets cure first?

**Sessions 31-32**: Final confrontation with Blood Titan as it attempts full manifestation. Cure distributed, infected dying or recovering. Party faces Titan with cure/weapons/magic. Multi-stage battle against disease incarnate. Resolution determines pandemic's end. Victory: Cure works, Titan contained/destroyed. Defeat: Plague consumes world.
