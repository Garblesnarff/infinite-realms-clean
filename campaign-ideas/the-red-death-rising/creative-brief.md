# The Red Death Rising - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Contagion meets Body Horror** - Clinical medical imagery mixed with visceral disease. Emphasis on protective gear, isolation, fear. Color grading: Sickly greens, medical whites, blood reds, death greys. Beautiful world dying visibly.

## Color Palettes
- **Infected Zones**: Sickly green, blood red, gangrenous black, pus yellow
- **Medical Facilities**: Sterile white, antiseptic blue, desperate hope
- **Safe Zones**: Paranoid grey, isolated browns, fearful shadows
- **Blood Titan**: Tumor pink, diseased purple, necrotic black, pulsing reds

## Music & Sound
**Main Theme**: "The Spreading Sickness" - Begins with single heartbeat, adds sounds of coughing, labored breathing, builds to epidemic chaos. **Quarantine**: Silence punctuated by distant screams, medical equipment beeping, despair. **Victory**: Heartbeat returns to normal, breathing clears, hope restored.

## Cinematic Moments
- **Session 1**: Patient Zero dying, blood everywhere, crowd backing away in horror
- **Session 21**: Blood Titan chamber—tumor-entity pulsing with each heartbeat, walls weeping
- **Session 32**: Cure dispersing, infected recovering, color returning to grey world
