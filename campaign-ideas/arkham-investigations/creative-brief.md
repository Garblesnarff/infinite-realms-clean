# Creative Brief: Arkham Investigations

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: 1920s Noir with Cosmic Horror (Lovecraft-inspired)

Inspired by the unsettling aesthetics of H.P. Lovecraft's works, 1920s period photography, and classic horror illustration. This style captures the veneer of normalcy cracking to reveal cosmic horrors, period-accurate settings descending into impossible geometry, and the visual representation of sanity erosion.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Period Authenticity:** 1920s clothing, architecture, vehicles, and technology
*   **Creeping Wrongness:** Normal scenes with subtle wrongness—wrong angles, impossible shadows
*   **Incomprehensible Geometry:** Spaces that shouldn't fit, Escher-like impossibilities
*   **Tentacled Horror:** When monsters appear, they're beyond natural comprehension

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Unsettling, 1920s period, cosmic horror, sanity erosion, insignificance, forbidden knowledge, creeping dread
*   **Feeling:** Normal reality slowly revealing it's a thin veneer over incomprehensible cosmic horror. The dread of knowing you're insignificant.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Period Normal:** Sepia tones, muted browns, grays, period photograph aesthetic
*   **Horror Intrusion:** Sickly greens, deep purples, colors that seem wrong/unnatural
*   **Deep Ones:** Fish-belly pale, algae green, barnacle gray
*   **Antarctic:** Blinding white with black rock, prismatic colors in ice
*   **Cosmic Elements:** Colors that seem to exist outside normal spectrum
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of sepia and muted 1920s browns and grays, like an old photograph. But something wrong intrudes—sickly green light from impossible sources, deep purple shadows that move incorrectly. A character's reflection shows colors that don't exist in the normal spectrum. Period authenticity corrupted by cosmic horror."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Investigators:** 1920s attire—men in suits and hats, women in period dresses, practical clothes
*   **Sanity Loss:** Gradual physical changes—hollow eyes, haunted expressions, jerky movements, aging rapidly
*   **Cultists:** Robed figures with ceremonial masks, some showing transformation
*   **Deep Ones:** Fish-frog hybrids, bulging eyes, webbed hands, scales, gills
*   **Elder Things:** Barrel-shaped with starfish heads, completely alien
*   **Prompt Example:** "An investigator showing sanity deterioration. 1920s suit and fedora, but something's wrong. Eyes too wide, dark circles beneath, skin too pale. Hands tremble holding aged Necronomicon. Behind them, shadows move wrong—angles that shouldn't exist. Reflection in window shows something else looking back."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Miskatonic University:** Gothic architecture, old library, period university campus
*   **Arkham Streets:** 1920s New England town, cobblestones, gas lamps, period vehicles
*   **Innsmouth:** Decaying fishing town, collapsed roofs, abandoned buildings, fishy smell visible in composition
*   **Antarctic Ruins:** Non-Euclidean architecture, impossible angles, black stone with hieroglyphs
*   **Underwater Y'ha-nthlei:** Alien city with cyclopean architecture, bioluminescent horror
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Antarctic ruins—massive black stone city with impossible geometry. Walls meet at wrong angles that hurt to look at. Passages that couldn't fit but do. Hieroglyphs showing things that never existed on Earth. Ice and howling wind. In the distance, mountains older than humanity. Everything feels like it's at the wrong scale—too big and too small simultaneously."

**5. Horror and Cosmic Elements:**
*   **Tentacles:** When monsters appear, masses of writhing appendages
*   **Wrong Geometry:** M.C. Escher impossible spaces, angles that shouldn't work
*   **Transformation:** Humans becoming something else—scales, gills, bulging eyes
*   **Cosmic Vistas:** Glimpses of realities humans shouldn't see—star patterns that spell doom
*   **Shoggoths:** Amorphous protoplasmic horrors with temporary eyes and mouths
*   **Prompt Example:** "A shoggoth emerging from darkness. Massive protoplasmic blob with temporary eyes, mouths, and organs forming and dissolving. Black-green iridescent surface. Burbling, piping sounds visualized as distortion. It fills a corridor that couldn't possibly fit it. Characters flee in terror, their sanity visibly cracking."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Period Lighting:** Gas lamps, flashlights with weak beams, natural light
*   **Horror Lighting:** Bioluminescence from wrong sources, phosphorescence, unnatural colors
*   **Shadow Wrong:** Shadows that don't match light sources, move independently
*   **Antarctic Glare:** Blinding snow reflection, deep black shadows on ice
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by weak flashlight beams barely pushing back darkness. Gas lamp in corner casts shadows that move wrong—there are more shadows than people. Something glows with sickly green bioluminescence from the deep. Moonlight through windows seems tinted purple. Everything is too dark or wrong lighting."

## Voice

A haunted narrator's voice, strained from witnessing the incomprehensible. The pacing is measured but increasingly unstable, like sanity eroding. The tone shifts from academic observation to existential dread. Occasional shaking and voice breaks at horror described. Underlying theme of cosmic insignificance. The voice carries the weight of forbidden knowledge that destroys the mind. Whispers "I shouldn't know this" and "It shouldn't be possible." Role: The voice of sanity's destruction and cosmic truth.
