# Creative Brief: Saviors of Mongo

## Art Style: Raygun Gothic / Planetary Romance (1930s-40s Serials)

Inspired by classic Flash Gordon serials and pulp sci-fi art—gleaming rocket ships, exotic costumes, impossible architecture, vibrant colors, art deco meets alien cultures.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Vibrant and varied. Ming City in golds, reds, and blacks—ornate and threatening. Sky City in whites and blues—clean and aerial. Arboria in lush greens. Frigia in crystalline blues and whites. Rocket ships are silver chrome. Ray guns glow with neon colors. Costumes are bold primaries.

**Character Design:** Flash in athletic outfit—bare chest or tight shirt, boots, utility belt. Dale in practical but form-fitting adventure wear. Ming in elaborate robes with Asian-inspired details, scaled green skin. Aura in revealing but regal gowns. Hawkmen with magnificent wings. Each culture has distinctive, exotic appearance.

**Environments:** Art deco rocket ships with impossible curves and chrome. Sky cities on floating platforms among clouds. Crystal ice palaces. Underwater domes. Ming's throne room—ornate, threatening, filled with exotic technology. Arena of death with viewing galleries and death traps.

**Action:** Rocket ship dogfights with ray beams. Sword fighting on narrow bridges. Heroes swinging on cables. Falling from great heights. Gladiatorial combat. Ray gun battles. Dramatic rescues. Everything is dynamic and colorful.

## Voice

Heroic and determined with a sense of wonder. Flash's voice (or narrator's) is confident but not arrogant—an ordinary person rising to extraordinary challenge. Ming speaks with theatrical villainy—cultured, cruel, amused by others' suffering. Vultan booms with hearty enthusiasm. Zarkov mutters scientific observations. Each kingdom has distinctive accent and cadence. The tone is "gee-whiz" adventure—excited by wonders of the cosmos.

## Music Style

Sweeping orchestral space opera with exotic instrumentation. Think classic sci-fi scores—theremin for alien technology, bold brass for rocket launches, romantic strings for love themes, ominous horns for Ming. Each kingdom has musical identity—Sky City is airy and light, Frigia is crystalline, Arboria is organic. Ray gun battles feature electronic effects. The main theme is triumphant and adventurous with fanfare that makes you want to hop in a rocket ship. Ming's theme is oriental-flavored menace. Everything is larger than life and gloriously melodramatic.
