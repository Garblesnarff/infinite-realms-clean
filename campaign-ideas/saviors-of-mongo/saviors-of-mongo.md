## Central Conflict

Tyranny versus freedom. Ming represents absolute power corrupting absolutely—he rules through fear, manipulation, and superscience. The kingdoms of Mongo are divided, making them weak. The party must prove that cooperation defeats tyranny, that freedom is worth fighting for, and that heroism inspires others to be brave. They're strangers in a strange land, but their Earth values of democracy and individual rights resonate across cultures.
