The party is in the bustling port city of Harbordeep when a massive, unknown creature emerges from the ocean and begins destroying the harbor district.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 4-6 sessions)

A desperate evacuation from a city under siege by incomprehensible horror.

*   **Act I — The Attack Begins (Sessions 1–2):** The party attends a harbor celebration when the creature—Thalos the Deep-Born—emerges from the water, towering over ships and buildings. The initial attack kills hundreds. The party must escape the collapsing harbor district while parasitic spawn creatures begin hunting survivors. They witness the military's first, futile attempts to fight Thalos.
*   **Act II — The City Falls (Sessions 3–4):** Thalos advances deeper into Harbordeep, leaving devastation in its wake. The party learns of evacuation points outside the city walls. They must navigate through ruined districts, avoid spawn creature nests, and rescue key NPCs who can help. The military deploys increasingly desperate measures—including magical artillery that only enrages Thalos.
*   **Act III — Escape or Stand (Sessions 5–6):** The party reaches the final evacuation checkpoint, but it's overrun with spawn creatures and refugees. They must hold the line long enough for transports to escape. Alternatively, they discover that Thalos is seeking something specific in the city—an ancient artifact buried beneath the cathedral. The party can attempt to give Thalos what it wants, potentially saving the city but risking unknown consequences.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Something in the Water"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Initial Attack
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is at the harbor for the Lantern Festival, a citywide celebration. Thousands of people crowd the docks.
    *   The water begins to churn. A massive shape rises—Thalos, a 200-foot tall creature of barnacle-covered hide, tentacles, and glowing eyes. It unleashes a sonic roar that shatters windows and deafens bystanders.
    *   The harbor district collapses as Thalos wades ashore. Ships capsize. Buildings crumble. The party must flee through the chaos.
**Escalation:** Smaller creatures—dog-sized parasites with razor teeth—fall from Thalos's body and begin hunting survivors.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The City Screams"
*   **Focus:** Urban Survival / Evacuation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party navigates through the ruined districts, encountering stampeding crowds, collapsing buildings, and spawn creature attacks.
    *   They meet key NPCs: Captain Rhysa (military officer organizing evacuations), young Kellen (a child separated from his family), and Scholar Viresh (who knows something about Thalos).
    *   Scholar Viresh reveals: "Thalos is ancient—a creature from the Abyssal Rift. It's not just attacking randomly. It's searching for something."
    *   The party witnesses the military's bombardment of Thalos. The spells and ballista only wound it superficially and enrage it further.
**Escalation:** Thalos changes direction, heading toward the city's cathedral district. The spawn creatures multiply, establishing nests in abandoned buildings.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The Cathedral Secret"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Moral Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Scholar Viresh leads the party to the cathedral's archives. They discover that an ancient relic—the Heart of the Deep—was stolen from the ocean centuries ago and sealed in the cathedral's vault. Thalos is a guardian, retrieving what was taken.
    *   The party faces a choice: Return the Heart to Thalos (potentially calming it but risking unknown consequences), destroy the Heart (Thalos may go berserk), or ignore it and focus on evacuation (Thalos will destroy the city).
    *   Meanwhile, spawn creatures swarm the cathedral. The party must fight through them to reach the vault.
**Escalation:** Thalos arrives at the cathedral and begins tearing it apart. The party has minutes to decide.

### Session 6 — "Exodus"
*   **Focus:** Climax / Evacuation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   If the party returns the Heart, Thalos takes it and retreats into the ocean, leaving the city devastated but standing. The spawn creatures die or flee.
    *   If the party does not return the Heart, they must hold the evacuation checkpoint against a final spawn wave while Thalos levels the cathedral district. Civilian casualties are massive.
    *   The session ends with the party escaping Harbordeep on the last transport, watching the city burn or recover behind them.
**Resolution:** The party survives, but Harbordeep is forever changed. Thousands died. The party is celebrated as heroes or haunted by those they couldn't save.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Thalos the Deep-Born** — *The Titan*
    *   **Role:** The massive creature attacking Harbordeep. It is ancient, powerful, and has a purpose beyond mindless destruction.
    *   **Personality:** Not evil—driven by instinct and duty. It is a guardian reclaiming what was stolen.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Thalos is suffering. The Heart of the Deep is part of its life force. Without it, it is incomplete.

2.  **Captain Rhysa Coldan** — *The Officer*
    *   **Role:** A military captain organizing evacuations and trying to maintain order amid chaos.
    *   **Personality:** Brave, disciplined, but overwhelmed. She makes hard choices about who to save.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Rhysa lost her family in the initial attack. She's functioning on autopilot, one step from breaking.

3.  **Scholar Viresh** — *The Lorekeeper*
    *   **Role:** A historian who knows about the Heart of the Deep and Thalos's origins.
    *   **Personality:** Intellectual, cautious, guilt-ridden. He knew the cathedral held a dangerous relic but never imagined this.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Viresh was part of the order that stole the Heart. He's desperate to make amends.

4.  **Kellen** — *The Child*
    *   **Role:** A young boy separated from his family, representing the innocent victims of the disaster.
    *   **Personality:** Terrified but brave when inspired by the party. He looks up to them.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Kellen's family is dead (though he doesn't know it). The party must decide whether to tell him.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of perspective, civilian survival, and the consequences of theft. The central conflict is not defeating Thalos (nearly impossible), but surviving the chaos and deciding whether to return what was stolen. Every choice has weight, and the party cannot save everyone.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Ground-Level Perspective**
*   The party are not epic heroes fighting the monster directly—they are civilians trying to survive. Thalos is a force of nature, not a combat encounter.
*   Combat focuses on spawn creatures and environmental hazards (collapsing buildings, fires, stampedes).
*   The party can influence the outcome through clever actions (luring spawn away, guiding evacuees, making the moral choice with the Heart), not direct combat.

### 2. **Evacuation Clock**
*   The campaign uses a **Clock** representing the city's evacuation progress. It starts at 0 and must reach 12 before Thalos destroys the evacuation point.
*   The clock advances by 1 each hour of in-game time.
*   The party can accelerate the clock (by helping evacuees, clearing routes, defeating spawn nests) or slow it (by getting sidetracked, failing to protect key NPCs).
*   If the clock reaches 12 before the party escapes, the final transport leaves without them.

### 3. **Spawn Creature Nests**
*   Spawn creatures establish nests in abandoned buildings. Nests produce 1d4 new spawn every hour.
*   The party can destroy nests to slow spawn numbers. Each destroyed nest reduces random spawn encounters by 25%.
*   Nests are located in tight, claustrophobic spaces—tunnels, basements, collapsed buildings.

### 4. **Collateral Damage**
*   Thalos's path of destruction is pre-determined by the DM (heading toward the cathedral). The party can witness its devastation:
    *   Buildings collapse (Dex saves to avoid falling debris).
    *   Thalos's sonic roar (Con saves or be deafened for 1 hour).
    *   Tidal waves when Thalos moves in water (Strength saves to avoid being swept away).
*   The party cannot stop Thalos directly, only survive its presence.
