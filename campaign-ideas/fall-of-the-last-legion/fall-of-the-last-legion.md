## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the fall of a great civilization and what its defenders choose to preserve. The central conflict is the players' realization that they cannot save the empire—only decide what aspects of it survive into the new world. They must navigate barbarian invasions that cannot be stopped, corruption that cannot be purged, religious transformation that cannot be reversed, and the painful choice between dying with honor or living to build something new. The campaign asks: What makes a civilization worth saving? Is it the institutions, the knowledge, the people, or the ideals? When everything is ending, what do you fight to preserve? And can something better rise from the ashes if the old world steps aside? The answer: empires fall, but what they teach can be eternal—if someone chooses to preserve it.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Collapse Tracker**
*   Measures the empire's decline across Military Strength, Political Stability, Economic Health, and Cultural Unity.
*   As trackers fall, the empire fragments—barbarian territory expands, provinces secede, resources vanish.
*   Players can slow but not stop the collapse, forcing them to prioritize what to save.

### 2. **Legacy Points**
*   Players earn Legacy Points for preserving aspects of Roman civilization: laws, knowledge, infrastructure, people.
*   These points determine what survives into the post-empire world.
*   The epilogue shows how preserved elements flourish in new kingdoms.

### 3. **Divided Loyalties**
*   Track which faction each NPC and legion unit supports: Traditional Rome, New Religion, Barbarian Alliance, or Self-Interest.
*   Loyalties shift based on events and player choices.
*   The final battle shows who stands with the players based on accumulated loyalty.

### 4. **Twilight Moments**
*   Special scenes where players witness the end of Roman traditions: the last triumph, the last senate session, the last temple ceremony.
*   These moments are bittersweet, emphasizing what's being lost.
*   Players can choose to preserve some traditions for the future or let them die with dignity.

### 5. **The Transformation**
*   Track how barbarian kingdoms adopt Roman elements and how Roman survivors adapt barbarian ways.
*   The new world is neither purely Roman nor barbarian but a synthesis.
*   Players shape this synthesis through their choices and preserved legacy.
