# Creative Brief: The Black Sphere Protocol

## Art Style: Hyper-Realistic Violence meets Sci-Fi

Photorealistic modern Tokyo with sudden intrusions of bizarre aliens and ultra-violence. Clean suits and weapons contrasting with organic alien horror.

### Core Principles:

*   **Photorealism:** Detailed, realistic human anatomy makes violence impactful.
*   **Alien Grotesque:** Wildly varied alien designs—Buddhist statues come to life, onion-headed monsters, mechanical horrors.
*   **Black Suit Aesthetic:** Sleek, form-fitting black suits with sci-fi elements.
*   **Extreme Violence:** Unflinching depictions of dismemberment, gore, death. Not gratuitous but realistic consequence of combat.

**Visual Elements:** The black sphere Gantz with ominous text displays. Black-suited hunters with futuristic weapons. Bizarre aliens (Buddha statue alien, dinosaur alien, etc.). Gruesome deaths. Score displays. Urban Tokyo battlefields.

**Color Palette:** Realistic modern colors. Black suits stand out. Alien blood and gore (various colors). Gantz's blue-white displays. Night missions in urban neon.

## Voice

Detached, almost deadpan narration of extreme violence. Like a game announcer calling brutal deaths. Environmental sounds: Gantz's electronic beeps, weapons charging, alien screams, bones breaking, the silence after someone dies and realizes they're in the game, urban night sounds.
