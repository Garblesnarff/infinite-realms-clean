### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Black Sphere Protocol**

**1. Core Concept:** Party dies and is conscripted by mysterious Gantz sphere to hunt aliens for points. 100 points = escape to normal life. Trapped in death game where violence is mandatory and death is temporary (until it isn't). Must maintain humanity while doing violence to survive.

**2. Lore Primer:** Gantz appears to conscript those who die in specific circumstances, resurrects them in apartment with equipment, sends on timed missions to kill aliens hidden in city, points earned for kills, 100 points buys freedom/equipment/resurrection, multiple Gantz spheres exist worldwide, true purpose unknown, aliens range from weak to catastrophic, some aliens are intelligent and question their own execution.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Gantz Players (Party):** Conscripted dead hunting to survive/escape.
*   **Gantz System:** Mysterious organization/entity running the game.
*   **The Aliens:** Varied species being hunted; some violent, some innocent.
*   **Veteran Players:** Survivors of many missions.
*   **Normal Society:** Unaware the game exists.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Gantz (sphere), Veteran Hunter, Psychopath Player, Alien Leader, Gantz Administrator (if exists).
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Newbie Player," "Alien Target," "Catastrophic Alien," "Dead Civilian."

**5. Locations:** Gantz apartment (start/end of missions), target zones (vary by mission—temples, neighborhoods, facilities), normal Tokyo (during downtime), other Gantz rooms (other cities).

**6. Triggers:**
*   **IF player refuses mission:** Head explodes; permadeath.
*   **IF player reaches 100 points:** Must choose freedom, weapon, or resurrection.
*   **IF killed outside mission:** Permadeath unless someone spends 100 points.
*   **IF encounter intelligent alien:** Moral complexity increases.
*   **IF discover Gantz's purpose:** Endgame initiates.
