# The Black Sphere Protocol

*A Death Game / Alien Hunting / Nihilistic Violence campaign — Medium Campaign (11–14 sessions) — Very High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Black Sphere Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Death Game / Alien Hunting / Resurrection Mechanics / Nihilistic Horror / Urban Violence
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 11–14 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** (dead) → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** Death game, resurrection, hunting aliens, points for kills, nihilistic violence, what gives life value, trapped between death and life
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party dies—killed in accidents, murders, or disasters. Instead of the afterlife, they wake in a strange apartment with a black sphere (the Gantz) that conscripts them to hunt deadly aliens hidden in the city. If they refuse, they die again permanently. Each successful hunt earns points toward the ultimate goal: 100 points buys either resurrection to normal life, enhanced equipment, or resurrect a dead teammate. The campaign explores whether life has meaning when death is temporary, how violence changes you, and what you'd sacrifice to escape the game.

## What "Very High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Permadeath:** Characters can die permanently if killed outside Gantz missions or if Gantz is destroyed.
*   **Overwhelming Enemies:** Aliens are vastly more powerful than starting characters. Early missions are survival horror.
*   **Graphic Violence:** Extremely brutal combat with dismemberment, gore, and body horror.
*   **Nihilistic Tone:** The game has no clear purpose. Gantz doesn't explain. Life and death feel meaningless.
*   **Moral Degradation:** Killing becomes routine. Party must fight to maintain humanity while doing violence.
*   **Forced Participation:** Can't opt out. Either hunt or die. No third option until you earn 100 points.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 11–14 sessions)

*   **Act I — Welcome to the Game (Sessions 1–4):** Party dies and wakes in Gantz's apartment. Meets other "players" (deceased conscripts). Gantz sends them on first mission—hunt a seemingly weak alien. Most players die horribly. Party learns the rules: kill targets for points, survive, repeat. Refused participation means your head explodes.
*   **Act II — The Grind (Sessions 5–9):** Multiple missions hunting increasingly dangerous aliens. Party accumulates points, better equipment, scars. Encounters veterans who've survived dozens of hunts. Discovers other Gantz spheres in other cities—this is worldwide. The aliens may not be random—there's a pattern. Some aliens plead for mercy, complicating morality.
*   **Act III — The Endgame (Sessions 10–14):** Party nears 100 points and must choose: escape to normal life, stay to save others, or investigate Gantz's true purpose. Final missions against catastrophic aliens. Revelation of what Gantz is (training program for alien invasion? Entertainment? God's experiment?). Multiple endings based on choices and who survives.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **survival versus humanity** and **what gives life value**. The party is trapped in a death game—kill aliens or die, accumulate points or remain imprisoned forever. Death is temporary for players but constant. Violence becomes routine. The question becomes: how do you maintain your humanity when killing is the only way to survive? If death is temporary, does life have meaning? If you could escape but others would die in your place, do you? And what do you do when you discover the "aliens" you're killing may be innocent, refugees, or even fellow victims of Gantz?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Point System**
*   Killing aliens earns points based on difficulty.
*   100 points = one of three choices:
    *   **Freedom:** Resurrect to normal life, escape Gantz forever (but forget everything).
    *   **Ultimate Weapon:** Gain the most powerful equipment.
    *   **Resurrect Teammate:** Bring back a dead ally.
*   Creates tension: help team or pursue personal escape?

### 2. **Gantz Resurrection**
*   If killed during a mission, may be resurrected by Gantz for next mission.
*   If killed outside missions, permanent death.
*   If refuse to participate, head explodes.

### 3. **Gantz Equipment**
*   Black suits that enhance strength/speed but are vulnerable at seams.
*   Gantz weapons: X-Gun (teleports targets into explosions), Y-Gun (gravity manipulation), Z-Gun (targeting).
*   Bikes and mechs for high-point players.
*   Invisible to normal people during missions.

### 4. **Target Hunting**
*   Gantz displays target aliens—must find and kill them in time limit.
*   Targets range from weak to catastrophic.
*   Mission ends when all targets dead or time expires.

### 5. **Civilian Interaction**
*   During missions, normal people can't see players or aliens (Gantz effect).
*   Creates surreal horror—fighting in public while invisible.

### 6. **Moral Degradation Tracker**
*   Track how party handles violence and death.
*   High degradation: become efficient killers but lose empathy.
*   Low degradation: maintain humanity but struggle with efficiency.

### 7. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Escape:** Earn 100 points, choose freedom, return to life (forget everything; bittersweet).
*   **Liberation:** Destroy Gantz, free all players, face consequences (invasion? judgment?).
*   **Ascension:** Discover Gantz's purpose and choose to continue (become administrators? Join larger war?).
*   **Death:** Team wipes; fail to accumulate points; permadeath.
*   **Monster:** Embrace violence; become like the psychopath; lose humanity completely.
