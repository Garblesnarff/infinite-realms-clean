# Walls of Last Hope
## *Humanity's Final Bastion. Three Walls. One Hundred Years of Peace. Until Today.*

### Campaign Overview

For one hundred years, humanity has cowered behind three massive concentric walls—Wall Maria (outermost), Wall Rose (middle), and Wall Sina (innermost). Beyond the walls roam the **Titans**: mindless, horrifying giants ranging from 10 to 60 feet tall that exist only to hunt and devour humans. No one remembers how the Titans first appeared or who built the walls, but survivors have built a fragile civilization in the shadow of constant threat.

The party begins as new recruits to the Survey Corps, the military branch dedicated to venturing beyond the walls to study Titans and reclaim lost territory. Most Survey Corps missions end in catastrophic casualties, yet volunteers continue to join, driven by hope, revenge, or desperation. When the campaign begins, the Colossal Titan—a 200-foot giant never seen before—breaches Wall Maria, and the **Armored Titan** smashes through the inner gate. Humanity's safe haven is shattered in minutes.

The party must survive the initial attack, evacuate refugees, and uncover the truth: the Titans are not mindless monsters—they're humans, transformed through horrific magic. The royal family knows the secret of the walls. The Colossal and Armored Titans are intelligent enemies with human motivations. And the walls themselves are made of dormant Colossal Titans, standing shoulder-to-shoulder. The campaign combines military survival horror, political intrigue, action-RPG combat against massive foes, and the gradual revelation that humanity's greatest monsters might be human after all.

### Core Themes

**Humanity vs. Nature (Seemingly)**: The Titans appear to be incomprehensible natural disasters. The campaign initially frames them as forces of nature, but gradually reveals human agency behind everything.

**Survival Horror Meets Military Drama**: Resources are scarce. Every expedition beyond the walls is terrifying. Discipline and strategy are essential. The tone is desperate and grim, but punctuated by moments of camaraderie and hope.

**The Cost of Peace**: The walls provided safety but imprisoned humanity. The royal government maintains order through lies and class division. Peace was purchased with terrible secrets.

**Scale as Threat**: Titans aren't just big—they're fundamentally different. Normal tactics fail. Traditional weapons are useless. Players must adapt or die.

**Betrayal and Conspiracy**: Allies might be enemies. The government conceals truth. Some Titans are humans with hidden agendas. Paranoia is justified.

**Hope in Desperation**: Despite overwhelming odds, characters find reasons to fight. Friendships, revenge, duty, or simple human stubbornness drive them forward.

### Session Breakdown (30-40 Sessions)

**Act I: The Fall of Wall Maria (Sessions 1-8)**
- **Session 1: Peaceful Days**: Party introduced as new Survey Corps trainees. Meet NPCs, learn about society, establish normal life. Foreshadowing: mysterious dreams of being giants, unexplained gaps in childhood memories (if party includes Titan shifters).

- **Session 2: The Breach**: During graduation ceremony in Shiganshina District (Wall Maria's southern gate), the Colossal Titan appears, towering over the wall. One kick obliterates the gate. Titans flood in. Party must survive chaos, save civilians, witness horror. The Colossal vanishes mysteriously after minutes.

- **Session 3: The Armored Charge**: As refugees flee inward, the Armored Titan rams through Wall Maria's inner gate. Two walls breached in one day. Party fights rearguard action, suffers losses. Evacuation to Wall Rose territory.

- **Session 4-5: Refugee Crisis**: Party deals with aftermath: overcrowding, starvation, disease. Assigned to maintain order. Political tensions: upper class vs refugees. Introduction to corruption in Military Police and royal government. Moral choices about resource distribution.

- **Session 6-7: Joining the Scouts**: Party officially joins Survey Corps. Training in Omni-Directional Mobility Gear (ODM). Practice fighting Titan dummies. Meet key NPCs: grizzled commander, genius strategist, bitter veterans. Learn about previous expeditions' horrific casualty rates.

- **Session 8: First Expedition**: Party's first trip beyond Wall Maria (now Titan-infested territory). Goal: establish supply base. Reality: ambushed by Titans. Squadmates die. Party barely escapes. First encounter with **Aberrant Titan** (behaves unusually intelligently). Seeds of suspicion: are some Titans different?

**Act II: The Scout Regiment (Sessions 9-18)**
- **Session 9-10: Trost District Defense**: Titans breach Trost District (Wall Rose). All-hands defense. Massive battle. Revelation: one party member (or NPC ally) transforms into a Titan to plug the breach, then emerges human from the Titan's nape. Humanity's first Titan shifter weapon revealed. Party must protect them from scared/angry civilians and military.

- **Session 11-12: The Interrogation**: Shifter put on trial. Are they human or monster? Party testifies. Political factions emerge: those who want to weaponize shifters vs. those who want them executed. Commander stakes reputation to protect shifter. Shifter joins party officially but under suspicion.

- **Session 13-14: The 57th Exterior Expedition**: Major operation to reach Shiganshina. Party encounters the **Female Titan**—intelligent, martial arts-using, selectively killing scouts. Devastating losses. Female Titan is captured briefly using elaborate trap, but escapes by hardening skin and calling normal Titans to eat through her body while she flees the nape. Evidence: this Titan has human intelligence and objectives.

- **Session 15-16: Conspiracy Unveiled**: Party investigates Female Titan's identity. Discovers she's a fellow Scout—a sleeper agent from outside the walls. There's a civilization beyond the walls! They're sending Titan shifters to infiltrate and destroy humanity. But why? Female Titan tries to kidnap the party's Titan shifter. Epic urban combat using ODM gear through city. Female Titan escapes but identity exposed.

- **Session 17-18: The Wall's Secret**: While repairing Wall Rose breach, party discovers a Titan face embedded in the wall itself. Investigation leads to forbidden archives: the walls are made of Colossal Titans in crystalline hibernation. The royal family has known all along. Government sends hit squads to silence party. Commander protects them. Stakes escalate: uncover truth or be eliminated.

**Act III: The Truth of the World (Sessions 19-28)**
- **Session 19-20: Political Coup**: Survey Corps stages rebellion against corrupt regime. Urban combat, not against Titans but Military Police and royal loyalists. Moral ambiguity: deposing legitimate government during wartime. Discovery: current royal family are figureheads. Real ruler is **Rod Reiss** of a secret bloodline.

- **Session 21-22: Historia's Burden**: Party ally Historia Reiss is revealed as true heir. Her Titan-shifter ally Eren (or PC) was supposed to be eaten by her to transfer his power. Reiss family has ability called the **Founding Titan**: can command all Titans. But they refuse to use it due to ancient vow of pacifism made by first king. Historia must choose: eat her friend to gain power and end threat, or reject destiny.

- **Session 23-24: Rod Reiss's Transformation**: Rod becomes massive Aberrant Titan (120 feet tall, unstable). Threatens to destroy capital city. Party must kill him using new anti-Titan weapons. Urban siege battle. Historia delivers killing blow, becoming queen but rejecting Titan power. New government established with Survey Corps backing.

- **Session 25-26: Return to Shiganshina**: Operation to retake Wall Maria and reach protagonist's childhood home's basement—contains truth about the world. Massive battle. **Beast Titan** revealed: intelligent shifter who can control mindless Titans and throw boulders with devastating accuracy. Leads army of Titans. Commander sacrifices himself in suicidal charge. Most brutal battle yet.

- **Session 27-28: The Basement**: Party defeats Armored and Colossal Titans (killing or driving off). Reaches basement. Discovery: humanity exists thriving beyond the ocean. The walled society is actually eldians—descendants of ancient empire that could transform into Titans. They're imprisoned on this island (Paradis) by the rest of the world as punishment. The Titans are Eldians transformed and exiled as punishment. Everything—the walls, the attacks, the history—is a lie. The world is vast, and humanity within walls is actually the last remnant of a hated race.

**Act IV: War with the World (Sessions 29-40)**
- **Session 29-30: The Ocean**: Party reaches the sea for the first time. What should be a moment of triumph is overshadowed: across that ocean are nations that want them dead. Marley, the nation that sent the infiltrators, plans invasion. The enemy isn't mindless monsters—it's organized military with Titan warfare capability.

- **Session 31-32: Three Years Later**: Time skip as Paradis industrializes and militarizes using basement knowledge. Party are now veteran elite. Paradis sends covert mission to Marley. Infiltration, espionage, moral complexity: enemy soldiers are people, many Eldians forced to serve. Meet Warrior candidates—children trained to inherit Titan powers.

- **Session 33-34: Attack on Marley**: Party joins attack on Marley military during festival. Devastating raid. War officially begins. Party's Titan shifter(s) gain new powers by consuming enemy Warriors. But at what cost? The look on a child's face as you kill their mentor haunts you.

- **Session 35-36: The Rumbling Threat**: **Eren (or PC)** reveals he'll activate the Founding Titan's ultimate power: wake all Colossal Titans in the walls and march them across the world, crushing all life. Global genocide as the only way to protect Paradis. Party fractures: some agree it's necessary, others see it as monstrous. Internal conflict between former allies.

- **Session 37-38: Choosing Sides**: Party must decide: join Eren's genocide, or join the alliance of former enemies to stop him. Either way, former friends are now opponents. Battle against/alongside resurrected past Titan shifters and mindless Titans. Moral weight crushes everyone. There are no good choices.

- **Session 39-40: The Final Battle**:
  - **If supporting Eren**: Fight coalition army, protect Founding Titan, commit genocide. "Victory" ends with protagonist as history's greatest monster but Paradis safe.
  - **If opposing Eren**: Kill former ally/friend, stop Rumbling at 80% global casualty rate, attempt peace negotiations with survivors who now hate you more than ever. Bittersweet: genocide prevented but Paradis endangered.
  - **Alternative**: Discover way to eliminate Titan powers entirely, ending curse. No one can transform anymore. Titans vanish. Reduces stakes but may be too optimistic for tone.

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Titans Are Humans** (Mid Act I)
Shifter reveals that every Titan was once human. Marley transforms Eldians into Titans as punishment. The mindless monsters were people.

**Twist 2: Infiltrators Among Us** (Act II)
Fellow soldiers are enemy shifters. Armored, Colossal, and Female Titans are teenagers who trained alongside party. Betrayal by trusted comrades.

**Twist 3: The Walls Are Titans** (End Act II)
The very walls protecting humanity are made of Titans. Disturbing one could awaken all and destroy everything.

**Twist 4: Royal Family's Lie** (Act III)
Government knows the truth and actively suppresses it. They made vow to never use Founding Titan power to end conflict. Peace bought through ignorance and submission.

**Twist 5: The World Exists** (Act III)
Humanity didn't go extinct. A thriving world exists beyond the ocean. The walled Eldians are prisoners/exiles, and everyone else wants them dead.

**Twist 6: History's Victims** (Act IV)
Eldians once ruled the world through Titan power, committing atrocities. Current persecution is revenge for ancient crimes. No clear good guys.

**Twist 7: The Founder's Plan** (Act IV)
Eren plans global genocide—kill all non-Eldians to end the cycle. Some party members might agree. Forces agonizing choice.

**Twist 8: Alliance with Enemies** (Act IV)
Must team up with Reiner, Marley, and other enemies to stop Eren. Yesterday's nemeses become today's essential allies.

**Twist 9: The Curse Origin** (Hidden Lore)
Titan powers originated from Ymir Fritz making deal with earth devil 2000 years ago. She was enslaved, gained powers, built Eldian empire, died, and her power split into Nine Titans. Breaking curse requires reaching her in Paths dimension.

**Twist 10: No Happy Ending** (Throughout)
Every victory costs something. Every choice has horrific consequences. The campaign doesn't allow clean heroism. Best outcome is "least terrible."

### Victory Conditions

- Activate Rumbling, crush 100% of outside world
- Paradis becomes only civilization
- Eldians free but at cost of genocide
- Party lives with moral weight forever
- Outcome: Peace through extinction

**Path of Alliance (Stop Eren)**
- Kill Eren/remove Founding Titan
- Save remaining 20% of world
- Attempt peace negotiations
- Paradis remains threatened
- Outcome: Prevented total evil but uncertainty remains

**Path of the Curse Break (Alternative)**
- Reach Ymir in Paths dimension
- Convince her to end Titan powers
- All shifters revert to human permanently
- No more Titans ever
- Outcome: Level playing field, but no Titan defense for Paradis

**Path of Compromise (Partial Rumbling)**
- Allow limited Rumbling (destroy military threats only)
- Negotiate from position of strength
- Maintain Titan powers as deterrent
- Morally gray but pragmatic
- Outcome: Uneasy peace, arms race continues

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Party Kill**
- All members die in expedition or battle
- Campaign could continue with new Survey Corps recruits
- Original party's sacrifice becomes in-world legend

**Eren Completes Rumbling (If Opposing)**
- Failed to stop genocide
- Survive in post-apocalyptic world of Eren's making
- Resistance continues guerrilla-style
- Dark ending but campaign can continue

**Paradis Destroyed (If with Eren but Fail)**
- Alliance succeeds in stopping Rumbling too well
- Marley invades and exterminates Paradis
- Party dies as martyrs or survivors in hostile world

**Compromise Failure**
- Attempt to thread needle between extremes
- Both sides turn on party
- Hunted by everyone
- Survival becomes only goal

### Campaign Themes Summary

**Walls of Last Hope** explores cycles of violence, the sins of ancestors, and whether genocide can ever be justified. It's a campaign where every choice is terrible, but choosing nothing is worst of all. Players experience genuine horror—not just from giant monsters, but from realizing there are no good guys, including potentially themselves.

The scale creates both gameplay and moral challenge: when facing extinction, how far is too far? When the enemy is 60 feet tall and seemingly unstoppable, adapting requires sacrifice. When that enemy turns out to be human, or your friend, the campaign forces confrontation with uncomfortable truths.

This is **Attack on Titan in D&D form**: military horror, political thriller, war drama, and philosophical nightmare about freedom, duty, revenge, and the cost of survival.
