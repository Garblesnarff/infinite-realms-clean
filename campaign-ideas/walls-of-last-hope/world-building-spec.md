# Walls of Last Hope - World Building Specification

## World History and Cosmology

### The Ancient Era (2000+ Years Ago)

**Ymir Fritz and the First Titan**
The origin of all Titans traces to a single enslaved girl named Ymir Fritz. In an ancient world much like our own Bronze Age, she was a slave of the Eldian tribe. When blamed for releasing livestock, she fled into the wilderness and fell into a mysterious tree—discovering a vast underground chamber with a strange organism (the Source of All Living Matter).

Upon contact, Ymir underwent the first Titan transformation, becoming a 15-meter being of immense power. Her master, Fritz, forced her to use this power to conquer surrounding nations, build roads, and cultivate lands. Ymir served for 13 years until she died protecting Fritz from an assassination attempt. Fritz forced their three daughters—Maria, Rose, and Sina—to consume their mother's corpse, transferring the Titan power.

This established the **Curse of Ymir**: all Titan shifters die 13 years after receiving power, as that was Ymir's lifespan as a Titan.

**The Eldian Empire (1900 Years of Dominance)**
The Titan power split into Nine Titans:
1. **Founding Titan**: Commands all Titans, alters Eldian memories
2. **Attack Titan**: Future memory inheritance, freedom-seeking
3. **Colossus Titan**: 60m size, devastating heat
4. **Armored Titan**: Hardened defensive plating
5. **Female Titan**: Versatile abilities, selective hardening
6. **Beast Titan**: Animal form, throwing precision, Titan control
7. **Jaw Titan**: Speed and powerful bite
8. **Cart Titan**: Endurance and equipment carrying
9. **War Hammer Titan**: Creates weapons from hardened material

The Fritz family held the Founding Titan and ruled the Eldian Empire, which conquered the known world. Eldians intermixed with conquered peoples, spreading the genetic ability to become Titans throughout most of humanity. This period is remembered differently by winners and losers.

**Eldian Version**: Benevolent empire bringing civilization, infrastructure, and culture
**Marleyan Version**: Genocidal conquest using Titan powers to enslave and slaughter

Both contain truth. Eldians did build civilization—and also committed atrocities.

**The Great Titan War (100 Years Ago)**
After 1,900 years of rule, the Eldian Empire fractured. Several Titan-holding families rebelled against the Fritz family. One faction sided with the oppressed Marleyans. After devastating civil war, Marley gained control of seven of the Nine Titans.

**King Karl Fritz's Retreat**
The 145th Fritz King, horrified by Eldian actions and embracing pacifist philosophy, made a terrible decision:
- Gathered loyalist Eldians (approximately 1 million)
- Fled to the remote island of Paradis
- Used Founding Titan to control countless Colossal Titans
- Created three concentric walls from hardened Colossal Titans standing shoulder-to-shoulder
- Altered the memories of all Paradis Eldians, making them believe:
  - Humanity outside walls had been destroyed by Titans
  - They were the last remnants of the human race
  - The walls were built by divine will
- Made vow renouncing war: all future Founding Titan inheritors would be bound by pacifist oath

**Marley's Rise**
With Eldians weakened and Fritz gone, Marley rose as the dominant world power. They:
- Reversed the oppression: Eldians became persecuted underclass
- Used their captured seven Titans as military weapons
- Developed Titan science: transformed criminal/undesirable Eldians into Pure Titans
- Exiled these Pure Titans to Paradis Island as punishment
- Propagandized Eldians as "descendants of devils"
- Forced Eldians into internment zones, wearing identifying armbands

The world's power balance shifted, but the cycle of revenge continued.

### The Century of Isolation (100 Years Inside Walls)

**Life on Paradis Island**
The one million Eldians knew nothing of their true history:
- Believed themselves last humans
- Pure Titans (exiled criminals) wandered the island
- Walls provided safety but limited expansion
- Population grew to several hundred thousand despite constraints
- Developed culture around wall worship (justified—walls literally divine)
- Military organized into three branches:
  - **Survey Corps**: Explore beyond walls (high casualty rate)
  - **Garrison**: Defend walls and maintain order
  - **Military Police**: Serve king, live in safety of inner district

**The World Beyond (Marley and Others)**
While Paradis stagnated in medieval conditions:
- Marley industrialized using Eldian Titan labor
- Other nations developed technology to counter Titans
- Anti-Marleyan sentiment grew as Marley used Titans to conquer
- Marley sought Founding Titan to prevent King's threat (rumored ability to release all Wall Titans)
- Trained child soldiers (Warrior program) from internment zones, promising freedom

The world advanced to early 20th-century technology level while Paradis remained 19th century.

### The Campaign Era (Current Events)

**Year 845: The Fall of Wall Maria**
Marley sends Warrior candidates to retrieve Founding Titan:
- **Bertolt Hoover** (Colossal Titan)
- **Reiner Braun** (Armored Titan)
- **Annie Leonhart** (Female Titan)
- **Marcel Galliard** (Jaw Titan, killed en route by Pure Titan)

They breach Wall Maria, beginning the campaign. One-third of Paradis population dies either in attack or subsequent food crisis.

**Year 847-850: Survey Corps Recruitment and Discovery**
Campaign primary timeline. Party progresses from recruits to veterans, uncovering truths about Titans, politics, and the world.

**Year 854+: The War for Survival**
If campaign reaches end-game, global war between Paradis and world powers unfolds.

### The Paths Dimension

**Nature**: Metaphysical realm connecting all Eldians through space and time
**Appearance**: Endless desert of glowing sand under starless sky, massive tree-like structure in center
**Function**:
- Titan powers transmitted through Paths
- Founding Titan manipulates structure to alter memories, command Titans
- Time doesn't flow linearly—past and future accessible
**Inhabitant**: Ymir Fritz's consciousness, enslaved for 2000 years building Titans from Paths sand whenever an Eldian transforms

## Magic System and Cosmology

### Titan Transformation

**Requirements**:
- Must be "Subject of Ymir" (Eldian blood)
- Needs trigger: self-injury + specific intent
- Transformation costs energy, limited duration
- Creates body from nothing via Paths connection

**Pure Titan Creation**:
- Eldian injected with Titan Spinal Fluid
- Transforms into mindless 3-15m Titan
- Retains human consciousness (dormant, suffering)
- Can revert to human by consuming Shifter
- Otherwise wanders eternally, guided by base instinct to find Shifter

**Titan Biology**:
- Don't need food (sunlight powers them via Paths)
- No digestive system—victims expelled later
- Regenerate from any damage except nape destruction
- Evaporate upon death (no corpse remains)
- Weak point: nape of neck (1m tall, 10cm wide)—pilot controls from here
- Female Titans rarely appear (theory: Ymir building them in Paths prefers male forms)

**The Nine Shifter Titans**:
Each has unique abilities and 13-year lifespan limit

1. **Founding Titan** (Coordinate)
   - Abilities: Commands Pure Titans, alters Eldian memories, sees through Eldian eyes, hardens at will, creates titans

   - Size: 15m
   - Role: Breakthrough assault, defensive

5. **Female Titan**
   - Abilities: Selective hardening, scream attracts Pure Titans, high stamina, crystallization
   - Note: Name misleading—pilot is female, but ability isn't gender-specific
   - Size: 14m
   - Role: Versatile fighter, intelligence operations

6. **Beast Titan**
   - Abilities: Animal form (usually ape), throwing precision, command Pure Titans via scream, speech
   - Variable: Form depends on inheritor

**Shifter Inheritance**:
- Power transfers to random Eldian baby if Shifter dies naturally
- Or to specific person who consumes previous Shifter's spinal fluid
- Memories of previous inheritors accessible (imperfectly)
- Curse of Ymir: 13 years maximum lifespan as Shifter

**Hardening**:
- Advanced technique creating crystal-like substance
- Used for: defense, construction, self-sealing
- Permanent unless broken by Jaw Titan or massive force
- Annie encases self in crystal (impenetrable prison/protection)

**Titan Serum**:
- Spinal fluid from Titans, especially Shifters
- Injected into Eldian = Pure Titan transformation
- Different serums can affect size, abilities
- Marley weaponizes this extensively

### The Founding Titan's Power

**Memory Manipulation**:
- Can alter or erase memories of all Eldians
- Used by King Fritz to create false history
- Doesn't work on Ackerman family or certain bloodlines
- Can restore erased memories

**Titan Command**:
- Pure Titans obey absolutely
- Can activate Wall Titans
- Can make Eldians sterile (Zeke's plan)
- Can alter Eldian biology

**The Rumbling**:
- Ultimate threat: wake all Wall Titans
- Hundreds of thousands of 60m Colossal Titans
- March across world, crushing everything
- Would cause near-total human extinction

**Restrictions**:
- Needs royal blood to access full power
- OR physical contact with royal-blooded Titan
- King's vow of pacifism binds royal inheritors (unless non-royal holds it)

### Ackerman Bloodline

**Origin**: Byproduct of Titan science, enhanced humans
**Abilities**: Awakening grants superhuman physicality, combat instinct
**Immunity**: Can't become Titans, immune to memory alteration
**Notable Members**: Levi, Mikasa (if using canon characters)
**Drawback**: Occasional compulsion to protect (theory: embedded command)

### Other Eldian Bloodlines

**Royal Fritz/Reiss Family**: Can use Founding Titan fully, bound by vow
**Asian Clan**: Not Eldian, immune to memory wipes, persecuted
**Noble Families**: Genetically selected families living in Wall Sina

## Plot Secrets and Hidden Lore

### The Complete Truth (Revealed Progressively)

**Secret 1: Titans Were People** (Early Reveal)
Every Pure Titan is a transformed Eldian, suffering inside mindless body.

**Secret 2: Shifters Among Us** (Early-Mid)
Trusted comrades are enemy agents. Reiner, Bertolt, Annie—child soldiers on mission.

**Secret 3: The World Exists** (Mid)
Humanity thrives beyond walls. Paradis Eldians are imprisoned, hated minority.

**Secret 4: Walls Are Titans** (Mid)
The walls are composed of hardened Colossal Titans. Thousands of them.

**Secret 5: Royal Family's Lie** (Mid-Late)
Government knows everything, chose ignorance, bound by pacifist vow.

**Secret 6: Eldian Empire's Sins** (Late)
Eldians once ruled world through Titan terror. Current persecution isn't baseless—it's revenge.

**Secret 7: No Good Guys** (Late)
Both sides committed atrocities. Cycle of violence has no clear origin or heroes.

**Secret 8: Ymir's Slavery** (Late)
Titan powers sustained by one girl's enslavement for 2000 years in timeless dimension.

**Secret 9: The Curse is Breakable** (Very Late)
Freeing Ymir ends Titan powers forever—but removes Paradis's only defense.

**Secret 10: Future Was Seen** (Late)
Attack Titan's future-sight means Eren/protagonist saw inevitable outcome. All paths lead to terrible choice: genocide or extinction.

### Hidden Lore Details

**The Source of All Living Matter**:
Unknown organism at Tree's base. Origin unclear—alien? Divine? Natural? Grants Titan power.

**Why Only Eldians?**:
Ymir's daughters consuming her spread genetic marker through reproduction. Now millions have latent ability.

**Titan Weakness Explanation**:
Nape houses pilot (Shifters) or core consciousness (Pure Titans). Destroying it severs Paths connection.

**Wall Construction**:
King Fritz commanded countless Eldians to transform into Colossal Titans, then hardened them in formation. They remain aware inside (horror upon horror).

**Memory Inheritance**:
Imperfect—requires effort, appears as dreams, can mislead. Attack Titan's future-sight unique (sees memories that don't exist yet via Paths timelessness).

**Why Mindless Titans Seek Shifters**:
Instinct to consume Shifter and return to human. They're trying to be free.

**Ackerman Power Origin**:
Result of Titan science experiments creating warrior bloodline. "Awakening" is embedded combat instinct activating.

**Historia's Importance**:
Last royal bloodline willing to reject vow. Represents different path—mercy without passivity.

**Zeke's True Plan**:
Make all Eldians sterile. Race dies out peacefully in one generation, ending both curse and persecution. Utilitarian nightmare presented as mercy.

**Eren's Determination**:
Saw every possible future. All lead to Paradis destruction except Rumbling. Chose omnicide to save his people. Sympathetic monster.

### Campaign Variables

DMs can adjust these secrets' validity:
- Maybe Eldians weren't as bad as Marley claims
- Maybe they were worse
- Maybe Ymir wants freedom—or likes her role
- Maybe technology will make Titans obsolete anyway
- Maybe there's a third option for ending

The campaign works because moral certainty is impossible.

### DM Notes

**Pacing**: This campaign requires careful pacing—too fast and revelations lose impact, too slow and players grow frustrated. Each arc should answer questions while raising new ones.

**Moral Complexity**: Don't simplify. Both sides have justifications. Push players to uncomfortable positions.

**Lethality**: NPCs should die frequently. PCs can die—have backup characters ready. Death is cheap except emotionally.

**Research**: Familiarity with source material helps but isn't required. This spec provides essentials.

**Flexibility**: If players theorize better plot than planned, use it. Reward investigation and thought.

**Tone Management**: Balance horror, camaraderie, action, politics. Too much darkness overwhelms; too much levity breaks immersion.

**End-Game Choice**: Don't force specific ending. All paths have narrative weight. Support player decision.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: The campaign deals with genocide, ethnic persecution, child soldiers, fascism. Handle with maturity and awareness.
