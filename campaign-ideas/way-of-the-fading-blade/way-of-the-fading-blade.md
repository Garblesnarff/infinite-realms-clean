## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act tragedy of fading glory and ultimate choice.

*   **Act I — The Outsider (Sessions 1-6):** A foreign warrior (or samurai fallen from grace) is hired by Lord Katsumoto to train his army. They learn the samurai code—bushido, honor, sword mastery, Zen philosophy. They discover that samurai aren't just warriors but artists, poets, and philosophers. The Emperor's modernization threatens this entire culture. They witness traditional samurai humiliated by modern conscript armies.

*   **Act II — The Rebellion (Sessions 7-13):** Katsumoto's faction opposes the Emperor's policies, especially the ban on carrying swords. Political tension erupts into open conflict. The party leads traditional samurai and trained peasants against modern Imperial army with rifles and Gatling guns. They win early victories through discipline and terrain, but modernity's advantage becomes clear. Moral question: Is preserving honor worth dooming Japan to weakness against Western powers?

*   **Act III — The Last Battle (Sessions 14-20):** Surrounded and outgunned, Katsumoto prepares for final stand. The party must choose: adapt samurai ways to modern world, die honorably preserving tradition, or find synthesis between old and new. Final battle is samurai charge against entrenched guns—beautiful, tragic, and doomed. Campaign ends exploring whether they preserved something worth saving or became casualties of inevitable progress.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores tradition vs progress, honor in a changing world, and whether some things are worth dying for even if doomed. It asks: Can tradition adapt or must it die pure? Is honor more important than survival? Do beautiful deaths matter if they change nothing? The central conflict pits samurai values against modern efficiency, individual mastery against mass production, and the question of what Japan loses and gains through modernization.
