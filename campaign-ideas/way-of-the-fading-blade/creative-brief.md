## Art Style: Traditional Japanese Aesthetic Meets Meiji Modernization

Inspired by *The Last Samurai* and historical Meiji period. Captures the austere beauty of samurai culture, the clash between traditional Japan and Western modernity, and the tragic elegance of a dying way of life.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Traditional Beauty:** Cherry blossoms, bamboo forests, traditional architecture, sword artistry
*   **Cultural Contrast:** Samurai armor vs Western uniforms, katana vs rifles, tea ceremony vs industrialization
*   **Seasonal Metaphors:** Cherry blossoms falling, autumn leaves, winter snow, spring renewal
*   **Disciplined Violence:** Precise sword techniques, archery form, beautiful death poses

### Color Palette:

*   **Traditional:** Muted earth tones, black lacquer armor, white and red samurai banners
*   **Cherry Blossoms:** Soft pinks against dark bark, petals falling in wind
*   **Imperial Modern:** Western military blues and reds, factory grays, steel rifles
*   **Natural:** Forest greens, mountain grays, rice field golds, misty mornings

## Voice

A measured, contemplative voice that finds poetry in violence and philosophy in death. Speaks with the cadence of haiku—economical words carrying deep meaning. Tone shifts between martial discipline during combat, gentle wisdom during teaching, and melancholic beauty when discussing the fading of tradition. Accent suggests Japanese formality even in translation. Role: The voice of dying elegance facing inevitable modernity.
