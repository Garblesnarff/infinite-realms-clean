# The Platinum Fork Trials - World-Building Specification

## The Platinum Fork Society

### Foundation and Purpose
- Founded 500 years ago by chefs tired of inconsistent quality
- Wanted objective standards for excellence
- Made pact with Flavoris, deity of taste
- Power corrupted within two generations
- Now: Feared institution maintaining order through terror

### Magical Binding Explained
- Critics channel Flavoris's divine judgment
- Words written in official review become reality
- Positive reviews grant supernatural success
- Negative reviews literally curse establishments
- Platinum Fork is permanent divine blessing

### The Ten Platinum Forks in History
1. **The First Feast** (Revoked - Chef went mad)
2. **Mountain's Bounty** (Still operating after 300 years)
3. **Ocean's Whisper** (Revoked - Used slavery)
4. **The Ember Grill** (Destroyed in war)
5. **Twilight Garden** (Owner requested revocation, couldn't handle success)
6. **The Crystal Table** (Revoked - Quality dropped)
7. **Harmony's Kitchen** (Still operating, peaceful)
8. **The Spice Emperor** (Revoked - Political reasons)
9. **Last Light Bistro** (Owner died, fork died with them)
10. **To Be Awarded** (Party's decision this campaign)

### Society Structure
- Grand Critic (Augustina) - Supreme authority
- Council of Nine - Senior critics
- Active Critics (20-30) - Full members, includes party
- Apprentices (50+) - Learning the trade
- Archivists - Record and maintain reviews
- Enforcers - Deal with violations and threats

### Training and Advancement
- Selected as apprentices through mysterious process
- Years of training in taste, language, ethics (supposedly)
- Elevation to full critic requires unanimous Council approval
- Platinum Fork authority requires decades of service (usually)
- Party is exceptionally accelerated (suspicious)

## The Review Circuit
