# Creative Brief: The Metal Dawn

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Tribal Post-Apocalypse with Robot Wildlife (Horizon Zero Dawn-inspired)

Inspired by the stunning aesthetic of *Horizon Zero Dawn*. This style captures nature reclaiming civilization, robot dinosaurs grazing in meadows, tribal cultures using primitive weapons against advanced tech, and the beauty of a world that ended and began again. Everything is lush, colorful, and hopeful despite the apocalypse.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Nature's Victory:** Green forests overtaking rusted skyscrapers, life thriving
*   **Robot Animals:** Mechanical creatures resembling dinosaurs and prehistoric animals, beautiful in their design
*   **Tribal Tech:** Primitive weapons and clothing scavenged from machine parts
*   **Vibrant Colors:** Rich greens, bright blues, sunset oranges contrasting with metal

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Post-apocalyptic hope, robot dinosaurs, tribal hunters, ancient mystery, nature reclaiming, chosen one, proving yourself
*   **Feeling:** Standing on a ridge watching mechanical deer graze in a valley. Discovering the truth of an apocalypse in buried ruins. The beauty of a second chance.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Environments:** Vibrant greens (forests), golden yellows (grasslands), rich blues (sky and water), sunset oranges
*   **Machines:** Metallic silvers with colored accents (blue optics, red fuel canisters, glowing parts)
*   **Ruins:** Rust reds, concrete grays, overgrown with vines and moss
*   **Tribes:** Earth tones—browns, greens, reds—with bright accents from machine parts
*   **Prompt Example:** "...vibrant color palette. Lush green forest with massive trees, sunlight filtering through leaves. In the foreground, a mechanical deer-like creature (Watcher) with sleek metal plating and glowing blue eye. Tribal hunter in leather and furs with bow drawn. Background shows rusted skyscraper overtaken by vines. Rich, saturated colors—greens, blues, earth tones."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Tribal Hunters:** Practical leather and fur clothing, scavenged machine parts as accessories, face paint, braided hair
*   **Nora:** Nature-focused, browns and greens, matriarchal symbols
*   **Carja:** Elaborate, sun symbols, golds and reds, more civilized appearance
*   **The Protagonist:** Red hair (iconic), practical armor made from machine parts, Focus device on ear
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tribal hunter with long red hair in braids, wearing leather armor with metal plates scavenged from machines. Blue glowing Focus device on her temple. Carrying a composite bow with multiple arrow types in quiver. Determined expression. Standing in tall grass with mechanical creatures visible in distance. Photorealistic style."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Post-Apocalyptic Nature:** Forests, grasslands, deserts, mountains—all pristine and beautiful
*   **Ruins Reclaimed:** Skyscrapers as massive trees grow through them, bridges collapsed and moss-covered
*   **Tribal Settlements:** Primitive villages built in ruins, using scavenged materials artistically
*   **Cauldrons:** Underground factories, high-tech and pristine, stark contrast to surface
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast landscape: rolling green hills and forests in the foreground. In the middle distance, a rusted city skyline overtaken by nature—trees growing through buildings, vines covering everything. Grazing in the fields are multiple mechanical creatures—some deer-like, some larger dinosaur-like. Bright blue sky with wispy clouds. Photorealistic, rich detail, vibrant colors."

**5. Machines:**
*   **Small:** Watchers (deer-scouts), Striders (horse-transports), Grazers (antelope-herds)
*   **Medium:** Sawtooths (saber-tooth hunters), Ravagers (wolf-like with guns), Bellowbacks (fire/freeze tanks)
*   **Large:** Thunderjaws (T-Rex with weapons), Behemoths (transport haulers), Stormbirds (flying predators)
*   **Ancient:** Deathbringers and Corruptors (Faro war machines, insectoid horrors)
*   **Design:** Sleek, believable robot animals with visible components, weak points, purpose-built
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Thunderjaw: massive mechanical T-Rex with disc launchers on its back, radar on its head, heavy armor plating. Metal construction with visible joints and hydraulics. Glowing blue optics. Weathered metal texture. Standing in grassland, dwarfing a tribal hunter. Photorealistic, emphasizing the scale. Dynamic pose showing it's alert."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Photorealistic:** High detail, natural lighting, realistic material properties
*   **Golden Hour:** Many scenes use warm sunset or sunrise lighting
*   **Vibrant:** Colors are saturated but believable, emphasizing beauty
*   **Prompt Example:** "...golden hour lighting with warm orange sun low on horizon. Long shadows across grassland. Natural volumetric lighting through trees. Metallic surfaces reflect sunset warmly. Photorealistic render with high detail on textures—grass, leather, metal. Vibrant but natural colors."

## Voice

A voice carrying determination and wonder, like someone discovering their purpose while uncovering impossible truths. The pacing builds from personal to planetary stakes. The tone shifts between tribal humility, awe at ancient technology, and fierce resolve. There's an underlying theme of second chances and proving yourself. Role: The voice of the outcast who saves the world.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Orchestral with electronic elements and tribal drums. Joris de Man and The Flight-style epic scope mixed with intimate moments.
*   **Exploration:** Peaceful orchestral with ethnic instruments, emphasizing nature's beauty.
*   **Machine Sounds:** Each machine type has unique mechanical sounds—clanks, whirrs, roars mixed with animal sounds.
*   **Combat:** Tribal drums, urgent strings, electronic beats when fighting machines.
*   **Boss Machines:** Epic orchestral swells, massive drums, choir for legendary creatures.
*   **Ruins/Holograms:** Ethereal, haunting, synthesizers representing lost technology.
