# Chronicles of the Somnolent Oracle - World-Building Specification

## Temporal Mechanics

### Timeline Types
**Prime Timeline**: The "main" sequence of events
**Branch Timelines**: Alternate possibilities created by choices
**Dead-End Timelines**: Paths leading to apocalypse
**Loop Timelines**: Recursive paradoxes
**Null Timelines**: Prevented futures

### Fixed Points vs. Fluid Events
**Fixed Points** (Cannot Be Changed):
- Certain deaths that cause major changes
- Meetings that create important relationships
- Discoveries that advance civilization
- Golden glow in prophetic visions
- Attempting to change causes temporal backlash

**Fluid Events** (Can Be Changed):
- Most minor occurrences
- Many deaths and births
- Personal choices
- Relationships
- Appear normal in visions

### Paradox Types
**Bootstrap Paradox**: Information from future creates itself
**Grandfather Paradox**: Changing past erases future
**Predestination Paradox**: Trying to prevent causes event
**Ontological Paradox**: Effect causes its own cause

## The Circle of Seers Detailed

### Members
**Grandmother Oracle**: Oldest, sees furthest, wise but cryptic
**Death Seer**: Specializes in seeing deaths, haunted by knowledge
**Birth Oracle**: Sees new lives, generally optimistic
**Disaster Prophet**: Sees catastrophes, constantly anxious
**Love Seer**: Sees relationships, romantic but realistic
**War Oracle**: Sees conflicts, militant personality

### Philosophy Debate
**Interventionists**: Use prophecy to help people
**Fatalists**: Never interfere with what they see
**Selective Seers**: Only prevent certain types of futures
**Chroniclers**: Record but don't act

## The Inevitability Deep Dive

### True Nature
- Not evil—maintains causality
- Protects timeline coherence
- Prevents paradoxes from collapsing reality
- Cannot be killed, only reasoned with or delayed
- May be future party member or collective unconscious

### Methods
- Enforces fixed points violently
- Creates temporal barriers
- Hunts those who change too much
- Can reverse changes by force
- Works backward through time

### Possible Truths
- Theory 1: Protecting stable timeline
- Theory 2: Enforcing bad timeline
- Theory 3: Testing Oracles' worthiness
- Theory 4: Itself a paradox that shouldn't exist

## Prophetic Dream Categories

### Clear Prophecies
- Literal visions of exact future
- Rare but unmistakable
- High accuracy
- Often fixed points

### Symbolic Prophecies
- Metaphorical imagery requiring interpretation
- Most common type
- Easy to misunderstand
- Open to multiple readings

### False Prophecies
- Visions of timelines that cannot manifest
- Planted by enemies or natural noise
- Distinguishing them is difficult
- Following them leads to disaster

### Paradox Prophecies
- Visions that create themselves
- Seeing them makes them true
- Not seeing them means they don't happen
- Quantum observer effect

## Temporal Dreamscape Geography

### The Library of Tomorrows
- Infinite books, each a possible future
- Reading them shows that timeline
- Some books blank (prevented futures)
- Some books locked (fixed points)

### The Tree of Time
- Trunk: Prime timeline
- Branches: Alternate possibilities
- Dead branches: Prevented futures
- Roots: Past events
- Climbing shows different timelines

### The Ocean of Moments
- Each wave is a moment in time
- Swimming through shows temporal flow
- Diving deep: Seeing far future
- Rising high: Seeing far past
- Drowning: Lost in time

### The Mirror of What-If
- Shows consequences of different choices
- Can preview before deciding
- Sometimes lies
- Breaks when paradox occurs

## The Time Storm Mechanics

### Causes
- Too many timeline changes
- Conflicting prophecies
- Paradox accumulation
- Fixed point violations

### Effects
**Stage 1**: Temporal bleeding (past/future visible)
**Stage 2**: Causality weakening (effect before cause)
**Stage 3**: Timeline fragmentation (multiple realities)
**Stage 4**: Temporal collapse (timeline ends)

### Prevention
- Limit changes to fluid events
- Respect fixed points
- Resolve paradoxes quickly
- Accept some futures cannot be changed

## Character Corruption Path

### Stage 1: Clarity (Beginning)
- Clear prophetic visions
- Normal temporal perception
- Full control

### Stage 2: Doubling (Early)
- Sometimes see multiple timelines
- Occasional déjà vu
- Minor time disorientation

### Stage 3: Fracturing (Middle)
- Constantly aware of alternate timelines
- Speaking in tenses incorrectly
- Aging irregularly

### Stage 4: Unstuck (Late)
- Experiencing multiple times simultaneously
- Becoming like Chronos
- Losing anchor to present

### Stage 5: Entity (Final)
- Becoming temporal being
- Like the Inevitability
- No longer truly human

## Victory Paths Detailed

### Path 1: The Acceptance
- Stop fighting fate
- Accept determinism
- Find peace in lack of control
- Surrender prophecy power

### Path 2: The Revolution
- Prove free will exists
- Defeat Inevitability
- Establish new temporal rules
- Risk timeline collapse

### Path 3: The Balance
- Change only what should change
- Accept only what must be
- Thread the needle perfectly

### Path 4: The Transcendence
- Become new Chronos
- Exist in all times simultaneously
- Guide future Oracles
- Sacrifice linear existence

## Hidden Lore

### Origin of Prophetic Dreams
Ancient civilization discovered Temporal Dreamscape. Opened pathway for future knowledge to flow to present. Created first Oracles. Civilization destroyed itself with foresight. Gateway never fully closed. Party is latest in long line.

### The Inevitability's Truth
It IS a future party member who prevented every disaster and created worse timeline. Now enforces that timeline. To break cycle, party must NOT become it. But circumstances seem to force same choices.

### The Ultimate Prophecy
One vision shows timeline where prophetic dreaming ends forever. This might be best outcome—humanity not meant to know future. Or worst outcome—losing precious gift. Party must decide.

### Chronos's Test
Entire campaign is test to see if party is worthy to join temporal guardians. Every choice is evaluated. Passing means transcendence. Failing means stripped of prophecy. There is no neutral outcome.
