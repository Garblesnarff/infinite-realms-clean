# Chronicles of the Somnolent Oracle
## "The Future Haunts Their Dreams"

### Campaign Overview

The party begins experiencing prophetic dreams—visions of future events they can prevent or cause. They are Somnolent Oracles, rare individuals whose sleeping minds touch timeline branches and probability streams. Each dream shows a possible future, and their waking actions determine which version manifests. They can save lives, prevent disasters, and change fate itself—but every change creates ripples, and some futures fight back.

The campaign centers on the Temporal Dreamscape, a realm where past, present, and future exist simultaneously. The party must navigate visions of what was, what is, what might be, and what must never be. They're opposed by the Inevitability—an entity that enforces "destiny" and punishes those who change "fixed points." As the party grows more powerful, they discover their prophetic gift is both blessing and curse: the more they change, the more they're hunted by temporal predators and corrupted by foresight.

This campaign explores free will vs. determinism, the burden of foreknowledge, self-fulfilling vs. self-defeating prophecies, and whether knowing the future means you can change it or are doomed to cause it.

### Core Themes

- **Prophecy and Choice**: Can you change what you foresee?
- **Temporal Responsibility**: Should you alter fate?
- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Actions to prevent visions may cause them
- **The Weight of Knowing**: Foreknowledge as burden
- **Fixed Points vs. Fluid Time**: What can and cannot be changed

### Key NPCs

**The Inevitability** (Antagonist)
A temporal enforcement entity that appears as a figure in backwards-running time (moves in reverse, speaks backward, ages younger). Claims to maintain causality and prevent paradoxes. Hunts those who change "fixed points." Cold, logical, seemingly cruel but may be protecting timeline stability. Possibly a future version of a party member who went too far with foresight. Cannot be killed—only delayed or convinced.

**Chronos** (Keeper of the Temporal Dreamscape)
An ageless being who dwells where all time is simultaneous. Appears as child, adult, and elderly person overlapping. Neutral arbiter who teaches Oracles to navigate prophecy. Speaks in past and future tense simultaneously. Knows everything that has happened and will happen but refuses to interfere directly. May be testing whether party is worthy of prophetic power.

**Cassandra Prime** (Tragic Oracle)
The first Somnolent Oracle, cursed to see truth but never be believed. Has been warning about the Time Storm for centuries. Everyone ignores her—even the party at first. Proves to be right about everything. Bitter but still trying to help. Her curse might be key to understanding prophecy's nature. In final sessions, her warnings become crucial.

**Future Self (Variant)** (Paradox)
The party meets their own future versions—but different choices created different people. Some are heroic, others villainous, some broken by foreknowledge. Each represents a possible outcome. Helping or fighting them influences which future manifests. One might be the Inevitability.

**The Circle of Seers** (Allied Faction)
Other prophetic dreamers forming support network. Each has different specialization—one sees deaths, one sees births, one sees disasters, one sees personal futures. Led by Grandmother Oracle who has seen furthest. Debate whether to share visions or keep silent. Some members believe prophecy should never be acted upon.

**Paradox the Chronomancer** (Wild Card)
A time mage who can manipulate when, not just see it. Reckless, brilliant, dangerous. Offers shortcuts to change fate but at terrible costs. May be ally or enemy depending on party's choices. Claims the Inevitability is wrong. Or might be using party for own agenda.

**The Butterfly** (Innocent Victim)
A child whose death the party foresees. Saving them is the inciting incident. But each attempt to save creates worse problem. Maybe they're meant to die. Maybe saving them causes catastrophe. Maybe the real test is accepting you can't save everyone. Their fate becomes symbolic of prophecy's burden.

### Major Locations

**Temporal Dreamscape** (Core Location)
A realm where linear time doesn't exist. Past, present, future visible simultaneously. Appears as vast library where each book is a timeline. Or as branching tree where each branch is a choice. Or as ocean where each wave is a moment. Perception varies by viewer. Navigating it risks temporal madness but grants ultimate foresight.

**The Chamber of Echoes** (Vision Hub)
Where prophetic dreams originate. A crystalline cave filled with temporal echoes—visions of all possible futures playing at once. Overwhelming to untrained minds. The Circle of Seers meditate here to sharpen foresight. Contains the Prime Mirror showing truest timeline.

**Fixed Point Monuments** (Cannot Change)
Locations/events that are temporally locked. Appear in dreams with golden glow. Attempting to change them causes violent temporal backlash. Examples: Certain deaths, certain meetings, certain discoveries. The party must learn to recognize them or suffer consequences.

**The Paradox Zone** (Dangerous)
Area where timeline contradictions have accumulated. Past and future exist simultaneously. You can meet yourself. Cause and effect are optional. Extended exposure causes dissociation. But also where greatest changes are possible. The Inevitability guards its borders.

**Your Own Grave** (Symbolic)
Each party member dreams of their death. The grave site exists in multiple timelines. Visiting it in waking world provides clues about which future manifests. Changing your own death is most difficult prophecy to affect—often self-fulfilling. Some versions show heroic sacrifice. Others show murder. A few show peaceful old age.

**The Branching Paths** (Decision Point)
Physical crossroads that exist in both Temporal Dreamscape and waking world. Standing here lets Oracles see immediate consequences of different choices. Minor version of perfect foresight. Paradox created them. The Inevitability tries to destroy them. Party must defend or let them fall.

**The Archive of Never-Was** (Repository)
Library containing records of prevented timelines. Every catastrophe avoided, every death prevented, every disaster averted. Maintained by Chroniclers who remember erased futures. Proves prophecy works—or proves how much damage changing fate causes. Contains warnings about going too far.

### Unique Mechanics

**Prophetic Vision System**
- Dreams show possible futures (not certain)
- Interpretation required—symbolic vs. literal
- Waking actions determine which future manifests
- Some visions are warnings, others are traps
- Roll Insight to understand true meaning

**Timeline Branching**
- Major choices create timeline splits
- Track which branch party is on
- Can switch branches through specific actions
- Some branches more stable than others
- Dead-end branches lead to apocalypse

**Fixed Point Recognition**
- Golden glow in dreams indicates unchangeable events
- Attempting to change causes temporal backlash damage
- Learning which points are fixed is survival skill
- Some fixed points are tests—not really fixed
- The Inevitability enforces "false" fixed points

**Prophecy Corruption**
- Overusing foresight causes temporal taint
- Symptoms: Seeing multiple timelines at once, aging irregularly, speaking in past/future tense
- Advanced corruption: Becoming unstuck in time
- Final stage: Becoming temporal entity like Inevitability
- Managed through accepting uncertainty

**Self-Fulfilling Paradox**
- Some prophecies come true BECAUSE you try to prevent them
- Classic example: Foresee betrayal, suspect ally, treat them poorly, cause betrayal
- Mechanics: DM tracks whether prevention causes vision
- Player agency vs. narrative destiny

**Future Knowledge Economy**
- Party can use foresight for advantage
- Knowing enemy tactics before fight
- Preventing ambushes
- Finding hidden items shown in dreams
- But overuse alerts Inevitability

**Death Defiance**
- If party member dies in prophesied way, they can spend resource to "remember" dying and avoid it
- Limited uses
- Creates timeline branch
- Might make things worse
- Represents changing fate

### Plot Twists

**Twist 1: The Inevitability Is Future You**
One party member goes so far with prophecy they become temporal enforcer. They're hunting their past self. The loop must be broken or fulfilled.

**Twist 2: Prophecies Are Self-Fulfilling**
Every vision the party has seen was caused by their actions to prevent it. They're not seeing future—they're creating it through paranoia.

**Twist 3: The Prime Timeline Is Terrible**
The "fixed" timeline Inevitability protects leads to apocalypse. They're not heroes maintaining reality—they're enforcing doom. Party must rebel against fate itself.

**Twist 4: They're Not Seeing the Future**
They're seeing parallel timelines, not future ones. Every "change" just switches which timeline they experience. No actual time travel—just timeline hopping.

**Twist 5: The First Prophecy Was a Test**
Saving the Butterfly was Chronos testing them. They passed by caring enough to try. But trying set events in motion that lead here. The test was the trap.

**Twist 6: One Vision Is Absolutely True**
Among many fluid prophecies, ONE is fixed—party's greatest triumph or worst tragedy. They must determine which vision is the true one and ensure/prevent it.

### Victory Conditions

**Accept Fate**: Stop trying to change prophecies, let timeline flow naturally, find peace in determinism
**Change Everything**: Successfully rewrite timeline, defeat Inevitability, prove free will exists
**Become Chronos**: Transcend time, become new keeper, guide future Oracles
**Perfect Timeline**: Thread the needle—make precise changes that create best outcome

### Defeat Conditions

**Temporal Collapse**: Too many changes break causality, timeline ends
**Total Corruption**: Party becomes temporal entities, lose humanity
**Fixed Doom**: Fail to prevent the one true prophecy
**Eternal Foresight**: Become omniscient of all futures, paralyzed by infinite choice, unable to act
