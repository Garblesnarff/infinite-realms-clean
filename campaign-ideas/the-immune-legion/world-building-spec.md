# World-Building Specification: The Immune Legion

## Human Body as Campaign Setting

### Scale
- Party: 10 micrometers (white blood cell size)
- Red blood cells: 6-8 micrometers
- White blood cells: 10-20 micrometers
- Bacteria: 1-10 micrometers
- Viruses: 0.02-0.3 micrometers (tiny even at micro scale)
- Blood vessels: Capillaries 5-10 micrometers wide, arteries millimeters (massive)

### The Immune System Structure

**Innate Immunity (First Response)**
- **Neutrophils:** Front-line soldiers, 60% of white blood cells, short-lived (hours to days), engulf bacteria
- **Macrophages:** Large phagocytes, generals/commanders, long-lived, versatile
- **Dendritic Cells:** Scouts and presenters, show antigens to adaptive immune system
- **Natural Killer Cells:** Assassins targeting virus-infected and cancer cells
- **Complement System:** Protein cascade creating holes in pathogens

**Adaptive Immunity (Specialized Response)**
- **T-Cells:** Trained assassins, learn to recognize specific threats, coordinate responses
- **B-Cells:** Antibody factories, produce Y-shaped proteins targeting pathogens, intelligence network
- **Memory Cells:** Remember past infections, faster response to repeat invaders

**Support Systems**
- **Red Blood Cells:** Oxygen delivery, non-sentient cargo haulers in campaign
- **Platelets:** Clotting and wound repair
- **Lymphatic System:** Immune cell highway and filtration
- **Bone Marrow:** Blood cell production facility
- **Thymus:** T-cell training academy
- **Spleen:** Blood filtration and immune storage
- **Lymph Nodes:** Regional immune headquarters

### Organs as Kingdoms

**The Lungs**
- Function: Gas exchange
- Environment: Airy, oxygen-rich, delicate tissue
- Threat: Respiratory infections
- Defense Priority: Keep airways clear

**The Liver**
- Function: Detoxification, metabolism
- Environment: Complex filtration system
- Threat: Toxin accumulation
- Campaign Role: Processing center under siege

**The Heart**
- Function: Pumping blood
- Environment: Powerful muscle contractions, high-pressure chambers
- Threat: If infected, immediate death
- Campaign Role: Must-defend at all costs

**The Gut**
- Function: Digestion, microbiome habitat
- Environment: Acidic, teeming with friendly bacteria
- Unique: Home to beneficial microbiome civilization
- Campaign Role: Allied bacterial kingdom

**The Kidneys**
- Function: Filtration and waste removal
- Environment: Complex tubular system
- Threat: Toxin accumulation if blocked
- Campaign Role: Environmental puzzle

**The Brain**
- Function: Neural processing
- Environment: Extremely delicate, well-protected
- Threat: Neurological damage if infected
- Campaign Role: Final defense of blood-brain barrier

## Pathogen Biology

### Bacterial Threats
- Reproduce by division (exponential growth)
- Form biofilms (defensive structures)
- Produce toxins (weapons)
- Adapt through mutation
- Campaign: Main soldiers of Pathogen Collective

### Viral Threats
- Hijack cells to reproduce
- Smaller, harder to target
- Spread quickly
- Different strategies than bacteria
- Campaign: Infiltrators and saboteurs

### Magical Enhancement
- Bioweapon combines natural pathogens with magic
- Grants intelligence and coordination
- Allows rapid adaptation
- Creates Pathogen Collective hivemind
- Makes standard treatments ineffective

## Immune Response Mechanics

### Phagocytosis
- White blood cells engulf pathogens
- Digest within cell
- Campaign: Immune cells can "eat" enemies

### Antibody Targeting
- Y-shaped proteins bind specific antigens
- Mark pathogens for destruction
- Neutralize toxins
- Campaign: B-cells produce antibodies as power-up

### Inflammation
- Swelling, heat, redness
- Increases blood flow
- Recruits immune cells
- Campaign: Environmental effect

### Fever
- Elevated body temperature
- Inhibits pathogen growth
- Speeds immune response
- Campaign: Environmental hazard/advantage

### Cytokine Signaling
- Chemical messengers coordinate immune response
- Campaign: Communication network between immune forces

## The Assassination Plot

### Method
- Magical bioweapon disguised as natural disease
- Targets royal bloodline specifically
- Adapts to resist treatment
- Designed to look like illness not murder

### Conspirators
- Rival noble house
- Court biomancer (traitor)
- Foreign agents
- Campaign: External investigation runs parallel to internal battle

### Evidence
- Magical signatures in pathogen
- Paper trail of biomancer research
- Testimony from captured minions
- Party's observations from inside body

## Campaign Tone: Osmosis Jones Inspiration

### Anthropomorphization
- Cells have personalities
- Body functions as civilization
- Organs as cities/kingdoms
- Immune system as military/police

### Humor and Heart
- Can have lighter moments despite serious stakes
- Cell character interactions
- Fish-out-of-water party in biological world
- But ultimately: Life-or-death stakes

### Educational Value
- Accurate biology underneath fantasy
- Players learn about immune system
- Memorable because engaging
- Science meets storytelling

## DM Customization

### Difficulty
- Pathogen strength and adaptation rate
- Number of organs infected
- Time until prince's death
- External conspiracy complexity

### Tone Options
- **Serious Medical Drama:** Realistic biology, grim stakes
- **Osmosis Jones Fun:** Lighter, personified cells, adventure
- **Balanced:** Mix of both

### Integration
- Standalone medical adventure
- Part of political intrigue campaign
- Introduction to biomancy magic
- Party gains permanent biological knowledge/abilities

### Expansion
- Other patients needing internal treatment
- Autoimmune disease campaign (misguided immune system)
- Cancer campaign (rogue cells)
- Transplant rejection scenario
- Long-term: Party becomes specialized medical adventurers
