# Creative Brief: The Emotion Manifold

## Art Style: Abstract Expressionism (Pollock / Rothko / de Kooning-inspired)

Pure emotion as color and form. No representational imagery. Gestural brushwork. Color fields. Drips, slashes, washes representing psychological states.

### Core Principles:
- **Emotion as Pure Form**: No objects, only feeling made visible
- **Gestural Energy**: Violent brushstrokes, action painting, frozen motion
- **Color Field Psychology**: Large areas of single color representing emotional states
- **Spontaneous Expression**: Unplanned, raw, immediate
- **Scale and Immersion**: Overwhelming size, viewer absorbed into painting

### Visual Style:
Pollock's chaotic drips for anxiety/violence, Rothko's color fields for melancholy/depth, de Kooning's violent gestures for rage/confrontation. No recognizable forms.

## Music: Atonal / Noise / Emotional Soundscape
Penderecki, Ligeti atmospheres, but also emotional - violent crashes for rage, sustained tones for melancholy, chaotic noise for anxiety. Pure feeling as sound.

## Voice Acting:
Wordless emotional sounds. Screams, sobs, laughter. When words exist, they're fragmented, disconnected, pure emotional vocalization.
