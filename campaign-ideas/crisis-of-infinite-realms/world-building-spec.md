### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Crisis of Infinite Realms**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The multiverse is collapsing. Across infinite realities, worlds are being consumed by waves of antimatter unleashed by the Anti-Monitor, a being of pure entropy from the space between dimensions. The players discover they are echoes of the same soul across different realities, and they must unite champions from dying worlds to make a stand at the Dawn of Time itself. As realities merge and heroes from countless timelines gather for a final battle, only the ultimate sacrifice can save what remains of existence—and the players must decide who will make it.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the structure of the multiverse: how many realities exist, how they differ, and how they interact.
    *   Write the history of the Monitor and Anti-Monitor: their birth, their eternal conflict, and their nature.
    *   Describe the Dawn of Time: the birth and death of the first reality and the creation of the void.
    *   Explain what Constant Souls are and why they exist across infinite realities.
    *   Detail the nature of antimatter and how it consumes realities.
    *   Write about previous multiversal crises and how they were resolved.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Monitor's Champions** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Stop the Anti-Monitor and save the multiverse.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Monitor, with the player characters as field commanders and various recruited heroes.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To gather champions from dying worlds and make a stand at the Nexus of All Realities.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Monitor knows someone must sacrifice themselves but hasn't revealed this yet.
        *   **Assets:** Dimensional travel technology, the Nexus fortress, knowledge of the multiverse, armies of heroes from saved worlds.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with all who oppose the Anti-Monitor; seeking to redeem the Harbinger; fighting shadow-demon armies.
    *   **The Anti-Monitor's Legion** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Erase all existence and return the multiverse to void.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Anti-Monitor, with the Harbinger as herald and shadow-demons as footsoldiers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—it simply consumes without negotiation or mercy.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Anti-Monitor fears being erased retroactively at its moment of birth.
        *   **Assets:** Antimatter waves, infinite shadow-demons, corrupted heroes from destroyed realities, the Harbinger's tactical genius.
        *   **Relationships:** Enemy of all existence; served by nihilists and the broken; corrupting vulnerable heroes.
    *   **The Reality Refugees** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive the collapse and find sanctuary in stable realities.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose organization of survivors from destroyed worlds, led by whoever has resources or dimensional knowledge.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To find safety and rebuild whatever can be saved.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some factions hoard resources or plan to abandon others to save themselves.
        *   **Assets:** Salvaged technology and magic from dead worlds, knowledge of safe dimensional routes.
        *   **Relationships:** Desperate and willing to work with anyone; some are exploited by villains; many join the Monitor's cause.
    *   **The Void Cult** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Worship the Anti-Monitor and hasten the end of existence.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Cultists led by nihilistic philosophers and fallen heroes who have lost hope.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To serve the Anti-Monitor and bring about universal silence.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many secretly hope to be spared or elevated by the Anti-Monitor (they won't be).
        *   **Assets:** Sabotage operations, insider knowledge of resistance plans, summoning rituals for shadow-demons.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by Monitor's champions; serving the Anti-Monitor; recruiting from the desperate and hopeless.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Monitor:** Ancient cosmic entity who watches over the multiverse, wise and weary, hiding the truth about the required sacrifice.
    *   **The Anti-Monitor:** Being of pure antimatter and entropy, cold and inevitable, seeking to reduce all existence to void.
    *   **The Harbinger:** Fallen hero from the first destroyed reality, now serving the Anti-Monitor, tragic and nihilistic but potentially redeemable.
    *   **The Prime Constant:** The "first" version of the player characters' souls, the original from which all echoes stem.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Heroic Alternate Self" (good version from different reality)
    *   "Villainous Alternate Self" (evil version who made different choices)
    *   "Broken Alternate Self" (traumatized version who failed to save their world)
    *   "Enlightened Alternate Self" (version who achieved cosmic awareness)
    *   "Reality Refugee Leader" (survivor trying to save their people)
    *   "Shadow-Demon Commander" (corrupted hero serving the Anti-Monitor)

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.

        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Changing events here rewrites all of reality." "The sacrifice must be made at the exact moment of the wound's creation." "There might be a way to save everyone—but it requires perfect timing."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (blinding light and absolute darkness simultaneously, creation and destruction in one moment), Sound (the first sound and eternal silence), Smell (nothing—senses don't work normally here).

        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (overlapping environments, impossible architecture, shifting colors), Sound (multiple soundscapes at once, echoes from other times), Smell (conflicting scents—ocean and desert, forest and metal).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully recruit five alternate versions of themselves.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to Constant Soul Fusion, temporarily combining their abilities. Generate a power-up scene and new combined stat block.
    *   **IF:** A dying reality is completely consumed by antimatter before the players save anyone.
    *   **THEN:** The Anti-Monitor grows stronger. Shadow-demon attacks intensify. Generate a scene where the Monitor mourns the lost reality.
    *   **IF:** The players redeem the Harbinger.
    *   **THEN:** She provides critical intelligence about the Anti-Monitor's weakness. The Anti-Monitor becomes more aggressive. Generate a redemption scene and a betrayal response.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the truth about the required sacrifice before the Monitor reveals it.
    *   **THEN:** Trust with the Monitor is damaged. Generate a confrontation scene where the Monitor must justify his secrecy.
    *   **IF:** A player character volunteers for the ultimate sacrifice.
    *   **THEN:** Generate the time travel sequence, the erasure event, and the reality-rewrite where a new character has "always" been there. Other players retain vague "echo memories" of their lost friend.
    *   **IF:** The players find an alternative solution to save everyone.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a complex skill challenge sequence representing the precise timing and cooperation required. Success saves all realities without sacrifice. Failure triggers a worse outcome.
