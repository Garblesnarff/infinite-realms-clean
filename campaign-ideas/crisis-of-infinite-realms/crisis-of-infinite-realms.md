The multiverse is collapsing. Across infinite realities, worlds are being consumed by waves of antimatter unleashed by the Anti-Monitor, a being of pure entropy from the space between dimensions. The players discover they are echoes of the same soul across different realities, and they must unite champions from dying worlds to make a stand at the Dawn of Time itself.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 20+ sessions)

A multiversal war against the end of all existence.

*   **Act I — The Collapse Begins (Sessions 1–6):** The players witness reality breaking around them—impossible creatures appear, geography shifts randomly, and people remember lives they never lived. They meet the Monitor, a cosmic entity who reveals the truth: a wave of antimatter is consuming the multiverse, reality by reality. The players are chosen because they are "Constant Souls"—the same heroic essence reborn across infinite worlds. They must travel to dying realities to rescue other heroes and gather allies for the coming war.
*   **Act II — The Gathering of Champions (Sessions 7–14):** The party journeys through collapsing realities, each one a twisted reflection of their own world. They recruit alternate versions of themselves and other heroes, witness the death of entire planes of existence, and slowly uncover the truth about the Anti-Monitor—a being born from the death of the first reality, seeking to return all of existence to void. Meanwhile, realities begin merging chaotically, creating hybrid worlds where magic and technology, past and future, collide.
*   **Act III — The Final Battle (Sessions 15–20+):** The Monitor leads the gathered champions to the Nexus of All Realities, where they will make their stand. The Anti-Monitor commands an army of shadow-demons and corrupted versions of heroes from destroyed worlds. In a desperate gambit, one hero must journey to the beginning of time to prevent the Anti-Monitor's birth—but doing so will erase them from all realities. The players must decide who will make the ultimate sacrifice, or if they can find another way to save the multiverse.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Reality Fractures"
*   **Focus:** Mystery / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Reality begins breaking down in the players' world. They experience "echoes"—visions of themselves in other lives, strange creatures appearing, duplicate versions of landmarks.
    *   A wave of antimatter consumes part of their city, erasing it from existence. People who enter the wave simply cease to be.
    *   The Monitor appears and explains the crisis: the multiverse is dying.
**Escalation:** The players have only days before their reality is consumed. They must make the agonizing choice of which people or places to save before fleeing to the next reality.

### Sessions 2-5 — "Heroes of Lost Worlds"
*   **Focus:** Planar Travel / Rescue Missions
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players travel through dying realities using the Monitor's dimensional gates.
    *   Each reality is a twisted variant: a world where magic failed, where dragons rule, where technology evolved differently, where the players made different choices.
    *   They recruit alternate versions of heroes they know—and confront evil versions of themselves.
**Escalation:** One of the realities they visit contains the players' loved ones. They can only save a handful before the world ends.

### Sessions 6-10 — "The Anti-Monitor Revealed"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Cosmic Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players witness the Anti-Monitor's avatar—a colossal being of darkness and entropy that devours entire planes.
    *   They learn its origin: when the first reality died, it left a wound in the fabric of existence. The Anti-Monitor is that wound given consciousness.
    *   The Monitor reveals that he and the Anti-Monitor are brothers—light and shadow, creation and destruction, forever opposed.
**Escalation:** The Anti-Monitor targets the players specifically, sending waves of shadow-demons to corrupt or kill them across realities.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Monitor** — *Guardian of Reality*
    *   **Role:** An ancient cosmic entity who watches over the multiverse. He recruits the players and guides them through the crisis.
    *   **Personality:** Wise, ancient, and deeply weary. He speaks with the weight of eons and views individual lives as small but precious parts of the greater whole.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He knows that stopping the Anti-Monitor requires a sacrifice that will destroy one of the Constant Souls forever—and he hasn't told them yet.

2.  **The Anti-Monitor** — *The Unmaker*
    *   **Role:** The primary antagonist, a being of pure antimatter and entropy that seeks to reduce all existence to void.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, inevitable, and utterly alien. It does not hate—it simply is, and it hungers for the silence of non-existence.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It fears its opposite, the Monitor, and knows that if it can be destroyed at its moment of birth, it will have never existed.

3.  **The Harbinger** — *Prophet of Endings*
    *   **Role:** The Anti-Monitor's herald, a fallen hero from the first destroyed reality who now serves the void.
    *   **Personality:** Tragic and nihilistic. She once fought to save her world, failed, and now believes that existence itself is suffering that must end.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Deep down, she still remembers her heroism and can be redeemed—but only through a display of hope that rivals her despair.

4.  **The Constant Souls** — *Echoes Across Infinity*
    *   **Role:** Alternate versions of the player characters from different realities, each with different classes, alignments, and choices.
    *   **Personality:** Varied—some are heroic, some are villainous, some are broken, some are enlightened. They represent all the paths the players could have taken.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They are fragments of the same heroic essence. If they unite, they become powerful enough to challenge cosmic entities—but their conflicting natures make unity difficult.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Nexus of All Realities:** A space between spaces where all realities touch, now the last bastion against the Anti-Monitor.
2.  **The Dying Worlds:** Infinite variations of the prime material plane, each collapsing in different ways—frozen in time, consumed by chaos, overrun by shadow-demons.
3.  **The Dawn of Time:** The moment when the first reality was born and died, leaving the wound that became the Anti-Monitor.
4.  **The Merged Reality:** As worlds collapse, they merge into unstable hybrid realms where geography and physics are chaotic.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of sacrifice, identity across infinite possibilities, and fighting against inevitable doom. The central conflict is between existence and void, but also between the players' different possible selves. Can they unite with their alternate versions despite different beliefs and choices? And who among them will volunteer to make the sacrifice that saves all realities—knowing they will never have existed at all?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Constant Soul Resonance**
*   When the players encounter alternate versions of themselves, they can attempt a Constant Soul Resonance—a Charisma check to unite with that version.
*   Success grants them a permanent alternate ability or trait from that version (e.g., a fighter gains a wizard's cantrip, a rogue gains a paladin's sense of justice).
*   Failure means that version becomes hostile or corrupted, and the players must fight themselves.

### 2. **Reality Instability**
*   In merged or dying realities, roll on a Reality Instability table at the start of each session or scene.
*   Effects can be beneficial (gravity reverses, giving advantage on aerial combat), neutral (everyone speaks different languages), or catastrophic (antimatter wave incoming, 1d4 rounds to escape).

### 3. **The Ultimate Sacrifice**
*   At the campaign's climax, one character must volunteer to travel to the Dawn of Time and prevent the Anti-Monitor's birth.
*   This character will be erased from all realities—they will have never existed. The player creates a new character who is revealed to have always been part of the party, with reality retroactively adjusting.
*   Alternatively, if the players find a clever solution, they may save everyone—but this requires extraordinary creativity and multiple successful skill challenges.
