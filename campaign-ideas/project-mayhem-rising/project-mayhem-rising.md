## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A descent into anarchic revolution that questions the nature of self and society.

*   **Act I — The Sleeping Life (Sessions 1-7):** The party meets while attending various support groups for ailments they don't have, seeking connection in a disconnected world. When they encounter Tyler—a charismatic soap-maker with radical ideas—they're drawn into underground fighting clubs where people brutally test themselves against strangers. Through violence and pain, they begin to feel alive again, forming a brotherhood of the disillusioned. But Tyler's influence grows stronger, and his ideas more extreme.
*   **Act II — The Rules of Project Mayhem (Sessions 8-13):** The fight clubs evolve into Project Mayhem, a decentralized anarchist organization dedicated to destroying symbols of consumerism. Members become "space monkeys" following orders without question, conducting elaborate pranks that escalate into terrorism. The party climbs the hierarchy, executing increasingly dangerous missions, while beginning to question Tyler's true goals and their own complicity.
*   **Act III — I Am Jack's Revelation (Sessions 14-20):** Reality fractures as the party discovers disturbing truths about Tyler's identity and their own. Project Mayhem's endgame emerges: destroying financial institutions to erase all debt and reset society to zero. As buildings fill with explosives and members become fanatics, the party must decide whether to stop the revolution they helped create or let it burn the world to cinders—and confront the possibility that Tyler was never real at all.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity, consumer culture's soul-crushing effects, masculinity in crisis, and whether destruction can be creative. It asks: Are you your job, your possessions, your body? Is violence necessary to break free from societal programming? Can you trust your own mind? The central conflict pits the party's desire for authentic existence against a society built on comfortable lies, while revealing that their revolutionary leader might be the biggest lie of all.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Fight Club System**
*   Underground fights use modified unarmed combat rules
*   Participants fight until one "quits" by speaking or passing out
*   Losing grants inspiration and clears mental exhaustion
*   Scars from fights become permanent marks of authenticity
*   Social bonds form with those you've fought

### 2. **Tyler's Influence**
*   Party members share a "Tyler Pool" representing the shared personality
*   When stressed or exhausted, roll to see if "Tyler" takes over
*   Tyler makes decisions the character wouldn't normally make
*   Actions during Tyler episodes aren't remembered but have consequences
*   The more you suppress yourself, the stronger Tyler becomes

### 3. **Project Mayhem Missions**
*   Escalating mission structure from pranks to terrorism
*   Success grants anarchist renown and resources
*   Failure results in "homework" punishment assignments
*   Each mission pushes moral boundaries further
*   Can't refuse missions without becoming a target

### 4. **Space Monkey Protocol**
*   NPCs who join Project Mayhem become interchangeable followers
*   They obey orders without question or identity
*   When one "dies," they're celebrated, not mourned
*   "In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name"
*   The party can command space monkeys but must maintain Tyler's philosophy

### 5. **Insomnia & Lost Time**
*   Characters experience sleep deprivation and blackouts
*   During lost time, Tyler acts using their body
*   Clues suggest they were places they don't remember
*   Other NPCs reference conversations that never happened
*   Logs and journals contradict memories

### 6. **Consumer Culture Rejection**
*   Characters must destroy possessions to gain "freedom points"
*   The more they own, the weaker they become
*   Missions target symbols of consumerism for psychological benefits
*   Advertising and brands cause mental strain
*   True liberation comes from owning nothing

### 7. **The Eight Rules**
*   First rule: You don't talk about fight club (loose lips cause complications)
