# Site-19 Breach
**"When containment fails, heroes are forged in the chaos."**

## Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a sterile, featureless room with no memory of how they arrived. Klaxons blare, red emergency lights pulse, and a cold, mechanical voice announces: "Multiple Keter-class containment breaches detected. All personnel evacuate to safe zones immediately." They are in Site-19, the largest facility of the SCP Foundation—a secret organization dedicated to containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena that threaten reality itself. But something has gone catastrophically wrong.

As the party navigates the labyrinthine facility, they discover they possess unique "anomalous resistances"—abilities that make them immune or resistant to certain memetic hazards, reality-bending effects, or cognitohazards. The Foundation AI overseer, SCRIBE, conscripts them into a desperate mission: recontain the breached anomalies before they escape into the world above or, worse, destroy reality itself. Each level of the facility houses different threat classifications, from Safe-class curiosities to world-ending Keter-class entities.

The truth slowly emerges: the breach was no accident. A shadowy group called the Chaos Insurgency orchestrated it to steal specific SCPs for their own purposes. The party must decide whether to trust the Foundation's cold utilitarianism, ally with insurgent forces who promise freedom, or forge their own path through the anomalous nightmare. Their choices will determine not just their survival, but the fate of consensus reality.

## Unique Mechanics

**Containment Protocol Checks**
- Each SCP has specific containment procedures players must learn/research
- Failing procedures triggers escalating danger levels
- Success grants SCP cooperation or tools for other challenges
- Example: SCP-173 requires constant eye contact from at least one observer

**Memetic Hazard System**
- Certain encounters or documents deal "psychic damage" and impose mental afflictions
- Protections: amnestics (memory erasure consumables), memetic filters, cognitive anchors
- Party's anomalous resistances grant advantage on saves
- Accumulated memetic damage can trigger madness or even beneficial mutations

**Clearance Level Progression**
- Start at D-Class (Level 0), unlock keycards through quests
- Higher clearance opens new areas, database files, and dialogue options
- Clearance can be revoked by factions if trust is broken
- Level 5 clearance reveals "infohazardous" campaign secrets

**Anomalous Object Equipment**

- Too many breaches or failed containments cause reality to break down
- Effects: gravity reversal, time loops, spatial impossibilities
- Players can repair anchors through engineer side quests

**Faction Reputation**
