## Hidden Lore

### The First Frozen's Story
Once a shaman who mastered astral projection. Discovered the space between sleep and wake. Got trapped there. Rather than fight, accepted it. Became powerful through acceptance. Now believes paralysis is transcendence and enforces it on others.

### Shadow Origin Truth
Shadows aren't external entities—they're fragments of each victim's own will to move, separated and corrupted by the dimension. Every shadow you fight is part of yourself. Defeating them weakens you. Reintegrating them strengthens you.

### The Protective Prison Theory
Some victims are in comas in the waking world due to trauma/injury. The Paralysis Dimension preserves consciousness while bodies heal. Escaping too soon = death. The Sovereign might actually be protecting them, not imprisoning them.

### The Cycle
The Shadow Sovereign was once like the party—a hero trying to escape. They succeeded in overthrowing the previous Sovereign, only to become the new one. The throne corrupts. Anyone who defeats the Sovereign risks becoming it.

### Connection to Waking World
Sleep paralysis in the real world is brief contact with this dimension. The shadows people see are real. Most escape quickly. The party and others are trapped because they somehow went too deep. Learning why they're trapped might be key to escape.

## Factional NPCs

### The Resistance
- Paralyzed victims who refuse to accept
- Led by Lydia Frost and others
- Constantly planning escape attempts
- Often fail, never give up
- Potential allies and quest givers

### The Acceptors
- Led by Marcus the Immobile
- Believe escape is impossible/undesirable
- Seek peace through acceptance
- View Resistance as prolonging suffering
- Philosophical opposition to party

### The Forgotten Chorus
- Too far gone to choose sides
- Can be awakened or left alone
- Each one saved weakens Sovereign slightly
- Saving all of them might tip balance
- Moral choice with mechanical benefit

### The Shadow Council
- Shadows who've developed consciousness
- Debate whether to serve Sovereign
- The Witness is their representative
- Could become allies against Sovereign
- Or could betray party to curry favor

## Mechanics Deep Dive

### Earning Movement
Small victories grant specific mobility:
- Resisting fear 10 times: One finger
- Helping another victim: Second finger
- Learning shadow entity pattern: Hand
- Defeating Harvester: Arm
- Solving dimension mystery: Leg
- Each micro-movement is earned permanently

### Shadow Feeding Mechanics
Shadows grow stronger on fear:
- Passive fear: They maintain presence
- Active terror: They grow larger
- Despair: They multiply
- Courage: They shrink
- Managing fear is survival mechanic

### Mental Projection Abilities
Out-of-body consciousness can:
- Scout ahead (but leave body vulnerable)
- Communicate with other victims
- Minor telekinesis (limited)
- Pass through walls
- See shadow entity true forms
- Risk: destruction = severe damage

### The Willpower Economy
Everything requires will:
- Moving: Costs will
- Resisting shadows: Costs will
- Mental projection: Costs will
- Regained through: Hope, small victories, helping others
- Running out: Increased paralysis

This creates resource management layer where players must balance expenditure with conservation.
