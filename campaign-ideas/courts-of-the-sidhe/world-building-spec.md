**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the barrier fails completely THEN Fomorians invade both realms causing mutual destruction
*   IF fey bargains are broken THEN terrible curses fall and true names are used against oath-breakers
*   IF iron is used against fey THEN it's effective but permanently damages reputation with all fey
*   IF too much time passes in the Otherworld THEN mortal Ireland ages centuries forward
*   IF the party learns true names THEN they gain power over specific fey but make permanent enemies
*   IF both courts unite THEN they can repel the Fomorians but may become too powerful
*   IF the Four Treasures are gathered THEN the barrier can be restored through sacrifice
*   IF traitors aren't exposed THEN they sabotage critical moments causing catastrophic failures
*   IF Balor's eye opens fully THEN everything it sees dies instantly
*   IF the party accepts immortality THEN they gain eternal life but lose ability to change/grow
*   IF mortal heroes are rallied THEN iron weapons tip the balance against fey enemies
*   IF the Morrigan's prophecy is ignored THEN fated doom occurs regardless of efforts
*   IF new oaths are sworn carefully THEN future conflicts can be prevented
*   IF geasa (taboos) are broken THEN supernatural consequences strip power and luck
*   IF the barrier is restored THEN mortal-fey contact becomes limited, protecting mortals but isolating fey
