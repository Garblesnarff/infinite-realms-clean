## Key Locations

1.  **Ancient Ireland:** Mortal realm with sacred groves, burial mounds, standing stones, and heroic kingdoms.
2.  **The Otherworld:** Parallel realm of the fey, where seasons and time don't follow mortal rules.

## Central Conflict

Freedom versus obligation under eternal fey oaths. The Sidhe offer immortality, beauty, and power but demand absolute obedience to bargains made centuries ago. Mortals have freedom and passion but brief lives and limited power. The party, caught between both worlds, must determine if the barrier should be restored (protecting mortal freedom but limiting both worlds) or broken (allowing mingling but risking mortal enslavement to fey whims). Every choice carries permanent consequences bound by unbreakable oaths.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Fey Bargains**
*   All deals with fey must be precisely worded. Hidden clauses and exact wording have mechanical consequences.

### 2. **True Names**
*   Learning a fey's true name grants power over them. Sharing your own gives them power over you.

### 3. **Glamour and Truth**
*   The party can see through fey illusions, but must navigate truth and lies in court politics.

### 4. **Heroic Gests**
*   Complete legendary challenges following Celtic mythology structure—boasting, single combat, impossible tasks.

### 5. **Time Dilation**
*   Time passes differently in the Otherworld. Hours there can be years in Ireland, or vice versa.

### 6. **Iron Vulnerability**
*   Iron harms the fey. Using it affects reputation and relationships but provides powerful advantage.

### 7. **Court Favor**
*   Track reputation with Seelie and Unseelie courts. High favor grants boons; low favor brings curses.

### 8. **The Four Treasures**
*   Recover and use legendary artifacts of the Tuatha Dé Danann with unique powers.

### 9. **Oathbound Magic**
*   Magic is enforced through oaths and geasa (taboos). Breaking them has severe supernatural consequences.

### 10. **Immortality's Price**
*   Achieving fey immortality means never aging, but also never changing—frozen forever as you are.
