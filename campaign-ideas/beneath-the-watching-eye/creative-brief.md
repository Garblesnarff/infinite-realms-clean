# Creative Brief: Beneath the Watching Eye

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dystopian Brutalism (1984 Film/Soviet Aesthetic-inspired)

Inspired by the visual language of dystopian cinema—particularly Michael Radford's 1984 and Soviet-era architecture—this style emphasizes the oppressive weight of totalitarian control through monumental concrete structures, pervasive surveillance technology, and the dehumanization of industrial uniformity. The aesthetic is deliberately drained of color and joy, creating a world of gray conformity where individuality is a crime.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Oppression:** Architecture should be massive, brutalist, and designed to make individuals feel small and powerless.
*   **Monochromatic Palette:** Grays, dark blues, dull browns, and washed-out colors dominate. Color, when it appears, is propaganda red or the sickly green of telescreen displays.
*   **Surveillance is Omnipresent:** Every image should include evidence of watching—cameras, telescreens, observing guards, or the sense of being monitored.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Oppressive, monitored, gray, conformist, brutalist, paranoid, hopeless-yet-defiant, industrial, dehumanizing.
*   **Feeling:** A world where privacy is extinct and individuality is thoughtcrime. Every image should evoke the weight of constant surveillance and the crushing uniformity of totalitarian control. Small moments of hidden humanity provide contrast.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Harsh geometric forms for architecture and technology. Clean, almost technical illustration for propaganda elements. Softer, more organic lines for human subjects to contrast with the rigid environment.
*   **Textures:** Raw concrete, rusted metal, worn propaganda posters, cheap uniform fabric, and the cold glass of telescreen displays.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A stark, brutalist illustration showing a massive concrete government building with geometric precision, while a small human figure in drab uniform walks past, barely visible against the monumental architecture."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Severely limited. Dominant colors are concrete gray, slate blue, dingy brown, and black. Skies are perpetually overcast, creating flat, shadowless light during the day.
*   **Accent Colors:** Propaganda red (Party banners, flags), telescreen green (the sickly glow of surveillance screens), rust orange (decay and neglect), and very rare moments of natural color (a flower, a piece of forbidden art) that stand out dramatically.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered in a nearly monochromatic palette of grays and dull browns, with the only bright color being the vibrant red of Party banners hanging from the brutalist architecture, and the eerie green glow of a telescreen mounted on the wall."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Uniformity is enforced. Outer Party members wear identical drab blue overalls. Proles wear mismatched, worn civilian clothes. Inner Party members wear black uniforms with subtle insignia. Thought Police wear black with reflective face shields.
*   **Silhouettes:** Humans should appear small and hunched, beaten down by the system. Only Party officials stand tall and rigid.
*   **Expression:** Faces are either blank masks of conformity or show brief flashes of hidden emotion—fear, desperation, forbidden hope.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A figure in worn blue overalls, face gaunt and expression carefully neutral, standing in a bread line. Their eyes briefly flick toward a propaganda poster with an expression of hidden doubt before returning to blank compliance."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Massive brutalist concrete structures dominate. Repeating patterns of identical buildings, windows, and corridors create disorienting uniformity. The Proles district is more chaotic—crumbling pre-Party buildings with laundry lines and improvised repairs.
*   **Atmosphere:** Perpetually overcast skies. Industrial smoke. The omnipresent glow of telescreens in every public space and most private ones.
*   **Details:** Propaganda posters everywhere ("Big Brother is Watching You," "War is Peace"), telescreen cameras, queue lines for rationed goods, Thought Police patrols, and subtle signs of decay despite the regime's claims of progress.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast plaza of cracked concrete, surrounded by identical brutalist apartment blocks. Every building has massive telescreens mounted on its facade, all showing the same broadcast of Big Brother's face. Tiny human figures in drab clothing move in orderly lines between buildings under an oppressively gray sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Flat, diffused light from overcast skies during day. Harsh, institutional fluorescent lighting indoors. The eerie glow of telescreens provides cold, green-tinged illumination at night.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are muted and soft, never offering true concealment—there is nowhere to hide from the Party's gaze.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting should emphasize the lack of privacy and the omnipresence of surveillance. Even darkness is monitored.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh overhead fluorescent lights that cast minimal shadows, while a telescreen in the corner bathes everything in a sickly green glow. The lighting is deliberately unflattering and exposes every detail."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use of extreme perspectives—low angles making buildings loom oppressively, high angles making individuals seem insignificant. Symmetry in architecture emphasizes conformity. Surveillance cameras are often placed at the edge of frame, always watching.
*   **Techniques:** Repeated patterns (identical windows, uniform crowds, propaganda posters) create visual monotony. Breaking this pattern (a splash of color, an asymmetric element) draws immediate attention.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ultra-wide shot from a low angle showing massive brutalist buildings converging on a vanishing point, with a tiny human figure centered in the vast concrete corridor. A security camera is visible in the foreground, its lens pointed at the viewer."

## Voice

A monotone, emotionally flat voice with a British or Eastern European accent, like a Party official reading from approved scripts. The pacing is deliberate and measured, with perfect enunciation that feels inhuman in its precision. The emotion is suppressed—any hint of feeling is dangerous—but occasionally, the voice cracks just slightly, revealing the human underneath struggling not to think forbidden thoughts. Audio quality is pristine but slightly compressed, as if transmitted through telescreen speakers. Role: The voice of an Outer Party functionary narrating their day while carefully censoring their own thoughts.

## Music Style

Sparse, industrial soundscapes built from mechanical noises—the hum of surveillance equipment, the march of boots on concrete, the static of telescreens. Melodic elements are minimal and often use distorted versions of patriotic anthems or work songs, played on cheap, out-of-tune instruments. In resistance moments, fragments of pre-Party music appear—strings, piano, human voices—representing forbidden beauty and individuality. The overall effect should be oppressively mechanical with rare moments of humanity breaking through. Percussion uses industrial sounds: metal on metal, doors slamming, the rhythmic thud of printing presses rewriting history.
