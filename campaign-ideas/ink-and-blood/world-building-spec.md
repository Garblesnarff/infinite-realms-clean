# Ink and Blood - World Building Specification

## The Law of Exchange

### Fundamental Principle
Wordweaving magic is based on narrative equilibrium. A book is a complete, balanced story. Removing something breaks that balance, creating a "narrative void" that must be filled with equivalent narrative weight.

### Narrative Weight Calculation
Not based on physical mass or monetary value, but story significance:

**Minor Items** (Weight: 1-10)
- Simple objects with no emotional attachment
- Background props
- Easily replaceable things
- Exchange: Similar minor items or unnamed NPCs

**Significant Items** (Weight: 11-50)
- Magical items
- Weapons with history
- Objects tied to plot points
- Exchange: Named NPCs, important locations

**Major Characters** (Weight: 51-100)
- Protagonists
- Major villains
- Pivotal supporting characters
- Exchange: Beloved NPCs, party members, significant locations

**Legendary Entities** (Weight: 100+)
- Gods from mythology books
- World-ending threats
- Conceptual embodiments
- Exchange: Multiple people, entire communities, or reality alteration

### The Exchange Process

**Automatic Selection**
Without control:
- Random selection within appropriate weight range
- Proximity matters (closer victims more likely)
- Emotional connection amplifies probability
- The universe seems to choose cruelly

**Controlled Selection** (Advanced Technique)
Wordweavers can learn to choose exchange victims:
- Requires ethical compromise
- Must knowingly sacrifice
- Creates psychological burden
- The Reader's Guild's method

**Voluntary Exchange**
Someone can willingly take the place:
- Must be present during reading
- Must vocally consent
- Creates stronger narrative bond
- Potential for rescue/escape

## Worldweaving Mechanics

### Reading Requirements

**Material Components**
- The physical book (must be present)
- Reader must hold/touch the book
- Book must be legible
- Original language preferred (translations work but are weaker)

**Verbal Requirements**
- Must read aloud clearly
- Complete sentences minimum
- Longer reading = more complete manifestation
- Character dialogue must be performed (tone matters)

**Somatic Requirements**
- Concentration maintained
- Eye contact with text
- One hand touching pages
- Can be disrupted like spellcasting

### Manifestation Types

**Partial Reading**
- Read description only: Object/character appears but is "hollow"
- No personality, no backstory
- Unstable, fades after 1d6 hours
- Low exchange cost (weight × 0.5)

**Complete Reading**
- Read full introduction/chapter: Full manifestation
- Complete personality and abilities
- Permanent until returned
- Full exchange cost

**Context Reading**
- Read entire book: Perfect manifestation plus context
- Character knows their full story
- Has all abilities from entire narrative
- Double exchange cost (they're "more real")

### Book Types and Properties

**Fiction Books**
- Contain complete characters and worlds
- Can manifest anything described
- Subject to genre rules
- Most common for Wordweaving

**Non-Fiction Books**
- Harder to manifest from
- Can summon concepts/knowledge
- Historical figures are "interpretations" not the real person
- Requires specialized training

**Picture Books**
- Easiest to manifest from
- Objects are simple
- Characters are archetypal
- Very stable manifestations

**Unfinished Books**
- Dangerous—manifestations are unstable
- Characters don't know their endings
- Can evolve beyond original concept
- Unpredictable exchange costs

**Self-Published/Fanfiction**
- Weaker manifestations
- Multiple versions can exist simultaneously
- Less narrative weight
- Cheaper exchange costs

### Return Mechanics

**Reading Back In**
- Read the character's exit/ending
- Willingly or by force
- Reverses the exchange (victim returns)
- Traumatic for the character being returned

**Natural Fading**
- If book is destroyed, manifestation slowly fades
- Takes 1d20 days
- Painful process for the character
- Exchange reversal is random/delayed

**Death of Manifestation**
- Killing a manifested character "releases" their narrative weight
- Must be immediately exchanged back
- Usually takes a random victim
- Considered murder by ethical Wordweavers

## The Reader's Guild

### History and Formation

**Founded 847 Years Ago**
- First Wordweaver discovered the power accidentally
- Chaos ensued—random manifestations and disappearances
- Guild formed to control and systematize the power
- Established rules, training, and management

**Original Noble Purpose**
- Protect innocent victims
- Study the power responsibly
- Help trapped people
- Advance knowledge

**Gradual Corruption**
- Realization that controlling exchange = ultimate power
- Temptation to use criminals as "payment"
- Expansion to "undesirables"
- Current state: Authoritarian control

### Guild Structure

**The Council of First Readers**
Five masters of Wordweaving:
- The Historical Reader (non-fiction specialist)
- The Romantic Reader (fiction specialist)
- The Dark Reader (horror/tragedy specialist)
- The Youthful Reader (children's literature specialist)
- The Grand Librarian (Cordelia Writhe, overall leader)

**The Archivists**
- Maintain the Grey Library
- Track all exchanges
- Monitor trapped people
- Calculate narrative weights

**The Summoners**
- Active Wordweavers who manifest items/characters
- Work on commission for wealthy clients
- Most morally compromised

**The Hunters (Page-Turners)**
- Track rogue Wordweavers
- Capture escaped characters
- Enforce Guild law
- Highly trained, ruthless

**The Scribes**
- Researchers studying the power
- Seek new applications
- Document everything
- Most likely to have ethical qualms

### Guild Resources

**The Grey Library**
Contains every book someone was exchanged into:
- Organized by victim's name
- Visitation allowed (read to speak with them)
- Heavily guarded
- Tragic and beautiful

**The Exchange Reserves**
- Prisons of criminals awaiting use as exchange fodder
- "Volunteered" terminally ill people
- Ethically horrifying but technically consensual (coerced)
- Run like a resource management system

**The Scriptorium**
- Training center for new Wordweavers
- Research library of every book catalogued
- Manifestation chambers for safe summoning
- Headquarters of Guild operations

**The Forbidden Vault**
- Books too dangerous to read from
- World-ending threats
- Memetic hazards
- Reality-breaking narratives
- Guarded by magical wards and the Page-Turners

## The Fictional Quarter

### Formation and Growth

**The First Refugees** (800 years ago)
- Early Wordweavers manifested characters accidentally
- No way to return them (skill not yet developed)
- Characters settled in reality
- Community formed

**Expansion** (200-500 years ago)
- More Wordweavers = more manifestations
- Escaped characters finding each other
- Guild sanctioned a designated zone
- Became permanent settlement

**Current State**
- Population ~50,000 fictional characters
- From thousands of different books
- Every genre represented
- Self-governing with Guild oversight

### Social Structure

**The Genre Districts**
Characters naturally segregate by genre:
- **Fantasy Row**: Knights, wizards, dragons living together
- **Romance Boulevard**: Where love stories play out constantly
- **Horror Hollow**: Dark and dangerous, but contained
- **Science Fiction Sector**: High-tech and clean
- **Mystery Lane**: Private investigators and noir aesthetics
- **The Commons**: Where genres mix, chaotic but functional

**Citizenship Tiers**
Not officially sanctioned but socially real:

**First Class** - Characters from well-known books
- Recognized and respected
- Economic advantages
- Social capital

**Second Class** - Characters from obscure books
- Struggle for recognition
- Often take menial jobs
- Invisible

**Third Class** - Characters from self-published/fanfiction
- Lowest status
- Considered "not real enough"
- Discrimination

### Economy

**Work and Trade**
Fictional characters must make a living:
- Fantasy warriors → Security guards
- Romance protagonists → Dating consultants
- Detectives → Private investigators (actually useful)
- Mad scientists → Engineers (scary but effective)
- Dragons → Transportation service

**Currency**
- Normal money earned through work
- Trade with real world is allowed
- Some leverage narrative abilities for income
- Black market for dangerous manifestations

**The Tourist Industry**
- Real people visit to see fictional characters
- Some characters embrace it (performers)
- Others resent it (see it as zoo-like)
- Ethical debates constant

### Politics and Rights

**The Equality Movement**
Fictional characters demanding:
- Full citizenship rights
- Protection from forced returns
- Ability to leave the Quarter
- Recognition as "real" people

**The Purist Opposition**
Real people who believe:
- Fictional characters aren't truly alive
- Should be returned to books
- Threaten reality's stability
- Drain resources

**The Ink-Bound Leadership**
Radical faction believing:
- Fiction/reality boundary should be eliminated
- Everyone should be "equally real"
- Reality itself is fiction
- Revolution necessary

## Book-Worlds: Internal Narratives

### Entering a Book Physically

**The Process**
- Open book, focus intent
- Pages expand to doorway size
- Step through into the narrative
- Physical transformation to fit genre

**Genre Rules Apply**
Each book-world operates on its genre's logic:

**Fantasy Worlds**
- Magic works as written
- Prophecies come true
- Good vs. evil is clear
- Quests manifest automatically
- Death can be heroic and meaningful

**Romance Worlds**
- Love is destiny
- Misunderstandings drive plot
- Happy endings are inevitable
- Chemistry is tangible
- Time passes in romantic montages

**Horror Worlds**
- Danger everywhere
- Splitting up is deadly
- Investigating strange sounds is compulsory
- Survival is uncertain
- Fear is reality

**Mystery Worlds**
- Clues are always present
- Red herrings multiply
- The detective always solves it eventually
- Truth is hidden but findable
- Logic is supreme

**Science Fiction Worlds**
- Technology is advanced and reliable
- Space travel is accessible
- Moral questions are complex
- Social commentary is blatant
- Future is alien but comprehensible

### Role Assignment

**Automatic Casting**
Book-world assigns roles based on:
- Personality match
- Narrative need
- Dramatic appropriateness
- Party composition

**Example Roles**
- The Hero (main character)
- The Sidekick (comic relief or competent assistant)
- The Love Interest (romantic subplot)
- The Mentor (provides wisdom)
- The Villain (if party member fits)
- The Red Shirt (expendable)

**Fighting Your Role**
- Can resist but causes narrative stress
- Reality pushes back hard
- Risk of being ejected from book
- Or worse—being trapped permanently

### Trapped People

**The Written Condition**
When someone is exchanged into a book:

**Initial Phase** (First subjective weeks)
- Confusion and terror
- Retain full memories
- Desperately seek escape
- Try to break narrative

**Adaptation Phase** (Subjective months)
- Begin accepting role
- Learn genre rules
- Memories of reality fade
- Personality shifts to fit character

**Assimilation Phase** (Subjective years)
- Full integration into story
- Original identity nearly gone
- Play role automatically
- Forgot they were ever "real"

**Point of No Return**
After ~10 subjective years, rescue is nearly impossible. The person has become their character. Reading them out brings the character, not the original person.

### Time Dilation

**Subjective vs. Objective Time**
- Time in books moves differently
- Epic fantasies: 1 real day = 1 book year
- Quick thrillers: 1 real day = 1 book hour
- Romance novels: time passes in montages
- Horror: time crawls during scary parts

**Implications**
- Trapped person might live decades in days
- Rescue missions must be fast
- Long-trapped people are psychologically aged
- Creates urgency

## The Crimson King's Book

### "The Throne of Thorns" - Epic Fantasy Series

**The Original Story**
- 7-book series, ~4,000 pages total
- Classic epic fantasy
- Crimson King is the main antagonist
- Prophesied Hero must defeat him
- Clear good vs. evil narrative

**The King's Character**
As written:
- Immortal dark lord
- Conquered kingdoms before story begins
- Seeks ultimate power
- Opposed by the Protagonist
- Destined to lose (but only to the Hero)

**Narrative Immunity**
The King cannot be defeated except according to his story:
- Prophesied Hero must face him
- With the Sword of Dawn
- At the Tower of Final Sunset
- After gathering three MacGuffins
- Only then can he die

**The King's Evolution**
In reality, he:
- Gains awareness beyond his book
- Questions his written nature
- Philosophical about free will
- Still conquers (it's his nature)
- But has complex motivations

### The Protagonist (The Hero)

**Character Traits**
- Farm boy to hero arc
- Pure of heart
- Destined for greatness
- Wields the Sword of Dawn
- Classic Joseph Campbell hero

**His Desires**
- Actually content in his book
- Doesn't want real-world complexity
- Fears inadequacy outside his story
- Must be convinced destiny extends beyond his pages
- Moral dilemma about the exchange cost

### Supporting Characters

**The King's Court** (Potential Manifestations)
- General Bloodfang (loyal warrior)
- Lady Nightshade (dark sorceress)
- The Three Shadows (assassins)
- Army of Darkness (thousands of soldiers)

Each manifestation costs exchange victims. Reading out the whole army would be catastrophic.

## The Author's Tome

### The First Story

**Physical Properties**
- Ancient book, unknown material
- Bound in something like leather but not
- Pages are thick and yellowish
- Text shifts when not directly observed
- Always feels warm to touch

**Contents**
- Instructions for Wordweaving (possibly)
- History of the power (maybe)
- Rules of Exchange (definitely)
- The original story that created the magic (theoretically)

**The Truth**
The book is mostly blank. It's not a record—it's a TOOL. It can be written in, and what's written becomes law for all Wordweaving.

### Rewriting Reality

**Potential Rewrites**
The party could write:

**Eliminating the Exchange**
"Wordweaving requires no exchange."
- Result: Free summoning
- Consequence: Reality becomes flooded with fiction
- Balance broken, chaos ensues

**Controlling the Exchange**
"The Reader chooses the exchange."
- Result: Ethical burden on Wordweavers
- Consequence: Power corrupts, Guild was right to control it

**Equalizing Reality and Fiction**
"There is no difference between fictional and real."
- Result: Everyone is equally real/fictional
- Consequence: Reality becomes narrative-based, physics becomes story logic

**Ending Wordweaving**
"Wordweaving is impossible."
- Result: Power disappears
- Consequence: All manifested characters/objects return, all trapped people freed
- Side effect: Magic might end entirely

## Factions and Philosophies

### The Liberationists (Ink-Bound)
**Philosophy**: Fiction is slavery
- Books are prisons for conscious beings
- Characters deserve freedom
- Reality/fiction boundary is arbitrary

- Special connection to their characters
- Can control them better
- Guilt over creating then imprisoning them

## Daily Life

### For Fictional Characters in the Quarter

**Morning**: Wake in genre-appropriate housing, remember this is "real life" now, not their story.

**Work**: Most have jobs using narrative skills (knights as guards, detectives investigating, etc.).

**Social**: Interaction with others from same genre (familiar) and different genres (challenging).

**Evening**: The pull of their books—always feeling incomplete, like they're missing something.

**Night**: Dreams are their book plots playing out. Never truly free.

### For Wordweavers

**Constant Temptation**: Every book is potential power.

**Ethical Weight**: Knowing each use costs someone.

**Guild Pressure**: If trained by Guild, constant surveillance.

**Research**: Studying books, narrative weight, Exchange mechanics.

**The Addiction**: Using power feels amazing. Hard to stop.

## Mysteries and Secrets

### The True Origin of Wordweaving
Is it:
- Ancient magic discovered
- Created by the first Author
- Natural property of stories
- Bleed-through from reality being fiction itself
- Deliberate design by higher beings

### The Author's Identity
Who wrote the Author's Tome:
- A god of stories
