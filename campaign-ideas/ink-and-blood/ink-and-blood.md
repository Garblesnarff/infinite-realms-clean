# Ink and Blood
## *"Every time you read a character into our world, someone from our world is written into theirs."*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers they possess a rare magical gift: when they read aloud from books, the characters and objects described manifest in reality. A dragon from a fantasy novel becomes flesh and blood. A detective from a mystery appears confused on a city street. Magic items from adventure stories materialize in their hands. At first, this power seems like an incredible gift—unlimited resources, powerful allies, and access to any story they desire.

But there's a terrible cost they don't immediately understand. The magic follows the Law of Exchange: for every character or object brought out of a book, something of equivalent narrative weight must go into a book. At first, it's small things—a chair disappears, a stranger vanishes from the street. But as the party uses their power more freely, they realize people they know are being written into books, trapped in fictional prisons, living out stories not their own.

The campaign begins when the party accidentally reads a powerful villain into reality—the Crimson King from an ancient dark fantasy epic. He immediately begins conquering the kingdom, using his narrative immunity (he cannot be defeated except by the specific hero from his book) to devastating effect. To stop him, the party must read out his nemesis, the prophesied hero. But doing so will cost them someone they love, condemned to take the hero's place in the book. The party must master the art of Wordweaving, navigate the politics of both book-worlds and reality, and ultimately face the question: who decides which lives are "real" and which are "fictional"?

## Core Themes

- **The Power and Responsibility of Stories**: Reading is never innocent—it has consequences
- **Exchange and Sacrifice**: Every magic has a cost; who pays the price for your power?
- **Fiction vs. Reality**: Are fictional characters less "real" than people from our world? What makes someone real?
- **Authorial Control**: Having power over stories is like being a god—a dangerous position
- **Identity Through Narrative**: If you're written into a book, do you become a character or remain yourself?

## Session Breakdown (32 Sessions)

### Act 1: Discovery (Sessions 1-8)

**Session 1-2**: *The First Reading* - The party discovers their gift when one member accidentally reads aloud and summons a magical sword from a children's adventure book. They experiment cautiously with their new power.

**Session 3-4**: *The Cost Revealed* - After reading out several useful items and a friendly character, they discover that random objects and people have disappeared from town. Investigation reveals these people have been "written into" various books, trapped in fictional worlds.

**Session 5-6**: *The Rescue Attempt* - The party learns they can "read into" books themselves to rescue trapped people. They enter a romance novel to save a baker who was accidentally swapped. They experience being characters in someone else's story.

**Session 7-8**: *The Crimson King* - A rival Wordweaver, seeking power, reads out the Crimson King—an immortal dark lord from an epic fantasy series. The King immediately begins his conquest, protected by narrative immunity. The rival is the first to die, written into the King's book as a minor henchman.

### Act 2: Escalation (Sessions 9-20)

**Session 9-11**: *The Book-Bound* - Meeting other victims of Wordweaving. Some have been trapped in books for years, living countless fictional lives. Some have gone mad. Others have adapted, becoming "actors" who play their roles waiting for rescue.

**Session 12-14**: *The Hero's Dilemma* - The party locates the Crimson King's book and finds the prophesied hero who can defeat him. But reading him out will condemn someone to take his place. Each party member wrestles with whether to sacrifice themselves or someone else.

**Session 15-17**: *The Reader's Guild* - Discovery of a secret society of Wordweavers who've been using their power for centuries. The Guild claims to carefully manage the exchange, using criminals and the terminally ill as "payment." But their methods are disturbing, and they want to control the party.

**Session 18-20**: *The Book Rebellions* - Fictional characters who've been read out begin organizing. They don't want to be sent back. They claim they're as real as anyone and shouldn't be re-imprisoned in books just because of their origin. Some become violent, insisting "real world" people should go into books instead.

### Act 3: Complications (Sessions 21-26)

**Session 21-22**: *The Written Ones* - Meeting people who were written into books and then read back out. They're changed—partly fictional now, with narrative abilities but also narrative vulnerabilities. One can't lie (honest protagonist), another can't help but betray people (villain archetype).

**Session 23-24**: *The Ink Plague* - Overuse of Wordweaving is causing reality itself to become "porous." Text appears on surfaces. People spontaneously speak in narrative prose. The boundary between fiction and reality is dissolving. If it continues, everything could become fiction—or fiction could cease to exist entirely.

**Session 25-26**: *The Author's Tome* - The party discovers the original book—the first story ever written, which contains the rules of Wordweaving itself. The book can be rewritten, potentially changing the Law of Exchange. But multiple factions want it for different purposes.

### Act 4: Resolution (Sessions 27-32)

**Session 27-28**: *The Crimson King's Truth* - Discovering that the King has learned Wordweaving. He's reading out entire armies from war novels. Worse, he's writing new books where he wins, creating self-fulfilling prophecies. Reality is being authored to ensure his victory.

**Session 29-30**: *The Choice* - Three options emerge:
1. Sacrifice someone to read out the hero and defeat the King traditionally
2. Rewrite the Author's Tome to eliminate the Law of Exchange (unknown consequences)
3. Write themselves into the King's book and defeat him from inside his story

**Session 31**: *The Confrontation* - Epic battle combining the party's choice with the King's forces. Fictional characters fighting alongside real people. Stories bleeding into reality. The fabric of narrative itself as the battlefield.

**Session 32**: *The New Story* - Aftermath and epilogue. Based on choices made, reality has fundamentally changed. The campaign ends with the party understanding they've rewritten the rules of stories themselves.

## Major Locations

**The Scriptorium**
The Reader's Guild headquarters. A vast library where Wordweavers practice their art. Contains cells holding books with people trapped inside. Ethically horrifying but beautifully maintained. The Guild treats imprisoned people as "resources" to be managed.

**The Threshold**
A bookstore that exists halfway between reality and fiction. Entering a book here doesn't just transport your consciousness—it transports your body. The owner, an ancient Wordweaver, maintains this space as neutral ground where both fictional and real people can meet.

**The Fictional Quarter**
A neighborhood in the capital city where read-out characters live. A strange place where fantasy knights buy groceries next to space captains, where romance heroines work as waitresses, where villains try to live peaceful lives. Segregated by fearful "real" people.

**The Grey Library**
Where books containing trapped "real" people are kept. Each shelf holds tragedies—people living out fantasy adventures, romance plots, horror stories, never aging, never escaping. Some have been here for centuries of subjective time (though only years in reality).

**The Paper Palace**
The Crimson King's fortress, constructed from narrative architecture—impossible towers, dramatic throne rooms, dungeons designed for dramatic escapes. Physics works according to fantasy novel logic here. The King's power is strongest within.

**The Author's Sanctum**
Hidden location containing the Author's Tome—the first and most important book. The room is blank white, containing only a pedestal with a single book. Whoever controls this book controls the rules of Wordweaving itself.

**The Ink Sea**
A surreal location where the barrier between fiction and reality has broken completely. An ocean of liquid text where stories flow together, characters from different books interact, and reality is completely fluid. Beautiful and terrifying.

## Unique Mechanics

**Wordweaving Ability**
Players can read aloud from books to manifest characters/objects. Mechanics:
- Requires concentration and clear reading voice
- DC varies by complexity (simple object DC 10, powerful character DC 20)
- Time required: 1 minute per page
- Automatic consequence: Something of equivalent narrative weight disappears into a book

**The Exchange Roll**
When reading something out, roll d100 to determine what goes in:
- 1-40: Random object of equivalent value
- 41-70: Random NPC the party doesn't know
- 71-85: Random NPC the party has met
- 86-95: Someone the party knows
- 96-100: A party member

**Reading Into Books**
Party can enter books physically to rescue trapped people or interact with fictional characters. While inside:
- You become subject to that book's genre rules
- Your role is assigned based on personality (hero, sidekick, villain, etc.)
- Time flows differently—subjective hours can be objective minutes
- Death in the book isn't permanent but is traumatic
- You can alter the story, but major changes risk collapsing the narrative

**Narrative Immunity**
Some read-out characters have plot armor from their stories:
- Cannot die except in specific prophesied ways
- Always succeed at tasks central to their story role
- Reality bends to accommodate their narrative

**The Written Condition**
People trapped in books gain the "Written" condition:
- Subject to the book's genre and plot
- Must play an assigned role
- Memories of real life fade over time
- Can be read back out, but they're changed

**Ink Corruption**
Overuse of Wordweaving causes reality corruption:
- Text appears on surfaces
- People speak in narration style
- Coincidences become too convenient (plot device manifestation)
- Genre bleed—reality starts following story logic

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: One PC Was Always Fictional**
Midway through campaign, reveal that one party member is actually a character read out years ago. They don't remember their book origin—false memories were implanted. Their player chooses which PC.

**Twist 2: The Exchange Can Be Controlled**
The party discovers you can choose who/what goes into books—but you must knowingly sacrifice them. The Guild has been doing this all along with criminals and "undesirables."

**Twist 3: The Protagonist Wants to Stay**
When found, the Hero doesn't want to be read out. He's happy in his book, living a simple predictable life. Being read out means facing real danger and complexity. He has to be convinced or forced.

**Twist 4: The Crimson King Is Right**
The King argues that fictional characters are genuinely enslaved—forced to repeat their stories forever for readers' entertainment. He's not conquering out of evil, but liberating his fellow characters. His methods are wrong but his point is valid.

**Twist 5: Reality Is Also a Book**
The Author's Tome reveals that the "real world" is also a story being written. There's no true reality—just different levels of fiction. The players might be characters in someone's D&D campaign (fourth wall break).

**Complication: Loved Ones Taken**
Through random exchanges, NPCs the party cares about get written into books. Some into terrible genres (horror, tragedy). The party must risk everything to rescue them.

**Complication: Fictional Character Romance**
A party member falls in love with a read-out character. Do they send them back to save reality? Keep them and damn someone else? Try to make them "truly real" somehow?

**Complication: The Guild Hunts Them**
The Reader's Guild sees the party as rogue Wordweavers threatening their careful system. They begin hunting the party, trying to trap them in books as punishment.

## Victory Conditions

**The Sacrifice Victory**
Someone (PC or beloved NPC) volunteers to be written into the Hero's book. The Hero defeats the Crimson King. Balance is maintained. One life for many. Traditional heroic sacrifice, bittersweet ending.

**The Rewrite Victory**
The party rewrites the Author's Tome to eliminate the Law of Exchange. Wordweaving becomes free but unpredictable. No more sacrifices required, but reality becomes more chaotic and story-like. Fiction and reality begin merging.

**The Internal Victory**
The party writes themselves into the Crimson King's book and defeats him from inside his own story, using metafictional awareness. They escape afterward, but the King remains imprisoned. Creative solution avoiding external sacrifice.

**The Liberation Victory**
Side with the Ink-Bound and the Crimson King. Eliminate the boundary between books and reality entirely. All characters become equally real. Reality becomes fluid and story-like. True equality at the cost of stable reality.

## Defeat Conditions

**The King's Reign**
Failure to stop the Crimson King. He conquers the world, reading out armies from hundreds of books. Reality is overwhelmed with fictional characters and monsters. The Crimson King rules an empire of mixed fiction and reality, himself immune to defeat.

**The Exchange Collapse**
Too much Wordweaving without management causes the Exchange to fail catastrophically. Thousands are randomly written into books. Thousands of fictional characters appear in reality. Chaos and madness. Neither world survives intact.

**The Guild's Control**
The Reader's Guild captures the party and the Author's Tome. They establish complete control over Wordweaving, using it to create a dystopia where they have infinite power, reading out whatever they need and writing "undesirables" into books as payment.

**Lost in Stories**
The party becomes trapped in books themselves, unable to escape. They live out fictional lives forever, their memories of reality fading. They become characters in someone else's story, their own story forgotten.

## Campaign Climax

The final confrontation occurs simultaneously in reality and within the Crimson King's book. The party splits—some face the King's physical armies in the real world, others dive into his narrative to fight him on conceptual grounds.

In the book, they must defeat him according to story logic—finding the prophesied weapon, gathering the required allies, fulfilling genre conventions. In reality, they must prevent his forces from reading out more reinforcements while managing the Exchange cost.

The twist: the Crimson King has rewritten his own book so that he cannot be defeated. The only way to beat him is to add a new ending, collaboratively authoring his downfall. This requires the party to become authors themselves, literally writing the final chapter.

But writing an ending means deciding: does the Crimson King die, or does he get redemption? Does he return to his book, or remain free? Are fictional characters granted rights, or returned to imprisonment? The ending the party writes determines the future of all stories.

The ultimate question: What story are you willing to tell, and who pays the price for it to be read?
