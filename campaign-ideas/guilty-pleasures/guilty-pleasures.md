**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In St. Louis where the dead don't always stay buried, the party works as preternatural investigators and executioners, with one member being a powerful necromancer and legal vampire executioner. They navigate the complex politics of vampire courts (kisses), lycanthrope packs, and necromantic cabals while investigating supernatural crimes that range from rogue vampires to ancient evils awakening. As the necromancer's power grows exponentially, they become targets for master vampires seeking to bind them, werewolf packs wanting their power, and dark forces that would use necromancy for apocalyptic purposes. In this world, power has a price, and that price is often paid in blood, flesh, and soul.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act arc of power escalation, vampire politics, and necromantic evolution.

*   **Act I — The Executioner (Sessions 1-6):** The party establishes themselves as preternatural investigators, with the necromancer serving as a licensed vampire executioner and animator of the dead. They learn about vampire kisses (organized groups), lycanthrope packs, and the laws governing preternaturals in society. They face rogue vampires, zombie-raising gone wrong, and encounters with master vampires who view the necromancer as prey or prize. They discover ancient vampire marks that can bind humans to vampires forever.
*   **Act II — Master's Games (Sessions 7-13):** Master vampires begin competing to claim the party's necromancer through marks and manipulation. Jean-Claude, Master of the City, and others scheme to bind them. Meanwhile, lycanthrope packs seek alliances or dominance. The party discovers necromancy far more powerful than believed—raising not just zombies but ghouls, controlling vampires themselves, and communing with death. They face the Triumvirate—a three-way power bond that could make them incredibly powerful but cost their independence.
*   **Act III — Power Beyond Death (Sessions 14-19):** The necromancer's power reaches terrifying levels: raising armies of undead, controlling master vampires, and becoming a wellspring of necromantic energy. They attract attention from the Vampire Council (ancient rulers), Mother of All Darkness (primal vampire), and other cosmic threats. They must navigate complex vampire politics while their power makes them a threat to everyone. Ardeur (metaphysical hunger for life energy) manifests, requiring constant feeding through intimate contact or violence.
*   **Act IV — Dark Queen Rising (Sessions 20-25):** The Mother of All Darkness seeks to possess the necromancer to walk in the world again. The party must prevent an ancient vampire goddess from using them as a vessel while fighting master vampires, lycanthrope challenges, and necromantic cults. The final confrontation determines whether the necromancer controls their power or becomes a vessel for ancient evil, whether they accept vampire marks and mate bonds, and what they're willing to sacrifice for power. Some endings involve becoming a vampire master themselves, others breaking free of all bonds, and some falling to darkness.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of power's cost, control versus slavery, embrace of monster nature, and whether ends justify means. It asks: How much power can you accept before losing yourself? Can you love monsters? Is independence worth sacrificing power? The central conflict pits the necromancer's desire for freedom against forces that would bind them, while their growing power makes them a threat to everyone and a target for ancient evils.
