The party are members of the Van Der Linde Gang, outlaws on the run in 1899 as the Wild West dies and civilization closes in. Led by Dutch Van Der Linde, a charismatic idealist whose plans grow more desperate, they rob, shoot, and survive while dreaming of one last big score to escape to Tahiti. But the gang is doomed—the Pinkertons hunt them, internal tensions fracture loyalty, and Dutch's paranoia spirals into madness. The party must choose between honor and survival, loyalty and self-preservation, as the gang they love tears itself apart. There is no happy ending; only how you face the end.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 25-35 sessions)

A tragic descent from hopeful outlaws to hunted, broken survivors.

*   **Act I — The Blackwater Disaster (Sessions 1-10):** The gang flees a botched ferry heist in Blackwater that left bodies and a fortune behind. Hiding in the frozen mountains, they're hunted by Pinkertons and O'Driscolls (rival gang). They descend to Valentine, robbing trains and homesteads while Dutch promises "one more score" to get money for everyone to escape. They meet Colm O'Driscoll, attempt peace, but are betrayed. One party member is captured and tortured but rescued. The gang moves to Rhodes, getting involved in a Gray-Braithwaite family feud for profit.
*   **Act II — Paradise Lost (Sessions 11-22):** The feud goes wrong; Jack (a gang boy) is kidnapped. They burn the Braithwaite manor, then rob the Saint Denis bank—it's a trap. Lawmen and Pinkertons massacre them. They flee to Guarma, a fictional Caribbean island, caught in a revolution. They return to find their camp raided and members missing. Dutch grows paranoid, accusing people of betrayal. They side with Native Americans against the Army in a doomed stand. Micah, Dutch's new favorite, poisons his mind against Arthur (the party's leader). The gang fractures—some want to leave, Dutch refuses.
*   **Act III — The Bitter End (Sessions 23-35):** Dutch abandons all morality, robbing trains with Army money, killing innocents. The Pinkertons offer deals to individuals—betray Dutch or die. Arthur contracts tuberculosis and is dying. He works to save those he can—helping John (a younger member) escape with his family. The gang's final job against the Army is a suicide mission. Micah is revealed as the Pinkerton informant. Dutch sides with Micah over Arthur. Arthur confronts Dutch one last time, fights Micah, and dies (high honor: watching the sunrise; low honor: shot in the face). Eight years later, John seeks revenge, hunting down Micah with Dutch's help. Dutch walks away, his dream dead, and shoots himself off a cliff. John builds a ranch but the Pinkertons come—he dies defending his family. His son inherits the cycle.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of loyalty versus self-preservation, the death of the frontier, cycles of violence, inevitability of consequences, and whether redemption is possible for bad men. It asks: Can you escape your past? Is loyalty worth dying for when the leader has lost his way? What is honor in a dishonorable life? The central conflict pits the party's love for the gang against the reality that the dream is dead and everyone who clings to it will die.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Honor System (Core Morality)**
*   Every action affects Honor: positive or negative
*   **High Honor:** Help strangers, spare enemies, donate, be kind
*   **Low Honor:** Murder innocents, rob, threaten, be cruel
*   Honor affects: how NPCs react, shop prices, Arthur's final fate
*   High Honor ending: dies peacefully, redemption
*   Low Honor ending: dies violently, no peace

### 2. **Gang Camp System**
*   Camp is a living hub between missions
*   Donate money and supplies to upgrade camp
*   Talk to members for stories, side quests, character development
*   Camp morale affects missions—happy gang performs better
*   Watch the gang's decline through camp conversations

### 3. **Dead Eye (Slow-Motion Targeting)**

*   Cinematic and empowering

### 4. **Horse Bonding**

*   Bond by riding, feeding, brushing

### 5. **Random Encounters**

### 8. **The Inevitable Tragedy**
