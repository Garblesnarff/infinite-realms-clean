**The Van Der Linde Legacy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Members of the Van Der Linde Gang flee a botched heist in 1899 as the Wild West dies. Led by Dutch's increasingly desperate plans and dreams of "one more score," they rob and survive while Pinkertons hunt them. The gang is doomed—Dutch's paranoia, Micah's betrayal, and civilization's advance fracture them. The party chooses between honor and survival as everyone they love dies or leaves. No happy ending exists, only how you face the end.
