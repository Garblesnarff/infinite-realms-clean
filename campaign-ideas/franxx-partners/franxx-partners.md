# Franxx Partners

*A Dystopian Coming-of-Age / Paired Pilot Mecha campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Franxx Partners
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Dystopian Coming-of-Age / Romance Drama / Existential Mecha
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **13–15**
**Tone (keywords):** paired pilots, dystopian society, coming of age in war, forbidden emotions, discovering humanity, child soldiers, reproductive metaphors
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are teenage pilots raised in isolation to operate Franxx—two-pilot mecha where a male "Stamen" and female "Pistil" must synchronize to fight the Klaxosaurs (giant monsters). They know nothing of the outside world, reproduction, or emotions—only combat. As they fight, they discover their society is controlled by immortal adults who've abandoned humanity for eternal life, viewing the pilots as expendable tools. The campaign is about discovering what it means to be human, forming bonds despite being tools, and choosing whether to serve or rebel.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Franxx combat requires partnership synchronization. Solo pilots are ineffective. Emotional harmony affects combat performance.
*   **Investigation:** Uncover the truth about the plantations (child soldier camps), the adults' immortality, and what Klaxosaurs really are.
*   **Consequences:** Partnerships can fail (incompatibility, emotional conflict). Failed synchronization = death. Discovering forbidden knowledge (sex, reproduction, freedom) triggers rebellion.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — The Plantation (Sessions 1–4):** The party lives in a gilded cage, piloting Franxx against Klaxosaurs. They're trained to fight, not question. Early sessions establish partnerships and hint at larger mysteries.
*   **Act II — Awakening (Sessions 5–8):** The party discovers forbidden knowledge—reproduction, emotions, the existence of free humans. They form deeper bonds, some romantic. Synchronization improves but obedience wavers.
*   **Act III — Rebellion (Sessions 9–11):** The truth revealed—adults sacrificed reproduction for immortality. Klaxosaurs are humans who rejected this, becoming monsters. The party must choose sides.
*   **Act IV — New Future (Sessions 12–15):** The party leads a children's rebellion, defeats the immortal council or the alien VIRM threat, and decides humanity's future—will they repeat the past or create something new?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Paired Piloting**

*   Each Franxx requires two pilots: Stamen (male, control movement) and Pistil (female, control weapons).
*   **Synchronization:** Emotional harmony between partners determines combat effectiveness.
*   **Incompatibility:** Partners who can't sync emotionally cannot pilot together effectively.

### 2. **Emotional Synchronization**

*   Players roleplay building relationships with their partners.
*   **High Sync:** Trust, romance, or deep friendship grants combat bonuses.
*   **Low Sync:** Distrust, conflict, or emotional distance causes penalties.

### 3. **Stamina Depletion**

*   Piloting drains life force. Prolonged combat ages pilots prematurely.
*   **Yellow Blood Cells:** Consumed to sustain pilots—running out means death or forced retirement.

### 4. **Reproduction Discovery**

*   The campaign features a major plot point where pilots discover sex and pregnancy—concepts hidden from them.
*   **Narrative Mechanic:** This discovery triggers rebellion, as pilots realize they're more than weapons.

*   **Coming of Age in War:** Child soldiers discovering what it means to be human while fighting for survival.
*   **Reproduction as Rebellion:** Pregnancy and sexuality are acts of defiance against a society that demands sterility.
*   **Partnership:** Franxx require two pilots—teamwork, trust, and love are literal survival mechanics.
*   **Immortality's Cost:** Adults gave up reproduction for eternal life, dooming the species. Is immortality worth losing the future?
*   **Defining Humanity:** Are you human because of biology, or because of choice, emotion, and connection?
