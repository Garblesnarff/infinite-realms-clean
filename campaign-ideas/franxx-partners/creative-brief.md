# Creative Brief: Franxx Partners

## Art Style: Dystopian Pastels with Reproductive Symbolism (Darling in the Franxx Aesthetic)

Soft, vibrant colors hiding dark themes. Franxx designs emphasize paired piloting and reproductive metaphors. Sterile plantation life contrasts with wild battlefields.

### Core Principles:

*   **Pastel Dystopia:** Bright colors (pinks, blues, reds) for characters and mechs, but settings show decay beneath beauty.
*   **Reproductive Symbolism:** Franxx cockpits resemble wombs, piloting positions suggestive.
*   **Coming-of-Age:** Characters drawn youthful, expressive, experiencing emotions for the first time.
