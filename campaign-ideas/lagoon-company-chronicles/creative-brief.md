# Creative Brief: Lagoon Company Chronicles

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Crime Noir (90s Action Films meets Southeast Asian Grit)

Inspired by Hong Kong action cinema, Tarantino violence, and Thai urban decay. This style blends neon-lit nightclubs with rusted shipyards, dual-pistol gun-fu with military tactical gear, and cynical nihilism with explosive action. Colors are harsh—neon pinks against night blacks, muzzle flash yellow, blood red. Character designs are practical—tank tops, tactical vests, sunglasses, cigarettes. Everything feels sweaty, violent, and morally bankrupt—like watching an action movie directed by nihilists.

### Core Principles:

*   **Gritty Realism:** Actual firearms, tactical movements, consequences for mistakes.
*   **Nihilistic Cool:** Violence is stylish but meaningless, survival trumps morality.
*   **Roanapur Chaos:** Lawless city where crime syndicates rule and innocence dies.

## Voice

A harsh, cynical voice—female, American street accent with edge and trauma. The delivery is aggressive, mocking idealism, with dark humor masking pain. Emotion is anger barely controlled—rage at the world, at abusers, at anyone claiming moral high ground. References guns, death, and survival with casual brutality. Audio has urban echo—bars, alleys, gunshots. Role: A traumatized gunslinger teaching the reality of violence, or delivering execution one-liners.
