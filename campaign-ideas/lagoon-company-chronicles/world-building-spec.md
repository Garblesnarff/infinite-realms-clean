# World-Building Specification Brief: Lagoon Company Chronicles

**Core Concept:** Players join the Lagoon Company—modern pirates operating in Roanapur, Thailand's lawless criminal haven. One member is a former corporate employee learning that morality is a luxury. They run smuggling jobs for cartels, triads, and Russian mob while Revy's nihilism infects them. The campaign is crime thriller descent—violence, betrayal, and moral decay in a city where innocence goes to die.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Roanapur's history—how a Thai port became criminal haven controlled by syndicates instead of government.
*   The major factions—Russian Hotel Moscow, Colombian cartel, Chinese triad, yakuza—in constant tension.
*   Revy's past—childhood abuse, NY streets, becoming a killer to survive.
*   The refugee phenomenon—people who can't return to normal society, trapped in Roanapur.

**Factions:**
*   **Hotel Moscow:** Russian mob led by Balalaika, ex-Soviet military, most powerful faction.
*   **Colombian Cartel:** Drug runners, violent and unpredictable, frequently clash with Russians.
*   **Chinese Triad:** Old-school organized crime, honor-bound but ruthless.
*   **Lagoon Company:** Small-time smugglers, survive by being useful to all sides.

**Locations:**
*   **Roanapur:** Lawless Thai port city, no police, controlled by crime syndicates, constant violence.
*   **Yellow Flag Bar:** Neutral ground for criminals, frequently shot up and rebuilt.
*   **The Mangroves:** Swampy smuggling routes, ambush territory.
*   **Black Lagoon Ship:** Modified PT boat, party's home and transport.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party maintains morality, THEN they struggle to survive and are seen as weak.
*   IF they embrace nihilism, THEN they survive but lose their humanity.
*   IF they betray a faction, THEN that faction hunts them to extinction.
*   IF the Vampire Twins aren't stopped, THEN Roanapur descends into total chaos.
