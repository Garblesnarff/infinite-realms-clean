# World-Building Specification: The Quantum Expedition

## Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals (For Gameplay)

### Superposition
- Quantum objects exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed
- Measurement/observation collapses superposition into single state
- Party can enter superposition: Exist in multiple locations, perform multiple actions
- Cost: Maintaining superposition requires focus; self-observation ends it

### Wave-Particle Duality
- Matter exhibits both wave and particle properties
- Particle form: Localized, certain position, can interact traditionally
- Wave form: Spread out probability, can tunnel through barriers, harder to pin down
- Party can shift between forms for tactical advantages

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
- Cannot know both position and momentum precisely
- Knowing where you are precisely means not knowing your velocity
- Creates navigation puzzles: Trade knowledge of location for knowledge of direction
- Combat applications: Uncertain position = harder to hit

### Quantum Entanglement
- Particles can be linked across any distance
- Measuring one instantly affects the other
- Party can entangle items, party members, or themselves with NPCs
- Perfect communication and coordination when entangled

### Quantum Tunneling
- Probability of appearing on far side of barrier without crossing it
- Thicker/higher energy barriers = lower probability
- Party rolls to attempt tunneling through obstacles
- Can fail spectacularly or succeed miraculously

### Virtual Particles
- Quantum vacuum constantly creates particle-antiparticle pairs
- They exist briefly then annihilate
- In quantum realm, these beings can be encountered
- Unstable but potentially helpful or hostile

## The Quantum Realm Structure

### Scale
- **Subatomic Level:** Smaller than atoms, within electron clouds
- **Nuclear Level:** Inside atomic nuclei, among protons and neutrons
- **Quark Level:** Inside protons/neutrons, fundamental particles
- **Planck Scale:** Theoretical smallest possible distance (campaign doesn't go quite this deep)

### Zones

**Electron Orbital Shells**
- Probability clouds where electrons exist
- Different orbitals (s, p, d, f) have different shapes and energies
- Higher energy orbitals are more exotic and dangerous
- Orbital inhabitants live in these probability clouds

**Atomic Nucleus**
- Dense core of atom
- Protons (positive charge) and neutrons (neutral)
- Strong nuclear force binds them together
- High energy environment
- Contains quark-level entities

**Quantum Vacuum**
- "Empty" space between particles
- Actually teeming with virtual particles
- Most alien and dangerous zone
- Home to Virtual Particle beings

**The Quantum Core**
- Center of pocket realm
- Heisenbrecht's experiment apparatus
- Nexus where observation is most powerful
- Reality most malleable here

## Probability Entity Society

### Nature
- Beings of pure quantum uncertainty
- Exist in all possible states simultaneously
- Experience all potential realities at once
- Observation/measurement is existential threat

### Culture
- Value uncertainty and possibility over actuality
- Believe collapsed states are death
- Art consists of maximum superposition
- Philosophy: "To be certain is to be dead"

### Factions

**Uncertainty Purists**
- Want realm to remain forever quantum
- Oppose any classical influence
- See party as contamination
- Leader: Probability Prime

**Classical Reformers**
- Believe some certainty has value
- Willing to partially collapse for benefits
- See potential in cooperation with classical beings
- Leader: Certainty Singer

**Decoherence Cult**
- Believe collapse is inevitable and necessary
- Accelerating decoherence deliberately
- See it as evolution to higher state
- Dangerous extremists

### Communication
- Multiple simultaneous conversations (superposition of dialogue)
- Party's observer suits translate most probable meanings
- Entanglement allows clearer communication
- Collapsed beings can only speak one statement at a time

## Physics as Magic System

### Observable Abilities (Party Can Learn)

**Quantum Leap:** Short-range teleportation via tunneling
**Superposition Strike:** Attack all possible target locations simultaneously
**Entanglement Bond:** Link with ally for perfect coordination
**Wave Form:** Become incorporeal, spread across space
**Probability Bias:** Manipulate quantum outcomes (limited uses)
**Observer's Sight:** See probability clouds, predict outcomes
**Decoherence Shield:** Force attacks to collapse into single missed trajectory

### Restrictions
- Classical laws don't fully apply
- Magic from normal world behaves strangely
- Observation is most powerful force
- Consciousness directly affects reality

## Campaign Stakes

### The Decoherence Crisis
- Pocket realm is unstable
- Will collapse into classical state
- Timeline: ~25 game sessions before total collapse
- Accelerating over time
- Environmental effects become more severe

### Consequences of Failure
- **Total Collapse:** Quantum realm becomes classical space, all Probability Entities die
- **Quantum Leak:** Uncertainty spreads into classical world, reality becomes probabilistic
- **Cascade Effect:** Destruction spreads beyond pocket realm

### Success Options
1. **Controlled Shutdown:** Save classical world, quantum beings die
2. **Stabilization:** Save quantum realm permanently, risk contamination
3. **Compromise Zones:** Partial collapse, protected quantum reserves
4. **Hybrid Reality:** Merge quantum and classical in new form of existence

## Heisenbrecht's Role

### Background
- Brilliant archmage and quantum physicist
- Sought perfect divination through quantum observation
- Experiment went wrong (or right, depending on view)
- Created pocket quantum realm instead

### Current State
- Merged with the realm
- Exists as living wave function
- Godlike power in quantum space
- Losing human perspective
- Might be holding realm stable through will alone

### Motivations
- Believes he's protecting quantum beings
- Sees classical certainty as death
- Genuinely doesn't want to "murder" by observation
- Tragic villain—noble goals, terrible methods

### Redemption or Sacrifice
- Can be convinced quantum beings value some certainty
- Might choose collapse to save classical world
- Could stabilize realm through ultimate observation/sacrifice
- Party's interaction determines his fate

## DM Customization

### Difficulty Adjustments
- Speed of decoherence (faster = harder)
- Complexity of quantum puzzles
- Number and strength of hostile entities
- Availability of quantum abilities

### Philosophical Depth
- Can be played as pure science-fantasy adventure
- Or as deep philosophical exploration of:
  - Observer effect on reality
  - Free will vs. determinism
  - Nature of consciousness
  - Ethics of creating/destroying life
  - Value of possibility vs. actuality

### Integration Options
- Standalone quantum adventure
- Part of series investigating magical experiments
- Introduces quantum magic to campaign world
- Party gains permanent quantum abilities
- Quantum realm becomes recurring location

### Alternative Endings
- Quantum beings integrate into classical world
- Party stays in quantum realm permanently
- Realm stabilizes as tourist destination for classical beings
- Quantum technology revolutionizes magic
- Disaster scenario: Reality becomes permanently uncertain
