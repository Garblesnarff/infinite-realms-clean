## Art Style: Classical Chinese Ink Painting meets Animation (Studio Ghibli/Traditional Scroll Painting)

Blend traditional Chinese ink wash paintings with vibrant animation aesthetics—think classical scroll paintings brought to dynamic life with Ghibli-style character expressiveness and supernatural wonder.

### Core Principles:
*   **Dynamic Brushwork:** Flowing, gestural lines suggest movement and energy
*   **Mythic Scale:** Gods, demons, and landscapes should feel larger than life
*   **Playful Supernatural:** Magic is colorful, transformative, and often humorous

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Traditional ink blacks and grays for landscapes, vibrant reds/golds/greens for supernatural elements, cloud patterns and celestial motifs.

**Character Design:** Sun Wukong in traditional robes with golden circlet and staff, able to transform. Other pilgrims have distinct silhouettes—rotund Pig, sturdy Sandy, scholarly Tripitaka.

**Environments:** Mythic Chinese landscapes—misty mountains, cloud palaces, demon territories with unique supernatural aesthetics (fire mountains, underwater kingdoms).

**Composition:** Use scroll painting techniques—vertical compositions for heaven, horizontal for journeys, asymmetric balance, atmospheric perspective with mist.

## Voice

Energetic, mischievous voice with theatrical Chinese accent, like a storyteller performing epic tales. Quick-paced during action, slowing for wisdom. The emotion is joyful irreverence mixed with genuine spiritual seeking. Role: A storyteller recounting the legendary pilgrimage.

## Music Style

Traditional Chinese instruments (erhu, pipa, dizi flute, guzheng) blended with modern orchestral swells. Sun Wukong has a playful, energetic theme using percussion and high winds. Tripitaka has a peaceful, meditative theme. Demon battles use dramatic percussion. Celestial scenes feature shimmering, ethereal arrangements. Overall tone is adventurous yet spiritual—think Joe Hisaishi meets traditional Chinese opera.
