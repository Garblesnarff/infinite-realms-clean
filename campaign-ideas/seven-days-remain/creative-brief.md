# Creative Brief: Seven Days Remain

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Japanese Horror Realism with VHS Degradation

Inspired by Ring's iconic aesthetic, this style combines modern Japanese horror with the degraded, grainy quality of old VHS footage. The imagery is realistic but slightly corrupted, as if viewed through cursed media. Sadako's appearances are iconic and terrifying.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Realistic but Degraded:** Modern settings but with visual corruption—static, grain, distortion.
*   **Water and Hair:** Recurring motifs—wet surfaces, long black hair, wells, reflections.
*   **The Crawl:** Sadako's signature movement—crawling with inhuman motion—should be emphasized.
*   **Countdown Dread:** Visual representation of time passing—calendars, clocks, sunset imagery.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** J-horror, cursed media, VHS static, ticking clock, vengeful spirit, water, long black hair, wells, investigation, dread.
*   **Feeling:** The inescapable approach of death. Time running out. Cursed knowledge you wish you could unknow.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic modern Japan with horror elements. Sadako is rendered with disturbing realism.
*   **Degradation:** Add VHS scan lines, static, tracking errors, color bleeding—as if viewed through cursed footage.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Photorealistic image of a Japanese apartment, but the image has VHS degradation—scan lines, tracking errors, slight color bleeding. The scene shows a television showing static, and in the reflection on the screen, a figure with long black hair."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Realistic modern colors but desaturated and degraded. Lots of grays, blues, and the colorof old tape—faded colors with magenta/green color bleed.
*   **Sadako:** Black hair, white burial kimono, pale gray-blue skin.
*   **Water:** Omnipresent—puddles, rain, wells, always reflecting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Desaturated color palette with VHS color degradation. The scene shows an old well in Japanese countryside, water at the bottom reflecting cloudy sky. Colors bleed slightly—greens have magenta edges, blues wash out."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Contemporary Japanese people, normal but increasingly stressed and exhausted as the deadline approaches.
*   **Sadako:** Iconic appearance—long black hair covering face, white burial kimono, pale skin, crawling with one eye visible through hair.
*   **Manifestations:** Sadako appears in reflections, emerging from water, crawling from wells or screens.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Sadako crawling forward with inhuman motion. Long black hair completely covering her face except for one pale eye visible through the strands. White burial kimono soaked. Pale blue-gray skin. Fingers elongated and wrong. The image has VHS static and degradation."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Modern Japan:** Apartments, libraries, urban settings, countryside wells, all rendered realistically but with an air of unease.
*   **The Well:** Central location—stone well, dark water, claustrophobic shaft, evidence of death.
*   **Water Everywhere:** Rain, puddles, bathrooms, reflections in windows—water as a recurring motif.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a Japanese apartment at night. Modern but slightly old-fashioned. A calendar on the wall shows days crossed out, only three remain. Through the window, rain. Water is pooling on the floor inexplicably. The image has a grainy, VHS quality."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Realistic lighting but with high contrast. Heavy shadows. Light from screens (TV, computer) casting blue glows.
*   **Manifestations:** Sadako appears in shadows, in reflections, in places she shouldn't be.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates paranoia—is that shadow her? Is that reflection moving independently?
*   **Prompt Example:** "A character looking at their reflection in a rainy window at night. The room behind them is dimly lit. In the reflection, slightly off from reality, a figure with long hair stands behind them that isn't actually there. VHS static obscures the details."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use frames within frames—screens showing cursed images, wells viewed from above, mirrors and reflections.
*   **The Crawl:** When showing Sadako, use low angles emphasizing her approach, or extreme close-ups of her eye through hair.
*   **Countdown:** Include visual timekeepers—calendars, setting suns, counting down.
*   **Prompt Example:** "POV shot looking down into a stone well. Darkness below with a suggestion of white at the bottom. The image is framed by the circular well opening. At the bottom, barely visible in the darkness, two hands reaching upward. VHS grain makes it hard to see clearly, creating uncertainty."

## Voice

A hollow, whispering female voice with a Japanese accent, speaking as if from a great distance or through water. The tone is flat affect mixed with desperate warning—someone trying to convey urgency while drained of emotion by horror. Pacing includes long pauses between statements, as if the speaker is struggling to continue. Background audio includes constant subtle water sounds—dripping, rain, wells echoing—and VHS tracking errors. Occasionally, underneath everything, a wet crawling sound. Role: A previous victim who failed, leaving a warning for the next cursed souls, knowing they face the same inevitable end in seven days.
