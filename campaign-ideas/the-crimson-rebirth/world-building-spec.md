### **World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Crimson Rebirth**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Players awaken as young adults in the magical kingdom of Astraea with fragmented memories of past lives and extraordinary magical potential. They must master their powers at the prestigious Astral Academy while uncovering a conspiracy to trigger the Crimson Eclipse—a catastrophic merging of realities. The campaign explores whether people can truly change and become better versions of themselves when given a second chance.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the Kingdom of Astraea and the discovery of the ley line convergence beneath what would become Luminis.
    *   Write the complete history of the Astral Academy, from its founding by the First Circle of Mages to its current role as the premier magical institution.
    *   Describe the ancient civilization that built the Celestial Spire and why they abandoned it. What was their connection to cross-dimensional magic?
    *   Explain the metaphysics of reincarnation in this world. Why do some souls cross between dimensions? What determines who becomes "Reborn Souls"?
    *   Detail the prophecy of the Crimson Eclipse. Who first foretold it? What are the exact conditions required to trigger it?
    *   Chronicle the history of the Noble Houses of Astraea, focusing on House Vermillion and their gradual corruption.
    *   Describe the nature of ley lines in this world. How were they discovered? What is their relationship to magic and reality itself?

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**

    *   **IF:** A player uses their Past Life Echo ability and succeeds.
    *   **THEN:** They recover a fragment of memory related to their past failure, providing both emotional development and a mechanical clue about the current situation. The Reborn Circle takes notice and may reach out.

    *   **IF:** A player uses their Past Life Echo ability and fails.
    *   **THEN:** They gain exhaustion and must confront the emotional weight of failing again. This may trigger a character development moment where allies must help them recover confidence.

    *   **IF:** The party sides with Lysander early (Session 2-3).
    *   **THEN:** He becomes a valuable ally sooner, providing insider knowledge about noble house politics. His redemption arc accelerates, and he joins the final battle with unique abilities.

    *   **IF:** The party antagonizes Lysander repeatedly.
    *   **THEN:** He remains hostile longer and may initially side with the noble houses when the schism occurs in Session 6, requiring the party to redeem him later or fight him as a mini-boss.

    *   **IF:** The party successfully rescues all kidnapped students in Session 4.
    *   **THEN:** They gain the loyalty of grateful students who provide support in Session 6. Marcus has fewer corrupted mages in the final battle.

    *   **IF:** The party fails to stop the warehouse ritual in Session 4.
    *   **THEN:** Marcus gains additional power. Several students are permanently corrupted and become enemies in later sessions. The Eclipse timer accelerates.

    *   **IF:** The party investigates openly through academy channels (Session 5).
    *   **THEN:** They maintain support of the full faculty but Marcus has time to prepare defenses. The final battle is harder but they have more allies.

    *   **IF:** The party investigates secretly (Session 5).
    *   **THEN:** They maintain surprise advantage and may disrupt ritual preparations, making the final battle easier, but fewer NPCs trust them to help in the final assault.

    *   **IF:** The party achieves high relationship scores (+7 or higher) with multiple NPCs.
    *   **THEN:** Those NPCs join the assault on the Celestial Spire. Each provides unique benefits—Vara provides combat buffs, Elena provides magical items, Celeste provides healing, Lysander provides spell support.

    *   **IF:** The party has low relationship scores with key NPCs.
    *   **THEN:** They assault the Spire with minimal support, facing the full force of Marcus's defenses alone. The difficulty increases significantly.

    *   **IF:** In the final battle, the party chooses to sacrifice their reincarnation powers to seal the Eclipse.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue showing them as normal (but skilled) mages building the lives they want. They've proven they can be better people even without extraordinary power.

    *   **IF:** In the final battle, the party finds an alternative solution to seal the Eclipse without sacrificing their powers.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue showing the consequences of retaining extraordinary power—they must now shoulder greater responsibility. Future threats will seek them out.

**7. Magic System Specifics**
*   **Directive:** Define the unique magical elements of this world.
*   **Ley Lines:** Rivers of concentrated magical energy that flow through the world. Visible to trained mages as shimmering streams of multicolored light. Convergence points are exceptionally powerful—Luminis sits on a major convergence, the Celestial Spire sits on the most powerful one known.
*   **Reincarnation Marks:** Each Reborn Soul bears a unique glowing mark somewhere on their body. These marks resonate with ley lines and pulse when the character uses Past Life Echoes. They're beautiful but impossible to hide from those who know what to look for.
*   **Cross-Dimensional Magic:** The most forbidden branch of study. Allows manipulation of the barriers between realities. Requires massive amounts of ley line energy. The ancient civilization that built the Celestial Spire mastered this but disappeared—possibly by accidentally merging with another reality.
*   **The Crimson Eclipse:** A tear between dimensions that, if fully opened, would merge two or more realities into one. The process is catastrophic, destroying both worlds and creating something new from the chaos. Those who control the ritual believe they'll become gods of the new reality.

**8. Timeline of Events (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Directive:** This is the default timeline if the party doesn't intervene. Use this to create urgency and show consequences.
*   **Session 1:** Party awakens. Kidnappings continue in background.
*   **Session 2:** Party enters Academy. Marcus completes second ritual site.
*   **Session 3:** More students disappear. Marcus gains more power.
*   **Session 4:** If party doesn't intervene, warehouse ritual succeeds. Eclipse timer begins early.
*   **Session 5:** Marcus activates all ritual sites. Eclipse tears begin appearing.
*   **Session 6:** Without party action, noble houses openly rebel. Civil war begins.
*   **Session 7:** Marcus completes the ritual unopposed.
*   **Session 8:** The Crimson Eclipse fully opens. Both realities are destroyed. Campaign ends in failure.

This specification ensures a living, reactive world that responds to player choices while maintaining narrative coherence and building toward the central conflict of redemption versus repeating past failures.
