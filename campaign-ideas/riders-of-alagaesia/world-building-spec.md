### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Riders of Alagaesia**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players bond with dragon hatchlings and become Dragon Riders, joining the Varden rebellion against Galbatorix's empire. They learn Ancient Language magic, train with elves, and unite fractured peoples to restore the fallen Rider order and overthrow tyranny.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   The Dragon Riders were peacekeepers for millennia until Galbatorix's betrayal destroyed them.
*   Galbatorix killed his fellow Riders, enslaved dragons, and built an empire through fear and true-name magic.
*   The Ancient Language is the language of magic—speaking it makes statements true; lying is impossible.
*   Dragons choose Riders through bonding with eggs, creating telepathic links and magical marks (Gedwey Ignasia).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Varden (Rebellion):** Human/dwarf alliance fighting the Empire. Led by Nasuada, seeks to restore freedom.
*   **The Elves:** Immortal forest dwellers, last protectors of Rider traditions, train new Riders in Ellesmera.
*   **The Dwarves:** Mountain clans, master smiths, politically divided on supporting the Varden.
*   **The Empire (Antagonist):** Galbatorix's tyranny, controls through Riders enslaved by true names and fear.
*   **The Urgals:** Warrior tribes, traditionally enemies of humans, potentially recruited as allies.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Brom (mentor), Arya (elven ally), Murtagh (tragic rival), Galbatorix (tyrant king), Oromis (hidden Rider teacher).
*   **Tier 2/3:** Varden soldiers, elven warriors, dwarf smiths, Empire soldiers, Urgal chieftains, villagers.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Carvahall:** Farming village where dragons hatch, peaceful until Empire attacks.
*   **Ellesmera:** Hidden elven city in ancient forest, training ground for Riders, protected by magic.
*   **Farthen Dur:** Hollow mountain, dwarf city, Varden headquarters, massive underground caverns.
*   **Uru'baen:** Empire capital, Galbatorix's fortress, dark spires, enslaved dragons.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** party bonds with dragons → **THEN** Empire hunts them as threats to Galbatorix's rule.
*   **IF** party learns true names → **THEN** they gain power over others but risk being controlled themselves.
*   **IF** party unites dwarves/Urgals with Varden → **THEN** rebellion gains strength for final assault.
*   **IF** Murtagh is captured by Galbatorix → **THEN** he's enslaved via true name and becomes enemy.
*   **IF** party defeats Galbatorix → **THEN** they must decide the new order—restore Riders or disband them forever.
