# Creative Brief: Spirit of the Dying Forest

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Painterly Fantasy with Emotional Lighting (Ori-inspired)

Inspired by the gorgeous hand-painted aesthetics and emotional visual storytelling of *Ori and the Blind Forest*. This style captures the contrast between decay and restoration, the expressiveness of silent characters, the beauty of nature, and the emotional weight of sacrifice.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Natural Beauty:** Forests, trees, water, light effects rendered with painterly detail
*   **Light as Hope:** Glowing spirits, luminescent flora, light representing life and restoration
*   **Decay Contrast:** Withered plants, dark corruption, visual transformation from death to life
*   **Expressive Silhouettes:** Characters convey emotion through body language and animation

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Emotional, beautiful, bittersweet, painterly, nature-focused, light vs. darkness, hopeful melancholy
*   **Feeling:** The heartbreak of loss mixed with determination to heal. The beauty of nature's resilience. The warmth of maternal love. The tragedy of misunderstanding. Tears and hope coexisting.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Ori:** White glowing spirit with blue accents, luminescent
*   **Sein:** Golden-white light, warm and guiding
*   **Healthy Forest:** Rich greens, vibrant flowers, blue waters, golden sunlight
*   **Decayed Forest:** Gray-brown withered plants, purple corruption, dark atmosphere
*   **Kuro:** Black feathers, red eyes, imposing silhouette
*   **Restoration:** Transition from darkness to light, gray to green, death to life
*   **Prompt Example:** "...painterly fantasy art of a small glowing white spirit (Ori) standing in a dying forest. Withered gray trees with bare branches. Purple corruption spreading across bark. In the distance, a faint golden glow suggests hope. Ori's white-blue luminescence stands out against the darkness. Emotional, melancholic atmosphere. Detailed hand-painted style."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Ori:** Small white spirit with large glowing eyes, cat-like ears, ethereal glow
*   **Naru:** Large gentle creature, motherly, expressive face despite lack of dialogue
*   **Kuro:** Massive black owl, fierce but tragic, protects egg, sharp silhouette
*   **Gumo:** Small hunched creature, large eyes, lonely posture, gradually stands taller
*   **Sein:** Orb of golden light with subtle face, always beside Ori
*   **Prompt Example:** "Character sheet: Ori the spirit. Small glowing white creature with large blue eyes full of emotion. Pointed ears, small paws, ethereal tail. Body emits soft white-blue glow with particle effects. Various emotional poses: grieving, determined, joyful, scared. Hand-painted fantasy art style with expressive features despite minimal detail."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Sunken Glades:** Forest floor with towering trees, Naru's home (carved tree hollow)
*   **Ginso Tree:** Massive ancient tree with hollow interior, water-filled chambers, bioluminescent plants
*   **Forlorn Ruins:** Stone structures overgrown with vines, once-grand now crumbling
*   **Mount Horu:** Volcanic interior, flowing lava, heat distortion, crystalline formations
*   **Restoration Effects:** Flowers blooming in timelapse, light spreading, color returning
*   **Prompt Example:** "Painterly wide shot of the Ginso Tree interior. Massive hollow tree trunk with platforms made of roots. Bioluminescent blue-green plants provide lighting. Water drips from above creating reflections. Small glowing Ori visible on a platform. Sense of scale and ancient natural beauty. Rich detail and atmospheric depth."

**5. Platforming and Movement:**
*   **Fluid Animation:** Ori's movements are graceful, flowing, ballet-like
*   **Bash Effect:** Time freeze with white glow, trajectory line, burst of light on launch
*   **Wall Jump Trails:** Light particles left behind during climbs
*   **Environmental Interaction:** Platforms respond to touch with glow, vines sway
*   **Prompt Example:** "Dynamic action scene: Ori mid-bash. Time frozen (desaturated background). Ori glowing bright white-blue grabbing a projectile. Trajectory arc shows intended path. Surrounding enemies frozen mid-attack. About to launch upward in burst of light. Painterly style with motion emphasis and dramatic lighting."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Volumetric Light:** God rays through forest canopy, underwater caustics
*   **Bioluminescence:** Plants and spirits provide soft, magical lighting
*   **Atmospheric Depth:** Multiple parallax layers with fog and distance
*   **Emotional Lighting:** Warm (hope, love), Cool (sadness, decay), Bright (triumph)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with volumetric god rays piercing through forest canopy. Golden light illuminates particles in the air. Ori glows softly in foreground. Background trees fade into atmospheric mist. Bioluminescent flowers provide blue accent lights. Painterly style with rich, emotional lighting that conveys hope breaking through darkness."

## Music & Sound

An orchestral soundtrack mixing strings, piano, and choir that swells with emotion. Gareth Coker-inspired: leitmotifs for characters (Ori's theme, Naru's theme, Kuro's theme), emotional crescendos during story beats, peaceful exploration music, intense action during escapes. Sound design emphasizes natural beauty: rustling leaves, flowing water, Ori's small vocal sounds. The music should make players cry during key scenes—genuine emotional manipulation through beauty.

## Voice

No spoken dialogue—only emotional vocalizations (gasps, cries, determined sounds). The "voice" is the music itself, swelling to convey joy, grief, hope, loss. Story beats are silent film-like: expressive animation conveys everything needed. When there is a narrator (rare), it's gentle, storytelling-like, as if reading a fairy tale. Role: The voice of emotional, wordless storytelling that transcends language.
