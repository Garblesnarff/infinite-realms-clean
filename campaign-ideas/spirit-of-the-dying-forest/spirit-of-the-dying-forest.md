The forest is decaying, corrupted by the owl Kuro who stole the Core Light to protect her own children, unaware it would destroy everything else.

It's a journey of sacrifice, where heroes and villains discover their similarities, and love can mean letting go.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-16 sessions)

An emotional journey of restoration where the real enemy is grief, not evil.

*   **Act I — The Dying Begins (Sessions 1-5):** Ori awakens during a catastrophic storm as the Spirit Tree's light fails. Their adoptive mother Naru dies from starvation caused by the forest's decay. Alone and grieving, Ori meets Sein—the Spirit Tree's eyes and voice—who explains what happened: Kuro the owl stole the Core Light, causing the forest to die. To restore Nibel, they must collect three elements from corrupted regions. The party learns movement abilities (wall jump, double jump, bash) to navigate increasingly difficult terrain. They encounter Gumo, a lone survivor of a destroyed race, who seems antagonistic but is desperately lonely.
*   **Act II — The Three Elements (Sessions 6-11):** The party journeys to three corrupted regions: Ginso Tree (Water), Forlorn Ruins (Wind), and Mount Horu (Fire). Each location is a gauntlet of platforming challenges culminating in an escape sequence. At each element's heart, they restore ancient power while the corruption fights back violently. Between missions, they discover Kuro's backstory through environmental clues: she lost her children when the Spirit Tree's previous light burst killed them. Her theft of the light wasn't malice—it was a mother protecting her last surviving egg. The party realizes Kuro isn't evil, just grieving like Ori. Gumo's loyalty shifts as he witnesses Ori's kindness.
*   **Act III — The Sacrifice (Sessions 12-16):** With all three elements restored, the party confronts Kuro at the Spirit Tree. A battle begins, but Naru (revived by Gumo using the waters of life) arrives carrying Kuro's child, showing Kuro her egg survived. Kuro realizes her grief blinded her to others' suffering—just as the Spirit Tree's light killed her children, her actions killed the forest. In the campaign's emotional climax, Kuro sacrifices herself to return the light to the Spirit Tree, knowing it means her death. The forest is reborn in brilliant light. Ori becomes the new spirit guardian. Naru raises Kuro's child alongside Ori. The cycle continues, but this time with understanding and compassion.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of maternal love and sacrifice, grief driving desperate actions, cycles of pain, understanding your enemy's humanity, and how love means letting go. It asks: How far would you go to protect those you love? Can enemies find common ground in shared loss? Is sacrifice the ultimate act of love? The central conflict isn't good vs. evil—it's grief vs. hope, understanding vs. vengeance.
