### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**Spirit of the Dying Forest**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Ori, a small spirit guardian, must restore the dying forest of Nibel by collecting three elements (Water, Wind, Fire) after the owl Kuro stole the Spirit Tree's Core Light to protect her last egg. Through emotional platforming challenges and discovering Kuro's tragic backstory, the party learns the antagonist is a grieving mother just like Ori's lost Naru. The climax requires understanding that sacrifice, not violence, breaks the cycle of pain. Light is restored through Kuro's self-sacrifice, and new life begins with understanding.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Spirit Tree's role as guardian of Nibel forest and source of life.
    *   Write the history of Kuro's loss—how the Spirit Tree's light burst killed her children.
    *   Describe the three element trees: Ginso (Water), Forlorn Temple (Wind), Mount Horu (Fire).
    *   Explain Gumo's race and their extinction when the forest began dying.
    *   Detail Naru's life before finding Ori—she lost her own child before adopting the spirit.
    *   Describe the cycle: Spirit Trees produce guardian spirits, light maintains balance, but can harm.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Forest Spirits** (Major): Ori, Sein, and other spirit guardians maintaining natural balance.
    *   **Corrupted Creatures** (Major): Animals and plants twisted by decay into aggressive threats.
    *   **Kuro's Family** (Minor): The owl and her sole surviving egg, antagonists from grief not malice.
    *   **Gumo's People** (Historical): Extinct race whose ruins tell story of the forest's failure.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Naru (adoptive mother), Sein (companion spirit), Kuro (tragic antagonist), Gumo (lonely survivor), Spirit Tree (benevolent guardian).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Corrupted Animal," "Forest Spirit," "Ancient Guardian" (dungeon boss), "Kuro's Owlets" (memory/ghost).

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Sunken Glades:** Starting forest area, Naru's home, gradually decaying.
*   **Thornfelt Swamp:** Corrupted wetlands with poisonous waters and hostile creatures.
*   **Ginso Tree:** Water element dungeon, massive hollow tree, escape sequence after restoration.
*   **Valley of the Wind:** Open area with wind mechanics and Gumo's destroyed village.
*   **Forlorn Ruins:** Wind element dungeon, ancient temple with precise platforming.
*   **Sorrow Pass:** Treacherous mountain path leading to volcano.
*   **Mount Horu:** Fire element dungeon, volcanic interior, hardest platforming challenges.
*   **Spirit Tree Grove:** Central location, site of Kuro's nest and final confrontation.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Element restored → **THEN:** That region begins healing, new paths open, visual transformation occurs.
*   **IF:** All three elements restored → **THEN:** Can confront Kuro, finale sequence triggers.
*   **IF:** Gumo witnesses Ori's compassion → **THEN:** He uses waters of life to revive Naru.
*   **IF:** Naru shows Kuro the surviving egg → **THEN:** Kuro realizes her grief blinded her to others' suffering.
*   **IF:** Kuro sacrifices herself → **THEN:** Light restored, forest reborn, Ori becomes guardian, cycle continues with understanding.

**7. Emotional Beats Without Dialogue**
*   Story conveyed entirely through animated cutscenes without words.
*   Characters express through: body language, facial expressions, actions.
*   Music swells at emotional moments to guide player feelings.
*   Environmental storytelling reveals backstories (Kuro's empty nests, Gumo's destroyed home).
*   Players infer tragedy and hope themselves, making it more powerful.

**8. Light and Decay Mechanics**
*   Visual language: Light = life, hope, restoration. Darkness = decay, corruption, death.
*   As elements restore, world visibly transforms: flowers bloom, colors return, creatures calm.
*   The Spirit Tree's light is both salvation and danger—it killed Kuro's children but sustains forest.
*   Paradox: What saves many can harm few. No simple answers. Tragedy is inevitable with cosmic-scale guardianship.
