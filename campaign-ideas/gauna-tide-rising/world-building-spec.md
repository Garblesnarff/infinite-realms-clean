### **World-Building Specification Brief: Gauna Tide Rising**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   Last humanity aboard the seed ship Sidonia pilots biomechanical Guardians against the Gauna—shapeshifting alien entities. Only Kabizashi can kill Gauna permanently. Humanity has been genetically modified for survival (photosynthesis, cloning, gender fluidity). The party uncovers secrets about the ship's thousand-year journey and whether Gauna possess intelligence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail Earth's destruction by Gauna swarms, only seed ships escaped.
*   Explain Sidonia's thousand-year journey—multiple generations born and died in deep space.
*   Describe genetic modifications humanity underwent to survive resource scarcity.
*   Outline Guardian technology—biomechanical mecha bonded to pilots, require Kabizashi (harvested from defeated Gauna) as weapons.
*   Explain Gauna nature—shapeshifting entities with cores (Ena) protected by regenerating placenta. Origin unknown.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Sidonia Command** (Major - Player Faction): Military hierarchy protecting the seed ship.
*   **The Immortal Committee** (Minor - Shadow Council): Ageless elites guiding Sidonia, may have hidden agendas.
*   **Ochiai's Followers** (Minor - Transhumanists): Believe humanity must merge with Gauna to survive.
*   **The Gauna** (Major - Alien Threat): Shapeshifting entities of uncertain intelligence.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Captain Kobayashi** (immortal commander/AI), **Hoshijiro** (assimilated pilot), **Izana** (third-gender friend), **Ochiai** (mad scientist AI), **Tsumugi** (human-Gauna hybrid).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Sidonia Residential Tiers** (stratified society), **Guardian Hangars**, **Training Simulations**, **Captain's Bridge**, **Deep Space Battlefields**.

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** Hoshijiro assimilated **THEN** she becomes hybrid Gauna seeking contact, party must choose to destroy or communicate.
*   **IF** resources critically low **THEN** rationing, civil unrest, pilots may starve.
*   **IF** contact with intelligent Gauna achieved **THEN** faction split—some seek peace, others demand extermination.
*   **IF** Tsumugi accepted **THEN** proves coexistence possible, but extremists attempt assassination.

**7. Guardian Combat Mechanics:**
*   **Two-Pilot System:** One controls movement, one controls weapons. Single-pilot mode at disadvantage.
*   **Kabizashi:** Extending spike that must pierce Gauna Ena (core). Limited supply—recovering them from destroyed Guardians is critical.
*   **Zero-G Physics:** Momentum and positioning matter. No up/down in space.

**8. Gauna Mechanics:**
*   **Adaptation:** Learn from tactics. Same strategy twice is less effective.
*   **Regeneration:** Heal from all damage except Kabizashi to core.
*   **Shapeshifting:** Mimic ships to approach, then reveal true form.
*   **Placenta (Ena):** Layered regenerating armor protecting core.

**9. Resource Scarcity:**
*   Food, water, oxygen, ammunition all limited.
*   Failed missions = rationing, civilian casualties.
*   Photosynthesis modification allows survival on light alone temporarily.

**10. Cloning Ethics:**
*   Deceased pilots can be cloned with memory backups.
*   Raises questions: Is the clone the same person? Do they have rights? Can memory be trusted?
