# Gauna Tide Rising

*A Hard Sci-Fi Horror / Last Humanity Mecha campaign — Long Campaign (16–20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Gauna Tide Rising
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Hard Sci-Fi Horror / Survival / Last Humanity Epic
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **15–17**
**Tone (keywords):** last humanity, alien horror, biomechanical guardians, space combat, resource scarcity, genetic engineering, humanity's survival
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are pilots aboard Sidonia, a seed ship carrying the last remnants of humanity through deep space after Earth was destroyed by the Gauna—shapeshifting alien entities of incomprehensible nature. They pilot Guardians (biomechanical mecha) to defend the ship using Kabizashi (the only weapon that can permanently kill Gauna). As they fight, they discover humanity has been genetically modified for survival, the Gauna may be more than mindless predators, and the ship hides dark secrets about its thousand-year journey.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Gauna are horror entities—adaptive, regenerating, shapeshifting. Only Kabizashi piercing the Ena (core) kills them permanently. Resources (food, ammunition, oxygen) are scarce.
*   **Investigation:** Uncover Sidonia's secrets—genetic engineering, clone creation, the immortal Captain's agenda, what the Gauna truly are.
*   **Consequences:** Permadeath is real. Pilots die frequently. Ship damage affects civilian population. Gauna learn from each encounter.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

*   **Act I — Awakening (Sessions 1–5):** A low-caste pilot (party member) awakens from the depths of Sidonia and joins Guardian training. Early Gauna encounters establish the threat—horrifying, adaptive, nearly impossible to kill.
*   **Act II — The Siege (Sessions 6–10):** Gauna attacks intensify. The party faces hybrid Gauna, cloned pilots, and learns about humanity's genetic modifications (photosynthesis, gender fluidity, cloning).
*   **Act III — The Cluster (Sessions 11–15):** A massive Gauna cluster threatens Sidonia. The party discovers ancient Gauna may possess intelligence. Contact attempts fail or succeed based on party choices.
*   **Act IV — Last Humanity's Choice (Sessions 16–20):** The truth revealed—Gauna and humans share a creator. The party decides humanity's fate: coexistence, extermination, or transcendence beyond mortality.

    *   **Personality:** (Before) Skilled, quiet, dedicated. (After) Tragic monster trying to retain humanity.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her assimilated form serves as a communication bridge between humanity and Gauna—or a weapon against Sidonia.

3.  **Izana Shinatose** — *The Genderless Friend*
    *   **Role:** Party member or ally, represents Sidonia's third gender (will choose male/female in adulthood).
    *   **Personality:** Supportive, skilled pilot, loyal friend.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Struggles with identity and choices in a society where individuality is secondary to survival.

    *   **Personality:** Believes humanity must merge with Gauna to survive.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Creates hybrid human-Gauna chimeras. May be right that evolution requires sacrifice.

5.  **Tsumugi Shiraui** — *The Human-Gauna Hybrid*
    *   **Role:** Artificially created fusion of human and Gauna, possesses Kabizashi tentacles naturally.
    *   **Personality:** Child-like, innocent, powerful, sees the party as family.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her existence proves human-Gauna coexistence is possible, but she's seen as an abomination by many.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Guardian Combat**

*   Guardians are biomechanical mecha requiring two pilots (one for movement, one for weapons, or single-pilot for lower effectiveness).
*   **Kabizashi:** The only weapon that can pierce Gauna cores (Ena). Limited supply—recovering Kabizashi from fallen Guardians is critical.

### 2. **Resource Scarcity**

*   Sidonia has limited food, water, oxygen, ammunition.
*   **Consequences:** Failed missions mean rationing. Pilots may die from starvation or asphyxiation, not just combat.

### 3. **Gauna Adaptation**

*   Gauna learn from encounters. Using the same tactic twice is less effective.
*   **Placenta (Ena):** Gauna cores are protected by regenerating shell. Must pierce to kill permanently.

### 4. **Genetic Modifications**

*   All Sidonia humans have been genetically modified:
    *   **Photosynthesis:** Can survive on light alone for short periods.
    *   **Third Gender:** Many individuals choose gender in adulthood.
    *   **Cloning:** Deceased pilots can be cloned (with memory backup), raising identity questions.

## Key Locations

1.  **Sidonia (Seed Ship):** Massive cylindrical generation ship, city inside, population of 500,000.
2.  **Guardian Hangars:** Where biomechanical mecha are stored and maintained.
3.  **The Residential Sectors:** Tiered society—elite near the ship's core, underclass in the depths.
4.  **Training Facilities:** Where pilots learn in simulations before facing real Gauna.
5.  **Deep Space:** The void where Gauna attack—no gravity, no sound, only death and stars.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is survival vs. understanding. Gauna appear to be mindless destroyers, but evidence suggests intelligence and possibly a shared origin with humanity. The party must decide: exterminate the alien threat or attempt communication despite the risk.

---

## Themes

*   **Last Humanity:** Every death reduces humanity's chance of survival. The weight of being the species' last hope.
*   **Horror in the Void:** Gauna are cosmic horror—shapeshifting, adaptive, their nature incomprehensible.
*   **Genetic Identity:** When you can be cloned, what makes you 'you'? Gender fluidity questions traditional identity.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Every meal, every bullet matters. Survival requires sacrifice.
*   **Understanding the Other:** Are Gauna enemies or another form of life seeking survival? Communication vs. extermination.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Exterminate the Gauna:** Destroy all Gauna nests and mega-structures. Humanity survives but remains isolated.
*   **Achieve Communication:** Establish contact with intelligent Gauna. Risky but could end hostilities.
*   **Human-Gauna Integration:** Accept Ochiai's vision—merge humanity and Gauna through biotechnology. Transcend mortality but lose humanity.
*   **Find a New Home:** Reach a habitable planet and establish a colony. Survival, but Gauna may follow.

---

## Session Highlights

*   **Session 2:** "First Sortie" — The party's first Gauna encounter. Watch veterans die horribly, realize this war is unwinnable by conventional means.
*   **Session 8:** "Assimilation" — A beloved pilot (Hoshijiro) is captured by Gauna, returning as a hybrid abomination seeking contact.
*   **Session 13:** "The Cluster Ship" — Facing a Gauna mega-structure the size of a moon, containing billions of cores.
*   **Session 18:** "Understanding" — The party achieves (or fails) contact with Gauna intelligence, learning the truth of both species' origins.

## Gauna Types

1.  **Standard Gauna:** Shapeshifting mass, imitates spacecraft to approach, regenerates from all damage except Kabizashi to the Ena.
2.  **Hybrid Gauna:** Has absorbed human forms, retains human appearance, can communicate but is hostile or confused.
3.  **Mass Union Ship:** Massive Gauna formation, thousands of cores, requires coordinated fleet assault.
4.  **Benign Gauna (Late Game):** Non-hostile Gauna seeking communication. Attacking them closes the path to peace.
