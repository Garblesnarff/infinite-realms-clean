# Wings of the Void - World-Building Specification

## The Skyrift Abyss

### The Shattering (50 Years Ago)
Skydancer Kaia, attempting the first magically-enhanced BASE jump, accidentally tore a hole between dimensions. The resulting chasm split the continent, creating the Skyrift Abyss—a bottomless void leading to the Between Worlds.

### Geography
- **Length**: 2,000 kilometers across continent
- **Width**: Varies, 10-100 kilometers
- **Depth**: Functionally infinite; enters dimensional space after ~10km
- **The Rim**: Chain of cities built on edges (Cloudfall, Edgewick, Plummeton, Vertigost, etc.)

### The Void Layers
1. **Upper Air** (0-2km): Normal physics, training depth
2. **Twilight Zone** (2-5km): Dimensional shimmer begins, weird physics
3. **The Between** (5-10km): Reality optional, magic wild
4. **Deep Void** (10km+): Pure dimensional space, only entities and masters survive
5. **The Core** (unknown depth): Where Void King exists

## The Fallers

### Organization
- **Founded**: By Skydancer Kaia as penance for the Shattering
- **Purpose**: Study the Abyss, perfect aerial magic, maintain balance
- **Membership**: ~500 active jumpers worldwide
- **Hierarchy**: Based on skill and Sacred Descents completed

### Factions
- **Purists** (Skydancer's): Traditional, spiritual, preservationist
- **Sky Demons** (Razor Wind's): Militaristic, control-focused, weaponization
- **Void Friends** (Echo sympathizers): Want full integration with Void entities
- **Thrill Seekers**: Just in it for the adrenaline, politically neutral

### The Nine Sacred Descents
Each stabilizes a dimensional anchor point:
1. **Courage** (2km): Tests basic skill
2. **Cloud Walker** (3km): Blind navigation
3. **Wind Whisperer** (4km): Air current mastery
4. **Void Toucher** (5km): First dimensional contact
5. **Gravity Dancer** (6km): Physics manipulation
6. **Thermal Rider** (7km): Extreme temperature
7. **Storm Breaker** (8km): Electrical hazards
8. **Dream Glider** (9km): Psychic navigation
9. **Infinity Plunge** (10km+): The ultimate test

## Void Entities

### Classifications
- **Drifters**: Passive, floating geometric forms
- **Gliders**: Active, curious, playful
- **Hunters**: Territorial, dangerous
- **Ancients**: Incomprehensibly old and powerful (Void King)
- **Refugees**: Fleeing from Deep Void threat

### Biology
- Exist in permanent freefall
- Feed on dimensional energy
- Reproduce through fractal splitting
- Communicate via resonance patterns
- No concept of "ground" or "up"

### The Void Threat
Something in the Deep Void is consuming entities, driving them toward material world. Nature unknown, possibly:
- Entropy wave
- Rival dimensional lord
- Heat death of their realm
- Void itself collapsing

## Sky Council

### Structure
Five chancellors representing Rim Cities, rotating leadership. Current head: Terminus.

### The Barrier Project
- **Budget**: Massive (bankrupting cities)
- **Tech**: Crystalline reality anchors
- **Magic**: Sacrificed Void entity consciousnesses
- **Timeline**: 60% complete, finishing in ~3 months
- **Effect**: Would seal Abyss permanently, cutting off Void access

### Public Opinion
- **Support**: Families who lost loved ones, business interests affected by incursions
- **Opposition**: Fallers, Void sympathizers, indigenous peoples displaced by Shattering
- **Undecided**: Majority, swayed by propaganda vs reality

## Magic System

### Void Flight
Achieved through absolute surrender to freefall plus technical skill:
- **Gravity Manipulation**: Adjust fall rate and trajectory
- **Wind Bending**: Create/dismiss air currents
- **Dimensional Slip**: Phase through matter while falling
- **Aero-Sight**: See invisible wind patterns
- **Void Communion**: Mind-link with entities

### Limitations
- Only works while in freefall (no ground-based casting)
- Requires split focus (survival + magic)
- Overuse causes dimensional bleeding (becoming part-Void)
- Needs specific altitude for certain effects
- Emotionally demanding (fear blocks it)

## Economy & Culture

### Currency
- Standard money in Rim Cities
- "Air Time" credits among Fallers (measured jump hours)
- Dimensional crystals (condensed Void energy, highly valuable)

### Faller Traditions
- **The Silence**: Meditation before dangerous jumps
- **Wake**: Memorial jumps for fallen (scattering ashes mid-flight)
- **Wingsuit Marking**: Personal symbols on suits
- **The Oath**: "I fall with grace, I rise with wings"

### Technology
- Advanced wingsuits with magical enhancement
- Altimeter-compass hybrids showing dimensional depth
- Emergency teleport beacons (one-use, expensive)
- Recording crystals (capture jump POV)
- Parachutes woven with stabilizing magic

## Mysteries

1. What is the Deep Void threat?
2. Can the Shattering be reversed?
3. Are there other Abysses worldwide?
4. What is the Void King's true goal?
5. Why can some humans achieve Void flight and others can't?
6. What happens if someone falls forever?
7. Is Skydancer telling the full truth?
8. Can Void entities and humans truly coexist?
9. What lies beyond the Nine Sacred Descents?
10. Is the Abyss growing?

These provide campaign extension hooks and player-driven investigation opportunities.
