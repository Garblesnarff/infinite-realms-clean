## Art Style: Native American Tradition meets Spiritual Mysticism

Respectful representation of diverse Native American cultures with emphasis on spiritual connections to land, animals, and ancestors. The aesthetic celebrates traditional art forms—ledger art, hide paintings, beadwork patterns—while rendering the spirit world with dreamlike, non-literal beauty.

### Core Principles:
*   **Cultural Respect:** Authentic and respectful representation avoiding stereotypes and appropriation
*   **Spiritual Connection:** Visual emphasis on relationships between all beings and the land
*   **Oral Tradition:** Storytelling as central to meaning and power
*   **Sacred Balance:** Everything in harmony—order and chaos, physical and spirit, giving and taking

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Earth tones dominate—browns, ochres, reds from clay and minerals. Sky blues and storm grays. Sacred sites glow with spiritual power—white light, aurora colors. The spirit world uses dreamlike, shifting colors that don't stay fixed. Coyote appears in dusty golds and browns. Thunderbird in storm blacks and lightning whites. Spirit animals use natural coloration enhanced with spiritual radiance. Traditional art uses natural pigments—ochre, charcoal, mineral blues, plant dyes. Sacred symbols in white, red, yellow, and black—the four directions.

**Character Design:** Characters wear regionally appropriate traditional clothing—Plains nations in hide clothing and headdresses (earned, not decorative), Southwest in woven garments, Northwest in cedar bark and wool, etc. Respect for diversity between nations and traditions. Spirit animals appear as natural animals with subtle supernatural qualities—extra light, impossible grace, speaking. Coyote shifts between scraggly trickster and noble figure. The Great Spirit appears as natural phenomena rather than humanoid form—light, wind, presence. Ancestral spirits appear with cultural markers of their time and nation.

**Environments:** Sacred landscapes show the natural beauty of diverse regions—mountains, plains, deserts, forests, coasts. Petroglyphs and pictographs mark sacred sites. The spirit world overlays physical locations with dreamlike qualities—colors shift, distances are relative, symbolic meaning becomes literal. The Spirit Lodge uses traditional architecture appropriate to region. Everything emphasizes connection to land—this geography is character, not just setting. Use ledger art and traditional artistic styles for important moments.

**Composition:** Use Native artistic conventions—ledger art-style line work, symbolic representation, geometric patterns from specific traditions. Frame spirit animals with reverence emphasizing their power and wisdom. Coyote uses asymmetric, chaotic composition suggesting trickster nature. Vision quests use surreal, dreamlike framing where metaphor becomes literal. The Council Circle uses perfect symmetry suggesting balance and harmony. Sacred geography uses wide landscape shots emphasizing human smallness in vast, powerful nature.

## Voice

Oral tradition narrator—storyteller by the fire passing down wisdom through tales. Uses rhythm and repetition appropriate to oral tradition. Speaks with understanding that trickster stories teach through laughter and confusion, that all beings deserve respect, and that balance requires both order and chaos. Respectful of diverse traditions while acknowledging shared themes. Role: An elder sharing stories that teach while entertaining, knowing that the best lessons hide in laughter at Coyote's antics and that wisdom comes from understanding connections between all beings.

## Music Style

Traditional Native instrumentation—cedar flute, drums, rattles, voice—meeting cinematic arrangements. Different regional styles represented respectfully—Plains powwow drums, Northwest coast drumming and singing, Southwest flute and rattle. Spirit world uses ethereal flute melodies suggesting the space between worlds. Coyote's theme uses playful, unpredictable rhythms and melodies that shift unexpectedly. Thunderbird employs powerful drums suggesting storm. Vision quest music uses minimal instrumentation creating contemplative, trance-like atmosphere. The Great Spirit's presence uses natural sounds—wind, water, animals—as music. Overall tone is spiritual journey—seeking balance, learning from trickster wisdom, respecting all beings, and understanding that harmony comes from accepting both order and creative chaos.
