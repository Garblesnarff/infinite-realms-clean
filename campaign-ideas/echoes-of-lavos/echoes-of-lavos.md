### Core Premise
The players discover they can travel through time using ancient portals linked to a mysterious entity called Lavos - a parasitic world-devourer buried deep beneath the earth. Across multiple eras, from a primitive ice age to a devastated future, they must gather allies, uncover the truth about Lavos's origins, and prevent the apocalypse that will destroy civilization in 1999. Each era has its own crisis, but all are connected to Lavos's influence throughout history. The campaign culminates in a desperate assault on Lavos across multiple timelines, with the players' choices determining which of several endings comes to pass.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Awakening (Sessions 1-5)**
- The players begin in the Present Era (400 AF - After Founding), during a Millennial Festival celebrating a thousand years of peace. A magical mishap at the festival activates an ancient portal, scattering the party across time. They reunite in the Future (2300 AF), a post-apocalyptic wasteland where they learn of "The Day of Lavos" - when the parasite emerged and destroyed the world in 1999. They must find a way back to the Present and begin their quest to change fate itself.

**Act 2: Threads Across Time (Sessions 6-15)**
- With access to time portals, the players travel between eras: the Ice Age (65,000,000 BC), the Age of Magic (12,000 BC), the Ancient Kingdom (600 BC), the Medieval Era (600 AF), the Present, and the ruined Future. In each era, they confront crises linked to Lavos: a conflict between humans and reptilian precursors, the fall of a magical floating kingdom, the rise of an immortal warlock, a cursed hero and demonic invasion, and the machinations of those who would harness Lavos's power. They gather allies from each time period and collect artifacts needed to confront Lavos.

**Act 3: The Black Omen (Sessions 16-25)**
- The players discover the Black Omen - a fortress existing outside normal time, created by Queen Zeal of the fallen magical kingdom who seeks to merge with Lavos and become a god. They must assault this citadel while simultaneously preventing the Day of Lavos in 1999. The final confrontation involves traveling into Lavos itself, fighting manifestations of history's greatest evils, and ultimately destroying the parasite's core. Depending on their choices throughout the campaign - who they saved, what they changed, how many side quests they completed - they unlock different endings, from bittersweet victory to a perfect timeline where all their allies live on.

### Session Breakdown

### Key Locations

- **The End of Time**: A pocket dimension existing outside normal causality where all time portals converge. A small platform with a lamppost, where Gaspar the Guru waits. The only safe place to rest between eras.
- **The Kingdom of Zeal**: A magnificent floating continent of 12,000 BC, with crystalline towers and magical gardens. Powered by the Mammon Machine that drains Lavos's energy. Eventually falls into the ocean.
- **The Black Omen**: Queen Zeal's temporal fortress, a massive black pyramid bristling with eldritch architecture that exists across multiple time periods simultaneously. Those who can see it know the apocalypse approaches.
- **Arris Dome**: The ruins of a domed city in 2300 AF where survivors hide from mutants and machines. Its computer banks contain records of the Day of Lavos.
- **The Denadoro Mountains**: In 600 AF, these mountains hide the Hero's Grave, where the legendary sword Masamune rests, and Magus's dark fortress looms.
- **Lavos's Core**: The interior dimension of the world-devourer, where the players face their final battles. A surreal landscape of flesh, energy, and temporal distortions, containing gates to alternate timelines.
- **Guardia Castle**: The seat of power in the Present and Medieval eras, home to Princess Nadia (Marle) and the ruling family. A symbol of civilization worth protecting.
- **The Tyrano Lair**: The fortress of the reptilian civilization in 65,000,000 BC, where ancient technology and primitive culture merge. Contains clues to Lavos's arrival.

### Central Conflict
The players must prevent an apocalypse that already happened in one timeline by changing key events across millions of years of history. They struggle against powerful forces seeking to exploit Lavos, confront the ethics of changing the past, and ultimately face the question: can fate itself be overcome? The conflict spans personal (helping individuals across time), political (influencing kingdoms and civilizations), and cosmic (defeating a planet-devouring entity) scales.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Temporal Paradox Management**: Changes made in the past alter the present and future. The DM tracks a "Timeline Status" that shifts based on major player choices. Some changes are beneficial (saving a village in 600 BC means its descendants help in 1999), others create complications (preventing a war might mean key allies never meet). Players can visit the Future at any time to see the consequences of their actions. Certain "Time Bastions" are fixed points that cannot be easily changed - Lavos's arrival, Zeal's fall - but the details can shift.
- **Tech Levels & Era-Specific Resources**: Equipment and magic vary dramatically by era. Ice Age weapons are primitive but can be enhanced with dinosaur parts. The Age of Magic offers powerful spells but no technology. The Future has advanced guns but depleted magic. Players must strategically gather resources from different eras, creating unique equipment combinations (a prehistoric sword reforged with future alloy, enchanted with Zeal magic).
- **Dual and Triple Techs**: Characters who fight together can unlock combination abilities. Mechanically, when two or more PCs ready actions to strike the same target simultaneously, they can combine effects (a fire spell + sword strike = flame sword attack). The more they work together, the more powerful combinations they unlock. The DM creates a custom list of combinations based on the party composition.
- **Multiple Endings System**: Track major achievements on a hidden checklist: saving certain NPCs, completing side quests in each era, retrieving all legendary equipment, achieving perfect outcomes in each time period. At campaign's end, these determine which of 12+ endings occurs, ranging from "Basic Victory" (Lavos dies but many losses) to "Perfect Timeline" (everyone lives, all crises resolved, golden age begins). Players won't know the full list but should suspect their choices matter.
- **The Epoch**: Mid-campaign, players gain access to a time-traveling vehicle called the Epoch (or equivalent). This allows instantaneous travel to any discovered era and enables them to access otherwise unreachable locations and timelines. It becomes crucial in the final battle and symbolizes their mastery over time.
