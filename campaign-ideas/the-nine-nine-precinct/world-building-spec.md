# The Nine-Nine Precinct - World-Building Specification

## The 99th Precinct

Located in a diverse urban neighborhood. Not the most prestigious precinct. Not the worst funded. But definitely the weirdest. And somehow, statistically effective.

### The Precinct Structure

- Captain Holt (recently assigned, reforming culture)
- Sergeant Jeffords (direct supervisor, gentle giant)
- Various lieutenants (bureaucratic obstacles)

- Rosa Diaz (mysterious, badass)
- Charles Boyle (loyal, weird)

**Support Staff**:

- Hitchcock and Scully (veteran detectives, "useless")

**Other Precincts**:
- The Vulture's precinct (credit-stealing rivals)
