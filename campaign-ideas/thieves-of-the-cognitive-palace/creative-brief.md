# Creative Brief: Thieves of the Cognitive Palace

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Stylish Urban Fantasy with Bold Red & Black (Persona 5-inspired)

Inspired by the high-contrast, ultra-stylish aesthetic of *Persona 5*. This style captures metropolitan rebellion, psychological warfare, the duality of daily life versus supernatural heists, and aggressive confidence through design. Everything drips with style—menus, transitions, combat, all are an art form.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Style Over Realism:** Bold shapes, aggressive lines, dramatic poses, comic book energy
*   **Dominant Color: Red & Black:** With white accents, these colors represent rebellion, passion, and the Phantom Thieves' signature
*   **Duality & Masks:** Characters have mundane appearances and flashy Phantom Thief outfits, emphasizing double lives
*   **Urban Japanese Setting:** Modern Tokyo aesthetic—trains, cafés, school, neon signs, crowds

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Stylish, rebellious, heist, duality, psychological, confident, "take your heart," jazz-infused cool
*   **Feeling:** Walking through Shibuya with a secret identity. The thrill of infiltration. Ripping off your mask to awaken power. Dramatic calling card reveals.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Phantom Thief Aesthetic:** Dominant red and black with white highlights, occasional gold accents
*   **Real World:** Muted urban colors—grays, browns, realistic tones contrasting with Metaverse
*   **Metaverse Palaces:** Hyper-saturated, thematic colors matching each Palace's sin (gold for greed, purple for pride, etc.)
*   **UI Elements:** High contrast red/black/white, sharp angles, bold typography
*   **Prompt Example:** "...bold red and black color scheme with white accents. Character in a black coat with red gloves, red scarf billowing dramatically. Background is abstract geometric shapes in red and black. High contrast lighting with deep shadows."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **School Uniforms:** Realistic Japanese school attire for the real world
*   **Phantom Thief Outfits:** Each character has elaborate costumes (domino masks, long coats, elaborate weapons) reflecting their rebellion
*   **Personas:** Massive supernatural beings behind characters—demons, gods, mythological figures in bold stylized designs
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Phantom Thief in a black tailcoat with red inner lining, white domino mask covering eyes, black gloves holding an ornate dagger. Confident smirking expression. Behind them, a massive red-winged demonic Persona with horns towers, its form stylized with sharp geometric patterns. Black background with red spotlight."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Real World:** Modern Tokyo—Shibuya crossing, train stations, cafés, school hallways, realistic but stylized

*   **Velvet Room:** Blue prison cell with chains, elegant but oppressive
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cognitive Palace interior: a casino with playing card motifs everywhere. Red carpet floors with card suit patterns. Slot machines with human faces trapped inside. Gold coins scattered everywhere. Surreal purple-tinted lighting. Distorted perspective emphasizing the unreal nature."

**5. Combat & Powers:**

*   **Prompt Example:** "A character dramatically ripping off their white domino mask, blue flames erupting from their face. Their eyes glow red with determination. Behind them, a massive Persona materializes in red and black tones—a skeletal demon with a top hat and cane. Speed lines and dynamic angles emphasize the explosive transformation."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High Contrast:** Deep blacks, bright highlights, minimal mid-tones
*   **Dramatic Spotlights:** Characters often backlit or spotlit like performers on stage
*   **Comic Book Influence:** Bold outlines, cel-shading, dramatic shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "...high contrast lighting with deep black shadows and bright white highlights. Red spotlight from above creating a dramatic silhouette. Bold black outlines defining shapes. Cel-shaded style with minimal gradients. Character's eyes catch the light, creating a piercing determined gaze."

## Voice

A confident, slightly cocky voice with underlying determination and rebellion, like someone who refuses to play by corrupt rules. The pacing is energetic with dramatic pauses for emphasis. The tone shifts between playful mockery of corrupt adults, serious declarations of justice, and camaraderie with friends. There's an underlying theme of unveiling truth and stealing hearts. Slightly theatrical, as if announcing a heist. Role: The voice of stylish rebellion.
