**Tone (keywords):** weird west, ghost rock, Civil War eternal, manitous, steampunk, shamans, mad scientists, walking dead
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In 1879, the Civil War still rages because ghost rock—a miraculous fuel that powers steampunk technology but screams when burned—was discovered in California, preventing reconciliation as both sides desperately need it. The party are cowboys, shamans, hucksters (card-slinging mystics), and mad scientists in the Weird West, where manitous (evil spirits) possess the dead creating Harrowed, creatures from Native legends walk, and the Reckoners (demonic beings) feed on humanity's fear to break into reality. When they discover that ghost rock mining is literally thinning the barrier between worlds—and the Reckoners are manipulating both sides to spread more fear—they must choose: help end the war, exploit ghost rock's power, or prepare for the apocalypse the Reckoners are orchestrating.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 18-24 sessions)

A three-act journey through the Weird West's supernatural horrors.

*   **Act I — Welcome to the Weird West (Sessions 1-8):** The party meets in Tombstone-equivalent Gomorra, a boomtown built on ghost rock. They take work as bounty hunters, gunslingers, and problem solvers in a West where the dead walk, Indian shamans wield genuine magic, and mad scientists build impossible devices. They encounter their first Harrowed (undead possessed by manitous), witness ghost rock's terrible power, and learn the Civil War continues because both sides need the fuel. A mysterious organization called the Agency recruits them to investigate strange occurrences, leading to discovery of the Reckoners—four demonic entities feeding on specific fears.
*   **Act II — The Reckoners' Game (Sessions 9-16):** Investigating for the Agency, the party discovers the Reckoners' plan: they manipulated events to cause the Civil War, introduced ghost rock to prevent peace, and feed on humanity's fear to break into reality. Each Reckoner represents a fear: War, Famine, Pestilence, Death. The party travels across the fractured America—Confederacy, Union, strange independent territories—confronting Reckoner servants: mad scientists creating abominations, shamans corrupted by dark spirits, automatons gone rogue, and Harrowed serving evil manitous. They learn ghost rock is crushed souls of the damned, and mining it weakens reality's barriers.
*   **Act III — The Reckoning (Sessions 17-24):** The Reckoners prepare their final manifestation as the Civil War reaches crescendo. The party must unite impossible factions—Union and Confederate forces, Native tribes, mad scientists, and even some Harrowed—to face the supernatural threat. They assault the Reckoners' strongholds, confront possessed leaders on both sides, and prevent rituals that would shatter reality. The finale involves a massive battle in the Deadlands (areas where reality is thin) as the Reckoners attempt full manifestation. Victory requires incredible sacrifice and choosing what kind of America emerges: reunited, fractured, or transformed by the supernatural.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the cost of progress, whether fear can be overcome, the price of peace, and if supernatural and normal can coexist. It asks: Is technological advancement worth spiritual cost? Can enemies unite against greater threat? Should the supernatural be embraced or fought? The central conflict pits humanity's survival against the Reckoners who feed on humanity's darkest emotions.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Poker-Based Magic (Hucksters)**
*   Hucksters cast spells by making deals with manitous through card games
*   Player draws cards; better poker hand = stronger spell
*   Bad hands risk backlash—manitou takes control temporarily
*   Adds gambling element to spellcasting
*   Different spells require different minimum hands

### 2. **The Harrowed**
*   Character who dies may return as Harrowed
*   Possessed by manitou but soul fights for control
*   Dominion battles: player vs. manitou for body control

*   Gain undead benefits (hard to kill, supernatural powers) but risk losing soul
*   Can sense other Harrowed and supernatural

### 3. **Mad Science**
*   Scientists build impossible devices powered by ghost rock
*   Devices are unreliable—roll each use for malfunction
*   Can create: steam-powered automatons, ray guns, mechanical limbs, flying machines
*   The more impossible, the more likely to explode
*   Ghost rock is essential but corrupting fuel

### 4. **Fear & Guts**
*   Characters have Guts stat for facing supernatural horror
*   Failing Guts check causes panic, running, or heart attack
*   Reckoners feed on fear—widespread terror strengthens them
*   Heroes who overcome fear weaken Reckoners
*   Town's fear level affects supernatural manifestations

### 5. **Native Magic (Shamans)**
*   Shamans access Spirit World—overlapping magical dimension
*   Can summon nature spirits for aid
*   Perform rituals requiring time and components
*   Spirit World is beautiful but dangerous
*   Ghost rock mining corrupts Spirit World, angering spirits

### 6. **Ghost Rock Technology**
*   Powers steampunk devices with supernatural efficiency
*   Screams when burned (souls in torment)
*   Mining it thins reality barriers
*   Valuable to both Union and Confederacy
*   Creates addictive dependence—hard to stop using
*   Too much exposure causes supernatural sensitivity or madness
