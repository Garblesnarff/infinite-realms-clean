# Creative Brief: Ghost Rock Frontier

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Weird West with Steampunk Horror (Deadlands-inspired)

Inspired by the unique fusion of Western, steampunk, and horror in *Deadlands*, classic Western films with supernatural twists, and Victorian mad science. This style captures dusty frontier towns with steam-powered impossibilities, gunfighters facing undead horrors, and the collision of Native magic with industrial progress.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Genre Fusion:** Classic Western aesthetics merged with steampunk technology and supernatural horror
*   **Ghost Rock Glow:** Eerie blue-green glowing mineral powering impossible machines
*   **Undead West:** Walking dead, skeletal creatures, possessed gunslingers
*   **Period Technology Twisted:** Steam-powered automatons, rail guns, mechanical limbs, all with Victorian brass aesthetic

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Weird West, steampunk horror, alternate history, supernatural frontier, Civil War eternal, mad science, Native magic
*   **Feeling:** The excitement of Western adventure corrupted by supernatural dread and industrial horror. Progress at terrible cost.

**2. Color Palette:**

Dried blood stains on weathered wood. Bone-white skeletal undead. Purple spirit energy from Native magic. Coal smoke darkens sky."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Gunslingers:** Classic cowboy attire—hats, dusters, gun belts—but worn and battle-scarred
*   **Harrowed:** Undead gunslingers with pale skin, unnatural eyes, stitched wounds visible
*   **Mad Scientists:** Victorian-era coats and goggles, carrying brass devices, slightly unhinged

Next to them, a mad scientist in Victorian coat with brass goggles, holding glowing ghost rock device. Behind, a Native shaman with spirit wolf visible in purple aura. Classic Western meets supernatural horror."

Automatons walk streets alongside horses. In distance, mine glows eerie blue-green. Sky shows wrong colors where reality thins. Bodies hanging from gallows show signs of rising as undead."

*   **Manitous:** Demon spirits shown as shadowy figures with glowing eyes possessing people
*   **Prompt Example:** "A mad scientist's steam-powered automaton—eight feet tall, brass and iron construction with Victorian rivets. Ghost rock core glows blue-green through chest viewport. One arm is gatling gun. Fighting a skeletal undead gunslinger whose bones are held together by purple manitou energy. Background shows ghost rock-powered train with impossible steam engine."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**

Burning building in background provides orange firelight. Deep shadows hide skeletal undead. Dust in air catches all light sources creating atmospheric haze."

## Voice

A world-weary frontiersman's voice with gravelly delivery and dark humor. The pacing matches a campfire storyteller—measured but building tension. The tone shifts between Western bravado and horror-struck whispers. Occasional card-playing metaphors and Western slang. Underlying theme of civilization's cost when pursued without wisdom. The voice carries both skepticism and acceptance of the impossible. Role: The voice of supernatural survival on the weird frontier.
