# Creative Brief: Don't Lose Your Way

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Weaponized Fashion (Trigger Animation meets Fascist Aesthetics)

Inspired by Imaishi's explosive animation, 1940s fascist propaganda reimagined, and haute couture runway shows. This style blends exaggerated character designs with militaristic uniforms, fanservice with empowerment philosophy, and absurdist comedy with deadly serious rebellion. Colors are bold and contrasting—academy blacks and whites, rainbow corruption, blood reds, liberation nude tones. Character designs are theatrical—exaggerated proportions, transforming clothing, power through exposure. Everything feels like watching a fashion show directed by revolutionaries on cocaine.

### Core Principles:

*   **Over-the-Top Everything:** No subtlety, maximum energy, absurdist escalation.
*   **Clothing as Metaphor:** Social control literalized through fashion, nudity as liberation.
*   **Operatic Rebellion:** Epic scale drama about sisterhood and fascist aesthetics.

## Voice

A fierce, shameless voice—female, powerful and declarative, refusing any embarrassment. The delivery is loud and proud, with battle cries and philosophical declarations delivered with equal intensity. Emotion is passionate defiance—rage against oppression, love for found family, absolute rejection of shame. References clothing, revolution, and "don't lose your way!" Audio has orchestral rock swells and transformation sequences. Role: A rebellious fighter declaring transformation, or a fascist leader commanding absolute loyalty.
