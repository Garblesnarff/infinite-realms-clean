*An Assassin / Underworld campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Continental Accord
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Assassin / Crime / Noir
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **6** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** stylish, professional, honor-among-thieves, consequence-heavy, mythic-assassins, elegant-violence
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are legendary retired assassins who once worked for The Continental—a secret society of killers bound by ancient rules and overseen by neutral "ground" establishments where no blood may be spilled. When the party leader's beloved companion is killed and a sacred marker is called in, they're pulled back into the life they left behind. Now they must navigate the intricate web of the underworld's politics, honor debts, and face increasingly dangerous contracts—all while a massive bounty on their heads turns every assassin in the world into an enemy.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Overwhelming Numbers:** The party is outnumbered by professional killers. Every public space could contain enemies.
*   **Consequence-Heavy Rules:** Breaking The Continental's rules results in being "Excommunicado"—losing all protection and becoming the target of every assassin.
*   **Legendary Opposition:** Enemies are not random thugs but skilled professionals, each with unique fighting styles and tactics.
*   **Social Complexity:** The campaign requires understanding and manipulating the underworld's complex honor system, debts, and hierarchies.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act arc that escalates from personal revenge to all-out war with the underworld's power structure.

*   **Act I — Blood and Debts (Sessions 1–4):** The party leader's peaceful retirement is shattered by tragedy. A blood marker from their past is called in, forcing them to undertake an impossible assassination. The party must accept the job or break the sacred rules, and their actions draw them back into the underworld's web.
*   **Act II — Excommunicado (Sessions 5–8):** The party's target was protected by the High Table—the ruling council of the underworld. Now declared Excommunicado with a bounty on their heads, every assassin in the world hunts them. They must survive while seeking powerful allies and ancient markers that could give them leverage against the High Table.
*   **Act III — The War (Sessions 9–12):** With enough markers called in, the party challenges the High Table directly. What follows is an escalating war through the underworld's hidden infrastructure, from The Continental hotels to the assassin's training grounds. The finale asks: can you destroy a system you once served, and what remains when the rules burn?

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "People Keep Asking If I'm Back"

*   **Focus:** Inciting Incident / Character Introduction
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party is in retirement, living peaceful lives, having walked away from their pasts as legendary assassins.
    *   The Tragedy: Thugs working for a spoiled noble kill the party leader's beloved companion over a perceived slight.
    *   The First Blood: Despite trying to walk away, the leader kills the thugs, then discovers their employer. The old skills return.

**Escalation:** A blood marker—an ancient medallion representing an unbreakable debt—arrives. Someone is calling in a favor from the party's past.

### Session 2 — "The Impossible Task"

*   **Focus:** Setup / World-Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Continental: The party visits the local Continental hotel, neutral ground where no business can be conducted. They learn the marker's holder wants them to assassinate a member of the High Table.
    *   The Rules: Exposition about the underworld's structure—markers, the Continental, the High Table, the consequences of refusal or rule-breaking.
    *   Preparation: The party gathers intelligence, acquires specialized gear from the underworld's Sommelier (weapons dealer), and makes plans.

**Escalation:** They learn their target is protected in a fortress-estate and surrounded by an army of bodyguards. This isn't a simple assassination.

### Session 3 — "No Business on Continental Grounds"

*   **Focus:** Heist / Infiltration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Approach: The party uses a high-society gala as cover to infiltrate the estate.
    *   The Hunt: A deadly game of cat-and-mouse through opulent halls as security realizes there are intruders.
    *   The Kill: The party reaches the target and must make the choice—complete the marker or refuse and face consequences.

**Escalation:** The target reveals they were under High Table protection. Completing the marker breaks sacred rules. But the debt must be honored.

### Session 4 — "The Adjudicator"

*   **Focus:** Judgment / Social Encounter
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Summons: The Adjudicator—an enforcer of High Table law—arrives to pass judgment on the party's actions.
    *   The Verdict: The party is declared Excommunicado. All services and protections are revoked. A $14 million gold bounty is placed on each party member's head.
    *   The Hour: Traditionally, the party is given one hour before the bounty goes active. They must use it wisely.

**Escalation:** As the hour ends, everyone—from beggars to nobles—reveals themselves as assassins and attacks simultaneously.

### Session 5 — "The Hour"

*   **Focus:** Survival / Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Gauntlet: The party must fight through waves of assassins trying to collect the bounty as they move through the city.
    *   No Safe Haven: Even Continental grounds are denied to them. Every door is closed.
    *   The Ticket: They seek the Bowery King—a rival power who operates outside High Table authority—who might offer sanctuary.

**Escalation:** A legendary assassin called The Shinobi, who has never failed a contract, accepts the bounty and begins hunting the party.

### Session 6 — "Those Who Serve Beneath"

*   **Focus:** Alliance / Underworld Politics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Bowery Court: The party meets the Bowery King, who controls an army of "invisible" people—beggars, servants, those the nobles don't see.
    *   The Offer: He'll give them sanctuary and resources, but they must do something for him—eliminate a High Table operation.
    *   The Strike: A coordinated attack on a High Table asset, using guerrilla tactics with the Bowery King's network.

**Escalation:** The High Table responds by sending a full kill squad—twelve elite assassins working in perfect coordination.

### Session 7 — "Old Friends, Old Debts"

*   **Focus:** Investigation / Social Maneuvering
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Calling In Markers: The party remembers others who owe them blood debts. They travel to collect, each marker representing a different ally or resource.
    *   The Director: They visit their old trainer, the Director of an assassin ballet academy (yes, really), who reluctantly helps.
    *   The Price: Each marker called in requires something in return. Help isn't free, even among killers with honor.

**Escalation:** The Shinobi catches up to them, resulting in a desperate fight where the party barely escapes with their lives.

### Session 8 — "Elder of the High Table"

*   **Focus:** Quest / Long Journey
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Last Option: There's one person who can overturn the Excommunicado—the Elder, who sits above even the High Table.
    *   The Desert: The party must travel to a remote location and complete a trial to even speak with the Elder.
    *   The Choice: The Elder offers to restore them, but the price is absolute loyalty. They must kill the Bowery King and pledge themselves to the High Table.

**Escalation:** The party must choose: accept servitude or find another way. If they refuse, they're truly alone against the entire underworld.

### Session 9 — "Breaking the Rules"

*   **Focus:** Betrayal / Turning Point
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Decision: If the party refused the Elder, they decide to do the unthinkable—attack the High Table directly.
    *   The Parlay: They request a meeting at the Continental, offering terms. When refused, they break the ultimate rule: they conduct business on Continental grounds.
    *   The Chaos: This violation sends shockwaves through the underworld. Some see it as sacrilege, others as revolution.

**Escalation:** The Adjudicator declares the Continental itself compromised. Now nowhere is neutral ground. It's total war.

### Session 10 — "Blood for Blood"

*   **Key Events:**

    *   The Duel: An epic final battle showcasing the party's mastery of combat. Stylized, lethal, elegant.

**Escalation:** Victory seems possible until The Shinobi arrives for one final confrontation—a duel between legends.

### Session 12 — "The Consequences"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The New Order: With the High Table broken, the underworld is in chaos. The party must decide what comes next.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict examines the price of violence, the weight of consequences, and whether anyone can truly leave a life of killing behind. It's about honor among criminals, the rules that bind society (even criminal society), and what happens when someone breaks those rules. Can the party destroy the system without becoming what they hate?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Markers and Debts**

*   Blood markers represent unbreakable debts. Refusing a marker breaks one's word and results in immediate Excommunicado.
*   **Mechanics:** The party has markers they can call in for major favors. Each used marker grants significant aid but costs something in return.
*   **Tracking:** Track who owes whom. Debts are currency in this world.

### 2. **Continental Rules**

*   On Continental grounds, no business can be conducted (no violence, no contracts).
*   **Mechanics:** The party is completely safe on Continental grounds—until they aren't. Breaking this rule is a major story moment.
*   **Services:** While in Continental hotels, the party can access special services: armory, medical, information network, secure communication.

### 3. **The Bounty System**

*   When Excommunicado, the party has an active bounty. Every NPC is potentially an assassin.
*   **Mechanics:** Random NPCs may attack at any time. The DM can declare any background character is actually an assassin.
*   **Escalation:** The bounty increases based on party actions, attracting more skilled hunters.

### 4. **Combat as Art**

*   Combat in this campaign should be stylized and cinematic. Reward creative environmental use, tactical positioning, and stylish descriptions.
*   **Mechanics:** Players who describe their attacks in cinematic terms gain advantage or bonus damage. Gun-fu, martial arts combos, and environmental kills are encouraged.
*   **Resource:** Limited ammunition and healing make every fight tactical. Scavenging weapons from defeated foes is essential.

### 5. **Reputation and Status**

*   Track the party's reputation in the underworld. Legendary deeds become stories that open doors or create enemies.
*   **Effects:** High reputation may cause some enemies to stand down out of respect, or attract worthy challengers seeking to test themselves.
*   **The Legend:** The party's past deeds should be referenced. They're not rookies—they're legends pulled back into the game.
