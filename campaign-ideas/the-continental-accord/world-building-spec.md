### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Continental Accord**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Legendary retired assassins are pulled back into the underworld when a blood marker is called in, forcing them to kill a High Table member. Now Excommunicado with a massive bounty, they must survive an army of professional killers while navigating the complex honor system of the assassin's world. The campaign explores honor, consequence, and whether anyone can truly escape a life of violence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the High Table and the ancient rules that govern the underworld of assassins.
    *   Write the history of the Continental hotels—neutral ground sanctuaries where no business can be conducted.
    *   Describe the blood marker system—what they represent, how they're made, and why refusing one is unthinkable.
    *   Explain the party's legendary past—what impossible task did they complete that made their reputation?
    *   Detail the Excommunicado process and what happens to those declared outside the rules.
    *   Describe the Zero Division—the High Table's personal guard and most elite killers.

        *   **Public Agenda:** Provide structure and rules for the criminal underworld.

        *   **Assets:** Vast wealth, armies of assassins, the Continental network, authority over all underworld business.
        *   **Relationships:** Absolute authority over most assassins; opposed by the Bowery Court; hunting the party.

        *   **Hierarchy:** Individual hotel managers with autonomy, reporting loosely to the High Table.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Provide sanctuary and services to those in the life.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some managers, like Winston, place loyalty to the Continental itself above the High Table.
        *   **Assets:** Hotels in every major city, armories, medical facilities, communication networks, information brokers.
        *   **Relationships:** Bound to serve the High Table but maintain independence; sympathetic to the party.

        *   **Goals:** Overthrow the High Table, gain power for the underclass of the underworld.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Bowery King, consisting of "invisible" people—beggars, servants, those nobles ignore.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they operate in shadows beneath shadows.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use the party as weapons against the High Table, even if it destroys them.
        *   **Assets:** Eyes and ears everywhere through the invisible underclass, hidden sanctuaries, improvised weapons.

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party completes the marker but refuses to accept consequences.
    *   **THEN:** They're immediately declared Excommunicado. Generate the one-hour grace period scene where everyone in the city reveals themselves as assassins preparing to attack.
    *   **IF:** The party calls in three or more blood markers.
    *   **THEN:** Word spreads that legends are making moves. Generate encounters with assassins who step aside out of respect rather than fight.
    *   **IF:** The party kills a member of the Zero Division.
    *   **THEN:** The High Table takes the threat seriously. Generate an escalation where all twelve Table members put personal resources toward the hunt.
    *   **IF:** The party conducts business on Continental grounds.
    *   **THEN:** The sanctuary is violated. Generate Winston's response, the Adjudicator's shock, and the philosophical crisis this causes in the underworld—some see it as sacrilege, others as necessary rebellion.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats The Shinobi in honorable combat.
    *   **THEN:** Their legend grows exponentially. Generate a scenario where half the assassins hunting them stand down, unwilling to face those who bested the unbeatable.
    *   **IF:** The party allies with both the Bowery King and Winston.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a three-way war scenario: High Table forces, Bowery Court insurgents, and Continental neutrality breaking down. The entire underworld chooses sides.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the party destroys the High Table but refuses to take their place.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue of chaos. Without rules, the underworld descends into war. The party must decide if they'll restore order or let it burn.
