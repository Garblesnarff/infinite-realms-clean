# Concrete Dreams
## *The streets remember. The board never lies. The revolution grinds on.*

### Campaign Overview

In the industrial city of Ashfall, magic flows through the cracks in the pavement. The concrete itself is alive with ancient earth spirits that the city's founders imprisoned in the foundations. For decades, the only people who could hear their whispers were the skaters—street rats and outcasts who spent every day grinding on the bones of the city. When a massive earthquake cracked the Containment Grid, raw magical energy began seeping through every gap, gap every rail, and every abandoned pool. The spirits made the skaters an offer: freedom in exchange for freedom. Help us escape, and we'll turn your boards into weapons of mass liberation.

The Corporate Council that rules Ashfall has responded with the Iron Decree—skateboarding is now punishable by exile or worse. The city's legendary underground skate scene has gone from counterculture to resistance movement overnight. Players are members of different skate crews who must unite to complete the Seven Sacred Grinds—legendary skate spots scattered across the city that, if all skated in sequence, will shatter the Containment Grid and free the earth spirits. But the Council has hired the Concrete Judges, elite mage-hunters who can literally harden the streets beneath a skater's wheels, and they're determined to pave over the rebellion.

This is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater meets Breaking Bad meets Avatar: The Last Airbender, where every kickflip is a spell, every grind is a prayer, and the concrete jungle fights back against those who try to control it.

- Defeating Judge "softens" the area permanently

### Plot Twists & Complications

1. **The First Skater Was a Tyrant**: The spirits were imprisoned because they enslaved humanity; freeing them might not end well.

2. **Ollie's Guilt**: He was paid by the Council to help build the Grid; the whole resistance is his atonement.

3. **Razor's Sister**: His sibling was killed in a skate accident; he blames the reckless culture, not the spirits.

4. **Commissioner Slate's Board**: His old skateboard is the key to the seventh Grind—he must voluntarily give it up.

5. **Ghost's Choice**: He merged with spirits intentionally to become guardian; freeing them means he dies permanently.

6. **The Corporate Sponsor**: The mysterious benefactor is actually a freed spirit testing the players' integrity.

7. **K-Grind's Art**: Her graffiti has been strengthening the Grid, not weakening it—she's an unwitting double agent.

8. **The Concrete Judge Supreme**: The armor contains the spirit of the city's first skater, forced to hunt their own descendants.

9. **Ashfall's True Nature**: The entire city is a massive containment ritual—freeing the spirits will cause it to crumble.

10. **The Player's Board**: One PC's skateboard contains a fragment of the most powerful spirit's essence.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory**: Complete all Seven Sacred Grinds, free the earth spirits, and negotiate a new coexistence between spirits, skaters, and the city.

**Secondary Victories**:
- Unite all major skate crews under one banner
- Redeem Razor and turn him to the resistance
- Expose the Corporate Council's corruption publicly
- Preserve skate culture's history and traditions
- Create permanent legal protections for street skating

**Personal Victories**:
- Land your signature trick at a Sacred Grind
- Earn the respect of Ollie
- Have your name added to the Memorial Wall
- Customize your board into legendary artifact
- Start your own crew and territory

### Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat**: The Council completes the Paving Protocol, covering the entire city in anti-magic concrete. Spirits permanently sealed, skateboarding erased from history.

**Partial Defeats**:
- Fail to complete all Seven Grinds in time; partial spirit release causes catastrophe
- Ollie dies before revealing crucial information
- All major crews destroyed or disbanded
- The Pit is demolished and paved over
- Razor becomes full antagonist and hunts former friends

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Free the spirits but they immediately attack the city, forcing players to imprison them again—or flee with other skaters into exile.

### Campaign Tone

This campaign captures the rebellious heart of skateboarding culture—the endless hours perfecting tricks, the camaraderie of shared sessions, the thrill of hitting a new spot, the defiance of skating where you're not wanted. Every session should feel like:

- **The documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys"**: Authenticity and rawness
- **Tony Hawk's Pro Skater soundtrack**: Energy and momentum
- **Street art**: Visual creativity and territorial marking
- **Underground resistance**: David versus Goliath
- **Coming-of-age**: Growing through challenges
- **Spiritual journey**: Finding meaning in motion

The stakes are global (the fate of the city) but the story is local (specific crews, specific spots, specific tricks). DMs should emphasize the sensory details—the sound of wheels on concrete, the smell of grip tape, the satisfying crunch of a perfect grind, the way light catches off a spinning board. This is about culture, community, and concrete—in that order.

Make your players want to learn how to skateboard (again, don't encourage actual dangerous behavior). Make them care about these fictional spots as much as real skaters care about real locations. Make every trick a prayer and every session a ceremony.

When in doubt, ask: "Would this make a sick skate video?"
