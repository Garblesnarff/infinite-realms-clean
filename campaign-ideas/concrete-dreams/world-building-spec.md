## The City of Ashfall

### Historical Timeline

**The Before (Millennia Ago)**
- Land was home to earth spirits—sentient manifestations of geological forces
- Spirits lived in harmony with indigenous peoples who honored them
- Sacred sites marked where spirit power was strongest

**The First Skaters (80 Years Ago)**
- Economic boom brought workers and their families
- Youth gravitated to street culture, skateboarding emerged
- Early skaters unknowingly practiced on prison sites
- Reports of "lucky spots" where tricks felt easier—spirits responding
- Skateboarding became working-class pastime, corporate class viewed it as delinquency

**The Golden Age (40-20 Years Ago)**
- Ollie Martinez and his generation elevated skateboarding to art form
- Massive growth in skate culture, spots became legendary
- Spirits grew stronger from the kinetic energy and rebellious spirit
- First manifestations of trick magic—dismissed as skill or luck

**The Crackdown (20 Years Ago)**
- Council hired sorcerers to strengthen Containment Grid

- Spirits began communicating directly with skaters
- Trick magic became undeniable
- Council passed Iron Decree banning all skateboarding
- Resistance movement born, present campaign begins

### Geography of Ashfall

**City Layout**:
Ashfall sprawls across a valley surrounded by dormant volcanic hills. The seven sacred sites correspond to seven distinct neighborhoods, each with unique character:

**Downtown (The Pit)**
- Former luxury neighborhood, now working class
- Old swimming pools from mansions abandoned after financial crash
- Dense housing, markets, community life
- Sacred Site: Grind of Water (swimming pool complex)

**Industrial Sector (The Foundry)**
- Active metalworks, chemical plants, warehouses
- Working port with shipping containers
- Blue-collar workforce sympathetic to skaters
- Sacred Site: Grind of Fire (abandoned blast furnace)

**Memorial District (Rails of Remembrance)**
- Old factory ruins, now memorial park
- Metal infrastructure everywhere—rails, beams, scaffolding
- Haunted by industrial accident victims
- Sacred Site: Grind of Metal (the longest rail in the city)

**Corporate Center (Skyline Plaza)**
- Modern glass towers, manicured parks
- Surveillance everywhere, zero tolerance for deviance
- Where the Council meets and Judges are headquartered
- Sacred Site: Grind of Air (rooftop gaps)

**The Quarry (City Outskirts)**
- Original excavation site for city foundation
- Dangerous, officially condemned
- Homeless encampments and outcasts
- Sacred Site: Grind of Foundations (the deepest point)

**The Heights (Residential Hills)**
- Middle-class suburbs on volcanic slopes
- Schools, parks, family neighborhoods
- Where many young skaters live double lives
- Sacred Site: Grind of Earth (underground cave network)

**Old Town (Historic District)**
- Preserved architecture from settlement era
- Museum, government buildings, tourist traps
- Secrets of the Binding hidden in archives
- Sacred Site: Grind of Spirit (beneath City Hall)

### The Containment Grid

**Architecture**:
- Seven main pylons at sacred sites
- Ley lines of anti-magic concrete connecting them
- Powered by combination of stolen spirit energy and industrial generators
- Designed to suppress earth magic and prevent spirit manifestation

**Weaknesses**:
- Earthquake created multiple fracture points
- Kinetic energy (especially from skateboarding) disrupts the field
- Each Sacred Grind completed weakens corresponding pylon
- Complete all Seven Grinds simultaneously → total collapse

**Side Effects**:
- Dreams are suppressed in high-Grid areas (people feel numb, uncreative)
- Plants struggle to grow
- Natural disasters are prevented but pressure builds
- Skaters feel physically ill when trying to skate in maximum Grid zones

### The Corporate Council

**Structure**:
- Five megacorporations control city governance
- Industrial manufacturing, real estate development, energy production, surveillance tech, "public safety"
- Commissioner Slate is current chairman (rotates every five years)
- Private security force supersedes traditional police

**Philosophy**:
- Order and profit above all
- Skateboarding is "destructive hooliganism"
- Spirits are dangerous natural disasters that must be contained
- Any cost is acceptable to maintain stability
- Workers are resources, not people

**The Iron Decree**:
- Skateboarding punishable by heavy fines, incarceration, or exile
- Possession of skateboard is probable cause for search
- Property owners liable for allowing skating on premises
- Judges given authority to use "necessary force"
- Builds on decades of anti-skate ordinances

**Secret Agenda**:
- Council knows about the spirits and communicates with them
- Has been offered a deal: Complete suppression of spirits grants permanent industrial power source
- If Grid is perfected, spirits will be converted to pure energy
- Some Council members have doubts but are overruled by others
- Not monolithic—internal conflicts players can exploit

### The Concrete Judges

**Creation**:
- Elite mage-hunters trained by Council's best sorcerers
- Armor forged from Grid-aligned concrete (living stone)
- Can manipulate pavement, harden/soften ground, create obstacles
- Enhanced strength and endurance but slow compared to skaters

**Hierarchy**:
- Judge Supreme (main antagonist)
- Seven Judge Lieutenants (one per district)
- Dozens of Judge Enforcers (regular encounters)
- Hundreds of Judge Initiates (cannon fodder)

**Abilities by Rank**:
- **Initiate**: Can harden ground under skaters' wheels, causing wipeouts
- **Enforcer**: Create concrete spikes, walls, pits
- **Lieutenant**: Reshape entire skate spots, summon constructs
- **Supreme**: Total environmental control, can temporarily drain trick magic

**Weakness**:
- Slow and predictable—skaters can outmaneuver
- Rely on Grid power; weaken when Grid is damaged
- Armor is brittle against certain spirit-enhanced tricks
- Some are conflicted about their purpose (roleplay opportunities)

### Trick Magic System

**Core Mechanic**:
Skateboarding tricks channel spirit energy through kinetic motion. The more difficult/stylish the trick, the more powerful the magic.

**Basic Trick Magic** (Available to all spirit-touched skaters):
- **Ollie Magic**: Small telekinetic bursts, minor levitation
- **Grind Channeling**: Channel elemental energy through rails/ledges
- **Manual Meditation**: Maintain concentration effects, amplify senses
- **Flip Attacks**: Psychokinetic strikes using board momentum

**Advanced Trick Magic** (Requires training/discovery):
- **Combo Cascades**: Chain tricks into exponentially powerful effects
- **Spot Sanctification**: Bless a location, making it resistant to Grid
- **Board Awakening**: Imbue skateboard with permanent enchantments
- **Spirit Riding**: Allow spirit to temporarily possess you for supernatural abilities

**Sacred Grind Magic** (Unlocked by completing respective grinds):
Each Sacred Grind teaches a unique ultimate ability tied to that element

**Limitations**:
- Requires actual skateboarding skill (can't just cast spells while standing)
- Draining—sustained magic causes physical exhaustion
- Blocked in high-Grid areas (Council territory)
- Boards can break under magical stress
- Requires attunement with spirits (moral/spiritual component)

### Economy & Resources

**Official Currency**: Corporate scrip (digital, tracked, can be frozen)

**Underground Currency**:

- Food and medical supplies for underground living

**Black Market**:

- Hacker collective offers surveillance bypasses
- Arte Crew forges permits and documentation
- Some corrupt Judges can be bribed
