# Creative Brief: The Scourge Rises

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy with Corruption Progression (Warcraft III-inspired)

Inspired by the tragic corruption narrative of *Warcraft III* with visual transformation from noble paladins to corrupted death knights. This style captures heroic fantasy becoming dark horror, undead armies, demonic invasion, and the visual progression of corruption.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Transformation:** Visual progression from shining paladin → corrupted → death knight → potential redemption
*   **Undead Horror:** Plague victims, zombie hordes, skeletal warriors, necromantic green energy
*   **Demonic Invasion:** Fel green fire, monstrous demons, corrupted landscapes
*   **Heroic to Villainous:** Same character designs evolving from noble to dark

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tragic fall, corruption arc, undead plague, noble intentions corrupted, redemption possibility, demonic invasion
*   **Feeling:** The tragedy of good people making terrible choices for good reasons. Horror of watching yourself become the villain. Weight of corruption changing who you are.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Early Campaign:** Bright gold and silver (holy paladin), blue kingdom banners, clean medieval
*   **Mid Corruption:** Fading colors, sickly plague greens, frost blues appear
*   **Full Scourge:** Black armor, ice blues, necromantic sickly greens, death and cold
*   **Burning Legion:** Fel greens, demon reds, corrupted purples, hellfire oranges
*   **Prompt Example:** "...showing corruption progression. LEFT: Noble paladin in shining silver plate armor with gold holy symbols, wielding blessed hammer, divine light emanating. CENTER: Same character with dulled armor, frost beginning to creep across edges, eyes slightly glowing blue, holy symbols cracked. RIGHT: Full death knight in black spiked armor covered in frost, ice-blue glowing eyes, wielding Frostmourne (runeblade), necromantic green energy swirling."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Paladin Phase:** Shining armor, holy symbols, blessed weapons, noble bearing
*   **Corruption Phase:** Armor tarnishes, frost appears, eyes begin glowing, personality hardens
*   **Death Knight Phase:** Black spiked armor, runeblade, ice-blue glowing eyes, undead aesthetic
*   **Scourge Army:** Ghouls (hunched zombies), crypt fiends (undead spider-things), abominations (flesh golems), frost wyrms (skeletal dragons)
*   **Prompt Example:** "A death knight in black plate armor with frost coating the surfaces and icicles hanging from pauldrons. Glowing ice-blue eyes visible through helmet. They wield Frostmourne—a runeblade crackling with frost and necromantic energy. Behind them, an army of undead: shambling ghouls, skeletal warriors, and a massive abomination stitched from multiple corpses."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Lordaeron:** Starts as prosperous medieval kingdom, progressively becomes plagued ruins
*   **Plague Effects:** Dead crops, diseased citizens, zombie-infested cities, mass graves
*   **Scourge Territory:** Frozen wastelands, necropolis ziggurats, death knights' fortresses
*   **Burning Legion:** Portals to hell realms, fel-corrupted landscapes, demon fortresses
*   **Prompt Example:** "Stratholme city during the culling: Medieval city with wooden buildings and stone streets. Citizens flee in terror as paladins and soldiers advance. Some citizens already show plague symptoms—greenish skin, vacant eyes. Fire begins spreading. The sky darkens. A paladin stands in foreground, expression torn between duty and horror at what they're about to do."

**5. Magic and Corruption:**
*   **Holy Magic:** Golden light, healing auras, blessings (early campaign)
*   **Necromancy:** Sickly green energy raising corpses, death coils, plague clouds
*   **Frost Magic:** Ice shards, frozen ground, frost breath, winter's chill
*   **Fel Magic:** Green hellfire, demonic portals, corruption spreading like disease
*   **Prompt Example:** "A necromancer raising the dead: Hooded figure with glowing green eyes extending hands. Sickly green-black energy flows from fingertips into mass grave. Corpses animate, crawling from earth with eyes glowing same green. Necromantic runes circle the ritual site. Background shows more zombies shambling to join the Scourge army."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Early Campaign:** Bright daylight, hope and heroism
*   **Corruption Phase:** Graying skies, shadows lengthening
*   **Scourge Phase:** Dark, cold lighting, frost reflecting moonlight, necromantic green glow
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lighting changes with corruption. Early scenes in warm golden sunlight showing hope. Mid-corruption has overcast gray skies and fading light. Full Scourge scenes are dark with cold blue moonlight reflecting off ice and snow. Necromantic green glow illuminates undead armies. Burning Legion scenes have hellish orange-red glow from fel fire."

## Voice

A voice that begins noble and determined like a paladin swearing oaths, gradually becomes colder and more ruthless, ultimately speaking with the authority of death itself (or returning to warmth if seeking redemption). The pacing starts measured and hopeful, becomes clipped and pragmatic, finally either embraces cold fury or regains humanity. The tone shifts between heroic determination ("We will save them, no matter the cost"), creeping ruthlessness ("The infected must be purged—all of them"), and either dark acceptance ("I am the Scourge") or desperate redemption ("I can still be saved"). Voice may echo with frost or death mid-campaign. Role: The voice of tragic corruption or hard-won redemption.
