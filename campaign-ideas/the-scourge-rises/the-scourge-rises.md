The campaign follows their gradual corruption into becoming leaders of the Scourge, the tragic fall from grace, and ultimately the arrival of the Burning Legion—demonic forces that created the Scourge as their vanguard.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-40 sessions)

A four-act arc of defense, corruption, fall, and potential redemption.

*   **Act I — Defending the Kingdom (Sessions 1-10):** The party are noble paladins when plague of undeath spreads across the kingdom. They defend cities, purge infected zones, and hunt necromancers. Investigation reveals the Cult of the Damned spreading plague deliberately. The trail leads north to frozen wasteland. Desperation grows as conventional methods fail. They discover prophecy of a powerful weapon—Frostmourne—that can end the plague. Against mentors' advice, they pursue it.
*   **Act II — The Corruption (Sessions 11-20):** The party claims Frostmourne, gaining immense power but immediately feeling its corruption. Their personality subtly changes—pragmatic becomes ruthless, noble becomes ambitious. They return and begin "saving" the kingdom through brutal efficiency: executing infected, raising dead as soldiers, purging entire cities. Former allies become enemies, calling them corrupted. The party fully transforms into death knights, commanding undead armies. They assassinate their king and claim the throne, raising him as the first Lich.
*   **Act III — Rise of the Scourge (Sessions 21-30):** The party leads the Scourge—massive undead armies consuming the world. They are contacted by the Lich King, revealed as their master, and the Burning Legion beyond him. They serve as vanguard for demonic invasion. Rival factions rise: orcs seeking redemption led by young warchief, night elves protecting ancient forests, human resistance led by former allies. The party wages war on three fronts, becoming the world's greatest threat. Internal conflict: some party members seek redemption while others embrace power.
*   **Act IV — The Burning Legion (Sessions 31-40):** Demons arrive and reveal the Scourge were always tools to be discarded. The Lich King commands party to serve demons. Choice point: Serve Legion (evil ending), rebel and seek redemption (redemption arc), or seize Lich King's power for themselves (ambition ending). Each path leads to different climax: battling demon lords, convincing former allies to trust them again, or ascending to become new Lich King. Multiple endings based on choices throughout campaign.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of noble intentions corrupted, ends justifying means, power's cost, and redemption's possibility. It asks: Would you sacrifice your soul to save others? When does pragmatism become evil? Can someone who chose darkness find redemption? The central conflict pits the party's desire to save their kingdom against the cost of the power needed, ultimately transforming them from heroes into the greatest threat.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Corruption System**
*   Party begins as paladins with holy powers
*   Each dark choice (claiming Frostmourne, purging innocents, raising dead) adds Corruption
*   Corruption grants dark powers but transforms personality and appearance
*   At thresholds, class changes: Paladin → Dark Paladin → Death Knight → Lich
*   High corruption changes dialogue options and NPC reactions
*   Redemption path requires extraordinary sacrifices to reduce corruption

### 2. **The Fall Arc Narrative**
*   Campaign deliberately makes party villains mid-campaign
*   Early sessions: defending kingdom, heroic tone
*   Middle sessions: becoming antagonists, former allies now enemies
*   Late sessions: choice between full evil, redemption, or independence
*   Multiple endings based on cumulative corruption and final choices

### 3. **Undead Army Management**
*   After corruption, party raises fallen enemies as undead servants
*   Build army: Ghouls (melee), Crypt Fiends (ranged), Abominations (tanks), Frost Wyrms (flying)
*   Necromancy: Convert corpses to troops during/after battles
*   No morale issues: undead never flee or desert
*   But: holy magic/sunlight devastating to undead armies

### 4. **Frostmourne - The Cursed Blade**
*   Legendary weapon offered mid-campaign
*   Immediately grants immense power (+5 weapon, devastating abilities)
*   But: soul-draining curse, kills wielder's compassion, serves Lich King
*   Kills fuel power: each enemy slain empowers wielder
*   Can eventually be purified (hard redemption path) or fully embrace (corruption path)

### 5. **Multi-Faction Warfare**
*   Late campaign: three-way war between Scourge (party), Alliance (humans/elves), Horde (orcs)
*   Each faction has unique units and strategies
*   Party can form temporary alliances or fight all simultaneously
*   Some endings require convincing factions to unite against greater threat

### 6. **Hero Units & Special Characters**
*   Party members are Hero Units—powerful individuals leading armies
*   Recruit other heroes: death knights, necromancers, banshee queens
*   Former allies become enemy heroes: Uther, Jaina, Thrall
*   Hero vs. Hero duels in major battles
*   Some heroes can be recruited if convinced party seeks redemption

### 7. **Plague of Undeath**
*   Cult of the Damned spreads plague through grain shipments
*   Infected citizens turn into zombies within days
*   Party faces impossible choice: quarantine and starve cities, or purge infected
*   Culling Stratholme: kill thousands of innocent infected before they turn
*   Choice haunts party; either corrupts them or strengthens resolve to find cure
