### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Scourge Rises**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party begins as noble paladins defending their kingdom from undead plague, but pursuing a cursed weapon to gain power ultimately corrupts them into death knights leading the Scourge. They experience gradual moral corruption, transforming from heroes to villains, culminating in choice between serving the Burning Legion demons, seeking redemption by turning against masters, or seizing independent power as new Lich King.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Lich King's creation—how demons imprisoned an orc shaman in ice to command the Scourge.
    *   Write the history of the Cult of the Damned spreading plague to prepare for demonic invasion.
    *   Describe the forging of Frostmourne and the curse binding its wielder to the Lich King.
    *   Explain the Burning Legion's multi-world conquest and why they created the Scourge as vanguard.
    *   Detail the original fall of Lordaeron and how the kingdom became Scourge territory.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**

    *   **The Scourge** (Major): Undead armies commanded by Lich King through death knights and necromancers.

**5. Location Blueprints**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **IF:** Party claims Frostmourne → **THEN:** Immediate power surge but corruption begins, personality changes, Lich King whispers.
*   **IF:** Stratholme is culled → **THEN:** Prevents plague spread but traumatizes party, corruption increases, Uther abandons them.
*   **IF:** Party kills King Terenas → **THEN:** Full corruption achieved, kingdom falls, raised as first death knight lieutenant.
*   **IF:** Corruption reaches maximum → **THEN:** Transform into death knight, command undead armies, former allies become enemies.
*   **IF:** Seek redemption path → **THEN:** Must make extraordinary sacrifices, ally with former enemies, purify Frostmourne.
*   **IF:** Serve Burning Legion → **THEN:** Demonic powers granted, become expendable tool, ultimate betrayal likely.
*   **IF:** Rebel against Lich King → **THEN:** Seize Frozen Throne, become new Lich King, independent Scourge rule.
*   **IF:** Unite all factions → **THEN:** Can defeat Archimonde, save world, earn redemption despite past.
