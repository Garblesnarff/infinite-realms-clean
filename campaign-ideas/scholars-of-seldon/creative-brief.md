# Creative Brief: Scholars of Seldon

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Retro-Futuristic Classical Empire (Golden Age Sci-Fi meets Roman Architecture)

Inspired by the classic science fiction art of the 1950s-60s and the grandeur of Roman and Byzantine architecture, this style blends optimistic futurism with the weight of declining empire. It aims to capture the vast scale of a galaxy-spanning civilization, the beauty of accumulated knowledge, and the melancholy of inevitable decay.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Grandeur:** Everything from cities to libraries to starships should feel monumental, built to last millennia.
*   **Contrast Glory and Decay:** Show the Empire at its height versus its ruin—pristine marble alongside crumbling columns.
*   **Celebrate Knowledge:** Libraries, scrolls, data crystals, and scholars should be central visual elements, treated with reverence.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, scholarly, prophetic, declining empire, retro-futuristic, classical architecture, mathematical destiny, melancholic grandeur.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of history and the hope of preservation. The loneliness of watching civilizations fall. The quiet determination of scholars against darkness.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, classical lines inspired by Greco-Roman architecture. Symmetrical compositions suggesting order and mathematical precision.
*   **Textures:** Polished marble, aged stone, burnished metal, fine fabrics, worn parchment, glowing data crystals.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in retro-futuristic style. A grand library hall with towering marble columns and brass fixtures, where scholars in flowing robes study ancient tomes and glowing holographic projections."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Imperial Trantor:** Rich, saturated colors—imperial purples, deep blues, gold accents, white marble, suggesting wealth and power.
*   **Terminus (Early):** Muted, practical colors—sandy browns, steel grays, functional whites, suggesting frontier austerity.
*   **Terminus (Later):** Warmer, prosperous colors—merchant golds, trade blues, wealthy greens, suggesting success.
*   **Ruined Trantor:** Desaturated, weathered colors—faded purples, rust browns, moss greens, crumbling grays, suggesting decay.
*   **The Vault:** Ethereal, prophetic colors—soft blues, whites, glowing golds, suggesting divine knowledge.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of imperial purple and gold, with white marble reflecting warm, ambient light. The scene conveys wealth and power but with subtle cracks and wear suggesting age."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Scholars:** Flowing robes in academic colors (deep blues, browns, grays) with hoods or caps. Carrying books, scrolls, or data tablets. Faces show intelligence and determination.
*   **Mayors/Leaders:** Elegant tunics or suits inspired by Roman senators, with badges of office—medallions, staffs, ornate belts.
*   **The Mule:** Physically unimpressive—small, hunched, with asymmetrical features—but eyes glowing with psychic power. Wears simple, dark clothing.
*   **Second Foundation:** Mysterious, hooded figures with subtle psychic auras—faint glows around their heads, eyes that seem to see too much.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A middle-aged scholar in flowing blue robes, holding an ancient leather-bound tome. His face shows wisdom and weariness, with gray hair and intense eyes. He wears a bronze medallion bearing the Foundation's symbol—a stylized book."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Trantor (Imperial):** World-spanning city of towering spires, domed palaces, vast plazas, all in classical architectural style with sci-fi elements—floating platforms, holographic displays.
*   **Trantor (Ruined):** Same architecture but crumbling, overgrown with vegetation, populated by scavengers. Lighting is dim, atmospheric, melancholic.
*   **Terminus:** Initially sparse—prefab structures on barren plains. Later, beautiful domed libraries, market squares, botanical gardens, suggesting prosperity built on knowledge.
*   **The Vault:** A perfect, timeless chamber—smooth metallic walls, geometric patterns, a central platform where Seldon's hologram appears in golden light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of Trantor's Imperial Plaza at sunset—a vast open space paved with white marble, surrounded by towering columns and golden domed buildings. Thousands of citizens in colorful robes walk through. Floating platforms carry dignitaries above. The sky is a gradient from gold to deep purple."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Imperial Scenes:** Warm, golden lighting suggesting prosperity and power. Soft shadows, ambient illumination from multiple sources.
*   **Terminus (Early):** Harsh, bright sunlight with sharp shadows, suggesting a frontier world without amenities.
*   **Terminus (Later):** Warm, inviting lighting—gas lamps, magical lights, suggesting comfort and civilization.
*   **Ruined Trantor:** Dim, atmospheric lighting—shafts of sunlight through broken domes, glowing fungi, scattered fires, creating dramatic contrast.
*   **Vault Scenes:** Ethereal, omnidirectional golden light with no visible source, suggesting the divine or prophetic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by warm, golden sunlight streaming through tall windows, casting long shadows across the marble floor. Dust motes float in the light beams, and scholars' robes glow softly in the warm illumination."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Classical, balanced compositions emphasizing symmetry and order. Wide, epic shots showing scale. Close-ups during intimate, political moments.
*   **Techniques:** Use architectural elements to frame characters. Show individuals dwarfed by massive libraries or palaces. Use depth to emphasize the passage of time (foreground in decay, background showing former glory).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A symmetrical composition showing the Vault's interior—a perfect circular chamber with the holographic Hari Seldon standing on a central platform, surrounded by the party members arranged in a semi-circle. Geometric patterns on the walls glow softly. The perspective emphasizes the chamber's perfect geometry."

## Voice

A measured, professorial voice—cultured, with a Trans-Atlantic or Received Pronunciation British accent suggesting timeless education and authority. The pacing is deliberate and thoughtful, as if each word is chosen carefully. The emotion carries quiet gravitas, a mix of wisdom, melancholy, and hope—the voice of someone who has seen empires fall but believes in humanity's resilience. Audio quality is pristine and clear, like a recorded lecture for posterity. Role: A senior Foundation scholar, a historian recording the fall of Empire, or Hari Seldon himself delivering prophecy.
