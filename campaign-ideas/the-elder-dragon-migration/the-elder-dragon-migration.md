**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14**
**Tone (keywords):** adventurous, ecological, strategic, preparation-focused, epic-hunts
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are Hunters—elite monster-slaying specialists sent on the Fifth Fleet's expedition to the New World, a mysterious continent where Elder Dragons migrate every century. These colossal beasts reshape ecosystems through their mere presence, and understanding why they gather here could save countless lives. The party must track, hunt, and study each Elder Dragon while maintaining the delicate ecological balance. But the apex predator Nergigante hunts other Elder Dragons for food, and an even greater threat—the dragon Xeno'jiiva gestating in the earth's core—draws all the dragons here like moths to flame.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12+ sessions)

A tale of ecological mystery solved through strategic monster hunting.

*   **Act I — Establishing the Base (Sessions 1–4):** The Fifth Fleet arrives in the New World and establishes Astera base camp. The party undertakes hunts to understand local ecosystems: the Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, and Coral Highlands. They discover tracks of multiple Elder Dragons converging on the continent. The Handler (their research partner) theorizes something is drawing them.
*   **Act II — The Elder Dragon Hunt (Sessions 5–9):** The party must hunt or repel Elder Dragons destabilizing ecosystems: Zorah Magdaros (walking volcano), Kushala Daora (steel wind dragon), Teostra (explosive flame dragon), Nergigante (regenerating spike dragon). Each hunt requires preparation, tracking, and exploiting weaknesses. They discover all dragons are drawn toward an energy source deep underground.
*   **Act III — The Convergence (Sessions 10–12+):** The party descends into the Confluence of Fates beneath the continent and discovers Xeno'jiiva—a newborn dragon of immense bioenergy gestating in solidified Elder Dragon energy. They must hunt this ultimate monster before its emergence destroys the New World. Success allows them to understand the migration cycle and prevent future catastrophes.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Hunt Preparation Phase**
*   Before each major hunt, players have a preparation phase.
*   Research monster weaknesses via tracking, ecology notes, and veteran hunter advice.
*   Craft specialized gear: armor resistant to specific elements, weapons exploiting weaknesses.
*   Gather items: potions, traps, bombs, environmental tools.
*   Poor preparation makes hunts significantly harder.

### 2. **Monster Weaknesses System**
*   Each monster has elemental weaknesses (fire, water, thunder, ice, dragon).
*   Physical damage types: slashing, blunt, piercing—different hit zones have different vulnerabilities.
*   Status effects: poison, paralysis, sleep, stun—can turn fights dramatically.
*   Learning weaknesses through Research Level (gained by hunting/tracking).

### 3. **Equipment Crafting**
*   Weapons and armor are crafted from monster parts.
*   Each monster provides unique gear with special abilities.
*   Armor sets provide elemental resistances and set bonuses.
*   Weapon types (14 total) have different playstyles: greatsword (slow/powerful), dual blades (fast/weak), bow (ranged).
*   Failed hunts mean wasted resources—must re-hunt.

### 4. **Tracking and Ecology**
*   Monsters leave tracks, scratches, mucus—gathering these reveals location.
*   High research level shows monster on map, health, rage state.
*   Understanding ecology helps predict behavior: where monsters feed, sleep, fight.
*   Environmental traps can be used: falling boulders, dam breaks, poisonous plants.

### 5. **Monster Behavior and Turf Wars**
*   Monsters aren't static enemies—they eat, sleep, fight each other.
*   Turf Wars: If two large monsters meet, they fight, damaging each other.
*   Wounded monsters flee to rest, allowing strategic choices: pursue or prepare for round 2.
*   Enraged state: When heavily damaged, monsters become faster and stronger.

### 6. **SOS Flares and Cooperation**
*   Difficult hunts allow calling for backup (NPC hunters or other players).
*   Hunts scale difficulty with number of hunters.
*   Specialized roles: Tank (draws aggro), DPS (damage), Support (healing/buffing).
*   Coordinated hunts are far easier than solo attempts on Elder Dragons.
