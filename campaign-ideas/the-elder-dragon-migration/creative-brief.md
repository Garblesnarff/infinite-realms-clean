## Art Style: Natural Fantasy Realism (Monster Hunter-inspired)

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Majestic Beasts:** Monsters are awe-inspiring, not evil—they're animals defending territory.
*   **Hunter Preparation:** Show the ritual of gearing up, sharpening weapons, gathering supplies.

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Hunters in practical but elaborate armor made from monster parts.

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural lighting emphasizing time of day and weather.
*   **Weather Effects:** Rain, storms, heat shimmers, all affect gameplay and visuals.
