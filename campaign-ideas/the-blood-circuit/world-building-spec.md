# The Blood Circuit - World-Building Specification

## The Corporate Landscape

**Major Corporations:**
- **Helix Dynamics:** Weapons manufacturing, aggressive sponsorship
- **Vanguard Industries:** Defensive tech, conservative values
- **Spectre Solutions:** Stealth/intel, morally gray
- **Titan Forge:** Heavy armor/vehicles, traditional
- **Nexus Biotech:** Augmentations, unethical experiments

**The Blood Circuit Organization:**
- Independent league owned by corporate consortium
- Generates billions in revenue (betting, streaming, merchandise)
- Legends are contracted employees, not free agents
- Termination clause: corporations can end contracts (and Legends)
- Resurrection technology expensive, used sparingly

## Legend Classes and Abilities

**Offensive Legends:** High damage, aggressive plays, flashy abilities
**Defensive Legends:** Shields, fortifications, team protection
**Support Legends:** Healing, buffs, information gathering
**Recon Legends:** Scouting, tracking, intel
**Mobility Legends:** Movement, repositioning, escapes

**Sample Legend Abilities:**

- Ultimate: Powerful game-changer (orbital strike, portal, resurrection)
- Passive: Always-on benefit (faster heals, extra inventory)

## Arena Locations Detailed

**Neon City:** Vertical combat, ziplines, indoor/outdoor mix. High-tier loot downtown. Sniper heaven on rooftops. Corporations' headquarters visible.

**Proving Grounds:** Industrial warehouse district. Close-quarters combat. Loot in factories. Environmental hazards (conveyor belts, crushers). Fast-paced matches.

**Frost Peak:** Mountain terrain, exposure damage outside shelter. Sniper sightlines. Ice-physics movement. Avalanche events triggered by combat.

**Volcanic Rift:** Lava flows deal damage. Geysers launch players. High-risk high-reward loot near lava. Heat visibility distortion. Aggressive meta encouraged.

**The Gauntlet (Finals):** Combines elements of all arenas. Largest map, most complicated. Central spire structure. Multiple levels and playstyles viable.

## The Dark Side

**Augmentation Addiction:** Legends pressured to enhance performance. Experimental implants have side effects. Some Legends become more machine than person. Psychological deterioration common.

**Fixed Matches:** Corporations bet on outcomes. Influence matches through sabotage, better gear for favorites. Some Legends blackmailed into throwing games. Betting scandal evidence exists.

**Termination:** "Retired" Legends actually executed. Too expensive to keep alive. Know too many corporate secrets. Bodies disposed of quietly. Urban legend among active Legends.

**The Undercity:** Failed Legends dumped here. No money, damaged bodies, PTSD. Criminal underground. Some plan revenge. Others just survive. Players might encounter them.

**Experimental Subjects:** New Legends are test subjects. Unauthorized augmentations. Dr. Kane's illegal research. Some Legends are prototypes. Corporate property legally.

## Resistance Movement

**The Fallen Legends:** Former champions who escaped termination. Lead underground resistance. Plan to expose corporations. Recruit current Legends. Limited resources but determined.

**Goals:** End forced participation. Expose fixed matches. Free Legends from contracts. Dismantle corporate control. Revolutionary violence if necessary.

**Methods:** Smuggle evidence, sabotage matches, rescue marked Legends, hack broadcasts, public relations campaign.

## Match Structure and Rules

**Team Formation:** Three-person squads. Can be pre-made or random. Chemistry matters. Team changes between seasons.

**Drop Phase:** Choose landing zone. Hot drops (high loot, high combat) vs. safe drops. Drop order matters.

**Looting Phase:** Find weapons, armor, attachments, consumables. Manage inventory. Share with team.

**Combat Phase:** Engage enemy squads. Communication crucial. Use abilities synergistically. Revive downed teammates.

**Ring Phases:** Arena shrinks in stages. Time between phases decreases. Final ring is tiny. Last squad standing wins.

**Elimination:** Downed but not out (can be revived). Full elimination requires finishing. Banner retrieval possible. Respawn at beacons.

**Victory:** Last squad alive. Instant celebrity. Fame, fortune, next match. Until you lose.

This world combines the excitement of battle royale gameplay with corporate dystopia themes, creating both thrilling combat and meaningful narrative choices.
