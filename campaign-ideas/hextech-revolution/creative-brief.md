# Creative Brief: Hextech Revolution

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Steampunk Class Divide (Arcane-inspired)

Inspired by the stunning visual contrast between Piltover's Art Nouveau steampunk elegance and Zaun's industrial cyberpunk decay. This style captures the beauty of innovation and the horror of inequality.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Stark Visual Divide:** Piltover is golden, clean, Art Nouveau curves and hextech blue glow. Zaun is green chemical smog, neon signs, industrial grit.
*   **Emotional Color:** Use color to convey emotion—cool blues for technology and isolation, warm oranges/purples for human connection, sickly greens for Shimmer corruption.
*   **Graffiti-Style Dynamism:** Combat and action should feel like animated graffiti come to life—fluid, stylized, explosive.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Class warfare, steampunk innovation, toxic beauty, sisterhood torn apart, revolution, progress vs tradition, hextech vs shimmer, tragedy.
*   **Feeling:** Beautiful but unjust. Innovation creating greater divides. The atmosphere is tense, colorful, tragic—like watching a beautiful painting being torn in half.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly detailed, painterly with strong, expressive linework. Art Nouveau curves for Piltover, angular industrial forms for Zaun.
*   **Forms:** Characters have exaggerated, expressive features. Hextech devices are elegant and geometric. Shimmer effects are chaotic and organic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A painted illustration in the style of Arcane. A young woman with pink hair and hextech gauntlets stands in a Piltover street. Art Nouveau architecture curves around her. Blue hextech light reflects off brass and glass. The style is highly detailed, painterly, with expressive linework."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:**
    *   Piltover: Golds, whites, blues (hextech glow), brass, clean pastels
    *   Zaun: Greens (chemical smog), purples (shimmer glow), neon signs, rusted metals, deep shadows
*   **Emotional Coding:** Blue = hextech/technology, Purple/Pink = shimmer/enhancement, Gold = wealth/power, Green = poison/decay
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a stark color divide. Above, Piltover in golden sunlight with blue hextech glow and Art Nouveau pastels. Below, Zaun in green chemical haze with neon purple signs and rust-red metals. The contrast is beautiful and heartbreaking."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Highly expressive, slightly stylized characters. Piltover fashion is elegant Victorian-steampunk. Zaun fashion is punk-industrial with gas masks and goggles.
*   **Shimmer Effects:** Characters using Shimmer have glowing purple eyes, enhanced musculature, visible veins, and signs of corruption.
*   **Hextech Integration:** Hextech devices are sleek, blue-glowing, Art Deco-inspired technology seamlessly integrated.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young woman with long blue braids, covered in tattoos and paint. Her eyes glow purple with Shimmer. She wears punk-industrial clothing—leather, straps, repurposed tech. In her hands, an improvised explosive device decorated with colorful graffiti. The style is Arcane—painterly, expressive, tragic."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:**
    *   Piltover: Tall elegant towers, brass hexgates, Art Nouveau architecture, gardens, clean streets, university halls.
    *   Zaun: Vertical undercity, pipes everywhere, green smog, neon signs, chemical runoff, cramped living spaces, vibrant but toxic.
*   **Visual Storytelling:** The architecture tells the class story—Piltover's beauty is built literally on top of Zaun's suffering.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vertical cross-section showing both cities. Above: Piltover's golden towers and hexgates gleaming in sunlight. Below: Zaun's industrial undercity, green smog between metal platforms, neon signs, people living in the shadows of the city above. The composition emphasizes the weight of Piltover crushing Zaun beneath it."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, painterly lighting with strong contrast. Hextech creates clean blue light. Shimmer creates sickly purple-green glows.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting reveals inequality—Piltover bathes in natural golden light while Zaun exists in artificial neon and chemical smog.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the contrast between clean blue hextech glow from above and neon purple shimmer light from below. Chemical haze creates atmospheric perspective. The lighting is painterly, with visible brush strokes in the shadows."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic, action-heavy compositions with strong diagonals and depth. Use of vertical compositions to show the cities stacked.
*   **Techniques:** Graffiti-style action sequences, slow-motion emotional beats, mirrored compositions showing the sisters on opposite sides.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition: Left side shows Vi in Piltover enforcer uniform, blue hextech light, clean background. Right side shows Jinx in Zaun, purple shimmer glow, graffiti-covered background. They mirror each other's pose but are separated by a literal divide down the center—a visual metaphor for their torn relationship."

## Voice

A tragic, emotional voice that speaks with the pain of family torn apart by circumstance and choice. The tone is that of someone recounting a war where everyone lost—full of love for the characters despite their flaws. There's a musical quality, almost like a ballad or folk song about revolution. The voice is young adult, touched by trauma, but still finding beauty in the struggle. When describing Piltover, the voice becomes formal, distant. When describing Zaun, it becomes raw, emotional, immediate. Role: The voice of someone who lived through the revolution, possibly one of the sisters in an alternate timeline, looking back with sorrow and understanding.
