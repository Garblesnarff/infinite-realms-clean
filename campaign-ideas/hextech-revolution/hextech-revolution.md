## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15–22 sessions)

A three-act tragedy about progress, revolution, and the bonds that war cannot break.

*   **Act I — The Heist Gone Wrong (Sessions 1–7):** Players are street kids or associates from Zaun who participate in a heist targeting a Piltover inventor. The job goes catastrophically wrong, resulting in an explosion that kills several people. In the aftermath, two sisters (Vi and Powder/Jinx) are separated. Players must survive in Zaun as enforcers hunt them, while Piltover's council debates how to respond to Undercity violence.
*   **Act II — Cities Divided (Sessions 8–14):** Years pass. Hextech has revolutionized Piltover, making it even more prosperous, while Zaun remains poisoned and desperate. Vi has become a Piltover enforcer, believing in reform from within. Her sister Jinx has become a dangerous revolutionary, working with the chem-baron Silco to arm Zaun with Shimmer-enhanced weapons. Players must navigate between the two cities, choosing allegiances as war approaches.
*   **Act III — The Revolution (Sessions 15–22):** Open conflict erupts. Hextech weapons clash with Shimmer-enhanced zaunites. The Council chamber is bombed. The sisters face each other in a final confrontation. Players must decide: support Piltover's order, Zaun's revolution, or find a third way where both cities can coexist. The cost of any choice is high.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores class warfare, the cost of progress, and how trauma shapes people into heroes or villains. The central question: "Is violent revolution justified when peaceful reform has failed for generations?" Players must navigate between two sisters on opposite sides, two cities at war, and the question of whether progress benefits all or only the privileged. The campaign examines how good intentions create systems of oppression and how love cannot always overcome ideology.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Hextech and Shimmer** (Dual Magic Systems)
*   Hextech: Refined, stable magic-technology available to the wealthy. Grants clean, predictable power.
*   Shimmer: Volatile alchemical magic available to the poor. Grants immense strength and speed but causes addiction and mutation.
*   Players can choose which path to pursue, affecting their abilities and how NPCs react to them.

### 2. **City Allegiance** (Reputation System)
*   Players have separate reputation scores with Piltover and Zaun.
*   Actions that benefit one city often harm standing in the other.
*   High reputation grants access to unique resources, allies, and information.
*   Being neutral is difficult—both cities will demand players choose a side.

### 3. **The Sisters' Path** (Parallel Storyline)
*   Vi and Jinx's relationship is central to the campaign. Players can influence but not control their fate.
*   The campaign tracks their relationship: can they reconcile, or will they destroy each other?
*   Players' choices affect which sister survives the final confrontation.

### 4. **Innovation and Ethics**
*   Players can participate in Hextech research or Shimmer enhancement.
*   Each innovation requires moral choices: Who benefits? Who pays the cost?
*   Creating new technology can solve problems but also creates new ones.

### 5. **Class Warfare Combat**
*   Combat encounters emphasize the technological/alchemical divide:
    *   Piltover enforcers have Hextech weapons and armor—advanced, clean, effective.
    *   Zaun fighters have Shimmer enhancements and improvised weapons—brutal, desperate, dangerous.
*   Environmental hazards differ by city: chemical clouds in Zaun, Hextech security systems in Piltover.
