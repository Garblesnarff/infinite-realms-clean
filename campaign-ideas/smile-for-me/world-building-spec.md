## Memetic Power Mechanics (Technical)

### How Belief Empowers Entities

**Equation**: Entity Power = (Believers × Belief Intensity) + (Story Spread × Fear Factor)

**Variables**:
- **Believers**: People who think entity is real
- **Belief Intensity**: Strength of belief (scale 1-10)
- **Story Spread**: How widely story is known
- **Fear Factor**: How scared people are

**Thresholds**:
- 0-100: Entity can't manifest
- 101-500: Brief manifestations, weak
- 501-1000: Physical form, moderate power
- 1001-5000: Sustained existence, dangerous
- 5001+: Godlike, nearly unkillable

**Current Levels** (Campaign Start):
- Jeff: 4,500 (dangerous but killable)
- The Rake: 3,200 (strong, multiple entities)
- BEN: 5,100 (godlike in digital realm)
- Smile Dog: 8,000 (widespread memetic hazard)

### Reducing Entity Power

**Information Suppression**: Remove stories from internet (-10% per major site)
**Counter-Narrative**: Spread debunking (-5% per viral post)
**Parody**: Make entity joke instead of fear (-15% if successful)
**Memory Wipe**: Chemical or magical amnesia (effective but unethical)
**Killing Believers**: Extreme, reduces power but creates martyrs

## Campaign Secrets (DM Only)

### The Original Writers
The people who created creepypasta stories are being hunted by their creations. Jeff's creator is in hiding. Smile Dog's creator died spreading the word. Finding them provides power—they can unmake what they made.

### The Archivist's True Goal
He wants to become the ultimate creepypasta. His plan: Get killed dramatically by all entities simultaneously. Death will make him legend. Resurrection through belief will make him god.

### One Killer Wants Out
Eyeless Jack is still partially human. He's fighting the demon. Can be saved through exorcism. Will ally with party against Collective if saved. Provides inside information on summoning.

### The Government Knows
Department of Paranormal Containment (black ops) has been watching. They want to weaponize creepypasta entities. Will interfere with party to capture, not kill, entities. Can become ally or secondary antagonist.

### Smile Dog's True Nature
Not evil—it's communication attempt from alien intelligence. Spread the word = tell others we exist. The madness is side effect of incompatible psychology. Can potentially be befriended.

### The Party Member Secret
One PC is unknowing descendant of creepypasta writer. Their bloodline gives them power over that entity. Reveal this dramatically when they accidentally command the creature.

### The Final Truth
The campaign is being written as creepypasta in real-time. Every session is another chapter. The party's actions are being posted online. They're becoming legends. The DM is The Archivist. Fourth wall shatters. Welcome to legend.
