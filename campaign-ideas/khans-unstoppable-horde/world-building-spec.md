### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**Khan's Unstoppable Horde**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are commanders in Genghis Khan's horde as it explodes from the Mongolian steppes to conquer the largest land empire in history through revolutionary military tactics, absolute discipline, and terrifying ruthlessness. As generals, diplomats, siege engineers, and elite warriors, they must execute the Khan's vision of uniting the world under Mongol rule while navigating the tension between nomadic traditions and ruling settled civilizations. The campaign explores military genius combined with extreme brutality, the creation of history's greatest empire through terror and meritocracy, and whether conquest can ever be justified.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Mongol unification under Genghis Khan and the transformation from warring tribes to disciplined empire.
    *   Write about Mongol military tactics: feigned retreats, arrow storms, psychological warfare, mobility, intelligence networks.
    *   Describe the Yassa—Mongol law code demanding absolute obedience and creating meritocracy.
    *   Explain Mongol siege warfare innovation: recruiting Chinese engineers, adopting gunpowder, revolutionary tactics.
    *   Detail the terror policy: cities that surrendered paid tribute, cities that resisted were annihilated.
    *   Write about the Pax Mongolica: safe trade, religious tolerance, cultural exchange under Mongol rule.

        *   **Hierarchy:** The Khan (absolute authority), generals (proven ability), tumens (10,000-warrior units), meritocratic advancement.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We will unite the world under one law—surrender and thrive, resist and die.

    *   **Sedentary Empires** (Major—Being Conquered)
        *   **Goals:** To preserve civilization, defend territories, maintain traditional order.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Emperors, aristocrats, traditional armies ill-suited to Mongol tactics.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We are civilized empires defending against barbarian invasion.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many leaders underestimate Mongols until too late; some collaborate after seeing Mongol meritocracy.
        *   **Assets:** Fortifications (increasingly useless), large populations, wealth, traditional legitimacy.
