## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the creation of history's largest land empire through military genius and extreme brutality. The central conflict is the players executing campaigns of terror and conquest that objectively work—cities surrender, empires fall, trade flourishes under Pax Mongolica—while grappling with the moral cost of building empire on fear. They must balance Mongol meritocracy and religious tolerance against systematic massacres, preserve nomadic traditions while governing cities, and decide whether conquest can create something better than what it destroyed. The campaign asks: Can brutality be justified by results? What's the difference between terror and legitimate military strategy? Can nomadic conquerors successfully rule settled civilizations? And what legacy does an empire built on conquest leave? The answer: the Mongols created both history's greatest horrors and greatest peace—players determine which they're remembered for.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Mongol Tactical System**
*   Players use historically accurate Mongol tactics: feigned retreats, arrow barrages, mobility, intelligence networks.
*   These tactics give massive advantages against sedentary armies.
*   Success in battle spreads Mongol reputation, making future conquests easier.

### 2. **Terror vs. Mercy**
*   Track whether cities are conquered through surrender (tribute) or resistance (annihilation).
*   High terror makes future conquests easier but increases moral weight.
*   Mercy preserves populations for governing but may encourage resistance.

### 3. **The Meritocracy System**
*   The Khan promotes based on ability, not birth—including conquered peoples.
*   Players can recruit the best from defeated enemies to strengthen the horde.
*   This creates diverse, capable administration but threatens traditional Mongol identity.

### 4. **Nomad vs. Sedentary Tension**
*   Track the balance between Mongol traditions and the needs of governing cities.
*   Too nomadic makes administration impossible; too sedentary loses Mongol identity.
*   The players must find synthesis or choose one identity over the other.

### 5. **The Pax Mongolica**
*   As the empire stabilizes, trade and cultural exchange flourish under Mongol protection.
*   Players see the positive legacy: safe trade routes, religious tolerance, meritocracy, cultural exchange.
*   This creates moral complexity: was the conquest worth this peace?
