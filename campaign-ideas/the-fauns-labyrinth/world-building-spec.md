### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Faun's Labyrinth**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** In a brutal war-torn land, the party must complete three dark fairy tale trials assigned by an ancient faun while navigating the horrors of military occupation, resistance fighting, and moral impossible choices where innocence itself is at stake in both the magical and mundane worlds.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the underground kingdom and its lost royal bloodline
    *   Explain the war—who's fighting, why, and the brutality of the occupation
    *   Describe the faun's origins and whether it truly serves benevolent powers
    *   Write about the ancient creatures (the toad, the Pale Man) and their symbolic meanings
    *   Detail the labyrinth's history and what it truly leads to
    *   Explain the relationship between fairy tale magic and brutal reality—are they separate or intertwined?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **The Military Occupation** (Major) - Captain Vidal's forces, goal: crush resistance, maintain order through terror
    *   **The Resistance** (Major) - Forest rebels, goal: survive, fight occupation, protect people
    *   **The Fairy Tale World** (Major) - The Faun and magical creatures, goal: test worthiness, reclaim royalty (or something darker)
    *   **The Innocents** (Minor) - Civilians, servants, children caught between forces, goal: survive
    *   **The Collaborators** (Minor) - Those serving the occupation from fear or belief, goal: safety through compliance

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** The Faun, Captain Vidal, Mercedes, Dr. Ferreiro, The Pale Man, The Underground Queen (if she exists)
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Rebel Fighter," "Military Patrol," "Sympathetic Servant," "Captured Prisoner," "The Giant Toad," "Fairy Guides," "Village Elder," "Vidal's Lieutenant"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Mill** - Remote military outpost, stone architecture, cold and oppressive with guard posts
*   **The Forest** - Where rebels hide, contains ancient fairy tale locations, dangerous for both sides
*   **The Ancient Fig Tree** - Dying hollow tree housing the giant toad, roots forming tunnels
*   **The Pale Man's Hall** - Isolated baroque chamber with feast table, treasure piles, horrifying murals
*   **The Stone Labyrinth** - Ancient spiral maze leading underground or nowhere
*   Each location has both mundane dangers (patrols, war) and fairy tale horrors (monsters, trials)

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the party completes trials while preserving innocence THEN the fairy tale escape may be real salvation
*   IF they complete trials through cruelty THEN the "reward" is revealed as a trap or curse
*   IF they refuse the faun's demands THEN they must face reality without magical escape
*   IF they help the resistance THEN Vidal targets them, increasing danger
*   IF they collaborate with Vidal THEN they become complicit in atrocities but survive longer
*   IF they eat from the Pale Man's feast THEN he awakens and hunts them
*   IF they bring innocent blood to the labyrinth THEN the final door opens—but at what cost?
*   IF they refuse the final demand THEN they prove worthiness through sacrifice, not compliance
