# Creative Brief: The 108 Stars Rising

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Watercolor War Epic (Suikoden II-inspired)

Inspired by the painterly, emotional aesthetic of *Suikoden II*, with watercolor-style backgrounds, expressive sprite work, and a muted color palette reflecting the tragedy of war. This style aims to capture the epic, tragic, hopeful, and bittersweet tone of "The 108 Stars Rising," where friendship fractures across the battlefield.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Intimacy:** Contrast massive army battles with personal character moments. Show both the grand sweep of war and individual faces in the crowd.
*   **Watercolor Aesthetic:** Soft edges, bleeding colors, painterly backgrounds that feel hand-crafted and emotionally resonant.
*   **Symbol of Division:** Use visual metaphors for the split between player and Jowy - mirrors, split screens, bridges broken in half, two paths diverging.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, tragic, hopeful, bittersweet, war, friendship, betrayal, base-building, political intrigue, sacrifice, destiny.
*   **Feeling:** The bittersweet weight of necessary war and fractured brotherhood. The atmosphere balances hope (building something new) with tragedy (losing your best friend to opposing ideals). Intimate character moments contrast with sweeping battles.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean sprite-based character designs with expressive poses and faces despite pixel limitations. Backgrounds have softer, more painterly edges. Army units shown as organized formations.
*   **Textures:** Watercolor bleeding for backgrounds, crisp sprites for characters, fabric and armor textures for military units.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sprite-based JRPG illustration with a watercolor background. The focus is on a castle headquarters with soft, painted textures, while character sprites in the foreground have clear, defined pixel edges."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted and naturalistic with splashes of symbolic color. Earth tones, military greens and browns, Highland's royal purple and red, Liberation Army's blue and white. Watercolor backgrounds use soft, bleeding hues.
*   **Symbolic Use:** Player associated with blue (hope, protection), Jowy with purple and red (royalty, blood). Bright Shield Rune glows blue, Beast Rune glows red.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered in a muted watercolor palette of soft greens for forest, gray for stone castle, and blue banners for the Liberation Army. A character in the foreground bears a glowing blue rune mark on their hand."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Sprite-based designs with distinct silhouettes for the 108 Stars. Military uniforms for soldiers, diverse cultural clothing for civilians. Player and Jowy should be visually parallel - similar but diverging.
*   **Expression:** Despite sprite limitations, characters convey emotion through pose and gesture. Emphasis on eyes and body language.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Two young men in sprite JRPG style standing back-to-back. One wears a blue military jacket with the Bright Shield symbol, the other wears purple royal garments with the Beast crest. They mirror each other but face opposite directions."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Watercolor-painted environments. The Liberation Army base grows from a ruined castle to a thriving city. Battlefields show the scars of war. Highland's architecture is ornate but oppressive. Jowston cities are diverse and democratic.
*   **Atmosphere:** Environments tell stories - the base feels hopeful and alive as more Stars join, battlefields are tragic and scarred, Highland's palace is beautiful but cold.
*   **Details:** Small touches show life - NPCs going about daily tasks in the base, war damage on buildings, flowers growing despite conflict, 108 different faces in the crowd.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A watercolor-style illustration of a castle war room. Wooden tables with maps, character sprites of generals discussing strategy, banners on the walls, warm candlelight. Through windows, see the courtyard where NPCs train and live."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, naturalistic lighting fitting the watercolor aesthetic. Warm light for hopeful moments (gathering at the base), cold light for tragic scenes (facing Jowy), harsh light for battles.
*   **Special Effects:** Rune magic glows with distinctive colors. Army battle effects show formations moving, arrows arcing, magic exploding in colorful bursts.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes emotional tone - warm gatherings of friends contrast with cold confrontations of enemies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm evening light streaming through windows, creating a cozy atmosphere in the Liberation Army's dining hall as sprites of the 108 Stars gather for a meal, watercolor style."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Compositional techniques emphasizing gathering vs. division. Wide shots of the 108 Stars together, split-screen comparisons of player and Jowy's parallel journeys, armies arrayed across battlefields.
*   **Techniques:** Use symmetry to show parallel paths. Frame important duels with equal positioning. Show the base growing denser with characters as the campaign progresses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition in watercolor JRPG style. Left side: the player surrounded by the 108 Stars in their castle base, warm blues and greens. Right side: Jowy alone on a throne in Highland's palace, cold purples and reds. A broken bridge or mirror divides them down the center."

## Voice

A warm but melancholic voice, like an old soldier recounting a war that had no true winners. The pacing is measured and reflective, occasionally breaking into passionate intensity when describing battles or the moment of final confrontation. The emotion carries deep sorrow for friendships lost and wars fought, tempered by hope that the sacrifice meant something. Audio quality is clear with a subtle outdoor ambiance - distant wind, flags fluttering - as if speaking on a battlefield long after the fighting ended. Role: The voice of a chronicler like Apple recording the Liberation War, or an older version of the player reflecting on what was lost and gained.
