    *   **IF:** Players use ruthless tactics (Shu's suggestions to sacrifice units, destroy neutral cities for strategic advantage).

    *   **IF:** Players maintain relationship with Jowy through letters and meetings.
    *   **THEN:** Unlock dialogue options in the final confrontation that can lead to reconciliation rather than death.
    *   **IF:** Nanami attempts to sacrifice herself to save the player.
