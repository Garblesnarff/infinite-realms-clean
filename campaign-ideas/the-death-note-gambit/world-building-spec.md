- Is L right?
- Is anyone?
- Would you use the Note?
- How far for justice?

### Campaign Mechanics Detail

**The Planning Phase:**
Each session includes planning time. Both sides (if playing both) plot moves. DM tracks without revealing all. Dramatic reveals when plans clash.

**The Execution Phase:**
Plans play out. Contingencies activate. Surprises emerge. Both sides adapt in real-time.

**The Analysis Phase:**
What did opponent learn? What did you reveal? How to counter? Next moves?

**The Escalation:**
Each round raises stakes. More elaborate plans. Higher costs. Grander gambits. Approaching endgame.

### Victory Conditions Detailed

**Kira Total Victory:**
- L and all successors eliminated
- Death Note secret maintained
- New world order established
- Worshipped as god
- But alone at top
- Absolute corruption
- Was it worth everything?

**L Total Victory:**
- Kira identity exposed
- Death Note captured/destroyed
- Kira arrested/killed
- Justice served
- World saved from tyranny
- But Kira's criticisms valid
- Crime returns
- Nothing really solved

**Compromise (Non-Canon):**
- Kira stops killing
- L stops hunting
- Stalemate
- Both lose and win
- Unsatisfying but realistic

**Mutual Destruction:**
- Both die
- Successors continue
- Cycle repeats
- Tragedy for all
- Shinigami laugh

### The Endgame

**Kira's Downfall:**
- One mistake after years
- Pride before fall
- Ryuk writes name
- "I was bored"
- Human game over

**L's Fall:**
- Curiosity killed detective
- Got too close
- Name written
- Successor rises
- Fight continues

**The Tragedy:**
Both brilliant. Both idealistic. Both corrupted. Both destroyed by game they played. Shinigami entertained. Humans interesting. Nothing changes.

### Legacy

**In-World:**
- Death Note legend
- Kira worship continues
- Investigation techniques evolved
- Moral debate endless
- Society changed forever

**For Players:**
- Intellectual challenge
- Moral complexity
- Dramatic satisfaction
- Character study

### Campaign Philosophy

This is about:
- **Intelligence**: Outsmart, not overpower
- **Morality**: No easy answers
- **Drama**: Everything theatrical
- **Consequence**: Every choice matters
- **Style**: Presentation is power
- **Complexity**: Layers on layers
- **Tragedy**: Watching corruption
- **Entertainment**: For us and Ryuk

"Humans are so interesting."

And they are. Watching genius fight genius. Idealism corrupt. Power destroy. All for justice. All for ego. All for victory.

And in the end?

Ryuk writes the name.

Because he's bored.

And humans?

Always interesting.

Just as planned.

*Dramatic music*

*Maniacal laughter*
