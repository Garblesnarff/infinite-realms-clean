# The Death Note Gambit - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
High contrast lighting. Dramatic shadows. Urban Japanese-inspired fantasy setting. Gothic aesthetics. Red and black color scheme. Shinigami realm: Dark, industrial, otherworldly.

**Colors**: Death Note black, blood red, L's white, dramatic purple, shinigami grey, apple red (Ryuk)

## Music
"Low of Solipsism" tension. Dramatic orchestral stings. L's theme (eerie, playful). Light's theme (epic, corrupted). Shinigami realm (dissonant, otherworldly). Silence for psychological warfare.

## Voice Direction
**Light/Kira**: Starts earnest, becomes megalomaniacal. Internal monologue crucial. "Just as planned" deliveries.
**L**: Monotone, childish, sudden sharpness. Sugar-addled wisdom. "There's a 5% chance, no, 7%..."
**Ryuk**: Deep, amused, detached. Laughing at human arrogance. "Humans are interesting."
**Misa**: High, devoted, tragic. Not stupid, just blinded by love.
