# Creative Brief: The Raid: Ascent

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Urban Realism with Brutal Kinetic Action (Gareth Evans-inspired)

Inspired by the visceral, unflinching cinematography of *The Raid* films, with their emphasis on practical martial arts, environmental destruction, and claustrophobic urban warfare. This style captures the raw, brutal intensity of Pencak Silat combat in confined spaces.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Brutal Realism:** Emphasize the physical cost of violence—blood, sweat, exhaustion, environmental damage.
*   **Claustrophobic Spaces:** Depict tight corridors, cramped apartments, and confined stairwells that force close combat.
*   **Kinetic Movement:** Show dynamic action with emphasis on impact, momentum, and explosive violence.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Brutal, intense, desperate, claustrophobic, survival, relentless, exhausting, visceral, tactical.
*   **Feeling:** Constant tension and physical exhaustion. Every fight matters, every wound persists. The environment is actively hostile, and there's no safe place.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Gritty, textured linework showing wear and damage. Action poses emphasize impact and violence.
*   **Forms:** Athletic but realistic body types showing strain and injury. Architecture is utilitarian and decaying.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gritty cinematic shot in the style of The Raid. Two fighters in brutal close combat in a narrow concrete hallway. One executes an elbow strike while the other is mid-throw. Broken drywall, bloodstains."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated, muted colors emphasizing grays, browns, sickly greens. Occasional harsh fluorescent lighting.
*   **Violence:** Blood is realistic red, bruises are purple and yellow, injuries look painful.
*   **Environment:** Concrete gray, rust brown, dirty green walls, flickering fluorescent lights.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a desaturated color palette of concrete grays and dirty browns, lit by harsh flickering fluorescent lights casting greenish tones. Blood splatter is vivid red against the muted background."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Tactical gear that gets progressively damaged—torn uniforms, lost equipment, visible injuries.
*   **Strike Team:** Black tactical uniforms, body armor, weapons that get discarded for improvised close-combat.
*   **Criminals:** Street clothes, makeshift weapons, gang tattoos, desperate expressions.
*   **Mad Dog:** Simple sleeveless shirt showing muscular build, martial arts stance, predatory smile.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tactical officer in shredded black uniform, face bruised and bleeding, missing his rifle but wielding a machete taken from an enemy. His body armor is cracked, knuckles bloody. Expression shows exhaustion but determination."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Cramped, deteriorating urban architecture—peeling paint, water damage, trash, graffiti.
*   **Layouts:** Narrow hallways (6-8 feet wide), small apartments with thin walls, concrete stairwells, flickering lights.
*   **Combat Damage:** Environments show progressive destruction—bullet holes, broken walls, blood trails, bodies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A narrow apartment hallway in a slum tenement building. Flickering fluorescent lights, peeling wallpaper, doors broken off hinges. Bullet holes in walls. A body slumped in the corner. Debris scattered across the stained carpet."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, practical lighting—flickering fluorescents, bare bulbs, dawn light through grimy windows.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, creating hiding spots but also claustrophobic darkness.
*   **Combat Lighting:** Flash of gunfire, sparks from metal on metal, harsh shadows from overhead lights.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a single flickering fluorescent tube on the ceiling, casting harsh overhead shadows. Dust particles visible in the light beam. The fighter's face is half in shadow, sweat reflecting the harsh light."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Tight framing emphasizing the claustrophobic environment. Action shots use motion blur and dynamic angles.
*   **Techniques:** Over-the-shoulder shots in narrow corridors, low angles showing multiple floors of stairwells, first-person perspective for visceral combat.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot looking up a concrete stairwell, showing five floors of stairs spiraling upward. A fighter climbs while criminals lean over railings above, creating a gauntlet. Harsh shadows and fluorescent light tubes create geometric patterns."

## Voice

A terse, urgent voice with rapid, clipped pacing like tactical communications. The tone is professional but stressed, conveying danger and immediacy. There's heavy breathing and background noise—distant gunfire, screams, alarms. Audio quality is close and intimate, like comms radio with occasional static. Role: Tactical team leader, mission updates, or the building's hostile announcements.

## Music & Sound Design

*   **Combat Themes:** Pulsing electronic bass with Indonesian percussion elements, building intensity during fights.
*   **Tension Music:** Droning bass tones, irregular percussion like heartbeats, building dread during exploration.
*   **Silence:** Strategic use of silence broken by sudden violence.
*   **Sound Effects:** The brutal impact of strikes (bone-crunching, body hits), gunfire echoing in confined spaces, breaking glass and drywall, heavy breathing, the distinctive *swish* of machetes, creaking stairwells, distant screams and chaos from other floors, alarm bells.
