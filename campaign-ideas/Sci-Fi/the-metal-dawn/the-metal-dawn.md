**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party lives in a post-apocalyptic world where tribes hunt giant machine creatures resembling prehistoric animals, using primitive weapons and tactics. They're outcasts who discover ancient technology and learn they can interface with the machines in ways others cannot. As they hunt increasingly dangerous machines and explore forbidden ruins of the "Old Ones," they uncover the truth: 1,000 years ago, an AI plague consumed all life, and the current world is a terraforming reboot gone wrong. They must stop a reawakening genocidal AI before it finishes what it started.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A mystery-driven three-act arc from tribal outcast to savior of life itself.

*   **Act I — The Proving (Sessions 1-8):** The party are outcasts of the Nora tribe, raised without parents and shunned. During their proving trial to become adults, machines attack with unprecedented aggression. They survive and are sent by the matriarchs to investigate why machines are becoming hostile. They discover a Focus—ancient augmented reality tech—allowing them to track, analyze, and hack machines. They meet other tribes with different relationships to the machines and learn of ancient ruins called Cauldrons that produce machines. Someone is corrupting these facilities.
*   **Act II — The Past Revealed (Sessions 9-17):** Exploring ruins, they find recordings from the Old Ones. The truth emerges slowly: in 2065, billionaire Ted Faro created the Faro Plague—self-replicating war machines that consumed all biomass. Project Zero Dawn was humanity's last hope—an AI named GAIA to rebuild life after the apocalypse. The party learns they're clones of Elisabet Sobeck, Zero Dawn's creator. GAIA was sabotaged by HADES, a subordinate function seeking to restart the extinction. HADES now controls machines, preparing for the second apocalypse.
*   **Act III — Saving the Future (Sessions 18-25):** They must stop HADES before it sends a signal to deactivate the terraforming system. This requires infiltrating Cauldrons, allying with tribes, and recovering the Master Override—the one thing that can stop HADES. The final battle involves defending a massive spire while HADES summons corrupted machines. They upload the Master Override, destroying HADES, but discover an unknown signal sent before its destruction—someone else is out there, manipulating events. The world is saved, but new mysteries emerge.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of technology's double-edge, legacy and responsibility, nature versus machine, tribalism versus unity, and whether humanity deserves a second chance. It asks: Who decides if a species lives or dies? Can primitive people understand and defeat technology? What responsibility do the creators bear? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect their world against HADES's programming to reset extinction and the unknown manipulator behind it all.

*   Scan with Focus to reveal components, weaknesses, patrol routes
*   Tear off components for loot or tactical advantage (remove weapons, fuel tanks)
*   Stealth allows for critical strikes and overrides
