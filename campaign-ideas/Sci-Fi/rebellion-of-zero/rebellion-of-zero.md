*A Strategic Rebellion / Mecha Warfare campaign — Long Campaign (14–17 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Rebellion of Zero
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Strategic Rebellion / Mecha Combat / Political Intrigue / Tragic Kingship
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 14–17 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **14–16**
**Tone (keywords):** strategic chess games, Geass mind control, "all hail Lelouch!", Black Knights rebellion, sacrificial kingship, "the only ones who should kill are those prepared to be killed"
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party joins the Black Knights—a resistance movement led by the masked revolutionary Zero, fighting to liberate Japan from the Holy Britannian Empire. Zero is actually Lelouch vi Britannia, an exiled prince with the power of Geass—absolute obedience through eye contact. As they pilot Knightmare mechs in strategic battles, they watch Lelouch sacrifice everything—his identity, morality, loved ones—to create a better world through increasingly ruthless means. It's a story about whether revolution justifies any cost, and if the end truly justifies the means.

*   **Investigation:** Political intrigue, double agents, navigating Britannian nobility and resistance factions.
