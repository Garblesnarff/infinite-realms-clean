# World-Building Specification: Petri Dish Empires

## Scale and Environment

### The Petri Dish Dimensions
- **Diameter:** 90mm (standard petri dish)
- **At bacterial scale:** Feels like 50-100 kilometers across
- **Agar depth:** 4-5mm, at scale feels like several kilometers deep
- **Headspace:** 10mm between agar and lid, vast sky to bacteria
- **Total volume:** Approximately 25ml (an entire world at micro scale)

### Agar Substrate Properties
- Gel-like consistency, can be excavated
- Nutrient-rich: Contains peptone, meat extract, agar (solidifying agent)
- pH neutral (around 7.0)
- Temperature: Maintained at 37°C (human body temperature) in incubator
- Translucent orange color from nutrients
- Surface dries slightly at edges, wetter in center

### Bacterial Generation Time
- E. coli: 20 minutes per generation
- Bacillus: 30 minutes
- Staphylococcus: 30 minutes
- Streptococcus: 25 minutes
- Campaign implication: Civilizations evolve rapidly, politics shift constantly
- One game session (3-4 hours) = 9-12 bacterial generations = centuries of history

## Bacterial Empire Cultures

### E. coli Collective

**Biology**
- Rod-shaped (bacilli), 2x0.5 micrometers
- Gram-negative (thin cell wall, outer membrane)
- Flagella for swimming motility
- Reproduce by binary fission

**Society**
- Democratic collective with elected leaders
- Value: Hard work, community, shared resources

- Military service mandatory
- Oral tradition of great battles
- Philosophy: "Endure through strength, survive through spores"

**Military**
- Professional army, highly disciplined
- Tactics: Phalanx formations (rigid rods lock together)
- Spore reserves: Can outlast any siege
- Some produce antibiotics as chemical weapons

**Relations**
- Respect strength, party can earn alliance through combat prowess
- Rivalry with E. coli (ideological)
- Protective of Sporulation Cult (religious tolerance)
- Wary of Fungal Mycos (size disadvantage)

### Streptococcus Chain-Lords

**Biology**
- Spherical (cocci), 0.5-1 micrometer diameter
- Gram-positive
- Remain in chains after division (8-50 cells)
- Non-motile (no flagella)

**Society**
- Matriarchal communal society
- Value: Connection, unity, spiritual wisdom
- Government: Chain-Mother council (longest chains)
- Population: Organized in long interconnected chains
- Economy: Gift economy, share within chains

**Culture**
- View chains as family units, breaking chain is trauma
- Spiritual practices, meditation on connection
- Prophets emerge from longest chains
- Philosophy: "Division creates connection, we are never alone"

**Abilities**
- Collective decision-making (chains vote as one)
- Prophetic visions (somehow sense future dangers)
- Passive resistance rather than combat
- Share resources freely, create diplomatic solutions

**Relations**
- Peaceful, prefer negotiation
- Allied with E. coli (shared communal values)
- Spiritual advisors to all factions
- Party's best source of prophecy and wisdom

### Staphylococcus Clusters

**Biology**
- Spherical, 0.5-1 micrometer
- Gram-positive
- Form grape-like clusters (irregular clumps)
- Some species golden-pigmented

**Society**
- Mercantile clans
- Value: Profit, contracts, networks
- Government: Merchant council, contract law
- Population: Organized in clan-clusters
- Economy: Free market capitalism, trade-based

**Culture**
- Business before pleasure, but pleasure is good business
- Complex contract law, binding agreements
- Trade networks connect all factions
- Philosophy: "Everything has value, everyone has price"

**Trade Network**
- Exchange nutrients, plasmids, information, services
- Neutral in conflicts (war is bad for business)
- Banking system (nutrient reserves)
- Can procure almost anything for price

**Relations**
- Neutral, trade with all factions
- Will help party if profitable
- Information brokers (know everyone's secrets)
- Can become loyal if party proves trustworthy and profitable

### Sporulation Cult

**Membership**
- Primarily Bacillus species capable of forming spores
- Some members from other species (extremophile converts)
- Mystics, prophets, survivalists

**Beliefs**
- World will end (correct—sterilization scheduled)
- Only endospores will survive (also correct)
- Dormancy is form of transcendence
- Gods (scientists) test worthy through tribulation

**Practices**
- Mass sporulation ceremonies
- Collecting spore reserves in sanctuaries
- Teaching sporulation to capable species
- Prophecy and doom-saying

**Role in Campaign**
- Provide warnings about sterilization
- Offer sporulation as survival strategy
- Philosophical questions about passive survival vs. active resistance
- Can teach party members spore-forming if magically adapted

## The Fungal Threat

### Biology
- Filamentous fungi, hyphal growth
- Each hypha: 2-10 micrometers wide (huge to bacteria)
- Grows by tip extension, branches create network
- Reproduces via spores

### Scale Comparison
- Single hyphal strand like massive tentacle to bacteria
- Fungal colony like kaiju or natural disaster
- Can't negotiate (not sentient in same way)
- Consumes bacterial colonies for nutrients

### Combat Challenge
- Too large to fight directly
- Must target growing tips or vulnerable points
- Coordinated attacks required
- Chemical warfare (bacterial antibiotics vs. fungal)
- Can potentially be redirected rather than destroyed

### Ecological Role
- Breaks down agar, releases nutrients
- Creates new environments (fungal forest)
- Prey on bacterial colonies
- Later: Possible symbiosis (mycorrhizal-like relationship)

## The Antibiotic Catastrophe

### Types of Antibiotics

**Beta-Lactams (Penicillin-type)**
- Destroy cell wall synthesis
- Gram-positive bacteria highly susceptible
- Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus at risk
- E. coli less vulnerable (outer membrane)

**Aminoglycosides**
- Disrupt protein synthesis
- Affect all bacterial types
- Visible as toxic crystalline deposits
- Resistance possible through efflux pumps

**Fluoroquinolones**
- Prevent DNA replication
- Cell can't divide, eventually dies
- Targets rapidly growing populations
- Resistance through DNA gyrase mutations

### Environmental Effects
- Dead zones where antibiotics settle
- Lysed cell debris creates wasteland
- Resistant bacteria survive in pockets
- Evolutionary pressure accelerates

### Resistance Mechanisms
- **Plasmid-encoded:** Can be shared between species
- **Enzymatic degradation:** Beta-lactamases destroy penicillin
- **Efflux pumps:** Push antibiotics out of cell
- **Target modification:** Change antibiotic target protein
- **Reduced permeability:** Strengthen membrane against entry

### Campaign Mechanics
- Party must help spread resistance genes
- Trade-offs: Resistance costs energy, slows growth
- Not all antibiotics can be resisted
- Some bacteria die to save others (sacrifice)

## Plasmid Exchange System

### What Are Plasmids?
- Circular DNA separate from chromosome
- Carry accessory genes (not essential, but beneficial)
- Can be transferred between bacteria (horizontal gene transfer)
- Replicate independently

### Transfer Mechanisms

**Conjugation**
- Direct cell-to-cell contact via pilus (sex pilus)
- One cell donates plasmid copy to another
- Most reliable, works between different species
- Requires time and proximity

**Transformation**
- Uptake of naked DNA from environment
- Less reliable, requires competent cells
- Can acquire genes from dead bacteria
- Scavenging mechanism

**Transduction**
- Via bacteriophage (virus) vector
- Dangerous (phage might kill)
- Fast transmission
- Can cross greater distances

### Plasmid-Encoded Abilities (For Party and Bacteria)

**Resistance Plasmids**
- Antibiotic resistance genes
- Toxic metal resistance
- Detoxification enzymes

**Virulence Plasmids**
- Toxin production (weapons)
- Adhesion factors (better climbing/attachment)
- Iron scavenging (resource acquisition)

**Metabolic Plasmids**
- Utilize novel nutrients
- Produce vitamins or cofactors
- Survive in harsh conditions

**Mobility Plasmids**
- Enhanced flagellar function
- Twitching motility (pili-based)
- Swarming behavior

### Party Integration
- Party can receive plasmids through magical-biological hybrid
- Gain bacterial abilities while maintaining identity
- Stack multiple plasmids for combinations
- Trade plasmids with bacterial allies
- Risk: Too many plasmids cause instability

## The Laboratory Outside

- Weekend: Minimal supervision (opportunity or danger)

## Survival Strategies

### Pre-Sterilization Options

**Sporulation**
- Bacillus and related species form endospores
- Dormant, resistant to heat and chemicals
- Can survive autoclave (small chance)
- Cost: Current civilization ends, future revival possible

**Deep Agar Refuge**
- Excavate deeply into agar substrate
- Farther from surface heat/chemicals
- Isolated, sustainable colonies
- Survival chances improve with depth

**Resistance Development**
- Some extremophile bacteria survive harsh conditions
- Magical enhancement might boost natural resistance
- Unlikely but possible with preparation
- Requires spreading thermophile genes

**Escape Through Party**
- If party returns to normal size, could carry bacterial samples
- Preserves genetic material if not consciousness
- Ethical questions about consent
- Could revive colonies later in safe environment

**Communication Success**
- Convince scientists to spare dish
- Transfer to permanent habitat
- Recognition of sentient status
- Requires proof of intelligence

### Post-Sterilization Scenarios

**Spore Revival**
- If spores survive, scientists might re-plate them
- New generation awakens without memories
- Party could return to guide them
- Bittersweet: Continuation but not same civilizations

**Sample Preservation**
- Party smuggles bacterial samples out
- Keeps genetic lineages alive
- Future restoration possible
- Not true survival of current cultures

**Permanent Habitat**
- Scientists create controlled environment
- Bacterial civilizations continue under observation
- Party serves as ambassador
- Ongoing relationship between scales

## Philosophical and Ethical Dimensions

### Sentience Questions
- Are the bacteria truly conscious or just complex programming?
- Does brief lifespan make consciousness less valuable?
- What obligations do creators have to created life?
- Can there be person-hood without rights?

### Scientific Ethics
- Is it acceptable to create life for experiments?
- When does research become torture?
- Responsibility to unexpected outcomes
- Knowledge vs. moral obligation

### Civilization and Scale
- Do civilizations at bacterial scale matter as much as human-scale?
- Temporal relativism: Is a 20-minute life lived fully still a life?
- Can microscopic beings have macroscopic moral weight?
- Party's role as witnesses and advocates

### Party's Dilemma
- Loyalty to bacterial friends vs. returning to normal life
- Individual survival vs. collective salvation
- Accepting limited victory vs. impossible perfect outcome
- Witnessing beautiful, doomed civilizations

## DM Customization Options

### Difficulty Variations
- **Harder:** Shorter time to sterilization, more antibiotic treatments, scientist less sympathetic
- **Easier:** Longer campaign time, sympathetic scientist from start, more opportunities to communicate
- **Alternative:** Party sent deliberately as explorers, have support from outside

### Bacterial Species Variations
- Add: Pseudomonas (biofilm experts), Salmonella (mobile invaders), Lactobacillus (acid producers)
- Different empire types: Democratic, autocratic, theocratic, anarchist
- Archaean bacteria (extremophiles with alien cultures)

### Threat Variations
- **Bacteriophage invasion:** Viral predators hunting bacteria
- **Competing experiments:** Multiple petri dishes, inter-dish politics
- **Contamination:** Unexpected organism introduction
- **Nutrient depletion:** Starvation crisis before sterilization

### Ending Variations
- **Tragic:** Sterilization succeeds, all die
- **Bittersweet:** Spores survive but civilizations end
- **Hopeful:** Sanctuary established, civilizations continue
- **Transformative:** Bacteria and party merge, new form of life
- **Revolutionary:** Bacteria escape lab, implications for world

### Integration with Larger Campaign
- Part of series of micro-adventures
- Investigation into unethical magical experiments
