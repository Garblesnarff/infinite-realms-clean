# The Endless Storm
*When the winds never cease, heroes must ride the tempest*

## Campaign Overview

The Endless Storm began three months ago when the Windcaller's Spire, an ancient weather control tower built by storm giants millennia past, was accidentally reactivated by treasure hunters. Now, a perpetual superstorm circles the continent, spawning devastating tornadoes, lightning strikes that crack mountains, and hurricane-force winds that have already destroyed dozens of coastal cities. The storm grows stronger each day, feeding on magical ley lines as it spirals inward toward the heart of civilization.

The party must become storm chasers extraordinaire, tracking tornado patterns, rescuing survivors from devastated towns, discovering the secrets of ancient storm giant technology, and ultimately finding a way to either shut down the Windcaller's Spire or redirect the storm's fury before it consumes the entire world. But they're not alone in their quest—rival factions seek to weaponize the storm, cultists worship it as divine judgment, and the awakened consciousness within the storm itself has its own terrifying agenda.

Time is running out. The eye of the storm is shrinking, concentrating its power. In forty days, meteorologists predict the Convergence—when all the storm's power focuses on a single point, creating a world-ending vortex that will tear the material plane apart.

## Core Themes

- **Man vs. Nature**: The raw, unstoppable power of weather and the hubris of trying to control it
- **Race Against Time**: Every day the storm grows stronger and the window for salvation narrows
- **Disaster Response**: Coordinating evacuations, rescue operations, and emergency relief
- **Scientific Investigation**: Studying weather patterns, ancient technology, and magical meteorology
- **Moral Complexity**: Choosing between saving individuals and saving the world, deciding who gets rescued when resources are limited

**Lightning Strike Random Events**
- Every hour in storm zones, roll d20
- 1-2: Lightning strike near party (Dex save or 4d6 lightning damage)
- 3-5: NPC struck (dramatic injury/death)
- 6-10: Equipment hit (random item damaged)
- 11-15: Environmental—tree/building struck
- 16-20: Beneficial—lightning charges magical items

**Wind Speed Combat Modifier**
- Light winds (10-25 mph): Disadvantage on ranged attacks over 60 feet
- Strong winds (26-50 mph): Difficult terrain for movement, ranged attacks at disadvantage
- Severe winds (51-100 mph): Strength saves to stay upright, no ranged attacks
- Hurricane winds (100+ mph): Cannot move against wind, must seek shelter immediately
- Tornado (200+ mph): Special encounter rules, survival-focused

**Pressure System**
- Barometric pressure affects spellcasting
- Low pressure zones: Storm/lightning spells empowered (+1 spell level)
- High pressure zones: Fire/heat spells dampened (save DC -2)
