### Core Premise
Tomoya is a delinquent human fighter who has given up on life, drifting through his days at the academy with his friend Sunohara. Everything changes when he meets Nagisa, a fragile girl repeating her final year due to illness, trying to restart the school's drama club. As he helps her achieve her dream, he meets other students facing their own struggles and slowly rediscovers purpose and connection. He falls in love with Nagisa, and their high school romance becomes a life-changing journey. But this is only the beginning—the campaign continues beyond graduation into marriage, family, and tragedy, all while a parallel supernatural story unfolds about a lonely girl and a junk doll in an illusionary world. The town itself grants wishes to those who help others, and Tomoya's ultimate wish will determine everything.

### Story Arc

**PART ONE: Academy Days (Sessions 1-12)**

**Act 1: Meeting Under the Cherry Blossoms (Sessions 1-4)**
- Tomoya meets Nagisa and decides to help her restart the drama club. He meets other struggling students: Kyou and Ryou (twin sisters with romance troubles), Kotomi (a genius isolated by loss), Tomoyo (a fighter trying to protect the town's trees), and Fuko (a girl trying to help her sister's wedding who might not be physically present). Helping each girl resolves their story arc and earns a "light orb" (a manifestation of the town's gratitude).

**Act 2: The Drama Festival (Sessions 5-8)**
- The drama club prepares for the school festival. Nagisa's health is precarious. Tomoya learns about her tragic past—an accident when her parents prioritized their careers over her, causing permanent weakness and a mystical connection to the town. They confess their feelings during the festival.

**Act 3: Family and Future (Sessions 9-12)**
- Meet the parents: Nagisa's wonderfully supportive parents, and Tomoya's broken relationship with his father. Reconciliation arc. Graduation. Tomoya and Nagisa decide on their future together.

**PART TWO: After Story (Sessions 13-25)**

**Act 4: Adult Life (Sessions 13-18)**
- Marriage, finding work, building a life. Nagisa becomes pregnant. Joy and anticipation. But her health deteriorates. Tragic childbirth: Nagisa dies delivering their daughter Ushio. Tomoya breaks completely, abandoning his daughter to Nagisa's parents and falling into despair for five years.

**Act 5: Redemption (Sessions 19-23)**
- Forced reconnection with Ushio, now five years old. Slow rebuilding of the father-daughter relationship. Learning to live for her, finding purpose again. Growing close. Happiness returning.

**Act 6: The Illusionary World and the Wish (Sessions 24-25)**
- The parallel story resolves: the lonely girl in the illusionary world was Ushio all along, and the junk doll was Tomoya. The light orbs collected throughout the campaign represent the town's gratitude for helping others. As Ushio falls ill with the same condition that killed Nagisa, Tomoya faces losing her too. The town offers him a miracle: he has earned enough light orbs to make a wish. In the climactic moment, time resets—Nagisa survives childbirth, Ushio is born healthy, and they live together as a family. The campaign ends with Tomoya, Nagisa, and Ushio under cherry blossoms, grateful for their miracle.

### Major NPCs

- **Nagisa Furukawa, the Fragile Dreamer**: A kind human cleric weak from illness, dreams of drama club. **Role**: Love Interest / Heart. **Personality**: Gentle, determined despite fragility, loves her family deeply. **Flaw/Secret**: Her life is connected to the town itself; if the town suffers, she suffers.
- **Tomoya Okazaki, the Delinquent**: A cynical fighter who has given up. **Role**: Protagonist. **Personality**: Sarcastic, aimless, but kind underneath. **Flaw/Secret**: Broken relationship with father, injured shoulder from their fight, uses cynicism to avoid connection.

### Key Locations

- **The Academy**: Where the story begins. The cherry blossom path where Tomoya meets Nagisa.
- **Furukawa Bakery**: A warm, welcoming family home and bakery. Central gathering place.
- **The Town**: A living entity that grants wishes to those who bring happiness to others.
- **The Illusionary World**: A parallel dimension where a lonely girl and a junk doll exist in endless winter, gradually collecting light orbs.

### Central Conflict
Can connection and family heal a broken soul? Is it worth loving people even when you might lose them? The struggle between despair and hope, isolation and family.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Light Orb Collection**: Every time the players help someone resolve their personal crisis (each heroine's arc, helping townspeople), they earn a light orb. Track these secretly. They're the currency for the final miracle.
- **The Illusionary World Interludes**: Periodically between sessions, describe scenes of the lonely girl and junk doll in the winter world collecting light orbs. Players won't understand until the end.
- **The Town's Health**: The town itself is a character. When people are happy and helping each other, the town thrives. When people suffer, the town suffers. Nagisa's health is tied to this.
- **Time Skip Mechanics**: The campaign jumps years between graduation and adult life. Use montages and narrative summary with key moment roleplay.
- **The Miracle Choice**: At the climax, offer Tomoya the choice to use the light orbs for a miracle—to reset time and save Nagisa, or accept the tragedy. The correct choice (mechanically requiring enough orbs from helping others) grants the happy ending.
