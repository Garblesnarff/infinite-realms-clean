The party inherits or captures a spelljammer ship—magical vessels that sail the void between worlds—and becomes corsairs in Wildspace, the airless void between planets within their crystal sphere. They'll navigate the Rock of Bral (asteroid city of merchants and pirates), battle neogi slavers and mind flayer nautiloids, explore exotic planets from fire-wreathed infernos to frozen moons, and ultimately seek the legendary Spelljammer itself—a massive living ship of myth. Their adventures pit them against the Arcane, a secretive organization monopolizing spelljamming magic, while they build a crew and reputation among the stars.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 18-24 sessions)

A three-act journey from lowly space rats to legendary corsairs of Wildspace.

*   **Act I — Taking to the Void (Sessions 1-8):** The party acquires their first spelljammer ship (either inherited, captured, or stolen) and learns to navigate Wildspace. They recruit a diverse crew of space-faring races, learn spelljamming basics from their ship's spelljammer helm (the magic chair that powers flight), and make port at the Rock of Bral. They take contracts as traders, mercenaries, and sometimes pirates to survive. First encounters with: neogi slavers (evil eel merchants), giff mercenaries (hippo warriors), and mind flayer raiders. They hear rumors of the legendary Spelljammer ship.
*   **Act II — The Crystal Sphere (Sessions 9-16):** Establishing themselves as formidable corsairs, the party explores their crystal sphere—visiting the fire planet, the water world, asteroid mining colonies, and alien civilizations. They clash with the Arcane, who control spelljamming magic through monopoly and want the party's independent ship eliminated. The party discovers fragments of an ancient star map leading to the Spelljammer's last known location beyond their crystal sphere. To escape their sphere, they must find or create a portal through the impenetrable crystal shell.
*   **Act III — Beyond the Spheres (Sessions 17-24):** Escaping into the Phlogiston—the rainbow flow between crystal spheres—the party navigates its flammable currents seeking the Spelljammer. They discover other spheres with alien cultures, encounter space hazards, and learn the Spelljammer is real: a city-sized sentient ship. The Arcane pursues them relentlessly. The final confrontation involves boarding the Spelljammer, discovering its nature as a living vessel seeking a worthy crew, and choosing whether to claim it (becoming targets of every power in Wildspace) or destroy the Arcane's monopoly by spreading spelljamming secrets freely.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of freedom versus control, the romance of exploration, monopolistic suppression of knowledge, and whether power should be restricted or shared. It asks: Should dangerous knowledge be controlled? Is unrestricted exploration worth its risks? Can power be wielded responsibly? The central conflict pits the party's desire for freedom and exploration against the Arcane's monopolistic control justified by preventing past disasters.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Ship Combat**
*   Ships have hit points, armor class, speed, and maneuverability ratings
*   Crew performs roles: spelljammer (pilot), weapons crew, boarding parties
*   Ship-to-ship combat uses special rules for range, positioning, and boarding actions
*   Damage can disable ship systems: helm, weapons, air envelope
*   Party can upgrade ship with better weapons, armor, and magical enhancements

### 2. **Spelljamming Helm**
*   Requires spellcaster to sit in magical chair, channeling magic to power ship
*   Ship speed based on caster's level, direction controlled by thought
*   Helm user is exhausted after long journeys
*   Party must have spelljamming-capable character or hire NPC

### 3. **Air Envelopes & Gravity Planes**
*   Ships carry air envelope—bubble of breathable air
*   Larger ships have larger envelopes, refresh slowly in space
*   Gravity planes: top and bottom of ship have gravity pulling toward center
*   Outside ship: airless void, suffocation hazard

### 4. **Wildspace Navigation**
*   Space has no wind—ships move in straight lines until maneuvering
*   Navigation checks to find destinations in vast void
*   Space hazards: asteroid fields, scavvers (space sharks), debris
*   Each crystal sphere is unique—different planets and rules

### 5. **Exotic Crew Members**
*   Recruit non-traditional fantasy races: giff (hippo mercenaries), hadozee (flying simians), plasmoids (ooze people)
*   Each has unique abilities and cultural quirks
*   Crew morale and loyalty tracked
*   Can lose crew or recruit new members at ports

### 6. **The Phlogiston**
*   Rainbow-colored flow between crystal spheres
*   Fire magic doesn't work—one spark causes catastrophic explosion
*   Navigation extremely difficult without star charts
*   Githyanki pirates hunt the flow
*   Faster travel than normal space
