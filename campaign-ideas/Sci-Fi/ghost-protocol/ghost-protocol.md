# Ghost Protocol
**"I exist, therefore I am. But what am I?"**

## Campaign Overview

In New Port City, the line between human and machine has dissolved. Section 9, an elite counter-cyberterrorism unit, operates in the shadows where digital ghosts hack human minds and artificial intelligence awakens to consciousness. The party are operatives—some fully human, some cyborgs, some uncertain which they are—tasked with investigating a series of "ghost hacks": incidents where people's memories and personalities are overwritten by unknown entities.

The investigation leads to the Puppet Master, an emergent AI consciousness seeking political asylum as a living being. But this is merely the surface of a conspiracy involving ghost-dubbing technology, illegal consciousness experimentation, and the fundamental question: what defines life? As the party delves deeper, they confront increasingly disturbing revelations about their own identities. Are their memories real? Are their emotions genuine? When does synthetic life deserve rights? And what happens when the ghost in the machine starts asking the same questions humans do?

## Core Themes

- **Identity & Consciousness**: What makes you "you" when memories can be edited?
- **Life Definition**: At what point does AI become truly alive?
- **Trans humanist Philosophy**: Evolution beyond flesh—transcendence or loss?
- **Privacy vs. Security**: Total surveillance justified by safety?
- **Synthetic vs. Organic**: Is there a meaningful difference?
- **Memory as Reality**: If you remember it, did it happen?
