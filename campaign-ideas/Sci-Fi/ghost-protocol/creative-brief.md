# Ghost Protocol - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic
- Futuristic Tokyo meets noir detective
- Blue-purple color palette with neon accents
- Rain-soaked cityscapes, endless urban sprawl
- Thermoptic camouflage effects (water-like distortion)
- Digital overlay effects (AR glasses perspective)

## Music Direction
- Melancholic electronic (Kenji Kawai's Ghost in the Shell OST)
- Traditional Japanese instruments mixed with synth
- Tension-building ambient for philosophical scenes
- Action sequences: Aggressive electronic beats
- Ending themes: Haunting vocals questioning existence

## Voice Acting
- **Motoko**: Emotionless exterior hiding existential dread (Scarlett Johansson energy)
- **Batou**: Gruff loyalty, working-class hero (masculine but sensitive)
- **Puppet Master**: Calm, logical, eerily persuasive AI (HAL 9000 meets curious child)
- **Aramaki**: Wise elderly statesman, political savvy

## Cinematic Moments
- Opening: Thermoptic assassination in rain (iconic)
- Ghost Hacking: Visual representation of consciousness intrusion
- Net Diving: Abstract digital landscapes (Tron meets Matrix)
- Identity Crisis: Mirror scenes showing duplicates, questioning which is real
- Merge Sequence: Bodies dissolving into data, reforming as hybrid entity
