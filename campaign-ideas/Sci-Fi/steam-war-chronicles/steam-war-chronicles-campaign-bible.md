# Steam War Chronicles [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi (Steampunk/Dieselpunk)]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
Centuries after the cataclysmic "Great Steam War" reshaped the continents and plunged the world into a perpetual industrial twilight, humanity clings to survival within colossal, steam-powered city-states. These bastions of clockwork and brass are locked in a ceaseless struggle for dwindling resources – coal, water, and rare aether-crystals. Rival factions, from aristocratic engineers to working-class revolutionaries, battle for control of ancient, powerful steam-tech relics and the secrets of the pre-War era. The players are mercenaries, inventors, or freedom fighters navigating this smog-choked, gear-driven world, seeking to uncover the truth behind the Great Steam War and forge a new future amidst the clanking, hissing ruins of the past.

## Setting [SETTING: Industrial Post-Apocalypse]
The world is a vast, scarred landscape dominated by the perpetual smog and clanking machinery of a bygone era. Continents are fractured, oceans are choked with industrial waste, and the sky is often obscured by the exhaust of countless steam engines. Gigantic, mobile city-states, powered by colossal boilers and intricate clockwork, traverse the desolate plains, while airships ply the smoky skies. The aesthetic is a blend of Victorian-era industrialism, dieselpunk grit, and post-apocalyptic decay, where every piece of technology is a precious, hard-won relic.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **Ironclad City (The Cog):** [LOCATION: City-State] A massive, mobile city-state built around a colossal, ancient steam engine. It is a hub of industry and military power, ruled by a council of powerful engineers and industrialists. Its lower levels are a sprawling, dangerous slum.
*   **Aetherium (The Crystal Spire):** [LOCATION: Research Hub] A floating city-state, powered by rare aether-crystals, dedicated to scientific research and the development of advanced steam-tech. It is a beacon of knowledge but also a target for those seeking its secrets.
*   **The Rusting Wastes:** [LOCATION: Wasteland] The vast, desolate plains between the city-states, littered with the skeletal remains of pre-War machinery and choked with perpetual rust-storms. It's a dangerous place, home to scavengers and mutated creatures.
*   **The Sunken City of Brass:** [LOCATION: Ruined City] The partially submerged ruins of a pre-War metropolis, now a dangerous underwater labyrinth. It is rumored to hold vast amounts of intact steam-tech and the secrets of the Great Steam War.
*   **The Sky-Pirate Haven (Cloud's Edge):** [LOCATION: Criminal Hub] A hidden, mobile base of operations for airship pirates, often located within dense cloud formations or atop remote, inaccessible plateaus. It's a lawless zone for trade and illicit dealings.

## Factions [FACTION: Political]
*   **The Ironclad Hegemony:** [FACTION: Militaristic Government] The dominant military and industrial power, ruling Ironclad City. They believe in expansion through force and control of resources, viewing other city-states as rivals or subordinates.

*   **The Gear-Grinders Union:** [FACTION: Labor Movement] A powerful, underground labor union representing the working class of the city-states. They fight for better conditions, fair wages, and often resort to sabotage or strikes to achieve their goals.
*   **The Sky-Corsairs:** [FACTION: Criminal Syndicate] Independent airship pirates who prey on trade routes, raid city-states, and operate outside the law. They are opportunistic and fiercely independent, often selling their services to the highest bidder.
*   **The Clockwork Cult:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A secretive, radical cult that worships ancient clockwork mechanisms and believes the Great Steam War was a divine cleansing. They seek to awaken dormant pre-War automatons and usher in a new age of mechanical purity.
