**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the wild frontier of the Jura Tempest, monster tribes have lived in constant conflict for generations. When a mysterious slime entity named Rimuru gains consciousness and incredible absorption abilities, everything changes. The players, granted similar powers, must help unite these fractious monster races into a peaceful nation. They'll absorb abilities from defeated foes, broker alliances between traditional enemies, develop infrastructure, and defend their growing civilization against prejudiced human kingdoms and powerful demon lords. Success means creating a world where monsters and humans can truly coexist.
