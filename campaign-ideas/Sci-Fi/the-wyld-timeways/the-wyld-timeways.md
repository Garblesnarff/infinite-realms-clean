# The Wyld Timeways
**Tagline:** *"Be excellent to each other. And party on through time, dudes!"*

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers a magical time-traveling phone booth (or mystical portal shaped suspiciously like one) that allows them to journey to any point in history—but only for fun, educational, and excellent adventures. Unlike dark time travel campaigns focused on preventing apocalypses, this lighthearted romp emphasizes comedy, historical tourism, meeting legendary figures, and forming a rock band that transcends time itself.

When the party accidentally disrupts history during a joyride through time, they must fix their mistakes by recruiting historical heroes, forming the most excellent adventuring party ever assembled, and saving reality through the power of friendship, music, and radical time travel shenanigans. The campaign celebrates the joy of adventure, learning from history, and the totally excellent power of being kind to one another across all of time and space.

Inspired by Bill & Ted's optimistic time travel comedy, this campaign is perfect for groups wanting lighter tone while still engaging with time travel mechanics and historical settings.
