# Creative Brief: The Psionic Cataclysm

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cyberpunk Psychic Chaos (Akira-inspired)

Inspired by *Akira*, this style blends neon-soaked cyberpunk aesthetics with psychic energy visualization, urban destruction, and teenage rebellion. It aims to capture the anarchic energy of street gangs, the terror of uncontrolled power, and the apocalyptic beauty of reality-warping psychic abilities.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Neon and Destruction:** Bright neon lights contrast with urban decay and apocalyptic destruction.
*   **Detail Psychic Energy:** Make the invisible visible—psychic power appears as energy trails, auras, and reality distortions.
*   **Celebrate Chaos:** This is punk, rebellious, and destructive—composition should feel dynamic and explosive.
