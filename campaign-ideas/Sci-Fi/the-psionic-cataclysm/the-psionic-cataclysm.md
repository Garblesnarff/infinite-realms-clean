In Neo-Kingsport, a sprawling metropolis rebuilt after a catastrophic psychic explosion destroyed the old city thirty years ago, the party—members of a street-racing biker gang—discovers that their friend Ryder is developing terrifying psychic powers similar to those that caused the original disaster. When government agents kidnap Ryder to weaponize their powers, the party must navigate gang warfare, corporate conspiracies, and underground resistance to rescue them. But deep beneath the city, the original psychic—a being of god-like power named Akuma—is awakening, and only by mastering their own latent psychic abilities can the party prevent Neo-Kingsport from being destroyed a second time.

    *   The Meeting: The party confronts Akuma—not a monster, but a transcendent psychic entity beyond human comprehension.

### Session 12 — "Neo-Kingsport Dawn"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Aftermath
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Destruction Path: If the party stopped Akuma, the city is devastated but survives. Psychics are treated as heroes and threats. The party must decide what to do with their powers.
    *   The Evolution Path: If the party merged, a new form of consciousness is born—Akuma and all psychics become something beyond human. The city is transformed into something otherworldly.
    *   The Memorial: Either way, the cost is high. Many have died. The party mourns Ryder, who sacrificed themselves or transcended beyond recognition.

## Key Locations

1.  **Neo-Kingsport:** A sprawling cyberpunk metropolis built on the ruins of the old city—neon lights, hoverbike highways, corporate towers, and gang territory.

## Central Conflict

The external conflict is rescuing Ryder and preventing (or facilitating) Akuma's awakening. The internal conflict is the corrupting nature of psychic power—rage and fear make it stronger but more dangerous. The party must learn to control their powers without losing their humanity. The campaign explores themes of power, trauma, evolution, and whether humanity should transcend its violent nature or remain fundamentally human.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Psychic Power Track**

*   Party members develop psychic abilities throughout the campaign.
*   **Powers:** Telekinesis, telepathy, energy blast, psychic shield, reality warping (high level).
*   **Corruption:** Using powers in rage or fear causes corruption. High corruption leads to loss of control and destructive outbursts.

### 2. **Rage Amplification**

*   Psychic powers scale with emotional intensity.
*   **Mechanics:** When angry or afraid, powers are stronger but harder to control (advantage on damage, disadvantage on control checks).

### 3. **The Awakening Meter**

*   Tracks Akuma's approach to full consciousness.
*   **Effects:** As it rises, reality becomes more unstable—hallucinations, psychic storms, matter becoming mutable.

### 4. **Hoverbike Combat**

*   High-speed chase and combat encounters on futuristic motorcycles.
*   **Special Rules:** Pilot checks, ramming maneuvers, psychic attacks while driving.
