# Creative Brief: See You, Space Cowboy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Jazz Noir in Space (Cowboy Bebop meets Film Noir)

Inspired by 1970s jazz noir aesthetics, lived-in space sci-fi, and melancholic cool. This style blends smoky jazz clubs with neon-lit Mars cities, battered spaceships with sharp-dressed characters, and action with emotional weight. Colors are muted and stylish—browns, deep blues, neon accents. Character designs are iconic—long coats, stylish hair, perpetual cigarette smoke. Everything feels cool but sad, like the last set at a jazz club.

### Core Principles:

*   **Cool Melancholy:** Characters are stylish but hurting inside.
*   **Jazz Aesthetic:** Smoky, improvisational, with musical rhythm to action.
*   **Noir Lighting:** Deep shadows, neon lights, rain-slicked streets.

## Voice

A laid-back, cool voice—male, American, slightly raspy from cigarettes. The cadence is slow, almost lazy, with pauses suggesting weight and thought. Emotion is understated—grief hidden behind a smirk, pain masked by humor. References jazz, bounties, and the past with equal casualness. Audio has analog warmth—vinyl crackle, like old jazz recordings. Role: A bounty hunter narrating a job, philosophizing about the past, or delivering a final "Bang."
