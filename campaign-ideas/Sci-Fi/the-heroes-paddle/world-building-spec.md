**The Hero's Paddle**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Two childhood friends approach table tennis with opposite philosophies: one plays for pure joy, the other from obligation. As they progress through increasingly intense competition, they encounter players with different reasons for playing—duty, fear, pride, or love. Through victories and devastating losses, they must each answer: Why do you play? The campaign explores whether competition destroys or elevates joy, whether talent is burden or gift, and what it means to be a "hero" in sports.
