# One Year War

*A Political War Drama / Mecha Combat campaign — Long Campaign (16–20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** One Year War
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Political War Drama / Military Sci-Fi / Mecha Combat
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **15–17**
**Tone (keywords):** political intrigue, morally gray warfare, coming of age in war, loss of innocence, the cost of conflict, awakening powers, mobile suit combat
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party begins as soldiers or civilians caught in the devastating war between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon—a conflict fought with mobile suits (giant mechanized armor). As they pilot these machines of war, they witness atrocities on both sides, lose friends to senseless violence, and discover some among them are Newtypes—evolved humans with psychic abilities that make them ace pilots but also allow them to feel their enemies' deaths. The campaign explores whether war can ever be justified and whether understanding your enemy makes killing them harder or easier.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Mobile suit combat is tactical and lethal. Positioning, terrain, and resource management (fuel, ammunition) matter as much as damage. Ace pilots on both sides can end characters in single engagements.
*   **Investigation:** Players must navigate military intelligence, decipher political maneuvering between Earth and colonies, and understand what Newtypes truly are.
*   **Consequences:** War crimes occur on both sides. Friends die. Enemies have sympathetic motivations. The party's choices determine which atrocities they witness—or commit.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

A five-act arc following the One Year War from outbreak to bitter conclusion.

*   **Act I — Outbreak (Sessions 1–4):** War begins when Zeon declares independence and drops a colony on Earth, killing billions. The party chooses sides (or is forced to by circumstance) and experiences their first mobile suit combat. Innocence dies quickly.
*   **Act II — Escalation (Sessions 5–8):** The war intensifies. Both sides commit atrocities. The party becomes elite pilots, encounters their first Newtype enemy, and realizes the war has no clear heroes.
*   **Act III — Awakening (Sessions 9–12):** Newtype abilities manifest in some party members. They feel their enemies' fear and pain as they kill. A Newtype enemy becomes a recurring rival—someone they understand but must fight.
*   **Act IV — Operation British / Solomon (Sessions 13–16):** Major battles that turn the war. The party participates in fleet-scale combat, witnesses war crimes, and faces impossible moral choices. Their Newtype rival may defect or die tragically.
*   **Act V — A Baoa Qu / Resolution (Sessions 17–20):** The final space fortress battle. Both sides are exhausted. The party confronts enemy aces in duels where Newtype understanding makes every kill personal. The war ends not with victory but mutual exhaustion. Those who survive carry the weight of what they've done.

**Escalation:** Char (or the opposing faction's leader) is devastated by Lalah's death and swears revenge on the party.

### Session 13 — "The Texas Colony"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Ruins: The party investigates a destroyed colony where a battle occurred. Mobile suit wrecks and frozen corpses fill the void.
    *   Ghosts: Newtype party members experience psychic echoes—the final thoughts of the dead, replaying endlessly.
    *   Survivor: They find a shell-shocked enemy pilot hiding in the wreckage. The party decides whether to capture, kill, or help them.

### Session 20 — "War's End"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Aftermath
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Ceasefire: The war ends with Zeon's surrender (or Federation collapse, depending on the party's path). Both sides are devastated.
    *   Body Count: The party learns the final toll—half of humanity dead in one year.
    *   Return: Survivors return home to find cities destroyed, families gone, and no clear victory. Just exhaustion.
    *   The Warning: Newtype party members have a final vision—this war will repeat. Newtypes were supposed to bring understanding, but humanity isn't ready.

2.  **Solomon:** A massive asteroid fortress in space, site of brutal fleet battles and superweapon deployment.
3.  **Odessa:** Earth-based mining operation critical to Zeon's resources, site of combined-arms warfare.
4.  **Texas Colony:** A destroyed colony serving as a haunted battlefield filled with wreckage and ghosts.
5.  **A Baoa Qu:** Zeon's final fortress—a massive space station where the One Year War ends in apocalyptic battle.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is whether war can ever be justified when both sides commit atrocities, and whether understanding your enemy (through Newtype abilities) makes killing them harder or creates new justifications for violence. The party must navigate a morally gray war where innocence is the first casualty and survival requires compromise.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Mobile Suit Combat**

*   Tactical grid-based or theater-of-mind combat emphasizing positioning, ammunition management, and environmental hazards (gravity, debris fields, atmospheric entry).
*   **Fuel & Ammo:** Limited resources force strategic retreats and conservation.

### 2. **Newtype Abilities**

*   Characters can awaken as Newtypes, gaining psychic flashes (advantage on initiative, sense danger, feel enemy emotions).
*   **Empathic Burden:** Killing while using Newtype abilities forces the character to feel the victim's fear and pain.

### 3. **Ace Pilot Progression**

*   Characters gain ace skills (improved evasion, signature moves, rival duels) as they accumulate kills—but also PTSD and moral weight.

### 4. **Faction Reputation**

*   Actions affect how both factions view the party—hero, war criminal, or deserter. Reputation determines available missions and ultimate fate.

### 5. **War Crimes Tracker**

*   The campaign tracks atrocities committed by both sides. The party can prevent, participate in, or expose them—each choice has consequences.

---

## Themes

*   **Morally Gray Warfare:** Neither side is purely good or evil. Both commit atrocities. The party chooses the lesser evil—or rejects both.
*   **Loss of Innocence:** Young soldiers enter war idealistic and leave traumatized or dead.
*   **The Cost of Understanding:** Newtypes can understand their enemies' humanity—making every kill personal, not easier.
*   **Cycles of Violence:** The war ends but animosity remains. Newtypes were supposed to evolve humanity beyond war, but instead perfected it.
*   **Honorable Enemies:** Some foes are more admirable than allies. Respect and enmity coexist.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Survive the War:** Make it to the ceasefire alive—a pyrrhic victory given what was lost.
*   **Prevent a War Crime:** Stop a superweapon, massacre, or false-flag operation—save lives, earn enemies within your own faction.
*   **Achieve Newtype Understanding:** Establish psychic connection with an enemy Newtype, proving communication across battle lines is possible—changes the endgame.
*   **Defect:** Abandon both factions and fight to end the war itself—become hunted by both sides but maintain moral integrity.

---

## DM Guidance

*   **Moral Complexity:** Never present one side as purely heroic. Both Federation and Zeon commit war crimes. The party must choose which evils they can live with.
*   **Tactical Combat:** Mobile suit battles should feel strategic, not just HP attrition. Use terrain, cover, and resource management.
*   **Respect Loss:** When NPCs die, give them moments of dignity. Let the party mourn.
*   **Newtype Sensitivity:** Psychic abilities should feel like burdens, not superpowers. Feeling your enemy's fear as you kill them is horror, not advantage.
