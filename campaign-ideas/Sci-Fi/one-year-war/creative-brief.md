# Creative Brief: One Year War

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Military Sci-Fi Realism with Retro-Futuristic Mecha (Gundam Aesthetic)

Inspired by the grounded military aesthetic of real robot shows, the industrial design of 1970s-80s sci-fi, and the personal drama of war, this style creates a world where giant robots are weapons of war (not superheroes), space colonies are industrial environments, and battles leave scars. It aims to capture tactical mobile suit combat, the weight of political conflict, and the tragedy of young soldiers in an unjust war.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Military Realism:** Mobile suits should look like military hardware—functional, battle-damaged, painted in camouflage or unit colors.
*   **Retro-Futuristic Design:** Technology should feel analog—switches, dials, CRT monitors, physical controls. Grounded, not sleek.
*   **Human Cost:** Show pilots' exhaustion, damaged mobile suits with scarred armor, battlefields littered with wreckage.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Military realism, political drama, morally gray warfare, loss of innocence, tactical combat, Newtype awakening, honorable enemies, the cost of war.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of a rifle. The exhaustion after battle. The moment you realize your enemy is human too.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Mobile Suits:** Humanoid mecha 18-20 meters tall, mechanical and industrial. Visible panel lines, vents, thrusters. Designed like military vehicles, not sleek sports cars.
*   **Iconic Designs:** Gundam (white/blue/red/yellow, heroic), Zaku (green, mono-eye, mass-production), Gouf (melee specialist), Gelgoog (elite late-war).
*   **Textures:** Painted metal with chipped paint, carbon scoring from beam hits, dented armor from physical impacts, exposed hydraulics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A military illustration of a MS-06 Zaku II mobile suit in battle stance. Green and gray camouflage armor with visible panel lines. Single red mono-eye camera. Holding a 120mm machine gun. Battle-damaged with carbon scoring and dented chest armor. Standing in a debris field with smoke. Functional military design, not sleek."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Federation Mobile Suits:** White, blue, red, yellow (RX-78 Gundam), or olive drab for mass-production GMs.
*   **Zeon Mobile Suits:** Forest green, gray, desert tan (Zakus), purple/black (Doms), blue (Goufs)—military camouflage schemes.
*   **Space Battles:** Black void with stars, illuminated by orange explosions, blue beam fire, and pink mega-particle cannon blasts.
*   **Earth Battles:** Realistic environments—dusty deserts, industrial cities, green forests, all scarred by war.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of military olive drab green for the Zaku, with gray secondary panels and red mono-eye. The background is a dusty Earth battlefield under an overcast sky. Explosions cast orange light. Muted, realistic military colors, not vibrant or heroic."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Pilots:** Ages 16-25, wearing normal suits (space suits with helmets) or pilot jumpsuits. Exhausted expressions, thousand-yard stares, dirt and sweat.
*   **Amuro Ray:** Young, inexperienced teenager forced into war. Brown hair, wide eyes showing trauma and determination.
*   **Char Aznable:** Wears iconic red helmet and mask hiding his face. Gold trim on his red uniform. Always enigmatic.
*   **Military Uniforms:** Federation (Earth Federation Forces green/tan), Zeon (military gray/purple with Nazi-inspired aesthetics).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A young pilot, age 17, wearing an Earth Federation normal suit (white and gray space suit with helmet under arm). Messy dark hair, exhausted expression with dark circles under eyes. Standing in front of a damaged white Gundam mobile suit. Expression shows trauma and determination. Realistic military sci-fi character design."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Space Colonies:** Massive cylindrical habitats, O'Neill cylinders with cities inside. Industrial and populated, not pristine.
*   **Battleship Interiors:** Cramped corridors, CRT monitors, analog controls, harsh fluorescent lighting. Military functionality.
*   **Mobile Suit Hangars:** Industrial repair bays with gantries, welding sparks, mechanics working on damaged suits.
*   **Space Battlefields:** Debris fields of destroyed ships and mobile suits, asteroids, the black void illuminated by weapon fire.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a space battleship hangar bay. Industrial metal construction with gantries and scaffolding. A white RX-78 Gundam mobile suit being repaired by mechanics with welding torches (sparks flying). Cramped space with visible pipes and cables. Harsh overhead industrial lighting. Grounded military sci-fi aesthetic."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Space Battles:** High contrast—pure black space with bright weapon fire and explosions creating dramatic lighting.
*   **Colony Interiors:** Artificial daylight from the colony's axial light tube, creating a strange always-noon atmosphere.
*   **Earth Battles:** Natural lighting—harsh sun, overcast skies, dawn/dusk creating long shadows and dramatic silhouettes.
*   **Cockpit Lighting:** Green CRT glow illuminating pilot faces from below, creating dramatic shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the green glow of cockpit CRT displays illuminating the pilot's face from below, creating dramatic shadows. Outside the canopy, beam fire and explosions create flashes of pink and orange light against black space. High contrast lighting emphasizing the chaos of combat."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use dynamic angles for mobile suit combat—low shots emphasizing size, Dutch angles during chaos, wide shots showing tactical positioning.
*   **Techniques:** Show scale by including human figures near mobile suits. Use debris and smoke to frame action. Include damaged units in backgrounds to show cost of battle.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic wide shot of a space battle. Multiple mobile suits (Federation GMs in white, Zeon Zakus in green) engaged in combat across a debris field. Beam rifle fire (blue/pink) crisscrosses the frame. A destroyed battleship burns in the background. Composition shows the tactical positioning of units in three-dimensional space. Scale emphasized by tiny human figures evacuating in the distance."

## Voice

A voice of a young soldier (late teens to early twenties) who's seen too much too fast—speaking with exhausted professionalism that occasionally cracks into emotion. Neutral accent (American English or received pronunciation) suggesting military standardization. The pacing is steady but weary, with pauses suggesting dissociation or grief. Occasional technical military jargon ("enemy mobile suit at vector 180," "beam rifle charged"). Audio quality is clean but with slight radio static, as if transmitted from a mobile suit cockpit. Role: A pilot recording a after-action report, a testimony, or a message to command, knowing they must return to battle soon.

## Sound Design

*   **Mobile Suit Movement:** Heavy mechanical servos, hydraulic hisses, metal footfalls that shake the ground. Not agile—powerful and industrial.
*   **Beam Weapons:** High-pitched whine building to discharge, then a sharp CRACK of super-heated particles cutting through armor.
*   **Physical Weapons:** Machine guns with deep bass reports, heat axes crackling with energy, shields clanging against impacts.
*   **Explosions:** Deep bass rumbles for ship explosions, sharp cracks for mobile suit destruction, the sound of pressurized air escaping from breached cockpits.
*   **Newtype Flash:** A crystalline chime, like glass resonating—subtle but distinct, indicating psychic awareness.
*   **Alarms:** Klaxons and radar pings, calm computer voices announcing threats in Japanese-English hybrid ("Enemy mobile suit detected").

## Music Palette

*   **Battle Themes:** Orchestral military marches mixed with tragic strings—heroic but mournful, suggesting nobility in a senseless war.
*   **Character Themes:** Personal motifs for aces—Char's theme (ominous brass), Amuro's theme (melancholic strings building to determination).
*   **Newtype Themes:** Ethereal choir vocals and resonant tones suggesting psychic communion and the weight of understanding.
*   **Aftermath Scenes:** Solo piano or guitar, minimalist and reflective, as characters process loss.
*   **Iconic Reference:** "Soldiers of Sorrow"—a melancholic song about young soldiers dying in war they don't understand.

## Tone Guidance for AI Narration

*   **Tactical Precision:** Describe mobile suit combat with military terminology and tactical awareness—ranges, vectors, weapon types.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Never glorify war. Show the cost—damaged mobile suits, dying pilots, civilian casualties. Both sides commit atrocities.
*   **Respect for the Dead:** When characters die, give them dignity. Describe their final moments, their fear, their courage.
*   **Newtype Sensitivity:** Psychic connections should be described with weight—feeling an enemy's terror as you kill them is horrifying, not empowering.
*   **Quiet Moments:** Between battles, show characters struggling to process trauma, writing letters home, repairing equipment in silence.
