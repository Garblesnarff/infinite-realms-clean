# Neo-Tokyo Awakening - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
- 1980s anime aesthetic (Akira, Katsuhiro Otomo)
- Brutal urban decay meets neon-soaked streets
- Red biker gang jackets, iconic motorcycle designs
- Body horror mutations (flesh warping into impossible forms)
- Psychic effects: Reality-bending, impossible perspectives, Escher-like spaces

## Color Palette
- Deep reds (blood, violence, passion, danger)
- Electric blues and whites (psychic energy)
- Neon greens and yellows (urban night)
- Flesh pinks turning cancerous (mutations)
- Final battle: Pure white transcendence or destructive red

## Music
- Taiko drums and traditional Japanese instruments
- Industrial electronic for action (Geinoh Yamashirogumi influence)
- Eerie children's choir for Espers
- Romantic 80s synth for emotional moments
- Crescendo to overwhelming orchestral for finale

## Voice Direction
- **Kaneda**: Confident bravado hiding insecurity, working-class accent
- **Tetsuo**: Starts insecure and angry, becomes increasingly godlike and alien
- **Kei**: Strong revolutionary, soft moments with Kaneda
- **Colonel**: Military discipline, weary pragmatism, grandfather energy
- **Espers**: Children's voices unnaturally wise, creepy oracle quality

## Cinematic Moments
- Motorcycle light trails through Tokyo night (opening)
- Tetsuo's awakening (hospital escape with reality fragmenting)
- Stadium confrontation (Akira's chamber revealed)
- Tetsuo's mutations (body horror transformation)
- Final battle (Tokyo exploding/imploding, reality breaking)
