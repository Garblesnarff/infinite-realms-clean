# Creative Brief: The Wheel of Naraka

## Art Style: South Asian Cosmological Art

Inspired by Hindu and Buddhist religious art, temple carvings, Tibetan thangka paintings, and mandala designs. Rich colors, symbolic imagery, wheels and cycles. Shows the cosmic scale of karma and rebirth.

### Core Principles:

*   **Cyclical Composition:** Everything circles back. Wheel motifs, mandala patterns, showing the cycle nature.
*   **Symbolic Color:** Colors have specific meanings - red for suffering, blue for divine, gold for enlightenment, etc.
*   **Multiple Arms/Aspects:** Gods and cosmic beings with multiple forms showing their comprehensive nature.

## Voice

Contemplative and philosophical, like a meditation teacher or spiritual guide. Calm even when describing suffering. Explains karma patiently. Emotional range from serene teaching to the weight of countless lifetimes.

## Music Direction

Traditional South Asian instruments: sitar, tabla, tanpura, Tibetan singing bowls, bells. Meditative but not boring. Chanting mantras. Music that facilitates contemplation. Each realm has distinct musical character.

## Sound Design

Temple bells, prayer wheels spinning, fire burning in hot hells, ice cracking in cold hells, the wheel of samsara turning, past lives echoing, karmic patterns manifesting as sound, meditation breath, the om vibration underlying everything.
