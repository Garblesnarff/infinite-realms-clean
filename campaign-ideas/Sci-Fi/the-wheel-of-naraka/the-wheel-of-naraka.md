# The Wheel of Naraka

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Hindu/Buddhist Mythology / Karmic Cycle / Philosophical Journey / Rebirth Quest
- **Estimated Length**: 20-26 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-20 (characters die and are reborn multiple times)
- **Tone**: Cyclical, Philosophical, Karmic, Transformative, Illuminating

### Core Premise
The players died and entered Naraka, the realm of suffering and purification in Hindu/Buddhist cosmology. But unlike permanent hells, Naraka is temporary - souls suffer proportionate to their karma, are purified, and are reborn. The players discover they're trapped in a karmic cycle, dying and being reborn repeatedly, each life affected by the previous. They must understand their accumulated karma, break negative patterns, achieve enlightenment or redemption, and escape the cycle of death and rebirth entirely. The campaign spans multiple lives and deaths, with players experiencing hot hells, cold hells, and various rebirths as they work toward liberation (moksha/nirvana).

### Major NPCs

- **Yama (Yamaraja)**: Lord of Death and Karma. **Role**: Judge / Teacher / Cosmic Authority. **Personality**: Stern but educational, judges karma precisely, believes suffering purifies, ultimately compassionate. **Flaw/Secret**: Bound by karma himself; the first mortal to die, now judges all others; sometimes shows compassion that bends cosmic law.

- **Chitragupta**: Keeper of karmic records. **Role**: Accountant / Information Source / Bureaucrat. **Personality**: Meticulous, knows every deed of every soul, emotionless record-keeper. **Flaw/Secret**: Records are perfect but understanding karma's complexity sometimes reveals injustice in the system; struggles with edge cases.

- **Bodhisattva Guide**: Enlightened being who delays nirvana to help others. **Role**: Mentor / Ally / Spiritual Teacher. **Personality**: Compassionate, patient, has experienced countless lives, understands suffering intimately. **Flaw/Secret**: Their own karma might be tied to helping the players; sometimes their compassion delays necessary lessons.

- **Mara**: The Tempter, embodiment of death and desire. **Role**: Antagonist / Tester / Philosophical Opponent. **Personality**: Charming, seductive, offers easy paths that lead to worse karma, represents attachment and delusion. **Flaw/Secret**: Also trapped in samsara (cycle of rebirth); his role as tempter is his own karmic punishment; defeating him doesn't destroy him, just postpones.

- **Past Life Versions of Self**: Players meet their own previous incarnations. **Role**: Mirrors / Teachers / Warnings. **Personality**: Vary by life - some wise, some foolish, all share core essence. **Flaw/Secret**: Confronting yourself across lifetimes shows patterns you can't escape alone.

### Key Locations

- **The Eight Hot Narakas**: Realms of fire and heat where souls burn karma. Each progressively more intense. Not eternal but proportional to sins. First is uncomfortable, eighth is agonizing.

- **The Eight Cold Narakas**: Frozen hells where souls suffer cold. Different type of purification. Shows that suffering takes many forms.

- **Yama's Court**: Judgment hall where karma is weighed. Mirror shows all deeds. Chitragupta reads records. Players judged repeatedly across lives.

- **The Six Realms of Rebirth**: Players can be reborn as gods (deva), demi-gods (asura), humans, animals, hungry ghosts (preta), or hell beings. Each realm teaches different lessons.

- **The Wheel of Samsara**: Cosmic representation of the cycle. Players can see their past and potential future lives. Understanding the wheel is key to escaping it.

- **The Bodhi Tree**: Place of potential enlightenment. Reaching it while alive and aware allows escape from the cycle. But getting there requires perfect understanding.

- **The Bardo**: Intermediate state between lives where souls await rebirth. Time to reflect, learn, and prepare for next incarnation.

### Central Conflict
Players are trapped in samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Each life they accumulate karma through actions. Good karma leads to better rebirths, bad karma to worse. But any rebirth means continued suffering - even as gods, there's no permanent peace. The goal is moksha (Hindu) or nirvana (Buddhist) - escaping the cycle entirely. To achieve this, they must understand their karma, break negative patterns, develop wisdom and compassion, and ultimately transcend attachment to existence itself. The central question: can they learn and grow enough to escape, or will they cycle forever?

### Unique Mechanics

- **Karmic Balance**: Track good and bad karma precisely. Every significant action affects balance. Determines rebirth quality. Visible consequence system.

- **Multiple Lives System**: Players die and are reborn. New character but same soul. Carry karmic traits and past-life memories. Each playthrough is a new life informed by previous ones.

- **The Six Realms**: Can be reborn in different realms. Each has unique mechanics, challenges, and lessons. Teaches different aspects of dharma (right living).

- **Enlightenment Progress**: Track spiritual development across lives. Wisdom, compassion, detachment from material concerns. Achieving perfect understanding allows escape.

- **Attachment as Vulnerability**: The more attached to things/people/goals, the more vulnerable. Letting go is mechanically powerful but narratively difficult.

- **Bardo Choices**: Between lives, make decisions affecting next incarnation. Can sacrifice good karma for specific opportunities or insights. Strategic reincarnation.

- **Narrative Karmic Echoes**: Actions in one life create situations in next. Killed someone? Meet them again as victim or lesson. Creates meta-narrative across lifetimes.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory (Moksha/Nirvana)**: Achieve enlightenment and escape the cycle entirely. Understand suffering's nature, let go of all attachments, achieve perfect balance. Transcend existence itself.

**Progressive Victory**: Each life better than the last. Improve karma, learn lessons, grow spiritually. Eventually reach state where escape becomes possible even if not achieved in campaign.

**Bodhisattva Path**: Achieve enlightenment but choose to remain in the cycle to help others. Paradoxical victory - escape cycle by choosing to stay.

**Cyclical Defeat**: Trapped in samsara forever, making same mistakes across lives. Bad karma creates worse rebirths. The ultimate failure is not learning.

**The Hungry Ghost**: So much bad karma that rebirth as preta (hungry ghost) - eternally hungry, unable to satisfy needs. Living metaphor for attachment and desire.

**Animal Rebirth**: Reborn without human consciousness or reasoning. Lose ability to make karmic choices. Must wait for natural cycle to eventually return to human birth.
