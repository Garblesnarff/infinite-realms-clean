# The Temporal Conspiracy - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: "Clockpunk Meets Cosmic Horror"**
- Blend Victorian-era aesthetics with crystalline futurism
- Temporal anomalies represented by reality "glitching" like corrupted film
- Time periods layer over each other visually when timeline is unstable
- Ancient chronomantic technology has clockwork meets arcane design
- Colors shift and flow to represent temporal flux

**Era-Specific Styles:**
- **Dawn Age**: Primal, mystical, with Proto-chronomantic symbols
- **Ancient Civilizations**: Classical architecture with temporal motifs
- **Medieval Periods**: Gothic with clockwork elements
- **Present**: Victorian industrial meets modern fantasy
- **Future**: Sleek but degraded, apocalyptic overtones
- **Time Between Time**: Abstract, impossible geometry, Escher-like

**Character Design Philosophy:**
- Time travelers wear layered clothing from multiple eras
- Temporal radiation creates prismatic auras around experienced travelers
- The Revisionists have clean, perfected aesthetics
- The Conclave has eclectic, historical-scholar vibes
- Paradox entities look "wrong"—multiple versions overlapping

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme: "Temporal Requiem"**
- Orchestral with clockwork percussion
- Ticking and chiming integrated into melody
- Builds gradually with layered motifs from different eras
- Major key but with haunting undertones
- Use of reverse audio effects and time-stretched sounds

**Location Themes:**

**Eternal Archive:**
- Crystalline chimes and bells

- Peaceful but slightly unsettling
- Harps, glass harmonica, and music boxes

**Battle Themes:**
- Aggressive orchestral with electronic elements
- Ticking grows faster and more insistent
- Different historical instrument layers based on era
- Temporal distortion sound effects
- Builds to crescendo with reality-tearing sounds

**The Architect's Theme:**
- Begins noble and heroic
- Gradually introduces discordant elements
- Tragic violin solos over dark chorus
- Clockwork rhythm becomes irregular and desperate
- Final version is corrupted version of hero's theme

**Paradox's Theme:**
- Punk rock energy with orchestral backing
- Quick tempo, cheeky and confident
- Electric guitar riffs meet fantasy instruments
- Occasionally "skips" like damaged record
- Fun but with underlying anxiety

**Temporal Nexus:**
- Synthesis of all other themes playing simultaneously

- Cosmic choir vocals
- Represents all of time happening at once
- Most ambitious and complex musical piece

**The Time Between Time:**
- Ambient drones and whispers
- Reversed and time-stretched sounds

- Sounds of other eras bleeding through
- Player's own theme fragments appear distorted

**Sound Effects Design:**

**Time Travel:**
- Ascending/descending crystalline chime cascade
- Reality "tearing" like fabric ripping
- Rush of air and displaced time
- Echo of destination era before arrival
- Moment of pure silence at transition point

**Temporal Anomalies:**
- Glitching, skipping record sounds
- Multiple audio tracks playing slightly out of sync
- Distorted versions of familiar sounds
- Sudden cuts and audio reversal
- Ticking clock speeding up or slowing down

**Paradox Entities:**
- Multiple voice tracks of same being speaking slightly offset
- Distorted breathing and heartbeats
- Sounds that seem to come from wrong direction
- Audio that affects players' sense of time
- Uncomfortable resonance frequencies

**Timeline Instability:**
- Background ticking becomes irregular
- Ambient sounds from other eras bleed in
- Audio "glitches" and temporal skips
- Increasing distortion as instability grows
- At highest levels, complete audio chaos
