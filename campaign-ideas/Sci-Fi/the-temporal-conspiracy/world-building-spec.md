## Causality Chains and Temporal Mechanics

### Major Causality Chains

**Chain 1: The Meridia Assassination**
- Event: Queen Meridia assassinated 300 years ago
- Direct Result: Civil war erupts immediately
- Secondary Effects:
  - Kingdom fragments into warring states
  - Century of conflict and suffering
  - Population decrease by 60%
  - Cultural and technological regression
- Tertiary Effects:
  - No unified defense against external invasion 200 years later
  - Entire region conquered by foreign power
  - Language and culture nearly destroyed
- Long-term Results:
  - Modern nation never forms
  - PC backstories change—some PCs never born
  - Different geopolitical landscape
  - Butterfly effect reaches present day

**If Prevented:**
- Meridia lives, implements reforms
- Civil war avoided
- Prosperity continues
- But: her reforms create different problems
- Revisionists believe these problems cause future apocalypse

**Chain 2: The Burning of Ashenvale**
- Event: Forest city destroyed by fire 400 years ago
- Direct Result: 10,000 deaths, cultural center lost
- Secondary Effects:
  - Survivors demand fire safety reforms
  - Architecture changes throughout kingdom
  - Urban planning revolution
- Tertiary Effects:
  - Reforms prevent larger fires in next centuries
  - Save hundreds of thousands of lives overall
  - Technological advancement in safety systems
- Long-term Results:
  - Modern cities much safer
  - But: initial tragedy was horrific
  - Is preventing 10,000 deaths worth hundreds of thousands later?

**If Prevented:**
- City survives but fire safety never developed
- Larger catastrophes occur elsewhere
- Net loss of life greater
- Cultural heritage preserved but at terrible cost

**Chain 3: The First Temporal Manipulation**
- Event: Chronos discovers time magic in Dawn Age
- Direct Result: Time travel becomes possible
- Secondary Effects:
  - Temporal wars fought
  - Paradoxes created
  - Timeline instability introduced
- Long-term Results:
  - Entire campaign's conflicts exist because of this
  - Future apocalypse possibly caused by time magic itself
  - Reality's fabric weakened

**If Prevented:**
- No time travel ever discovered
- Campaign never happens (paradox!)
- But: no temporal damage to reality
- Ultimate solution might require undoing this

### Paradox Types and Resolution

**Bootstrap Paradox:**
- Definition: Information/objects with no origin point
- Example: Party gives historical figure idea that party learned from history
- Effect: Stable loop with no beginning
- Resolution: Accept the loop as stable or break it and create origin point
- Danger: Breaking creates instability spike

**Grandfather Paradox:**
- Definition: Preventing your own existence
- Example: PC accidentally prevents their parents' meeting
- Effect: PC begins fading from existence
- Resolution: Ensure events leading to their birth or use temporal anchor
- Danger: Complete erasure if not fixed quickly

**Predestination Paradox:**
- Definition: Attempting to prevent event actually causes it
- Example: Trying to stop assassination accidentally provides weapon used
- Effect: Frustration and realization you're part of causality
- Resolution: Accept event is fixed point or find alternate approach
- Danger: Obsessive attempts make it worse

**Twin Paradox:**
- Definition: Multiple versions of same being in one timeline
- Example: Present self meets past or future self
- Effect: Both versions weakened, reality strain
- Resolution: Temporal separation or one version returns to proper time
- Danger: If both stay too long, both might cease to exist

**Ontological Paradox:**
- Definition: Existence without cause or origin
- Example: Artifact from future given to past, exists in loop forever
- Effect: Object has no creation point
- Resolution: Often acceptable, sometimes must trace true origin
- Danger: Too many create reality instability

### Fixed Points and Mutable Events

**Fixed Points (Cannot Be Changed):**
- The discovery of time magic (prevents paradox)
- The founding of certain nations (too many dependent events)
- Birth of certain key individuals (paradox risk)
- Major celestial events (beyond temporal magic's power)
- The Temporal Wars (self-fulfilling prophecy)

**Mutable Events (Can Be Changed):**
- Most individual deaths (unless fixed point person)
- Battle outcomes (if consequences can be absorbed)
- Political decisions (within limits)
- Technological discoveries (timing can shift)
- Cultural developments (malleable)

**Determination Method:**
- Research in Eternal Archive
- Trial and error (dangerous)
- Consultation with temporal entities
- Massive resistance when attempting to change
- Cosmic guardians actively prevent changes

### Temporal Sickness

**Symptoms by Severity:**

**Mild (0-5 months displaced):**

**Treatment:**
- Regular returns to native time period
- Temporal anchor rituals
- Memory preservation stones
- Chronotherapy from Conclave healers
- In extreme cases: permanent return required

### Timeline Manipulation Techniques

**Paradox Suppression:**
- Making changes while using technology to dampen paradox
- Allows bigger alterations
- Artificial and unstable
- Revisionist specialty
- Conclave considers it dangerous

## Additional Lore and World History

### The First Temporal War (3000 Years Ago)

**Cause:**
- Chronos the Eternal discovers time magic
- Knowledge spreads to other powerful beings
- Disagreement about proper use
- Factions form with different philosophies
- Conflict escalates into temporal warfare

**Conflict:**
- Reality itself became battlefield
- Combatants attacked each other across time
- Entire civilizations erased as tactics
- Timeline damage nearly unraveled everything
- Hundreds of thousands died/were erased

**Resolution:**
- Surviving factions created Temporal Accords
- Established rules for timeline interaction
- Founded Keeper system to guard eras
- Chronos imprisoned himself as penance
- Created foundation for Chronal Conclave

**Legacy:**
- Current timeline is edited version after war
- Original history lost/sealed away
- Fear of repeating mistakes
- But: war proved time travel could be controlled
- Question: are we living in better or worse timeline?

### The Unraveling (500 Years in Future)

**Nature:**
- Apocalyptic event destroying civilization
- Reality itself begins breaking down
- Time becomes unstable globally
- Past, present, future blend together
- Causes both Revisionists and possibly the party

**Possible Causes:**
- Too much time manipulation weakens reality
- Specific catastrophic event triggers it
- Accumulation of paradoxes reaches critical mass
- Natural cosmic cycle
- Or: attempt to prevent it causes it (predestination)

**Manifestations:**
- Time zones appear randomly
- People age rapidly or reverse
- Dead return, unborn appear
- Physics becomes unreliable
- Madness spreads as reality fails

**Prevention:**
- Must trace exact cause through causality chain
- Might require ending time travel
- Or: accepting some version of apocalypse is inevitable
- Final answer unclear until campaign end
- Party's choices determine outcome

### The Missing Century

**The Mystery:**
- One hundred-year period with no reliable records
- Time period 1,000 years ago
- Any information about it contradicts other information
- Attempts to visit result in disorientation
- Something happened that was systematically erased

**Theories:**
- Previous Temporal War that was covered up
- Intervention by cosmic entities
- Mass paradox event
- Deliberate erasure by ancient conspiracy
- Test by higher beings

**The Keeper of Silence:**
- Guards this era absolutely
- More powerful than other Keepers
- Refuses to explain why
- Attacks anyone investigating too closely
- Might hold key to preventing apocalypse

**Truth (GM's Knowledge):**
- Original timeline's version of events was so catastrophic
- Early Conclave erased entire century
- Rewrote history to avoid outcome
- But: erasure creates ongoing instability
- May need to be restored to stabilize timeline

### The Time Before Time
