**Campaign Type / Genre:** Space Opera / Political Intrigue / Sci-Fi Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** gritty, political, space-faring, factional, mysterious, blue-collar heroes
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the fractured solar system of the Shattered Sphere, humanity has spread across asteroids, moons, and planets, divided into three major factions: the wealthy Inner Worlders, the militant Martian Coalition, and the exploited Belt miners. The party, a crew of resourceful Belters, discovers a mysterious substance called the "Protean Essence" in a remote asteroid that defies the laws of magic and nature. As powerful factions race to control this reality-warping material, the party must navigate deadly politics, space combat, and the terrifying transformations the Essence inflicts on those who use it, all while fighting for the Belt's independence.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** A mix of zero-gravity combat, ship-to-ship battles using magical starship rules, social encounters with faction leaders, and horror-tinged investigations of Protean Essence corruption.
*   **Investigation:** The party must uncover the truth about the Protean Essence's origin, navigate complex factional politics, and expose conspiracies before the solar system erupts into war.
*   **Consequences:** Player choices directly affect faction standing, territorial control, and the spread of Protean contamination. Reckless actions can trigger civil war or doom entire stations.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from hardscrabble Belt miners to key players in the solar system's future.

*   **Act I — The Discovery (Sessions 1–3):** The party, working as independent miners on the asteroid station Ceres' Hope, discovers the Protean Essence in an ancient, impossible structure buried in an asteroid. Their salvage claim attracts the attention of all three factions, and violence erupts.
*   **Act II — The Factions' Game (Sessions 4–6):** Forced to flee Ceres' Hope, the party becomes embroiled in the political machinations of the Inner Worlds, the Martian Coalition, and the Belt's own radical independence movement. They must decide which faction to support—or play them all against each other.
*   **Act III — The Protean Horror (Sessions 7–9):** As the Essence spreads, horrifying transformations begin. Infected individuals gain reality-warping powers but lose their humanity. The party investigates the Essence's origin, discovering it's a remnant of an ancient, eldritch civilization that once ruled the stars.
*   **Act IV — War and Revelation (Sessions 10–12):** The solar system teeters on the brink of war. The party must choose whether to destroy the Essence, weaponize it for their chosen faction, or find a third path that preserves the Belt's freedom while containing the cosmic threat.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a struggle for the soul of humanity's future in space. Will the solar system unite or fracture? Will the Protean Essence elevate humanity or destroy it? The party must balance factional politics, personal survival, and cosmic horror while deciding what kind of future they want to build.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Protean Exposure System**

*   Characters exposed to the Protean Essence gain temporary reality-warping powers (reroll failed saves, bonus damage, etc.) but accumulate "Transformation Points."
*   **Effects:** At certain thresholds, characters gain permanent mutations (beneficial or harmful). At maximum exposure, they risk losing control to the collective consciousness.

### 2. **Faction Reputation**

*   The party's actions affect their standing with Inner Worlds, Mars, and the Belt. High reputation unlocks allies, resources, and safe havens. Low reputation brings assassins and blockades.
*   **Dynamic World:** The faction with the highest player reputation gains advantages in the final war.

### 3. **Zero-Gravity Combat**

*   Space battles and void combat use special movement rules. Characters trained in Belt culture (or with specific feats) gain bonuses.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** Hull breaches, radiation, and decompression add tension to space encounters.

### 4. **Starship Combat**

*   The party's ship is a character in its own right, with stats, abilities, and upgrades. Ship combat uses simplified D&D mechanics with crew roles (pilot, gunner, engineer, etc.).
*   **Crew Synergy:** Party members' class abilities translate to ship actions (e.g., a wizard's spells become ship weapons, a rogue's sneak attack becomes targeting systems).
