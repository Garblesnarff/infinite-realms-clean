## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

A four-act epic spanning decades and the end of an era.

*   **Act I — The Challenge of Grandmasters (Sessions 1–5):** In 1930s Foshan, Master Gong Yutian (Gong Er's father) announces his retirement and challenges the best fighters to determine who deserves to unify the Northern and Southern martial arts schools. The party participates in this challenge, proving their worth. Ip Man gains Gong Yutian's respect, sparking Gong Er's interest. This act establishes the martial arts hierarchy and the party's place in it.
*   **Act II — The Betrayal and War (Sessions 6–10):** Ma San, a traitorous student of Gong Yutian, kills his master to steal the school's legacy. Gong Er swears revenge but must abandon potential romance with Ip Man to honor her father. Meanwhile, the Japanese invasion begins, forcing martial artists to choose between collaboration and resistance. The party must protect their schools while the world collapses around them.
*   **Act III — The Years of Exile (Sessions 11–15):** During Japanese occupation and the subsequent civil war, the party is scattered. Some flee to Hong Kong, others go underground. This act jumps forward in time, showing how war destroys the old martial arts world. Gong Er pursues her revenge while slowly dying from internal injuries. Ip Man loses everything but preserves Wing Chun. The party must decide what parts of their legacy they can save.
*   **Act IV — The Final Inheritance (Sessions 16–20):** In 1950s Hong Kong, the old guard is dying. Gong Er confronts Ma San in a final duel, achieving revenge but at the cost of her life. Ip Man begins teaching the next generation (including a young Bruce Lee). The party must pass on their knowledge to students, deciding what the future of martial arts will be in a modern world that no longer needs warrior masters.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **School Reputation & Politics**
*   Track the reputation and influence of various martial arts schools.
*   Political maneuvers, challenges, and demonstrations affect standings.
*   High reputation grants students and resources; low reputation means the school closes.

### 2. **The Romance That Cannot Be**
*   Track the relationship between Ip Man and Gong Er (or party equivalents).
*   Their honor and duties prevent them from being together.
*   This creates a melancholic undertone to all their interactions.
*   Mechanical benefits when they fight together (understanding), but narrative impossibility of romance.

### 3. **Generational Time Skips**
*   The campaign jumps forward in time between acts.
*   Characters age, students become masters, the world changes.
*   Track what each character loses and preserves through the years.

### 4. **Internal Injury Mechanic**
*   Gong Er (and possibly others) fight with worsening internal injuries.
*   Each major fight adds to the injury, eventually becoming fatal.
*   This creates urgency but also poignancy—knowing she's dying even as she achieves revenge.

### 5. **Teaching the Next Generation**
*   In the final act, success is measured not by personal achievement but by what students learn.
*   The party creates "legacy techniques" that their students can use.
*   The campaign ends with student success, not party glory.

### 6. **Style Philosophy Debates**
*   Before major duels, there are philosophical debates about martial arts principles.
*   Wing Chun's directness vs. Baguazhang's circular motion.
*   Northern formality vs. Southern practicality.
*   Winning philosophical debates grants combat advantages.
