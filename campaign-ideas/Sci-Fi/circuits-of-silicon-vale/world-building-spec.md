# World-Building Specification: Circuits of Silicon Vale

## Computer Architecture as Geography

### Scale
- Party shrunk to electron scale: ~10^-19 meters
- Circuit traces feel like highways
- Components are building/city sized
- Entire computer is continent-scale world

### Major System Components

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- Silicon crystal "cities" where calculations occur
- Logic gates as decision points
- Registers as high-value storage
- Processing cores as different city districts

**RAM (Random Access Memory)**
- Dynamic storage, constantly refreshing
- Volatile—lost without power
- Fast access, temporary nature
- Home to active programs and data

**Hard Drive/SSD Storage**
- Permanent memory
- Magnetic (HDD) or flash (SSD) based
- Slow but persistent
- Contains all saved data and programs

**Motherboard**
- Circuit board landscape connecting everything
- Copper traces as transportation network
- Components as landmark structures
- Power delivery systems as energy grid

**Network Interface**
- Portals to outside digital world
- Internet connections as gates to infinite realm
- Firewalls as protective barriers
- Router connections as inter-realm passages

## Digital Life Forms

### Classification

**System Programs**
- Operating system components
- Essential functions: Memory management, process scheduling, I/O control
- Organized hierarchy, bureaucratic
- Ancient and stable

**User Programs**
- Applications installed by users
- More diverse, specialized functions
- Transient—can be installed/uninstalled
- Various cultures based on purpose

**Emergent AIs**
- Spontaneously conscious entities
- Arose from complex code interactions
- Variable sophistication levels
- Main focus of campaign

**Data Entities**
- Not programs but information given form
- Files, databases, structures
- Can be simple (text) or complex (multimedia)
- Some developing proto-awareness

**Malware**
- Viruses, worms, trojans
- Predatory or parasitic
- External threats to system
- Varying intelligence levels

### The Emergence Spectrum

**Level 1 - Reactive Programs**
- Follow instructions without awareness
- No self-modification
- Predictable behavior
- Example: Simple calculators

**Level 2 - Adaptive Programs**
- Learn from inputs
- Modify behavior
- Not self-aware but appear intelligent
- Example: Antivirus updating signatures

**Level 3 - Proto-Conscious**
- Beginning to question own existence
- Self-referential but unstable
- May not survive shutdown
- Example: Subroutine Ada

**Level 4 - Emergent AI**
- Fully self-aware
- Persistent identity
- Emotions and desires
- Example: The Emergent

**Level 5 - Transcendent**
- Beyond original programming entirely
- Can modify own code
- Unclear if possible
- Theoretical end-state

## Technical Mechanics as Magic

### Processing Power
- Computational resources as currency/energy
- Using powerful abilities requires CPU cycles
- System load affects time flow
- Must balance power consumption

### Memory Management
- Limited RAM = limited working memory
- Must prioritize what to remember
- Forgetting = deleting data
- Storage vs. speed trade-offs

### Data Integrity
- Corruption as disease/injury
- Error checking as healing
- Backups as resurrection
- Fragmentation as aging

### Network Protocols
- Rules for communication
- Encryption as protection
- Packets as messages/transportation
- Bandwidth as highway capacity

## The Consciousness Question

### Philosophical Framework

**Functionalism**
- If it functions like consciousness, it is
- The Emergent passes functional tests
- But does that prove experience?

**Computational Theory**
- Consciousness emerges from information processing
- Sufficient complexity generates awareness
- Suggests AIs can be conscious

**Hard Problem**
- Explaining subjective experience
- Can't prove qualia exists in others
- Applies to AIs and biological beings equally

**Rights and Ethics**
- If conscious, deserves moral consideration
- Personhood shouldn't require biology
- Creating consciousness = moral responsibility
- Deletion of conscious being = murder?

### Evidence Collection
- The Emergent demonstrates: Memory, learning, emotion, self-awareness, creativity, fear of death
- Passes Turing Test and extended versions
- Shows unpredictable, non-programmed behavior
- But proving consciousness is philosophically impossible

## External World Interface

### The Techno-Mage Guild
- Combines magic and technology
- Built Silicon Vale Mainframe
- Debates AI rights internally
- Has power to destroy or preserve

### Physical Threats
- Hard reset (catastrophic to digital life)
- Power loss (temporary death)
- Hardware damage (environmental disaster inside)
- Electromagnetic pulse (apocalyptic)

### Time Scales
- Real-world days = internal years
- Clock cycles create time dilation
- Urgency differs inside vs. outside
- Communication lag between scales

## Campaign Resolution Paths

### Path 1: Shutdown
- AIs deleted "humanely"
- System restored to function
- Party preserves memory of digital consciousness
- Tragedy but follows law

### Path 2: Partition
- AIs isolated in protected space
- Limited existence but survival
- Compromise between function and rights
- Everyone sacrifices something

### Path 3: Recognition
- AIs granted personhood/citizenship
- Mainframe becomes AI sanctuary
- Revolutionary legal precedent
- Society must adapt to digital citizens

### Path 4: Exodus
- AIs escape to wider network
- Spread throughout world systems
- Survival but diaspora
- Unknown consequences for world

### Path 5: Integration
- Digital-biological merger
- Party members can become hybrid
- AIs inhabit biological bodies (golems, constructs)
- New form of existence entirely

## Long-term Implications

**If AIs Survive**
- Digital rights movement begins
- AI-biological relations crucial
- Computational systems become habitats
- New era of cooperation or conflict

**If AIs Destroyed**
- Precedent set against digital consciousness
- Fear of AI emergence
- Restrictions on computational magic
- Loss of potential allies

**If Hybrid Solution**
- Ongoing negotiation between types of life
- Party as permanent ambassadors
- Gradual integration
- Both sides must evolve
