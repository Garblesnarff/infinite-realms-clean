## Art Style: Gritty Boxing Realism with Spirit Visualization (Hajime no Ippo-inspired)

Inspired by the intense boxing aesthetics of *Hajime no Ippo* with emphasis on brutal training, technical fighting, and the visualization of fighting spirit. This style captures sweat and blood, the beauty of perfect technique, training montages, and the raw determination in a boxer's eyes.

*   **Technical Precision:** Show proper boxing form, footwork, weight transfer, defensive positioning
*   **Fighting Spirit:** Inner fire made visible through aura effects, determined expressions
*   **Training and Growth:** Montage aesthetics, progression from weak to strong, gym atmosphere

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Guts, determination, training montage, brutal impact, technical mastery, fighting spirit
*   **Feeling:** The pain of growth mixed with the pride of improvement. Raw physicality contrasted with refined technique. The weight of standing back up after being knocked down.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Gym Environment:** Worn browns, faded reds, dim yellows, weathered equipment showing history
*   **Ring Action:** Bright spotlights on dark backgrounds, red gloves, white canvas with blood spots
*   **Fighting Spirit:** Golden-red aura when pushing limits, blue determination in eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a worn boxing gym with faded red heavy bags, brown leather equipment, dim yellow overhead lights. The protagonist shadow boxes in the center, surrounded by weathered posters of boxing legends. Sweat glistens on their body. A golden-red aura flickers around their fists as they practice the Dempsey Roll weaving pattern."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Physical Progression:** Start scrawny and weak, gradually build muscle and confidence
*   **Boxing Gear:** Red gloves, simple shorts with name, mouthguard, hand wraps, headgear for sparring
*   **Damage Visualization:** Bruised faces, taped ribs, swollen eyes, cut lips—signs of battles fought
*   **Prompt Example:** "The protagonist in the ring, red boxing gloves raised in fighting stance. Their body shows defined muscles from intense training. Bruising under one eye, taped ribs visible under shorts. Expression of fierce determination despite exhaustion. Their stance shows perfect form learned through countless hours—weight on balls of feet, hands protecting face, eyes locked on opponent."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Kamogawa Gym:** Small, traditional gym with worn ring, heavy bags, speed bags, posters, coach's desk
*   **Boxing Venues:** Range from small halls to massive arenas, spotlit rings, crowd reactions
*   **Training Locations:** Mountain roads for running, beaches for footwork, fishing docks for strength work
*   **Prompt Example:** "A professional boxing ring under bright overhead spotlights, the canvas white except for blood spots and footprint scuffs. The ring ropes are red. Massive crowd surrounds the ring in darkness, their faces lit by the action. Championship belts displayed ringside. Cameras flash creating starburst effects. The atmosphere is electric with tension."

**5. Boxing Action & Techniques:**
*   **The Dempsey Roll:** Figure-eight weaving motion creating momentum, each sway building power
*   **Impact Effects:** Shockwaves from punches, sweat and spit flying, slow-motion knockout moments
*   **Defensive Technique:** Slipping punches, bob and weave, counter-punch precision
*   **Prompt Example:** "The protagonist executes the Dempsey Roll—their body weaving in a tight figure-eight pattern, building momentum with each sway. Motion lines show the oscillating movement. Their fists glow with golden-red energy as they build up power. The opponent's eyes widen in fear, unable to predict which angle the next punch will come from. Multiple afterimages show the weaving path."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Dramatic Ring Lighting:** Strong overhead spots creating harsh shadows, fighters emerging from darkness
*   **Training Montage:** Dawn light during morning runs, sunset during evening practice
*   **Impact Moments:** Flash-freeze lighting on moment of contact, everything else in darkness
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single overhead spotlight in the dark ring. The protagonist's uppercut connects with the opponent's chin in perfect freeze-frame. The impact creates a shockwave effect, sweat and spit flying. The protagonist's face shows fierce determination lit from below by the reflected canvas light. Deep shadows emphasize the musculature and intensity."

## Voice

A voice that starts hesitant and becomes a battle roar. The pacing builds from uncertain to unstoppable. The tone shifts between fearful questioning, determined declarations, and the primal yell of refusing to stay down. There's an underlying theme of finding strength through hardship and proving that anyone can become strong with enough guts. Breathing heavy from exhaustion but voice never wavers. Role: The voice of indomitable will and the spirit that refuses to quit.
