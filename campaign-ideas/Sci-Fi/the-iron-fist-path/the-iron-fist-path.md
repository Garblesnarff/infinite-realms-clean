## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-30 sessions)

A four-act journey from weakness to world-class strength.

*   **Act I — The Beginner's Spirit (Sessions 1-8):** Bullied and weak, the protagonist discovers boxing after being saved by a professional. They begin brutal basic training, learning footwork, jabs, and the fundamentals. Their first amateur matches are clumsy but spirited. They discover they have natural talent for taking punishment and getting back up. First major test is the Rookie Tournament where they prove they belong in the ring.
*   **Act II — The Road to the National Title (Sessions 9-16):** Now a professional boxer with a growing reputation, they face increasingly skilled opponents with unique fighting styles—outboxers, infighters, counterpunchers. They develop their signature move, the Dempsey Roll, through studying legendary boxers. They must defend their pride against rivals who mock their unpolished style. The regional championship puts them on the national stage.
*   **Act III — The Champion's Burden (Sessions 17-23):** Holding the national title means becoming a target. Challengers study their every move, specifically training to counter the Dempsey Roll. They face their greatest rival in a brutal match that leaves lasting injuries. They must decide whether to retire or push forward despite their damaged body. The weight of being champion and inspiring others becomes heavy.
*   **Act IV — The World Stage (Sessions 24-30):** Recovery and evolution of their style leads to challenging for the world title. They face international champions with styles they've never encountered. The final opponent is the undefeated world champion who represents everything they aspire to be. In the ultimate match, they must combine everything they've learned, overcome their body's limits, and prove that spirit can overcome pure technique.
