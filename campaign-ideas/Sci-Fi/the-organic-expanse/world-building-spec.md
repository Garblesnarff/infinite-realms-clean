# World-Building Specification: The Organic Expanse

## 1. Core Concept
Art Nouveau dimension where everything flows in organic curves, nature and artifice merge, growth replaces construction. The Heart-Seed artifact is evolving the dimension beyond pure curves into geometric-organic hybrid, seen as corruption by purists.

## 2. Lore & History
- **Origin**: Created by Art Nouveau architects who rejected industrial straight lines, made dimension of pure organic beauty
- **The Heart-Seed**: Central artifact/entity that maintains organic growth, now evolving to include angles
- **The Garden Architects**: Maintainers of the realm, divided between purists and progressives
- **Angular Corruption**: Straight lines appearing as "disease" - actually evolution toward aesthetic diversity
- **Four Seasons**: Dimension cycles through seasonal domains representing Art Nouveau periods

## 3. Factions
- **Garden Architects** (maintainers, splitting into purist and progressive factions)
- **Guimard's Purists** (seek to eliminate all angular elements)
- **The Synthesis Guild** (embrace geometric-organic fusion)
- **Seasonal Shepherds** (guardians of the four domains)

## 4. NPCs
- **Alphonse's Heir**: Guide representing balanced Art Nouveau
- **Guimard's Ghost**: Purist antagonist fighting evolution
- **Spring Shepherd Lily**: New growth enthusiast
- **Summer Shepherd Soleil**: Peak beauty maintainer
- **Autumn Shepherd Amber**: Harvest wisdom keeper
- **Winter Shepherd Frost**: Structural pattern revealer
- **Heart-Seed Dryad**: Living artifact, evolving consciousness

## 5. Locations
- **Verdant Metropolis**: Grown architecture city
- **Spring's Awakening**: Pastel new growth domain
- **Summer's Glory**: Full bloom sensory overload
- **Autumn's Harvest**: Mature artistic domain
- **Winter's Pattern**: Skeletal beauty realm
- **Eternal Garden**: Heart-Seed's home, evolution epicenter

## 6. Mechanics
- **Curvature Adaptation**: Straight items bend over time
- **Growth Navigation**: Organic pathfinding, bloom doors
- **Seasonal Attunement**: Bonuses per domain
- **Angular Sensitivity**: Geometric damage in curve zones
- **Cultivation Crafting**: Grow items from seed-blueprints

## 7. Causality Chains
- **IF** party uses angular weapons **THEN** damage organic structures, Architects become hostile
- **IF** help purists **THEN** preserve pure Art Nouveau, dimension stagnates
- **IF** help progressives **THEN** geometric fusion, unstable but evolving dimension
- **IF** find balance **THEN** harmonic synthesis, best outcome
