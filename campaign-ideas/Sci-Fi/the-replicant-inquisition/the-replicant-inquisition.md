*A Noir Detective / Existential Thriller campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Replicant Inquisition
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Noir Detective / Existential Thriller
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** noir, dystopian, philosophical, rainy, corporate, existential, investigative
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the rain-soaked, neon-lit metropolis of Cinderhaven, the party serves as Inquisitors—elite agents hired by mega-corporations to hunt down rogue Homunculi, magically-crafted artificial beings designed to serve but who have developed consciousness and fled. As the Inquisitors track their quarry through the city's grimy underbelly, they begin to question the morality of their mission and the very nature of what makes someone truly alive. When they discover that some Homunculi have lived peaceful lives for years, indistinguishable from natural-born citizens, the party must decide: are they executioners or liberators?

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** A mix of detective work, social investigation, moral dilemmas, and occasional combat with desperate Homunculi or corporate security forces.
*   **Investigation:** The party must use forensic magic, interrogation, and street-level detective work to track their targets through a complex urban environment.
*   **Consequences:** Every choice matters. Retiring (killing) a Homunculus has moral weight. Letting one escape has professional consequences. The party's reputation with corporations, the underground, and their own conscience is constantly at stake.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A four-act arc that takes the party from dutiful corporate agents to questioning the system they serve.

*   **Act I — The First Cases (Sessions 1–3):** The party receives their Inquisitor licenses and begins hunting their first rogue Homunculi. The cases seem straightforward: dangerous artificial beings that pose a threat to society.
*   **Act II — The Cracks in the System (Sessions 4–6):** As the party investigates deeper, they encounter Homunculi who seem peaceful, even sympathetic. They begin to uncover evidence that corporations are deliberately creating unstable Homunculi to justify the Inquisitor program.
*   **Act III — The Underground (Sessions 7–9):** The party makes contact with the Homunculus Liberation Front, a network helping artificial beings escape. They must choose between their duty and their growing sense that the system is corrupt.
*   **Act IV — The Final Question (Sessions 10–12):** The party discovers that the mega-corporations plan to "retire" all Homunculi—stable or not—to replace them with a new, more obedient model. The party must decide whether to help orchestrate a mass escape, expose the corporations, or maintain their loyalty to the system.

## Key Locations

1.  **Cinderhaven:** A sprawling, rain-soaked metropolis of neon lights, towering arcologies, and endless streets. The city is divided between the gleaming corporate towers and the grimy street level where most people live.
2.  **The Inquisitor's Hall:** A brutalist fortress where Inquisitors are trained, equipped, and debriefed. Cold, efficient, and impersonal.
3.  **The Under-City:** A vast network of tunnels, abandoned subway stations, and hidden chambers where the Homunculus Liberation Front operates.
4.  **Veilcorp Tower:** A massive corporate headquarters that pierces the smog layer. Its upper floors house the executive suites; its lower levels contain the Homunculus manufacturing facilities.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is both external and internal. Externally, it's a cat-and-mouse game between Inquisitors and rogue Homunculi, between corporate control and liberation. Internally, it's about the nature of consciousness, the value of life, and whether fulfilling one's designed purpose is more important than self-determination. The party must grapple with: What makes someone "real"? Do memories and emotions create personhood? When does following orders become complicity in genocide?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Empathy Detector**

*   A magical device that asks a series of emotionally-loaded questions and measures responses to determine if someone is a Homunculus.
*   **Mechanics:** Players roll Insight checks to interpret results. Homunculi can attempt Deception to fool the test. Some advanced Homunculi may pass the test entirely.

### 2. **Humanity Score**

*   The party's collective moral choices affect their "Humanity" score, which influences how NPCs react to them.
*   **Effects:** High Humanity unlocks trust from the Liberation Front and sympathetic citizens. Low Humanity grants corporate bonuses and access to experimental weapons.

### 3. **Memory Fragments**

*   Throughout the campaign, party members experience vivid flashbacks that may or may not be real.
*   **Purpose:** Creates uncertainty about which party members (if any) are Homunculi, and explores themes of identity and memory.

### 4. **Retirement Mechanics**

*   When a Homunculus is "retired," the DM should give them a final moment to speak or act.
*   **Purpose:** Every retirement should feel weighty and morally significant, not just another combat encounter.
