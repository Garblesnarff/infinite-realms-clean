# Creative Brief: Breach Runners

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Minimalist Tactical Sci-Fi with Pixel Precision (Into the Breach-inspired)

Inspired by the clean tactical aesthetics of *Into the Breach* with pixel-perfect clarity, mech designs, and kaiju threats. This style captures grid-based tactical precision, clear visual communication, time-loop desperation, and the scale of mechs vs. monsters.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Clarity:** Grid-based layout, clear unit positions, telegraphed attacks, perfect information
*   **Mech vs. Kaiju:** Giant robots fighting building-sized monsters on city grids
*   **Time Loop Aesthetics:** Glitch effects, timeline echoes, temporal anomaly visuals
*   **Minimalist Beauty:** Clean lines, functional design, no unnecessary detail

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tactical precision, time loop, mech defenders, kaiju emergence, grid-based strategy, timeline manipulation, desperate protection
*   **Feeling:** The tension of perfect tactical puzzles. Clean mech designs against monstrous kaiju. Weight of timeline resets and lost futures.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary:** Clean blues and teals for mechs and UI, signifying hope and technology
*   **Secondary:** Reds and oranges for Vek and danger, showing emergence points and attacks
*   **Environment:** Muted grays for cities, distinct colors per biome (rust, ice, forest)
*   **Timeline Effects:** Purple-pink glitch effects, temporal distortion halos
*   **Prompt Example:** "...tactical grid-based battlefield. Blue-teal mechs stand on city tiles. Red-orange Vek kaiju emerge from ground with glowing warning indicators. Gray buildings represent power grid. Purple temporal distortion effects around edges show timeline instability."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Mechs:** Three types with distinct silhouettes: Punch (boxy melee), Cannon (angular ranged), Science (sleek support)
*   **Pilots:** Visible in cockpits through mech chest windows, determined expressions
*   **Vek:** Insectoid kaiju: Fireflies (flying), Scorpions (armored), Beetles (tunneling), Hornets (fast)
*   **The Architect:** Impossible geometry, crystal fractals, exists between dimensions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Punch-class mech: boxy torso with reinforced fists, industrial design, blue-teal color scheme with orange highlights. Pilot visible through chest window—determined expression. Standing in powered-up stance on tactical grid. Behind it, a massive red-orange Vek Scorpion with armored carapace prepares to attack."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Island Biomes:** Rust (industrial browns), Ice (whites and blues), Forest (greens), Desert (tans)
*   **Tactical Grid:** 8x8 grid clearly marked, each tile distinct (buildings, mountains, water, plains)
*   **Cities:** Functional buildings representing power grid, distinct from terrain
*   **The Archive:** Clean sci-fi headquarters between timelines, holographic displays
*   **Prompt Example:** "Tactical grid battlefield on Rust Island: 8x8 grid with industrial buildings (power grid), mountain tiles, water hazards. Three blue mechs positioned strategically. Four red Vek emerge from glowing tiles. Orange trajectory lines show enemy attack paths. Gray smoke from damaged building."

**5. Combat and Timeline Effects:**
*   **Attack Telegraphs:** Clear lines showing which tiles Vek will target
*   **Knockback:** Visual arrows showing push direction and distance
*   **Timeline Reset:** Screen glitch effect, everything rewinding, purple temporal waves
*   **Emergence Warning:** Tiles glow one turn before Vek appear
*   **Prompt Example:** "Combat moment frozen in time: A Cannon mech fires (orange blast line), pushing a Vek backward (blue knockback arrow) into mountain tile (will cause damage). Red attack telegraphs show three Vek targeting power buildings next turn. Purple timeline echo shows 'ghost' positions from previous failed attempt."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Clean Top-Down:** Overhead lighting for tactical clarity
*   **Glowing Elements:** Mech weapons glow when charged, Vek glow with bio-energy, power grid pulses
*   **Timeline Distortion:** Lighting breaks down near temporal anomalies
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit from above for tactical clarity. Mechs have glowing blue energy cores visible. Vek have internal red-orange bio-luminescence. Buildings emit yellow power glow when active, fade gray when damaged. Timeline glitch areas have purple light bleeding from impossible angles."

## Voice

A voice that begins calm and tactical like mission control, carries urgency as situations deteriorate, and ultimately speaks with weary determination across countless timeline resets. The pacing is measured during planning, rapid during combat. The tone shifts between tactical precision ("Vek emerging grid B-3, target power grid"), desperate improvisation ("We can't save them all—prioritize the grid!"), and haunted reflection ("How many times have we failed this mission?"). There's awareness that failure means reset, not death, but emotional weight remains. Slightly distorted as if transmitted across timelines. Role: The voice of tactical determination and timeline-weary resolve.
