### Core Premise
Lawrence is a traveling merchant, a human artificer who trades goods across the realm, dreaming of opening his own shop someday. In the village of Pasloe, he discovers a wolf deity named Holo hidden in his cart—an ancient harvest goddess with wolf ears, tail, and immense pride. She was once worshipped as the deity of the village's wheat harvest but has been forgotten as new religions spread. Lonely after centuries, she asks Lawrence to take her north to her distant homeland of Yoitsu. Thus begins a journey where economics, faith, and romance intertwine. They travel from town to town, engaging in clever trades, navigating currency manipulations and merchant politics, debating philosophy and theology, and slowly falling in love despite their vastly different natures—one mortal and practical, one divine and playful.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Journey Begins (Sessions 1-4)**
- Lawrence discovers Holo in his cart. Initial wariness becomes partnership. First trade adventure together where Holo's supernatural senses (detecting lies, understanding animal behavior) prove valuable. They negotiate a major currency speculation deal, navigating merchant guild politics. Their banter and intellectual sparring begins.

**Act 2: The Silver Deception (Sessions 5-8)**
- A major arc involving silver coin debasement and economic manipulation. Lawrence and Holo must navigate a dangerous scheme where they could either profit enormously or lose everything. Holo's divine nature is nearly discovered. They must trust each other completely. Their relationship deepens beyond partnership toward romance. Lawrence realizes he no longer wants the journey to end.

**Act 3: The North and the Truth (Sessions 9-12)**
- As they approach Yoitsu, Holo becomes anxious about what they'll find. Discovery arc reveals Yoitsu no longer exists—destroyed long ago. Holo's homeland is gone. She faces the reality that her purpose (returning home) is impossible. Crisis: will she and Lawrence separate now that the pretense for traveling together is gone, or admit they've fallen in love? Confrontation with another deity or church forces them to choose.

**Act 4: A New Home (Sessions 13-15)**
- Resolution arc. They decide to continue traveling together not out of necessity but choice. Lawrence abandons his dream of a settled shop in favor of a life on the road with Holo. She chooses him over solitude. They become life partners—merchant and deity, traveling the realm together, their trade profits funding their adventures, their love transcending the mortal/divine divide.

### Major NPCs

- **Lawrence, the Merchant**: Human artificer and traveling trader. **Role**: Protagonist. **Personality**: Practical, clever, kind, ambitious but not greedy. **Flaw/Secret**: His dream of settling down is actually fear of loneliness, not true desire.

- **The Church of the New Faith**: **Role**: Antagonist Organization. **Personality**: Dogmatic, actively suppressing old gods. **Flaw/Secret**: Use fear and control rather than genuine faith.

### Key Locations

- **The Open Road**: Primary setting. Various towns, merchant camps, inns.
- **Pasloe Village**: Where Lawrence finds Holo. Traditional harvest festivals and old faith.
- **The Trading Cities**: Major economic centers where large deals occur. Guild politics, currency exchanges, markets.
- **Northern Wilderness**: As they approach Yoitsu's former location. Cold, ancient, mythical.
- **Yoitsu (Ruins)**: The tragic destination that no longer exists.

### Central Conflict
Can love bridge the gap between mortal and divine, temporary and eternal? The tension between Lawrence's practical, time-limited life and Holo's ancient, enduring nature. Economics as a metaphor for understanding value—Holo learning that time's limit makes it precious, Lawrence learning that some things are priceless.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Economic Challenges**: Major plot points involve trade deals, currency speculation, price negotiations, and identifying economic schemes. Use Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) to navigate merchant politics.
- **Holo's Senses**: She can detect lies (enhanced Insight), understand animal behavior, and has supernatural knowledge of agriculture and weather. These provide advantages in trades.
- **Wolf Form**: Holo can transform into a massive wolf, but requires wheat in her diet to maintain power. This creates resource management.
- **Dialogue-Heavy Sessions**: Much of the campaign is witty banter, philosophical debates about faith and economics, and gradual romantic development through conversation.
- **The Economic Mini-Game**: Track Lawrence's capital, profits, and losses. Major arcs involve risk/reward trading decisions. Success funds their journey; failure creates problems.
- **Loneliness vs. Partnership**: Track relationship development through how they make decisions—initially independent, gradually consulting each other, finally as true partners.
- **Cultural Exploration**: Each town has unique economic systems, faiths, and customs to navigate, providing variety and worldbuilding depth.
