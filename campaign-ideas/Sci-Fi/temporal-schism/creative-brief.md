# Temporal Schism - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Donnie Darko meets Primer. Suburban mundane mixed with temporal distortion. Reality's edges blurring, multiple overlapping images suggesting alternate timelines. Practical photography with surreal elements.

## Color Palettes
- **Stable Timeline**: Normal, natural colors
- **Temporal Flux**: Double-exposure effect, overlapping color schemes
- **Timeline Bleeding**: Multiple color grades simultaneously, disorienting
- **The Nexus**: Grayscale with color bleeding in from various timelines
- **Collapsed Zones**: Sepia fading to white, memories of color

## Music and Sound
- **Time Loop**: Music repeating but slightly different each iteration, Groundhog Day effect
- **Timeline Jump**: Record scratch, reality skipping like scratched CD
- **Multiple Timelines**: Layered audio from different realities playing simultaneously
- **The Moment**: All sounds at once, overwhelming cacophony resolving to silence
- **Emotional Score**: Philip Glass-style minimalism, repetition with variation

## Voice Direction
- **Temporal Overseer**: Multiple voices speaking same words at different speeds, layered
- **Alternate Selves**: Same actor but different energy, showing divergent development
- **Dr. Chen**: Increasingly desperate across timelines, guilt deepening
- **Future You**: Hollow, tired, warning tone

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Loop Death**: Experiencing catastrophe, everything going wrong, final moment, then—waking up before it
- **Meeting Alternate Self**: Two versions facing each other, realizing both are real, both are you
- **Timeline Jump**: Reality stuttering, one environment blending into another, vertigo of displacement
- **The Butterfly Effect**: Showing small choice rippling outward, reality branching visibly
- **Final Choice**: All timelines visible simultaneously, party selecting which survives, others fading as unselected
