# Temporal Schism - World-Building Specification

## Temporal Mechanics (Scientific-Magical Framework)

### How Time Travel Works
Dr. Chen's discovery: consciousness can navigate temporal dimension like space. Device doesn't move matter through time, moves awareness. Body stays present, consciousness jumps. But side effect: observation creates branch. Every time travel creates new timeline.

### Why Reality Branches
Quantum mechanics made macro. Observer effect scaled up. Conscious choice collapses probability wave. Usually invisible. Time travel makes it literal. Each different choice creates physically distinct timeline.

### The Catastrophe
Dr. Chen's first time travel experiment. Consciousness jumped, saw terrible future, returned to prevent it. Created timeline where it was prevented. But original timeline still exists. Experiment created first branch. Subsequent attempts to fix it created more. Now branches proliferating exponentially.

### Timeline Stability
- New branches: Unstable, might collapse back into parent
- Established branches: Solid, developing independently
- Mature branches: Permanent separate realities
- Ancient branches: Forgot they branched, believe they're original

### The Multiverse Problem
Infinite branching unsustainable. Each new timeline strains reality's fabric. Eventually: collapse into primordial chaos or forced merger into single timeline. Temporal Overseer's concern is valid. Method is questionable.

## Timeline Variations

### Timeline Alpha (The Hero Timeline)
- Party made all "right" choices
- Catastrophe prevented early
- Everyone happy
- But... boring? Safe but stagnant
- Party here is celebrated but unfulfilled

### Timeline Beta (The Villain Timeline)
- Party made all "wrong" choices
- Catastrophe not prevented, exacerbated
- World devastated
- Party hunted as criminals
- But this timeline's party believes they did right thing

### Timeline Gamma (The Broken Timeline)
- Party tried and failed repeatedly
- Traumatized by failures
- Gave up trying to fix anything
- World in slow decline
- Party exists but hollow

### Timeline Delta (The Transcendent Timeline)
- Party accepted temporal nature
- Learned to live across branches
- No longer fully bound to one reality
- Have become something post-human
- Offer this path to main party

### Timeline Epsilon (The Dead Timeline)
- Party died preventing catastrophe
- Were martyrs, are remembered
- World saved at cost of their lives
- Exists as ghost-memory
- Main party can talk to their own ghosts

### Timeline Zeta (The Pruned Timeline)
- Butterfly Hunters collapsed this one
- Partially erased, fragments remain
- Shows what happens when timeline eliminated
- Party here never existed
- Evidence they could be erased too

## The Butterfly Hunters

### Ideology
"Free will is chaos. Choice is disease. Only one timeline should exist. We will find or create the perfect timeline, eliminate all others."

### Methods
- Identify "deviant" timelines
- Travel to their branching points
- Prevent the choice that created them
- Erase everyone who only exists because of that choice
- Believe they're saving multiverse through genocide

### Internal Conflict
- Some members doubt righteousness
- Others are alternate versions of people they've erased
- Some joined because their timeline was erased, want revenge
- Others genuinely believe in mission

### The Adamant Prophet
Leader. Comes from timeline where branching caused apocalypse. Watched everyone die. Believes anything justified to prevent that. Is right about danger. Wrong about solution.

## The Temporal Overseer

### Nature
Being from outside time. Possibly from far future, possibly extradimensional, possibly abstract concept given form. Exists in all moments simultaneously. Sees timeline branching as cancer.

### Motivation
Genuinely trying to help. Multiverse collapse would be worse than single timeline. But doesn't understand meaning of individual existence. To Overseer, erasing a timeline is just simplifying equation.

### Plan
Assist party in choosing "best" timeline, collapse others. Defines "best" by mathematical optimization: least suffering, most happiness, greatest stability. Doesn't account for meaning, beauty, individuality.

### Can Be Reasoned With
Not evil, just alien in thinking. If party can show why multiverse worth preserving despite danger, Overseer might accept alternative solution. But must actually solve instability problem.

## Philosophical Framework

### Eternalism
All moments exist simultaneously. Past and future are real as present. Choice doesn't create timeline—reveals which branch you're on. Implies determinism.

### Growing Block Universe
Past is fixed, present is real, future is potential. Choice matters because it creates future. Branching timelines are growth of reality tree.

### Many Worlds Interpretation
All possible outcomes of quantum events occur in separate universes. Time travel just makes this macro. Every choice has always created branches. Now just perceive it.

### The Dilemma
If all timelines exist, does choice matter? If you're doing everything in some timeline, are you responsible for any of it? Or is responsibility precisely about which timeline you create/inhabit?

## Campaign Structure

### Early Campaign
Focus on time loop, trying to prevent catastrophe. Groundhog Day horror. Failure after failure. Growing desperation.

### Mid Campaign
Loop breaks, timelines revealed. Meeting alternate selves. Understanding weight of choice. Moral complexity increasing.

### Late Campaign
Butterfly Hunters conflict. Temporal Overseer introduced. Must choose: preserve multiverse or save single timeline. No clear right answer.

### Climax
All timelines visible. Party members may disagree on which to save. Final decision: consensus or fracture? Save themselves or sacrifice for better world?

## The Fixed Point Mystery

One NPC dies in every timeline. Party discovers this while trying to save them. Represents limit of choice. Some things may be destined. How do you cope with unchangeable?

**Possible Resolutions**:
- Accept their death, learn from it
- Transcend time to save them (but lose humanity)
- Discover their death triggers necessary change
- Find timeline where they live (but everything else is worse)

## Ending Implications

**Single Timeline**: Survivor's guilt. Did we choose right one? What if we killed the best timeline?

**Multiverse**: Constant instability. Must eternally manage branching. Never done.

**Transcendence**: Lose humanity to save possibility. Worth it?

**Failure**: At least tried. Didn't make choice out of fear.

The campaign's question: "If every choice matters infinitely, how do you choose?"
