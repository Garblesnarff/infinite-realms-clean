## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 22-30 sessions)

*   **Act I — Rising Warriors (Sessions 1-8):** The party trains in martial arts and ki manipulation. They compete in the World Martial Arts Tournament, facing increasingly skilled opponents. An alien warlord arrives seeking the Dragon Balls—artifacts that grant wishes. The party must defend Earth, learning to power up, fly, and fire energy blasts.
*   **Act II — Legendary Powers (Sessions 9-16):** More powerful aliens arrive—a genocidal emperor and his army. The party travels to alien worlds, trains under higher gravity, and unlocks transformations (Super Saiyan equivalent). They face androids sent from the future and an evolving bio-weapon that absorbs fighters.
*   **Act III — Gods and Mortals (Sessions 17-22):** An ancient demon is resurrected. The party must learn fusion techniques and push past mortal limits. They encounter gods of destruction and angels who reveal the multiverse. They're recruited for the Tournament of Power—a battle royale between universes where losing means erasure.
*   **Act IV — Ultra Instinct (Sessions 23-30):** The party competes in the Tournament of Power, facing warriors who've trained for millions of years. They must unlock Ultra Instinct—a technique even gods struggle with—and prevent their universe's erasure while learning the true nature of power.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of constantly surpassing limits, rivalry driving growth, protecting the weak, and what true strength means. It asks: Is power everything? Can you protect those you love through strength alone? When does the pursuit of power become the problem? The central conflict escalates from local threats to universal stakes with increasingly godlike opponents.

### 3. **Transformations**
*   Characters unlock transformations that multiply power (Super Saiyan x50, Super Saiyan 2 x100, etc.)
*   Each form has physical changes (hair color, aura, muscle mass)
*   Higher forms drain energy faster
*   Emotional triggers unlock first time, controlled access after
*   Ultimate forms: Ultra Instinct, Ultra Ego, God Ki

### 4. **Zenkai Boosts**
*   Recovering from near-death grants permanent power increase
*   Incentivizes tactical retreats and recovery
*   Diminishing returns at higher power levels
*   "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" as mechanic
