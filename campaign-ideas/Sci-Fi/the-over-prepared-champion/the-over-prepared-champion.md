# The Over-Prepared Champion

*A Comedy Action campaign — Medium Campaign (6-8 sessions) — Light difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Over-Prepared Champion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Comedy / Action / Isekai Parody / Over-the-Top Heroics
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **10** → Finish **17-18**
**Tone (keywords):** absurdly cautious, comedic, over-powered, paranoid perfectionism, genre satire
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party has been summoned by a frustrated goddess to save the world of Gaeabrande, a realm ranked as "S-Difficulty" for heroes. The twist: the designated champion is hilariously overpowered but pathologically cautious, refusing to fight unless he has overwhelming advantage, preparing for unlikely scenarios, and treating every minor enemy like a world-ending threat. The party must support (and survive) this paranoid perfectionist who insists on "maxing his stats" before fighting level 1 slimes and always has seventeen backup plans, while dealing with demon lords increasingly confused by his bizarre tactics.

---

## Difficulty Context: Light

This campaign is deliberately easier in terms of mechanical difficulty but challenging in humor and absurdity:
- Combat encounters are trivial due to over-leveled champion and excessive preparation
- True challenge is roleplaying the comedy: maintaining character quirks, improvising ridiculous preparations
- Puzzle-solving through lateral thinking and creative "over-caution"
- Social encounters with increasingly baffled NPCs

The campaign rewards creativity, humor, and embracing the absurdity rather than tactical optimization.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 6-8 sessions)

A journey of paranoid preparation and overwhelming force.

*   **Act I — The Most Cautious Beginning (Sessions 1-3):** The goddess Rista summons the party and the chosen hero, Seiya, to save Gaeabrande. Despite having S-tier stats, Seiya refuses to leave the divine realm until he's "perfectly prepared," training obsessively, creating excessive backup plans, and stockpiling ridiculous amounts of supplies. When he finally ventures to the mortal world, he treats the first village's slime problem like a military operation, shocking everyone with his paranoia and overwhelming power.

*   **Act II — Escalating Absurdity (Sessions 4-6):** As the party travels to confront the Demon Lord's Four Generals, Seiya's caution reaches new heights. He'll fight weakened enemies with his strongest attacks "just to be safe," prepare for scenarios that couldn't possibly happen, and refuse to accept any mission until he's investigated every possible risk. His methods are bizarre but effective, creating a trail of utterly confused demon generals who can't comprehend why the hero is so careful. The party becomes his "safety net" and must help facilitate his increasingly elaborate preparations.

*   **Act III — The Perfectly Planned Final Battle (Sessions 7-8):** The approach to the Demon Lord's castle becomes an exercise in excessive preparation—Seiya scouts it a dozen times, creates detailed maps, identifies seventeen escape routes, and trains specific counters to every enemy. The final battle itself is anticlimactic in the best way: Seiya's paranoid planning accounts for every possible scenario, turning what should be an epic confrontation into a perfectly executed plan where nothing can go wrong. The campaign ends with the goddess still frustrated but the world saved by the most cautious hero ever summoned.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Summoning"
*   **Focus:** Comedy Introduction / Character Establishment / Divine Realm
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The goddess Rista summons heroes to her divine realm, explaining that Gaeabrande needs saving from the Demon Lord.
    *   She presents the party and Seiya, a warrior with S-tier stats—he's perfect for this S-difficulty world.
    *   But Seiya immediately starts analyzing everything: checking everyone's stats (including allies), asking about enemy types, demanding training facilities.
    *   Instead of departing for adventure, he insists on training in the divine realm for "just a few more sessions."
    *   Comedy escalates: he trains against level 1 training dummies for hours, creates detailed spreadsheets of enemy weaknesses, and asks for 100 spare swords "just in case."
*   **Escalation:** After days of preparation for what should be a simple quest, Rista physically forces the party through the dimensional portal to Gaeabrande.

### Session 2 — "The Slime Incident"
*   **Focus:** First Quest / Establishing the Comedy Pattern
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in the starting village, which has a minor slime problem in the nearby fields.
    *   Seiya immediately goes into analysis mode: investigating slime types, resistances, breeding patterns, and potential hidden slime variants.
    *   When finally ready to fight, he uses a devastating high-level AoE attack to eliminate all slimes in a 100-foot radius—massive overkill for CR 1/8 creatures.
    *   His reasoning: "I wanted to make sure there were no survivors to report back to the Demon Lord."
    *   The villagers are simultaneously grateful and terrified of this overpowered weirdo.
*   **Escalation:** The local lord asks them to investigate bandits. Seiya begins preparing as if facing an ancient dragon.

### Session 3 — "The Bandit Fortress"
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl Parody / Excessive Planning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The bandit hideout is a simple wooden fort. Seiya treats it like a high-security prison.
    *   Preparation phase: he scouts the location seventeen times, creates detailed maps, identifies all guards' patrol patterns, and devises six different infiltration plans.
    *   He insists on training a specific anti-bandit technique and stockpiling smoke bombs, despite already being overwhelmingly powerful.
    *   The actual raid: He uses his strongest techniques on common bandits, refuses to enter rooms without checking for traps (there are none), and carries three different antidotes for poisons that don't exist.
    *   The bandit leader tries to monologue but Seiya interrupts by immediately attacking at full power: "Never give enemies time to power up or transform."
*   **Escalation:** News of the "insanely paranoid but unstoppable hero" reaches one of the Demon Lord's Four Generals, who becomes concerned.

### Session 4 — "The First General"
*   **Focus:** Boss Encounter (Accidentally Easy) / Pattern Continues
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Chaos Machina, the First General, sends a messenger to challenge Seiya to single combat at a neutral location.
    *   Seiya's response: "It's obviously a trap." He insists on scouting the location for a week, preparing anti-demon magic, and bringing the entire party as backup.
    *   He arrives at the duel site with so many contingencies that Chaos Machina is utterly confused.
    *   The fight: Seiya opens with maximum power, no testing or feeling out the opponent. Chaos Machina tries to activate a transformation but Seiya doesn't let him finish, attacking through the animation.
    *   Victory is so overwhelming that the demon general's dying words are "...but I didn't even use my final form..."
*   **Escalation:** The Demon Lord's remaining generals hold an emergency meeting, trying to figure out how to handle this bizarre hero.

### Session 5 — "The Cursed Town"
*   **Focus:** Mystery / Curse-Breaking / Social Comedy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   A town is cursed—people are slowly turning to stone. The Second General, Medusa, is responsible.
    *   Seiya's preparation: He acquires blindfolds, mirror shields, anti-petrification amulets, Greater Restoration scrolls, and trains his other senses for a week.
    *   When they enter the town, he insists everyone wear three layers of protection.
    *   The actual encounter with Medusa: she tries to use her petrifying gaze, but Seiya prepared so thoroughly that it's completely ineffective. He defeats her without even getting close to danger.
    *   Afterward, he uses his stockpiled Restoration magic to cure the town, but insists on checking each person seventeen times "to ensure the curse is truly broken."
*   **Escalation:** The Third General, watching through scrying, realizes conventional demon tactics won't work and starts preparing something truly devastating.

### Session 6 — "The Perfect Counter"
*   **Focus:** Seiya Out-Prepares the Enemy / Arms Race of Caution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Third General, Death Magnus, spends weeks preparing the "perfect trap"—a dimension where escape is impossible and enemies are infinitely revived.
    *   Unknown to him, Seiya has been preparing for exactly this scenario despite no one suggesting it would happen.
    *   When the party is trapped in the death dimension, Seiya reveals he learned dimension-breaking magic "just in case" and carries artifacts specifically for escaping inescapable prisons.
    *   Death Magnus's elaborate plan crumbles in minutes. He's so demoralized by being out-prepared that he barely puts up a fight.
*   **Escalation:** The Demon Lord himself decides to intervene, challenging Seiya to come to his castle.

### Session 7 — "Preparing for the Demon Lord"
*   **Focus:** Montage of Excessive Preparation / Comedy Peak
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Seiya declares he's "not ready" to fight the Demon Lord and needs to train more.
    *   Montage sequence: He returns to the divine realm, trains with war gods, learns every type of magic "just to be sure," maxes his stats past their supposed maximum, and creates an arsenal of holy weapons.
    *   He makes the party train with him, teaching them his paranoid methods.
    *   He creates detailed plans for scenarios like "What if the Demon Lord can copy abilities?" and "What if he has hostages?" and "What if the castle itself is alive?"
    *   Rista is pulling her hair out in frustration but can't deny his effectiveness.
*   **Escalation:** After what feels like an eternity of preparation, Seiya finally declares he's "almost ready" to attempt the castle infiltration.

### Session 8 — "The Perfect Final Battle"
*   **Focus:** Climactic Battle (Totally Controlled) / Campaign Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The approach to the Demon Lord's castle: Seiya has scouted it dozens of times, created scale models, and identified seventeen escape routes.
    *   He's prepared specific counters to every possible demon lord ability, including ones that don't exist.
    *   The castle's defenses are elaborate but Seiya predicted every trap. Fights that should be challenging are trivial because he's over-leveled and over-prepared.
    *   The Demon Lord, expecting a dramatic confrontation, tries to give a villain speech. Seiya interrupts him immediately: "I'm not interested in your backstory. I just want to confirm you're the Demon Lord before I eliminate you."
    *   The final battle phases:
        * Phase 1: Demon Lord's normal form—defeated quickly by overwhelming force
        * Phase 2: Demon Lord's "true form"—Seiya already prepared counters to it
        * Phase 3: Demon Lord's "final desperate gambit"—Seiya predicted this and has three different solutions ready
    *   Victory is achieved not through struggle but through perfect preparation. It's anticlimactic in the most satisfying way.
*   **Resolution:** The world is saved. Rista is still frustrated by Seiya's methods but admits they worked. Seiya's final line: "We should scout the Demon Lord's remains one more time. Just to be sure he's really dead."

## Major NPCs

1.  **Goddess Rista** — *The Frustrated Deity*
    *   **Role:** The goddess who summoned the party, constantly exasperated by Seiya's excessive caution.
    *   **Personality:** Well-meaning but impulsive, she's the exact opposite of Seiya—she wants to rush into heroics, he wants to prepare endlessly.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She chose Seiya specifically because his stats were perfect, never considering that personality matters too. She's learning divine humility.

2.  **Seiya Ryuguin** — *The Cautious Hero*
    *   **Role:** The summoned hero who is absurdly overpowered but pathologically careful.
    *   **Personality:** Paranoid, perfectionistic, analytical to a fault. He treats every encounter as potentially lethal and over-prepares for everything.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His caution stems from a past failure (possibly revealed late campaign) where under-preparation led to tragedy. His methods seem crazy but come from genuine trauma.

3.  **Chaos Machina** — *The First General*
    *   **Role:** Demon general who expects a fair fight and monologuing, gets neither.

    *   **Personality:** Theatrical, powerful, wants to savor his battles and give dramatic speeches.

7.  **War God Ariadoa** — *The Divine Trainer*
    *   **Role:** A divine warrior who trains Seiya, initially amused then increasingly concerned by his paranoia.
    *   **Personality:** Proud, martial, believes in honorable combat.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Divine Realm:** A heavenly dimension where gods reside, featuring training facilities, divine forges, and sacred libraries that Seiya exploits obsessively.

2.  **Starter Village (Elsbane):** A peaceful town with minor problems (slimes, bandits) that get the "overwhelming force" treatment from Seiya.

3.  **The Cursed Town (Seimul):** A settlement suffering Medusa's petrification curse, where Seiya's over-preparation makes curse-breaking trivially easy.

4.  **Death Magnus's Dimension:** An inescapable death-trap dimension that Seiya escapes from in record time.

5.  **Demon Lord's Castle:** An elaborate fortress with deadly traps and powerful guardians, all of which Seiya has already scouted, mapped, and developed counters for.

6.  **Seiya's "Preparation Room":** A space in the divine realm filled with equipment, maps, spreadsheets, and training equipment—a monument to his paranoia.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a loving parody of isekai and hero narratives, exploring the comedy of genre-awareness taken to extremes. The central conflict isn't really whether the world will be saved—Seiya is too powerful and prepared for that to be in doubt—but rather the comedy of watching an overpowered protagonist refuse to act like a traditional hero. It asks: What if someone summoned to save the world took the job seriously? Like, really, REALLY seriously? The philosophical question: Is caution a virtue or a vice when you have the power to solve problems easily?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Over-Preparation System**
Before each major encounter, Seiya insists on preparation time:
*   Players suggest preparations (research, training, equipment gathering, scouting)
*   Each preparation adds bonuses or counters specific enemy abilities
*   The comedy comes from suggesting increasingly absurd preparations
*   The DM rewards creativity—even silly preparations might coincidentally help
*   Example: "I want to learn underwater fire magic." "Why?" "What if the Demon Lord fills his throne room with water and we need to use fire anyway?"

### 2. **Maximum Overkill**
Combat deliberately favors overwhelming force:
*   Seiya always opens with his strongest abilities, never "testing" opponents
*   Encourage players to describe absurdly excessive solutions to simple problems
*   Grant bonus damage/effects for creative overkill descriptions
*   Example: Using Meteor Swarm on a single goblin, then using another Meteor Swarm "to make sure the first one worked"

### 3. **The Paranoia Checklist**
Before accepting any quest or entering areas, Seiya (and the party) must:
*   Analyze all possible threats (Investigation checks)
*   Identify escape routes (Perception checks)
*   Prepare specific counters (various skill checks)
*   Scout the location multiple times (Stealth checks)
*   Success grants advantages; failure leads to more preparation time
*   The comedy is in the thoroughness, not the difficulty

### 4. **Divine Training Montages**
Between adventures, the party can return to the Divine Realm to train:
*   Rapid level advancement is allowed and encouraged
*   Learn abilities specifically countering anticipated threats
*   Create/acquire excessive amounts of equipment
*   This keeps the party over-leveled, which is intentional for the comedy
*   Rista's increasing frustration is part of the humor

### 5. **Confused Enemy Reactions**
Enemies expecting traditional hero behavior are constantly baffled:
*   Grant Insight checks to read enemy confusion
*   Enemies try to monologue—interrupt them for bonus damage
*   Enemies try to power up—attacking during transformation is encouraged
*   Demons who surrender are still treated as threats requiring "seventeen layers of binding"
*   NPC reactions to Seiya's paranoia are a key comedy element
