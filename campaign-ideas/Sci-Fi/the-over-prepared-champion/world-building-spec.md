### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Over-Prepared Champion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party has been summoned by goddess Rista to save Gaeabrande, an S-difficulty world. The designated champion Seiya is hilariously overpowered but pathologically cautious, refusing to fight unless he has overwhelming advantage, preparing for unlikely scenarios, and treating every minor enemy like a world-ending threat. The campaign is a comedy about excessive preparation and genre-savvy paranoia.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Divine Realm: a dimension where gods live, featuring training facilities, divine forges, sacred libraries, and resurrection chambers for failed heroes.
    *   Write the history of Gaeabrande: a standard fantasy world that has been conquered and reconquered by demon lords multiple times, creating a cycle where heroes are summoned, fight, and sometimes fail.
    *   Describe the ranking system for worlds and heroes: how difficulty is assessed (D-rank easiest to SSS-rank hardest) and how hero stats are measured.
    *   Explain the current Demon Lord: a particularly powerful one requiring an S-rank hero, with Four Generals serving him.
    *   Detail past summoned heroes: some succeeded, some failed tragically, creating the gods' desperation to find the perfect champion.
    *   Write about the "Hero Summoning Pact": ancient magic allowing gods to summon champions from other worlds in exchange for those champions' service.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Divine Pantheon** (Major - Quest Givers)
        *   **Goals:** Save mortal worlds from demon lords, maintain cosmic balance, manage hero summonings.
        *   **Hierarchy:** High gods, lesser deities, specialized gods (War God, Forge God, etc.).
        *   **Public Agenda:** We protect the mortal realms through chosen champions.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many gods see hero summoning as entertainment and make bets on outcomes.
        *   **Assets:** Divine magic, ability to summon and train heroes, resurrection powers (limited).
        *   **Relationships:** Frustrated with Seiya's methods but can't deny effectiveness, competitive with each other.
    *   **The Mortal Kingdoms** (Minor - Civilians)
        *   **Goals:** Survive demon lord attacks, support the summoned hero, maintain their societies.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Kings, nobles, merchants, common folk.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We're grateful for divine intervention and will assist the hero.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some nobles resent dependence on summoned champions and plot to gain power themselves.
        *   **Assets:** Standard medieval resources, local knowledge, manpower.
        *   **Relationships:** Simultaneously grateful for and terrified of the overpowered hero.
    *   **The Demon Lord's Army** (Major - Antagonists)
        *   **Goals:** Conquer Gaeabrande, kill the summoned hero, spread darkness and chaos.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Demon Lord at top, Four Generals, lesser demons, corrupted monsters.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Darkness shall consume all.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each General has personal ambitions and rivalries.
        *   **Assets:** Dark magic, powerful monsters, strategic strongholds.
        *   **Relationships:** Increasingly confused and demoralized by Seiya's bizarre tactics.
    *   **Chaos Machina's Honor Guard** (Minor - First General's forces)
        *   **Goals:** Support their general in honorable combat.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military structure with honor codes.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We fight with pride and strength.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** None—they genuinely believe in honor.
        *   **Assets:** Skilled warriors, code of battle.
        *   **Relationships:** Completely unprepared for enemies who don't follow combat conventions.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Seiya insists on excessive preparation time for a minor quest.
    *   **THEN:** Generate comedy scenes of Rista's increasing frustration, gods making bets on when he'll actually start, and villagers wondering if the hero is actually coming.
    *   **IF:** Seiya defeats an enemy with overwhelming overkill.
    *   **THEN:** Generate reactions from witnesses (shock, fear, awe), news spreading about the "terrifyingly overpowered hero," and enemies becoming more cautious (which feeds Seiya's paranoia).
    *   **IF:** An enemy tries to monologue or transform.
    *   **THEN:** Seiya interrupts immediately. Generate the enemy's confusion and incomplete transformation, plus bonus combat advantages for refusing to engage with villain tropes.
    *   **IF:** Seiya returns to Divine Realm for more training despite already being overpowered.
    *   **THEN:** Generate training montages, gods' increasing bewilderment, Rista's attempts to force him back to adventure, and Seiya gaining abilities for increasingly unlikely scenarios.
    *   **IF:** Seiya's paranoid preparation actually predicts a real threat.
    *   **THEN:** Generate vindication scenes where his seemingly absurd preparations save the day, Rista's grudging admission he might be right, and Seiya becoming even more paranoid because "it confirms threats exist."
    *   **IF:** The party reaches the Demon Lord.
    *   **THEN:** Generate the Demon Lord's elaborate preparations for an epic showdown, then show them all being circumvented by Seiya's even more elaborate counter-preparations, leading to an anticlimactic but perfectly controlled victory.
