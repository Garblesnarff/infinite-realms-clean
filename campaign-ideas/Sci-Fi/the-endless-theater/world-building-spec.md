# The Endless Theater - World-Building Specification

## Caden's Vision

### The Project
Creating life-sized perfect replica of world inside theater. Every person must be cast. Every location must be built. Every moment must be performed. It's impossible. He knows. But he's trying anyway because understanding life through art is all he has.

### Why He's Doing This
Believes performed life is more authentic than lived life. Performance requires conscious choice of every action. Living happens automatically. Theater forces intentionality. Artifice reveals truth by admitting its artifice.

### How It Started
Small production. Kept growing. Needed more actors, more sets. Theater grew or always was infinite. Now project has consumed his life and everyone in it. Can't stop. Stopping means admitting it's impossible. Continuing means never finishing. Both are death.

### His Fate
Eventually becomes character in his own play. Directing himself directing the play. Cannot exist outside project. Has forgotten if he ever did.

## The Theater's Nature

### Is It Magical?
Maybe. Or maybe just obsession made physical. Or mass delusion. Or actual infinite building. Ambiguous intentionally. Multiple explanations work.

### How Big Is It?
Contains world. Or growing toward that. New areas appear based on need. If party talks about place, set appears. Memory becomes architecture. Theater feeds on narrative.

### Can You Leave?
Yes. No. Maybe. Depends on act you're in. Doors work different times. Or party is allowed to think they can leave—that's part of performance.

### What's Outside?
Unknown. Either: Real world (normal reality), Bigger Theater (it's theaters all the way out), Nothing (theater is all that exists), Same Theater (exit loops back in).

## The Cast and Crew

### How Many Actors?
Hundreds. Thousands? Some play multiple roles. Some play one person their whole lives. Economy of performance unclear. Sometimes seems too few people for production scale. Sometimes too many.

### Do They Know?
Some aware it's theater. Some think it's real. Some know and forget alternately. Some have been here so long the distinction means nothing. Integration levels vary.

### The Hierarchy
- Director (Caden) - vision
- Stage Manager (Millicent) - execution
- Lead Actors (Party) - unknowing stars
- Supporting Cast - everyone else
- Understudies - learning leads
- Extras - background, barely aware
- Crew - maintaining illusion

### Payment
Do actors get paid? Paid in what? Purpose? Existence? Script doesn't mention economy. Maybe that's intentional omission. Focus on art, not commerce. Or maybe they're all prisoners refusing to acknowledge it.

## The Philosophical Framework

### Life as Performance
Goffman's dramaturgical theory made literal. All social interaction is performance. We present curated selves. Backstage vs. frontstage. Theater just makes it visible.

### Authenticity Paradox
Trying to be authentic is itself performance. Most genuine moments are unrehearsed, unconscious. But performing authenticity with full awareness—is that more or less real?

### The Artist's Trap
Caden's problem: Trying to capture life perfectly requires removing self from life. Observer effect. By studying, he stops living. Art consumes artist.

### Metatheatricality
Theater aware it's theater. Party aware they're performing. Awareness doesn't enable escape—makes escape meaningless. If all is performance, performing escape is just another act.

## Campaign Structure

### Early: Uncanny
Theater seems normal but details wrong. Players feel something off. Investigation begins.

### Middle: Revelation
Discovering they've been here longer than thought. Life is performance. Boundaries dissolving. Horror mounting.

### Late: Choice
Accept theater, escape theater, or transcend question? What does ending mean? How do you conclude?

### Ending: ???
Deliberately ambiguous. Whatever party chooses, hint it might be part of script. Or maybe they finally broke free. Or maybe both. Schrödinger's ending.

## The Exit Question

**If party finds EXIT, what's behind it?**

Option 1: Real world. They were trapped, now free. Relief but also loss—theater had meaning.

Option 2: Another theater. Escape was illusion. Or theater is infinite. Despair or acceptance?

Option 3: Void. Nothing. Theater was all that exists. Exit is death. Still better than prison?

Option 4: Same theater. It loops. You can leave but only to arrive. Sisyphean cycle.

Option 5: The Real Theater. What they thought was theater was real life. Actual theater is beyond door. Everything inverts.

**DM should choose based on campaign themes, or let party's choices determine.**

## Ending Implications

### If They Escape
- Are they really out or still performing?
- Lost community of theater
- Freedom but purposeless
- Always wondering if outside is also stage

### If They Stay
- Accepted theater as home
- Found meaning in performance
- Surrendered to director's vision
- Or became directors themselves

### If They Transcend
- Understood theater/life distinction is false
- Perform consciously with full awareness
- Neither trapped nor free
- Artists of their own existence

### If They End It
- Brought play to conclusion
- Faced whatever comes after
- Mortality accepted
- Theater closes, meaning unknown

The campaign asks: "If your life were a play, would you want to know?"
