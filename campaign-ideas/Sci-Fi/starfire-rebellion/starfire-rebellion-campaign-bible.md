# Starfire Rebellion [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
The galaxy groans under the iron fist of the Stellar Imperium, a tyrannical interstellar empire that crushes dissent, exploits resources, and enforces its will through overwhelming military might. Across countless star systems, whispers of rebellion grow louder. A diverse group of individuals – smugglers, ex-soldiers, disenfranchised nobles, and alien freedom fighters – united by a shared desire for freedom, must ignite the "Starfire Rebellion." They will gather allies, conduct daring raids, expose Imperial atrocities, and ultimately lead a desperate, galaxy-spanning war to overthrow the oppressive regime and restore liberty to the stars.

## Setting [SETTING: Classic Space Opera]
The galaxy is a vast, diverse tapestry of star systems, all connected by a network of hyperspace lanes. From the glittering, opulent Core Worlds, where Imperial power is absolute, to the desolate, exploited mining colonies and the untamed, dangerous Frontier sectors, the Imperium's reach is long. The aesthetic is classic space opera: sleek starships, bustling spaceports, alien species, and advanced technology, but with a grim undertone of oppression and constant surveillance. The stars are beautiful, but freedom is a distant dream for many.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **Imperial Capital (Nova Roma):** [LOCATION: Capital City] The heart of the Stellar Imperium, a colossal ecumenopolis spanning an entire planet. It is a marvel of engineering and a symbol of Imperial power, heavily fortified and patrolled by elite forces.
*   **The Frontier Outpost (Kessel's End):** [LOCATION: Border World] A lawless, dusty mining colony on the edge of Imperial space. It's a haven for smugglers, pirates, and those seeking to escape the Imperium's gaze, but also a dangerous place where Imperial patrols are rare but brutal.
*   **The Rebel Base (Hidden Asteroid):** [LOCATION: Secret Base] A mobile or hidden base of operations for the nascent Starfire Rebellion, often located within a nebula, a hollowed-out asteroid, or a forgotten deep-space station. It's a hub for planning, repairs, and recruitment.
*   **The Slave Mines of Xylos:** [LOCATION: Prison Colony] A brutal Imperial penal colony on a desolate, resource-rich planet. Sentient beings from across the galaxy are forced into back-breaking labor, extracting rare minerals under harsh conditions.
*   **The Ancient Shipyard (Precursor Ruin):** [LOCATION: Ancient Ruin] The derelict remains of a colossal, pre-Imperial alien shipyard, rumored to contain lost technologies or dormant super-weapons that could turn the tide of the war.

## Factions [FACTION: Political]
