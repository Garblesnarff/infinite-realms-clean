# Creative Brief: Neon Shadows

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cyberpunk Fantasy Fusion (Shadowrun-inspired)

Inspired by the unique blend of cyberpunk and fantasy in *Shadowrun*, *Blade Runner* aesthetics, and urban dystopia merged with magic. This style captures neon-soaked streets where elves wear cyberware, shamans hack the Matrix, and dragons run megacorporations.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Genre Fusion:** High-tech cyberware on fantasy races, magic and technology coexisting
*   **Neon Dystopia:** Rain-slicked streets, corporate towers, holographic advertising
*   **Metahuman Diversity:** Orks, trolls, elves, dwarves with cybernetic enhancements
*   **Dual Realities:** Physical world and Matrix/Astral spaces visible simultaneously

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Cyberpunk fantasy, neon noir, corporate dystopia, magic returns, street level, high-tech low-life
*   **Feeling:** The gritty excitement of heists mixed with existential dread of corporate control. Magic breaking through technology's sterile future.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Neon Dominance:** Hot pink, electric blue, acid green, toxic yellow
*   **Urban Decay:** Dark grays, blacks, rust, grime
*   **Magic Intrusion:** Purple-pink astral glow, spirit manifestations
*   **Corporate:** Clean whites, chrome, sterile environments in contrast
*   **Always Raining:** Wet reflections multiply neon colors
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of hot pink and electric blue neon reflecting off rain-slicked streets. Dark grays and blacks dominate with acid green holographic ads. Purple-pink magical auras contrast with chrome cyberware. Corporate towers glow white sterile above grimy street level. Everything is wet with rain."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Street Samurai:** Chrome limbs, cyberware implants, military gear, orks/humans
*   **Decker:** Cyberdeck (portable computer), neural implants, more subtle tech
*   **Mage:** Robes or street clothes, magical auras visible, carrying fetishes
*   **Metahumans:** Orks with tusks and cyberware, trolls massive with implants, elves elegant with tech
*   **Cyberware:** Visible chrome, glowing implants, artificial limbs, weapon ports
*   **Prompt Example:** "An ork street samurai with chrome cyber-arm, tusks, mohawk, wearing armored jacket covered in neon lights. Next to them, an elven decker with neural implants visible at temples, holding glowing cyberdeck. Behind them, a human mage with purple astral aura and tribal tattoos. All on rain-slicked Seattle street with neon signs."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Sprawl:** Dystopian megacity, neon everywhere, holographic ads, rain always falling
*   **Corporate Arcologies:** Massive buildings, clean interiors, security everywhere
*   **The Barrens:** Lawless zones, ruins, squatter settlements, no neon
*   **The Matrix:** Visualized as neon cyberspace—data as geometric shapes, ICE as digital entities
*   **Astral Space:** Magical overlay—auras visible, spirits manifest, mana flows
*   **Prompt Example:** "2075 Seattle at night—perpetual rain falls. Neon signs in Japanese and English advertise cyberware and soy products. Holographic ads float above streets. Massive corporate towers loom above street-level decay. An ork ghetto shows makeshift shelters. In distance, Renraku Arcology—mile-high fortress. Cybered metahumans walk streets."

**5. Technology and Magic:**
*   **Cyberware:** Chrome prosthetics, glowing neural implants, weapon systems
*   **Drones:** Flying and ground robots, some armed, surveillance everywhere
*   **The Matrix:** Neon data streams, geometric ICE, digital avatars fighting
*   **Magic:** Visible auras, elemental spirits manifesting, spell effects
*   **Fusion:** Mages with cybereyes, shamans using commlinks, magic-enhanced tech
*   **Prompt Example:** "A decker's Matrix view—neon geometric cyberspace. They navigate data streams visualized as flowing lights. ICE (security) appears as angular entities. Simultaneously show astral space—mage sees magical auras overlapping. A technomancer combines both—digital magic. Cyberpunk and fantasy literally merged."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Neon Noir:** High contrast with multiple neon light sources
*   **Rain Reflections:** Everything doubled in wet streets
*   **Corporate Sterile:** Harsh fluorescent, no warmth
*   **Magic Glow:** Soft purple-pink from spells and spirits
*   **Matrix:** Pure neon geometry
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by multiple neon sources—pink signs, blue holographic ads, green underglow. Rain reflects all light, doubling colors on wet pavement. Harsh shadows between lights. A mage's spell adds purple-pink glow. Corporate building windows show cold fluorescent interior. Cybereyes gleam in darkness."

## Voice

A hardboiled street-smart narrator with tech-savvy slang and urban edge. The pacing is quick, matching high-speed data transfers and quick combat. The tone shifts between cynical street wisdom and wonder at magic's return. Mixing cyberpunk slang ("chummer," "drek," "frag") with fantasy elements. Underlying theme of humanity fighting corporate dehumanization. The voice carries both digital and spiritual awareness. Role: The voice of street-level survival in a high-tech magical dystopia.
