    *   **THEN:** Problem is solved but his reputation suffers. Yukino and Yui are concerned. Relationship strain increases.
    *   **IF:** A case forces them to confront their own codependency.
    *   **THEN:** Crisis point. They must choose: continue fake cooperation or risk genuine honesty.
    *   **IF:** Hachiman makes his "genuine" request—wants real connection, not pretense.
    *   **THEN:** All three must be honest about feelings. Yukino confronts family. Yui admits feelings. Hachiman chooses vulnerability over cynicism.
