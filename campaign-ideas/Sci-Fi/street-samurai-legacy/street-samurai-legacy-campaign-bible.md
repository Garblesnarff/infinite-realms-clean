# Street Samurai Legacy [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi (Cyberpunk)]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In the neon-drenched, perpetually rainy metropolis of Neo-Kyoto, megacorporations rule with an iron fist, their influence extending from gleaming corporate towers to the grimy, multi-tiered streets below. Amidst this urban sprawl, a new breed of warrior has emerged: the "Street Samurai." These cybernetically enhanced individuals, often wielding advanced katanas and adhering to a modern code of Bushido, navigate the treacherous landscape of corporate espionage, gang warfare, and political intrigue. The players are Street Samurai, fighting for justice, profit, or personal honor in a world where technology and ancient traditions clash, struggling to maintain their humanity in a society that constantly seeks to commodify and control it.

## Setting [SETTING: Cyberpunk Metropolis]
Neo-Kyoto is a colossal, multi-tiered metropolis, a testament to human ingenuity and corporate greed. The upper levels are pristine, holographic-laden corporate districts, while the middle tiers are bustling commercial zones. The lower levels, the "Undercity," are a chaotic, perpetually shadowed labyrinth of slums, black markets, and gang territories. Japanese cultural influences are pervasive, blending seamlessly with Western cyberpunk tropes: ramen stalls next to chrome-plated noodle bars, ancient temples nestled between towering data-spires. The air is thick with pollution, the glow of neon, and the hum of countless cybernetic implants.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]

*   **The Neon Dojo:** [LOCATION: Training Ground] A hidden, traditional dojo nestled within the heart of the Undercity. It serves as a training ground, sanctuary, and meeting place for a specific clan of Street Samurai, adhering to ancient martial arts and modern cybernetics.
