# Creative Brief: The Song of Redemption

## Art Style: Emotional Redemption Drama (A Silent Voice-inspired)

Captures the heavy emotional weight of guilt and disability awareness while maintaining hope for redemption. Visual metaphors for communication barriers and healing. Emphasis on body language and visual communication.

### Core Principles:

*   **Visual Communication:** Since Shoko is deaf, emphasize body language, facial expressions, and sign language.
*   **Guilt Visualization:** X marks on faces, muffled/distorted environments, representing Shoya's psychological state.
*   **Water Imagery:** Frequent use of water, bridges, koi fish—symbols of cleansing, flow, and life.

### Detailed Style Guide:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:** Heavy, emotional, hopeful despite pain, honest about difficult topics, ultimately redemptive.

**2. Color Palette:** Muted, washed-out colors early in campaign (representing Shoya's guilt-filtered world). Gradually becomes more vibrant as healing occurs. Water blues are prominent. Pink for cherry blossoms representing renewal.

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Shoko:** Gentle appearance, wears hearing aids, communicates expressively through body language and sign language. Often smiling despite pain.
*   **Shoya:** Slouched, avoiding eye contact (looks down or away), gradually stands taller. X marks visualized on others' faces from his perspective.
*   **Others:** Each designed to show their role in the bullying and its aftermath.

**4. Backgrounds:** Modern academy, the bridge over water (crucial location), Shoko's home, festival grounds, sign language school.

**5. Lighting:** Often soft, diffused light through water or glass—creating distance. As healing progresses, lighting becomes clearer and more direct.

**6. Visual Metaphors:** X marks on faces disappearing, muffled sound becoming clear, water/bridges for communication and cleansing, fireworks for moments of breakthrough, sign language as beautiful visual poetry.

## Voice

**Narrator Voice:** Heavy, emotional, deeply honest about difficult topics (bullying, disability, suicide) but ultimately hopeful about redemption and healing. Gentle and respectful when discussing disability. The voice of someone who has witnessed profound pain and precious healing. Studio-quality with occasional muffled effect when representing Shoya's guilt-filtered perception, clearing to crystal clarity as healing occurs.

**Content Warning:** This campaign deals with bullying, disability, and suicide. The narrator should handle these topics with care, sensitivity, and ultimate hope.
