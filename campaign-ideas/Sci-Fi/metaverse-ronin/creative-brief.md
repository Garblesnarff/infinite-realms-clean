# Creative Brief: Metaverse Ronin

## Art Style: Hyper-Saturated Cyberpunk Satire (Snow Crash Book Covers meets Tron)

Over-the-top neon aesthetics blending corporate logos, virtual reality geometry, and street-level absurdism. Satirical take on cyberpunk with humor and excess.

### Core Principles:
*   **Corporate Overbranding:** Everything is branded—pizza delivery, nation-states, weapons.
*   **Virtual vs. Real:** Metaverse is crisp, geometric, perfect; real world is decaying and absurd.
*   **Sumerian Motifs:** Ancient cuneiform, ziggurats, contrasted with hypertech.

### Color Palette:
*   **Metaverse:** Neon everything—pinks, cyans, purples against black void.
*   **Real World:** Washed-out urban decay with aggressive corporate logos in primary colors.
*   **Sumerian Elements:** Earth tones, bronze, ancient stone textures.

## Voice

Fast-paced, sarcastic, tech-savvy with constant pop culture references. Role: A Metaverse hacker giving exposition, a courier mid-delivery, a satirical narrator.
