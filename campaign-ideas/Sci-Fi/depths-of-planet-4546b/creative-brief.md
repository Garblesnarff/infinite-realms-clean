# Creative Brief: Depths of Planet 4546B

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Bioluminescent Deep Sea Horror (Subnautica-inspired)

Inspired by the breathtaking underwater vistas and creeping terror of *Subnautica*. This style combines the vibrant, alien beauty of bioluminescent ocean life with the oppressive darkness and isolation of deep-sea exploration. The emphasis is on the contrast between the colorful, living ecosystems of the shallows and the pitch-black, predator-filled abyss.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Underwater Immersion:** Every scene should feel unmistakably aquatic—light filtering through water, particles floating, the sense of being surrounded by the ocean.
*   **Bioluminescence:** Use glowing, vibrant colors for alien flora and fauna, especially in darker environments. This creates both beauty and unease.
*   **Scale & Isolation:** Emphasize the vastness of the ocean and the smallness of the characters, creating a sense of vulnerability and awe.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tense, claustrophobic, mysterious, bioluminescent, escalating terror, isolation, alien beauty, aquatic survival.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of wonder at the alien ocean's beauty, mixed with growing dread as the depths reveal their secrets. The mood shifts from curious exploration in the shallows to suffocating fear in the abyssal zones.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Organic, flowing lines for sea life and environments. Smooth, hydrodynamic forms for creatures and technology.
*   **Forms:** Alien sea creatures range from elegant, jellyfish-like beings to nightmarish, serpentine Leviathans. Technology is sleek and futuristic, designed for underwater function.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed digital painting of an alien underwater environment in the style of Subnautica. Smooth, flowing organic forms dominate, with bioluminescent creatures drifting through the water."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant, saturated colors in the shallows (blues, greens, pinks, purples), gradually shifting to darker, more muted tones in the depths, with pops of bioluminescent glow.
*   **Shallow Colors:** Bright azure blues, emerald greens, coral pinks, and sunlit yellows.
*   **Deep Colors:** Deep navy, black, with striking bioluminescent blues, greens, and purples creating contrast.
*   **Kharaa Colors:** Sickly green pustules, glowing veins, diseased yellows—visually unsettling.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette of azure blues and emerald greens for the shallow reef, with bioluminescent purple and blue flora glowing softly in the filtered sunlight."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** D&D adventurers in futuristic diving suits, oxygen tanks, and reinforced underwater gear. As they progress, their equipment becomes more advanced (depth modules, exosuits).
*   **Alien Creatures:** Highly varied—some are beautiful and harmless (Peepers, Gasopods), while others are terrifying apex predators (Reaper Leviathans, Sea Dragon Leviathans). All have a distinctly alien, ocean-adapted appearance.
*   **Expression:** Adventurers show tension, focus, and fear. Creatures are alien and often emotionless, making them harder to read and more unsettling.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A D&D adventurer in a reinforced underwater diving suit with a glowing oxygen tank, wielding a scanner device. Nearby, a massive, serpentine Reaper Leviathan with four glowing eyes and mandibles looms in the dark water."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, open underwater vistas in the shallows, shifting to claustrophobic, bioluminescent caverns in the depths.
*   **Atmosphere:** The shallows feel bright and inviting but hide danger. The depths are oppressive, dark, and filled with the unknown. Ancient alien ruins add mystery.
*   **Details:** Kelp forests, coral reefs, bioluminescent mushrooms, thermal vents, alien architecture, skeletal remains of ancient Leviathans, and the ever-present bubbles and water particles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the Lost River biome: a massive, bioluminescent underwater cavern filled with the glowing skeletons of ancient Leviathans. The water is a deep, eerie blue-green, and strange, tree-like bioluminescent plants line the cavern walls."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Light filtering through water creates god rays in the shallows. Bioluminescence provides the only light in the deep. Darkness is ever-present.
*   **Shadows:** Soft, diffused shadows in the shallows. In the depths, shadows are absolute, creating terrifying blind spots.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the transition from the safe, bright shallows to the terrifying, dark depths. It also highlights the alien beauty of bioluminescent life.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by god rays of sunlight filtering through the water from above, creating shimmering beams of light. In the darker areas, bioluminescent creatures glow softly, providing eerie illumination."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Wide, cinematic underwater shots to showcase the scale of the ocean and the creatures within. Close-ups to emphasize the tension of resource gathering or predator encounters.
*   **Techniques:** Use depth of field to create a sense of distance—clear foreground with a hazy, mysterious background. Frame characters against massive creatures or alien structures. Low-angle shots looking up at the surface, or down into the abyss.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot from below, looking up at a D&D adventurer in a small submarine (Seamoth) silhouetted against the bright surface of the ocean. Below them, the dark abyss stretches endlessly, hinting at unseen terrors."

## Voice

A calm, female voice with a slight British accent, pacing that is measured and precise, like a scientist or AI guide. The emotion is controlled curiosity with undercurrents of rising tension as danger approaches. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle underwater resonance—a slight echo and the faint sound of bubbles or water movement. Role: The voice of ECHO, the survival AI, or a documentary narrator describing the alien ocean and its inhabitants.
