# Sons of Ares [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In a dystopian future, humanity is ruled by the iron fist of the "Purity Hegemony," a militaristic, eugenics-obsessed regime that believes in genetic perfection. Society is rigidly stratified: the "Pure" live in pristine, upper-level arcologies, while the "Unfit" (those with genetic imperfections, disabilities, or undesirable traits) are relegated to the polluted, dangerous undercities, forced into menial labor or worse. A secret society, born from the shadows of the undercity and calling themselves the "Sons of Ares," rises to challenge the Hegemony. They are a diverse group of genetically "flawed" individuals, augmented with scavenged tech and fueled by a burning desire to reclaim their humanity and dismantle the oppressive system.

## Setting [SETTING: Dystopian Future]
The world is a grim, hyper-militarized future. Cities are colossal, stratified megastructures, piercing perpetually smoggy skies. The upper levels gleam with the cold, sterile efficiency of the Purity Hegemony, while the lower levels are a sprawling, chaotic labyrinth of makeshift dwellings, black markets, and forgotten infrastructure, perpetually shrouded in shadow and pollution. Advanced technology is ubiquitous, but it is primarily used for surveillance, control, and warfare, not for the comfort or freedom of the masses. The air is often thick with industrial waste, and the only natural light is a distant, filtered glow.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Citadel of Purity (Upper City):** [LOCATION: Government Hub] The gleaming, central arcology of the Purity Hegemony. It houses the ruling council, the genetic archives, and the elite military. Its defenses are impenetrable, and its citizens live lives of sterile luxury.
*   **The Iron Labyrinth (Undercity):** [LOCATION: Slum] A sprawling, multi-layered undercity beneath the Citadel, home to millions of "Unfit." It's a dangerous, anarchic place of narrow alleys, makeshift markets, and hidden resistance cells.
*   **The Ares Forge (Hidden Base):** [LOCATION: Secret Base] The hidden, mobile base of operations for the Sons of Ares, often located in abandoned industrial complexes or deep within the forgotten maintenance tunnels of the undercity. It's a hub for tech modification and tactical planning.
*   **The Genetic Reclamation Centers:** [LOCATION: Prison/Lab] Hegemony facilities disguised as "re-education" centers, where "Unfit" individuals are subjected to brutal genetic "correction" experiments or harvested for organs.
*   **The Silent Wastes:** [LOCATION: Wasteland] The polluted, irradiated lands outside the megacities, where failed genetic experiments roam and ancient, forgotten technologies lie buried. It's a dangerous but resource-rich area.

## Factions [FACTION: Political]
*   **The Purity Hegemony:** [FACTION: Totalitarian Government] The ruling military-scientific dictatorship. They believe in genetic purity as the key to humanity's survival and progress, ruthlessly suppressing any deviation.
*   **The Sons of Ares:** [FACTION: Rebel Underground] A diverse, decentralized resistance movement composed of "Unfit" individuals. They fight for freedom, equality, and the right to exist without genetic discrimination.
*   **The Bio-Engineers Guild:** [FACTION: Corporate/Scientific] A powerful, amoral corporate entity that works closely with the Hegemony, developing advanced genetic modifications and cybernetic augmentations, often testing them on the "Unfit."
*   **The Data Ghosts:** [FACTION: Hacker Collective] A shadowy network of hackers and information brokers operating within the Hegemony's vast data networks. They specialize in exposing corruption and providing intelligence to the resistance.
*   **The Iron Guard:** [FACTION: Elite Military] The elite, genetically perfected soldiers of the Purity Hegemony. They are cybernetically enhanced, fanatically loyal, and equipped with the most advanced weaponry.

## NPCs [NPC: Key]
*   **Commander Valerius Thorne:** [NPC: Antagonist] The ruthless, charismatic leader of the Iron Guard and a staunch believer in the Purity Hegemony. He is genetically perfect and utterly devoid of empathy for the "Unfit." (Male, 40s, cold, efficient)
*   **"Ghost" Anya:** [NPC: Hacker] The enigmatic, brilliant leader of the Data Ghosts. She operates from the deepest corners of the network, her true identity unknown, but her influence is vast. (Female, unknown age, elusive, strategic)

*   **"The Oracle" Silas:** [NPC: Psychic] An ancient, blind "Unfit" individual living in the Silent Wastes, rumored to possess powerful psychic abilities that allow him to see glimpses of the past and future. (Male, 80s, cryptic, wise)
*   **Ares-7 (The Prototype):** [NPC: Genetically Modified] A failed Hegemony super-soldier prototype, escaped from a Genetic Reclamation Center. He is a hulking, powerful figure, but mentally unstable and prone to berserker rages. (Male, 20s, tragic, dangerous)
