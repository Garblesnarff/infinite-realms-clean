**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party consists of Reds—the lowest caste in a color-coded hierarchy on colonized Mars, mining helium-3 in brutal underground conditions to "terraform the surface" (actually a lie—the surface has been habitable for generations). When recruited by the Sons of Ares (rebel group), one party member is surgically transformed into a Gold (the ruling elite) and infiltrates the Institute—a brutal academy where young Golds compete in war games to prove their dominance. The party must navigate the deadly politics of Gold society, maintain their Red identity in secret, and spark a revolution that shatters the entire color caste system. The campaign explores class warfare, identity, the corruption of power, and whether revolution requires becoming the monster you fight.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Color Caste System**
*   Society is divided by color: Golds (rulers), Silvers (business/finance), Coppers (bureaucrats), Blues (pilots), Greens (scientists), Yellows (doctors), Oranges (mechanics), Grays (soldiers), Obsidians (warriors), Pinks (pleasure), Reds (laborers), down through Browns, Violets.
*   **Mechanics:** Each color has distinct culture, privileges, and restrictions. The party's infiltration requires mastering Gold culture.

### 2. **Razor Combat**
*   Razors are whip-swords made of nano-material, the signature weapon of Golds.
*   **Mechanics:** Versatile weapons (whip form for range, blade form for close combat), require training to master.

### 3. **The Institute Trials**
*   Young Golds compete in a year-long war game, capturing enemy House standards, forming alliances, engaging in combat.
*   **Mechanics:** Strategic gameplay—resource management, alliance building, betrayal, brutal combat with permanent consequences (deaths are real).

### 4. **Surgical Enhancement**
*   Carvers can modify bodies—Reds are short and weak, Golds are tall and strong. The party member is carved into Gold physiology.
*   **Mechanics:** Physical stat increases but identity crisis. Risk of exposure if bloodwork is analyzed.

### 5. **The Sons of Ares Network**
*   Underground rebellion spanning all low colors.
*   **Mechanics:** The party receives secret missions, supplies, and intelligence while maintaining cover.

## Campaign Outcomes

*   **Revolution Ignited:** The party exposes the terraforming lie, unites the low colors, and overthrows the Gold oligarchy.
*   **Gold from Within:** The party rises to power among Golds and reforms the system from the top (risks corruption).
*   **Martyrdom:** The party is exposed and executed, but their sacrifice inspires larger rebellion.
*   **Pyrrhic Victory:** The revolution succeeds but the party becomes tyrants, replacing one caste system with another.
*   **Stalemate:** Society fractures into civil war between colors with no clear victor.
