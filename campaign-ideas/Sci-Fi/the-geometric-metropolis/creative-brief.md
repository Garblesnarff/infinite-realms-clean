# Creative Brief: The Geometric Metropolis

## Art Style: Art Deco (Tamara de Lempicka / Erte-inspired)

Geometric luxury, streamlined forms, zigzag patterns, stepped pyramids, chrome and glass, machine-age glamour.

### Core Principles:
- **Geometric Precision**: Sharp angles, zigzags, chevrons, stepped forms
- **Streamlined Elegance**: Aerodynamic curves, sleek surfaces, chrome finish
- **Vertical Emphasis**: Soaring towers, stepped ziggurats, upward thrust
- **Luxury Materials**: Chrome, glass, exotic woods, geometric mosaics
- **Bold Color Blocks**: Contrast of black/white/gold, or jewel tones in geometric patterns

### Visual Style:
Sleek, elegant, precise. Everything designed. No organic randomness. Humans stylized as geometric ideals.

## Music: Jazz Age / Big Band / Noir
Duke Ellington, Gershwin. Saxophone, brass, piano. Smooth, sophisticated, slightly melancholic. Prohibition-era speakeasy atmosphere.

## Voice Acting:
Transatlantic accent, smooth and cultured. Noir detective cadence. Emphasis on sophistication and precision in speech.
