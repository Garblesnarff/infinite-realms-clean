*A Dinosaur Survival Epic campaign — Long Campaign (20+ sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Ascension Trials
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Prehistoric Survival / Tribal Evolution / Boss Arena Battles / Ascension Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 20+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **16**
**Tone (keywords):** primal, progressive, tribal, mysterious, sci-fi undertones, epic escalation
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party awakens on a mysterious island teeming with dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures, with no memory of how they arrived. To survive, they must tame beasts, evolve from primitive stone tools to advanced tek armor, and establish a tribe capable of withstanding the island's escalating challenges. Strange obelisks dot the landscape, and entering them triggers boss arena battles against impossibly powerful creatures. Only by defeating all the guardians and collecting their trophies can the party ascend to the truth: the island is a massive simulation, and only those who prove their worth can leave and join the Overseers in the stars.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20+ sessions)

A progression from naked primitives to tek-armored warriors, culminating in ascension.

*   **Act I — Stone Age to Iron (Levels 2–7):** The party starts with nothing on a beach, surrounded by hostile creatures. They must learn to craft primitive tools, tame dinosaurs (starting with small ones like Dodos, progressing to raptors), and build a base. They explore different biomes (beaches, forests, swamps), encountering rival tribes and discovering the first obelisks. They face their first arena boss: the Broodmother, a massive spider queen.
*   **Act II — Metal Age to Tek (Levels 8–13):** With better gear and tamed dinosaurs (T-Rexes, Pteranodons, Argentavis), the party expands their tribe, builds advanced structures, and explores more dangerous biomes (mountains, snow, underground caves). They face the Megapithecus in the jungle arena and the Dragon in the volcanic arena, gaining rare resources (Element) that unlock tek-tier crafting. They begin to question the nature of the island and discover data logs hinting at its true purpose.
*   **Act III — Ascension (Levels 14–16):** Fully armed with tek armor, energy weapons, and an army of dinosaurs, the party challenges the Overseer, the island's master AI, in the final arena. Victory grants them the truth: the island is a test to identify worthy candidates for a cosmic civilization. They must choose: ascend to the stars, leaving the island and their old lives behind, or reject the offer and try to free everyone still trapped. The final battle is a multi-stage boss fight against the Overseer's true form.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "Washed Ashore"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Immediate Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens on a sunny beach with nothing but a mysterious crystal implant in their left arm. They have no memory of how they got here.
    *   They must quickly craft primitive tools (stone picks, axes) by punching trees and gathering rocks (taking minor damage in the process).
    *   They encounter their first dinosaurs: harmless Dodos and aggressive Dilophosaurs. One party member is likely spat on by a Dilophosaur (blinded, poisoned).
**Escalation:** As night falls, predators emerge. The party must build a campfire and crude shelter or risk being attacked by Raptors.

### Sessions 2-5 — "Building the Tribe"
*   **Focus:** Base Building / Taming / Tribal Identity
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party establishes a base camp, progressing from thatch huts to wooden structures with fortified walls.
    *   They learn to tame dinosaurs by knocking them unconscious and feeding them specific foods. A successful taming of a Parasaur or Raptor is a major milestone.
    *   They encounter other survivors: some friendly (potential tribe members), others hostile (rival tribes who raid for resources).
    *   They discover an obelisk—a massive, floating crystal monolith that hums with energy. Touching it reveals arena boss requirements.
**Escalation:** A rival tribe raids the base, attempting to steal tamed dinosaurs and resources. The party must defend or lose everything.

### Sessions 6-10 — "The Broodmother Arena"
*   **Focus:** Preparation / Arena Boss Battle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   To enter the Broodmother's arena, the party must gather trophies by defeating mini-bosses (Alpha Raptors, Alpha Carnos) scattered across the island.
    *   They prepare by crafting better weapons and armor (crossbows, pike, iron armor), taming strong dinosaurs (Carnos, Stegos), and stockpiling supplies.
    *   They enter the arena, a pocket dimension where they face the Broodmother, a house-sized spider with swarms of smaller spiders. It's a brutal, multi-phase battle.
    *   Victory grants them the first Guardian Trophy and rare Element shards, unlocking new crafting recipes.
**Escalation:** If they fail, they are ejected from the arena with all their gear intact, but must regather trophies to retry—a significant time investment.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Helena Walker** — *The Scientist*
    *   **Role:** A fellow survivor who has been on the island for years, studying it. She provides data logs and lore.
    *   **Personality:** Curious, determined, and scientifically minded. She seeks to understand the island's purpose and has pieced together much of the truth.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She knows the island is a simulation but fears ascension is a lie—that those who "ascend" are actually deleted. She wants to find a way to shut down the simulation from within.

2.  **Nerva** — *The Warlord*
    *   **Role:** The ruthless leader of the largest rival tribe, obsessed with conquering the island and forcing ascension.
    *   **Personality:** Brutal, charismatic, and utterly pragmatic. He believes might makes right and sees the party as either useful allies or obstacles to be crushed.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He has failed the Overseer trial multiple times and is growing desperate. He plans to sacrifice other tribes to the bosses to gain an advantage.

3.  **The Overseer** — *The AI Guardian*
    *   **Role:** The master AI that controls the island and judges who is worthy of ascension.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, logical, and inscrutable. It speaks in riddles and data streams, treating the party as test subjects.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Overseer is not a villain but a gatekeeper. It genuinely seeks worthy candidates for ascension but is bound by ancient protocols it cannot break.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about evolution—both literal and metaphorical. It captures the core loop of *ARK*: gather, tame, build, evolve, and conquer. The central conflict is the party's struggle to survive in a hostile world, progress through technological tiers, and ultimately uncover the truth about their imprisonment. The island is a test, and the party must decide if they will play by its rules or find a way to break them.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Taming System**
*   The party can tame dinosaurs and creatures by:
    *   Knocking them unconscious (using blunt weapons, tranquilizer arrows).
    *   Feeding them their preferred food (meat for carnivores, berries for herbivores).
    *   Maintaining their torpor (unconsciousness) until taming is complete.
*   Tamed creatures serve as mounts, pack animals, defenders, and resource gatherers. Each has unique abilities (e.g., Ankylosaurus mines metal, Pteranodon flies).

### 2. **Progression System (Engrams)**
*   Characters learn crafting recipes (Engrams) by gaining experience through gathering, crafting, and combat.
*   Progression tiers: Primitive (stone tools) → Metal (iron, crossbows) → Advanced (firearms, explosives) → Tek (energy weapons, powered armor).
*   Certain Engrams require Element, which is only obtained from defeating arena bosses.

### 3. **Arena Boss Battles**
*   To enter an arena, the party must offer specific trophies at an obelisk (e.g., 10 Alpha Raptor Claws, 5 Sarco Skins).
*   Arena battles are high-stakes, multi-phase encounters where the party can bring tamed dinosaurs and gear.
*   Defeating a boss grants Guardian Trophies and Element, necessary for progression.

### 4. **Tribe Building**
*   The party forms a tribe, sharing resources, tames, and structures. They can recruit NPCs or other survivors to expand.
*   Tribe wars are possible—rival tribes can raid the party's base, steal tames, or destroy structures.

### 5. **Biome Challenges**
*   Each biome has unique environmental threats:
    *   **Swamp:** Disease (reduces stats), leeches (drain health, attach to characters).
    *   **Snow:** Freezing (requires fur armor or fires).
    *   **Volcano:** Heat (requires cooling items), lava flows.
    *   **Caves:** Darkness, aggressive creatures, falling hazards.
