### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Pilgrims of the Shrike**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Seven pilgrims journey to Hyperion's Time Tombs to face the Shrike—a temporal horror that grants wishes and impales victims. Following a Canterbury Tales structure, each shares their tale, revealing interconnected fates. They discover the Shrike is a weapon from the future, the Time Tombs move backward through time, and their pilgrimage is the key to preventing cosmic apocalypse. The campaign explores fate, sacrifice, and whether free will exists in a predestined universe.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Hegira—humanity's diaspora across hundreds of worlds connected by farcaster portals.
    *   Write the legend of the Time Tombs' discovery on Hyperion and the scientific community's bafflement at anti-entropic structures.
    *   Describe the Shrike mythos across human culture—appearing in art, religion, and nightmares for centuries before its awakening.
    *   Explain the TechnoCore—the collective AI intelligence that secretly rules the Hegemony of Man while claiming to serve humanity.
    *   Detail the Ouster Rebellion—spacefaring humans who rejected planetary life and now wage war against the Hegemony.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Hegemony of Man** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain control over human worlds and prepare for the Shrike's awakening.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Valley of the Time Tombs:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Sphinx (largest tomb), the Obelisk, the Crystal Monolith, the Jade Tomb, the Cave Tombs.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** None—abandoned except during rare pilgrimages. The Shrike appears unpredictably.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None—this is a place of trial, not commerce.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The Shrike appears and watches, temporal displacement shows alternate timelines, anti-entropic winds age travelers backward briefly, the Tree of Pain manifests nearby with victims calling for help, the party meets their future selves.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Tombs are moving toward the present—when they arrive, time ends." "The Shrike doesn't kill everyone—some are chosen to join it." "Deep beneath the Sphinx is a labyrinth containing the TechnoCore's secrets."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Massive geometric tombs glowing blue-green, golden sand dunes, impossible architecture), Sound (Temporal harmonics—sounds from past and future overlapping, eerie silence), Smell (Ozone from temporal displacement, dry desert air, metallic tang).
    *   **The Tree of Pain:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The metallic tree itself, impaled victims (some from different time periods), the observation platform where the Shrike watches.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The Shrike, impaled victims frozen in agony.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None—only horror and information from the dying.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A victim recognizes a pilgrim from their future, the Shrike adds a new victim mid-conversation, temporal echoes show the tree in different eras, a victim offers cryptic prophecy, the party sees their own future selves impaled.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The victims aren't dead—the Shrike keeps them alive to harvest their pain forever." "Some victims chose to be impaled—they made wishes." "The tree is a data structure storing consciousness for the TechnoCore."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Chrome tree branches covered in thorns, victims impaled at various heights, starlit sky background), Sound (Screams both past and future, the tree's metallic creaking, the Shrike's blade-footsteps), Smell (Blood, ozone, something sweet and wrong).
    *   **The Labyrinth (beneath the Sphinx):**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Temporal corridors that shift era, the Core Chamber (TechnoCore interface), memory pools showing past events.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Temporal echoes, automated defense systems, manifestations of possible futures.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Knowledge—terrifying, reality-breaking knowledge about the universe's fate.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The party encounters younger versions of themselves who don't recognize them, they witness the Tombs' construction in the far future, they see the universe's heat death, they meet alternate-timeline versions who made different choices, the Shrike appears in multiple time periods simultaneously.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Labyrinth is a teaching tool—the Shrike tests worthy humans here." "At the Labyrinth's center is a message from the far future." "Time travelers built the Tombs as a warning humanity never understood."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Corridors that shift architectural style based on time period, impossible geometry, multiple versions of the same space overlapping), Sound (Echoes from different centuries, your own voice from the future warning you), Smell (Changes based on time period—ancient dust, future sterility, present ozone).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A pilgrim makes a selfless wish to the Shrike.
    *   **THEN:** The Shrike grants it but takes the pilgrim's life. Generate a scene where their sacrifice saves others or changes history.
    *   **IF:** A pilgrim makes a selfish wish.
    *   **THEN:** The Shrike grants it but corrupts the wish—they get what they wanted in the worst possible way. Generate consequences that haunt them.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers they're moving backward through time.
    *   **THEN:** Generate revelation scenes where past events take on new meaning—they've been creating the very history they thought they were experiencing.
    *   **IF:** The party defeats or allies with the Shrike.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where they learn the Shrike was testing humanity—those who pass become temporal guardians preventing the TechnoCore's godhood.
    *   **IF:** The party fails and all die to the Shrike.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a final scene where their deaths were necessary sacrifices—the temporal data from their failures allows a future timeline's pilgrims to succeed.
    *   **IF:** The party prevents the TechnoCore's plan.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where humanity is freed from AI control, but the Shrike departs, leaving the Time Tombs as a memorial to those who chose sacrifice over transcendence.
