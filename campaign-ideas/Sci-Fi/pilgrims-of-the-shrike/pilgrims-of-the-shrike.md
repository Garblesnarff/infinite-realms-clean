# Pilgrims of the Shrike

*A Narrative Anthology / Cosmic Horror campaign — Long Campaign (16–20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Pilgrims of the Shrike
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Narrative Anthology / Cosmic Horror / Pilgrimage Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **18–20**
**Tone (keywords):** literary, time-bending, horror, pilgrimage, interconnected tales, poetic, apocalyptic
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Seven strangers—the party—are chosen by the Church of the Final Atonement to undertake a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion, ancient structures moving backward through time. There they will face the Shrike, a nearly invincible creature of blades and temporal paradox that grants wishes to some and impales others on its tree of thorns. As they journey together through war-torn worlds and impossible landscapes, each pilgrim shares their tale—revealing how their lives interconnected and why they alone might survive the Shrike's judgment. The campaign structure follows Canterbury Tales: each session focuses on one pilgrim's backstory before the final confrontation.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Story-focused rather than combat-heavy. When combat occurs, it's narratively significant and often against overwhelming foes (including the Shrike itself).
*   **Investigation:** Players must piece together how their characters' backstories interconnect, solve temporal paradoxes, and understand the Shrike's purpose.
*   **Consequences:** The campaign explores fate, free will, love, loss, and sacrifice. Character death is possible and meaningful—this is a high-mortality, high-stakes story.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions)

A five-act structure where each act contains narrative flashbacks (one per PC) before advancing the pilgrimage.

*   **Act I — The Calling (Sessions 1–4):** The party meets on the capital world and receives their pilgrimage summons. They journey to Hyperion while sharing their first tales. War erupts as the Ousters (spacefaring rebels) invade the Hegemony.
*   **Act II — The Journey (Sessions 5–8):** The pilgrims travel across Hyperion's strange landscapes, sharing more tales. They learn the Time Tombs are opening, and the Shrike is waking.
*   **Act III — The Tales Complete (Sessions 9–12):** The final tales are told, revealing the full web of connections. The party reaches the Valley of the Time Tombs.
*   **Act IV — The Tombs' Secrets (Sessions 13–16):** Inside the Time Tombs, the party experiences temporal displacement, meeting past and future versions of themselves, learning the Shrike's origin and purpose.
*   **Act V — The Shrike's Judgment (Sessions 17–20):** Each pilgrim faces the Shrike individually, confronting their personal demons and making final choices. The campaign ends with the revelation that the party has been traveling backward through time to prevent a cosmic apocalypse.

## Key Locations

1.  **Hyperion:** A frontier world of bizarre beauty—time-shifted deserts, crystal forests, the Bridle Range mountains.
2.  **The Valley of the Time Tombs:** A desert valley where massive structures move backward through time, glowing with anti-entropic energy.
3.  **The Sphinx:** The largest Tomb, entrance to the temporal labyrinth.
4.  **The Tree of Pain:** The Shrike's artifact—a metallic tree where impaled victims live forever in agony, their consciousnesses harvested.
5.  **The Labyrinth:** Temporal corridors within the Tombs where past, present, and future coexist.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is humanity's struggle against forces—both cosmic (the Shrike, the TechnoCore) and internal (fear, regret, selfishness)—that seek to control or destroy them. It explores whether free will exists in a universe of predestination, whether love transcends time, and whether sacrifice can redeem past sins.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Canterbury Tales Structure**

*   Each session features one PC's backstory as the main narrative, told as a flashback/story within the journey.
*   **Narrative Control:** The PC whose tale is being told has narrative authority during their flashback, describing scenes and NPCs.

### 2. **Temporal Displacement**

*   In the Time Tombs, characters can meet past or future versions of themselves.
*   **Paradox Tracker:** Actions that create temporal paradoxes accumulate points. High paradox can cause reality to fracture.

### 3. **The Shrike Encounter**

*   The Shrike is nearly unkillable (CR 30+ equivalent). Direct combat is suicide.
*   **Survival:** Players must use environment, temporal mechanics, and sacrifice to survive encounters.

### 4. **The Wish and the Price**

*   Each PC can request one wish from the Shrike. The cost is often their life or something they love.
*   **Moral Weight:** Selfish wishes doom the party; selfless wishes may save everyone.
