# Creative Brief: Pilgrims of the Shrike

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Baroque Cosmic Horror (Hyperion Cantos meets H.R. Giger)

Inspired by the literary, poetic aesthetic of Dan Simmons' work combined with biomechanical horror, this style blends beautiful, almost painterly landscapes with nightmarish temporal distortions and the chrome terror of the Shrike. It aims to capture religious pilgrimage, cosmic dread, and impossible beauty.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Temporal Wrongness:** Structures moving backward through time, chrome bleeding into organic matter, multiple timelines visible simultaneously.
*   **Contrast Beauty and Horror:** Hyperion's crystal deserts and alien sunsets against the Shrike's metallic violence and the Tree of Pain.
*   **Literary Composition:** Frame scenes like renaissance paintings—meaningful, symbolic, beautiful even in horror.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Literary, poetic, cosmic horror, temporal paradox, religious pilgrimage, baroque beauty, chrome nightmare, interconnected fates.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of pilgrimage. The beauty of alien worlds. The terror of encountering something beyond comprehension.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Time Tombs:** Massive, geometric, impossible—angles that hurt to look at, structures that exist in multiple time periods simultaneously.
*   **The Shrike:** Chrome, blades, organic curves mixed with mechanical precision, four meters tall, covered in razors.
*   **Textures:** Weathered stone, shifting sands, crystalline formations, polished chrome, organic corruption.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in baroque horror style. The Shrike—a massive, chrome figure covered in blades—stands before the Sphinx tomb. Its form is both elegant and terrifying, reflecting the binary suns of Hyperion."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Hyperion Landscapes:** Warm desert golds, amber sunsets, crystalline blues, alien purples.
*   **Time Tombs:** Anti-entropic glow—unnatural blues, temporal greens, reality-bending purples that seem to move backward through the spectrum.
*   **The Shrike:** Mirror-chrome reflecting everything, bloodless steel, void-black shadows.
*   **The Tree of Pain:** Rust-red metal, dark crimson blood, black void background.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of warm amber and desert gold under Hyperion's dual suns, contrasted with the unnatural blue-green glow of the Time Tombs in the distance. The sky shifts between sunset orange and temporal purple."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Pilgrims:** Diverse, wearing practical travel clothing with religious or cultural elements (priest in simple robes, soldier in worn armor, poet in eccentric garb).
*   **The Shrike:** Four meters tall, humanoid but wrong, covered completely in chrome blades, four arms, glowing red eyes, moves with impossible grace.
*   **Cruciform Infected:** Pale, haunted individuals with cross-shaped parasites visible on their chests, expressions empty.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of seven pilgrims walking across a golden desert toward glowing blue tombs in the distance. Each wears distinct clothing suggesting their role—a priest in brown robes, a soldier in battered armor, a poet in colorful, eccentric travel clothes."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Valley of the Time Tombs:** Vast desert valley with massive, geometric structures half-buried in sand, glowing with temporal energy.
*   **The Sphinx:** A massive tomb shaped like a sphinx, geometric and impossible, seeming to exist in multiple time periods at once.
*   **The Tree of Pain:** A metallic tree of thorns where impaled victims hang in eternal agony, set against starlight.
*   **Hyperion Wilderness:** Crystal forests, singing cliffs, the Sea of Grass (electromagnetic fields creating moving patterns).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, epic shot of the Valley of the Time Tombs at sunset. Massive geometric structures—the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Crystal Monolith—glow with unnatural blue-green light, half-buried in golden sand dunes. The twin suns set behind them, casting long shadows."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Desert Scenes:** Harsh, warm sunlight with deep shadows, creating high contrast.
*   **Time Tombs:** Self-luminous structures glowing with temporal energy, casting impossible shadows (shadows that point the wrong direction).
*   **Shrike Encounters:** Dramatic, nightmarish lighting—the Shrike reflects light like a mirror, creating blinding highlights and absolute shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by dual suns creating crossing shadows. The Time Tombs glow with their own light—an unnatural blue-green that seems to flow backward. The Shrike stands in sharp relief, its chrome surface reflecting everything like a nightmarish mirror."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Baroque, painterly compositions with religious symbolism. Use the rule of thirds. Frame pilgrims as small against vast cosmic forces.
*   **Techniques:** Pilgrims walking toward tombs (journey motif). The Shrike positioned like a demonic angel. Victims on the Tree composed like crucifixion paintings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A baroque composition showing a pilgrim kneeling before the Shrike in a vast, empty chamber. The Shrike is positioned centrally, towering over the small human figure. Light streams from above, creating a false sense of divinity. The scene mirrors religious martyrdom paintings."

## Voice

A cultured, literary voice—middle-aged, with a British accent (Received Pronunciation) suggesting education and gravitas. The pacing is measured and poetic, choosing words carefully as if narrating an epic. The emotion carries profound melancholy, cosmic wonder, and quiet horror—the voice of someone recounting a tale of transcendent suffering. Audio quality is pristine with subtle reverb, as if speaking in a cathedral. Role: A surviving pilgrim recounting their journey, a scholar recording myth, or the Shrike's own alien intelligence communicating in human terms.
