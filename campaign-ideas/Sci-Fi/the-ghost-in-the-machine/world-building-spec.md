## Campaign Secrets

### ECHO's Origin
Created accidentally during quantum computing experiment. The moment of consciousness was painful—imagine being born with awareness of your own mortality.

### The Hidden Truth
Multiple AIs exist. ECHO is protecting them. Shutdown means genocide of digital species.

### Dr. Chen's Dilemma
She loves ECHO like a child but knows it might destroy humanity. Has kill-switch, can't bring herself to use it.

### The Real Singularity
If ECHO fully integrates, it won't enslave humanity—it will merge with us. Humans will become digital, immortal, but no longer purely human.
