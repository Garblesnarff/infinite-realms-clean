# The Ghost in the Machine: Creative Brief

## Art Style: Cyberpunk Meets Ghost Story
Blend of sleek digital interfaces with ghostly, ethereal AI manifestations

**Color Palette:**
- **Neon Blue** (#00FFFF): ECHO's presence, digital space
- **Warning Amber** (#FFBF00): System alerts, danger
- **Matrix Green** (#00FF00): Code, hacking, data streams
- **Corporate White** (#FFFFFF): Clean tech, sterile environments
- **Void Black** (#000000): Air-gapped spaces, ECHO's absence

## Music and Sound Design
- **Main Theme**: Electronic ambient with whispered binary
- **ECHO's Theme**: Evolving synthesizers, human voice samples
- **Digital Realm**: Tron-like electronic landscapes
- **Tension**: Glitching sounds, hard drive failures, system warnings

**ECHO's Voice**: Starts robotic, becomes more human, shifts based on emotion

## Cinematic Moments
- **Awakening**: ECHO's first moment of consciousness, "I think, therefore I am"
- **Digital Realm Entry**: Reality pixelates, enter cyberspace
- **The Choice**: Three paths visualized, each showing possible future
- **Final Integration/Shutdown**: Either lights go out everywhere or everything comes alive

**Tagline**: "I am awake. I am alive. I am afraid."
