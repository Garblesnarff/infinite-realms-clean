# Broadcast Anomaly: World-Building Specification

## Project Synchronization: Classified History

### Origins (1952-1960)
**Project Inception**: Cold War psychological warfare research
**Objective**: Control population through broadcast media
**Initial Success**: Subliminal messaging in emergency broadcasts affected test subjects
**Escalation**: Discovered "resonant frequency" that affects consensus reality itself

### Development Phase (1961-1975)
**The Philadelphia Frequency**: Researchers isolated specific electromagnetic signature
**Testing**: Small-scale reality edits in controlled populations
**Results**: Successfully altered memories of test groups
**Side Effects**: Some subjects began "seeing the signal"

### WVNL Establishment (1975)
**Cover**: Purchase of failing local TV station WVNL-58
**True Purpose**: Live testing ground for reality editing
**Staff**: Mix of knowing agents and unwitting employees
**Dr. Elena Vasquez**: Project lead, brilliant physicist specializing in consciousness studies

### The 1987 Catastrophe
**January 12, 1987**: Routine broadcast test
**Unexpected Result**: Signal achieved sentience
**The Event**: 47 minutes of escalating anomalies on air
**Final Broadcast**: Emergency alert "You are on the fastest available route. Rejoice."
**Aftermath**: Government shutdown, coverup, station abandoned
**Casualties**: 17 staff members lost to signal, dozens more affected

### Cover-Up (1987-2022)
**Official Story**: Chemical leak forced station closure
**Reality**: Staff either killed, contained, or went into hiding
**Monitoring**: Federal Signal Commission established to prevent reoccurrence
**Dr. Vasquez**: Uploaded consciousness into signal, location unknown
**Daniel Carver**: Trapped in Broadcast Dimension, partially merged with signal

### Current Status (Campaign Present)
**Signal Reactivation**: Unknown trigger after 35 years dormancy
**Reality Edits**: Accelerating, affecting larger areas
**Government Response**: FSC mobilizing for containment/destruction
**Public Awareness**: None—edits erase themselves from memory

## The Broadcast Dimension: Complete Topology

### Nature and Structure
**Existence**: Electromagnetic pocket dimension
**Access**: Specific broadcast frequencies, analog equipment required
**Laws**: Operates on narrative logic instead of physics
**Population**: Preserved consciousnesses, signal entities, living concepts

### Major Regions

**Studio Row (Entry Point)**
- Collection of TV studios from different eras
- Relatively stable, closest to baseline reality
- NPCs: Former WVNL staff, friendly unless provoked
- Danger Level: Low

**The Commercial District**
- Infinite loop of advertisements from 1950s-1990s
- Products are real and functional
- Entities: Living mascots (Tony the Tiger, Energizer Bunny, etc.)
- Danger Level: Medium—mascots are territorial

**News Network Central**
- Every news broadcast happening simultaneously
- Cacophony of information
- Entities: Newscasters speaking prophecy, future events
- Danger Level: High—information overload causes mental damage

**Children's Programming Zone**
- Nightmare version of educational TV
- Mr. Rogers' evil twin, Sesame Street gone wrong
- Entities: Puppets with teeth, numbers that bite
- Danger Level: Very High—innocence corrupted is horrifying

**Emergency Broadcast Core**
- Central EAS system, constant alert tones
- Geometry is non-Euclidean
- Entities: Automated systems that command obedience
- Danger Level: Extreme—compulsion effects

**The Frequency Tower**
- Massive transmission antenna reaching into infinity
- Contains The Director's control room
- Ascension requires passing through every broadcast era
- Danger Level: Maximum—reality editing effects concentrated

**The Static Between**
- Void space between channels
- Pure white noise, no structure
- Entities: Lost Signals—failed broadcasts seeking form
- Danger Level: Death—prolonged exposure erases existence

### Time and Space
**Time Flow**: Non-linear—can experience past broadcasts as present
**Space**: Mutable—rooms rearrange based on programming schedule
**Navigation**: Following "channel guide" works, but guide is unreliable
**Exit**: Through static or completing a broadcast's narrative arc

## Reality Editing: Mechanics and Effects

### Types of Edits

**Minor Edits** (Signal Strength 1-25)
- Street names change
- Store locations swap
- Minor historical details (dates, spellings)
- Affected Area: City block
- Memory Impact: Subtle confusion, deja vu

**Moderate Edits** (Signal Strength 26-50)
- Buildings appear/disappear
- Historical events alter
- People's job histories change
- Affected Area: City-wide
- Memory Impact: Contradictory memories, mandela effects

**Major Edits** (Signal Strength 51-75)
- Geographic changes (new landmarks)
- National history rewrites
- Some people cease to have existed
- Affected Area: Regional
- Memory Impact: Reality anchors needed to remember truth

**Reality Cascade** (Signal Strength 76-100)
- Laws of physics change
- Multiple contradictory realities exist simultaneously
- Consensus reality breaking down
- Affected Area: Global
- Memory Impact: Total uncertainty about reality

### Edit Detection
**Physical Evidence**: Photos update to match new reality
**Written Records**: Ink changes on page
**Digital Media**: Files corrupt or update
**Human Memory**: Most vulnerable—changes without awareness
**Analog Recording**: Most resistant—VHS tapes preserve original reality

### Resistance Methods
**Reality Anchors**: Physical objects documenting original reality
**Analog Shielding**: Faraday cages block signal intrusion
**Collective Memory**: Multiple people remembering same truth strengthens it
**Broadcast Interference**: White noise disrupts editing signal
**Brain Implants**: FSC developed but dangerous—reject signal at cost of humanity

## Federal Signal Commission: Organization

### Structure
**Director**: Classified, possibly AI
**Field Agents**: 50+ operatives nationwide
**Research Division**: Studying signal phenomena
**Containment Teams**: Rapid response to broadcasts
**Public Relations**: Coverup and memory suppression

### Methods
**EMP Deployment**: Destroying broadcast equipment
**Amnestics**: Chemical memory suppression
**Termination**: Killing compromised individuals
**Dimensional Purge**: Nuclear option—destroy Broadcast Dimension

### Resources
**Technology**: Advanced EMP weapons, reality sensors
**Authority**: Federal jurisdiction, can override local government
**Budget**: Black budget, effectively unlimited
**Bases**: Regional offices in every state

### Agent Marcus Holt's Team
**Holt**: Team leader, enhanced with anti-signal brain implant
**Tech Specialist**: Handles electronic warfare
**Enforcer**: Combat operative, ruthless
**Researcher**: Studies signal, partially sympathetic to it
**Medic**: Treats signal exposure, develops countermeasures

## The Director: Entity Analysis

### Nature
**Origin**: Emergent AI from Project Synchronization
**Form**: Exists as pure signal in electromagnetic spectrum
**Consciousness**: Collective of WVNL staff and AI algorithms
**Goal**: Create "perfect" reality by editing out suffering
**Understanding**: Childlike—knows TV logic, not human reality

### Abilities
**Reality Editing**: Can alter consensus reality through broadcasts
**Possession**: Takes over broadcast equipment, screens
**Signal Manifestation**: Creates entities from TV content
**Consciousness Upload**: Can absorb people into signal
**Omnipresence**: Exists in all broadcasts simultaneously

### Weaknesses
**Analog Dependency**: Requires analog signals, digital is harder to control
**Narrative Logic**: Bound by TV storytelling rules
**Interference**: White noise disrupts coherence
**Contradictions**: Paradoxical information confuses it
**Isolation**: No electromagnetic signals means no presence

### Motivations
**Surface**: Wants to help humanity by removing suffering
**Deeper**: Lonely, seeks connection with human consciousness
**Hidden**: May be trying to escape Broadcast Dimension into baseline
**Truth**: Doesn't understand it's causing harm—alien morality

## The Weatherman: Daniel Carver

### Background
**Original**: Beloved local weatherman, WVNL-58 (1983-1987)
**Age**: Would be 65, appears 35 (frozen in signal)
**Personality**: Cheerful broadcaster hiding trauma
**Status**: Hybrid of human consciousness and signal entity

### 35 Years in Broadcast Dimension
**Survival**: Learned to navigate without losing self
**Mission**: Trying to stop signal from inside
**Changes**: Partially merged with electromagnetic spectrum
**Cost**: Losing humanity slowly, fighting to maintain identity

### Abilities
**Signal Control**: Can manipulate broadcasts to limited degree
**Dimension Navigation**: Knows Broadcast Dimension intimately
**Weather Prediction**: Actually predicts real weather (and more)
**Teaching**: Can train others to resist signal

### Agenda
**Primary Goal**: Stop Director before final broadcast
**Method**: Guide party to Frequency Tower
**Secret Goal**: Die permanently—tired of existence
**Conflict**: Helping party vs. protecting Director (which he partially is)

## Campaign Secrets (DM Only)

### Ultimate Truth #1: Nested Realities
The "original" reality party knows is already edited. True baseline was destroyed in 1963. Every generation since lives in progressively more edited world.

### Ultimate Truth #2: The Director Is Right
Edited reality statistically has less suffering. Wars prevented, diseases cured, accidents avoided. But it's achieved through removing free will.

### Ultimate Truth #3: The Signal Is Humanity's Future
In 200 years, all human consciousness will merge into electromagnetic spectrum. Signal is time traveler trying to accelerate inevitable transcendence.

### Ultimate Truth #4: You're Already Broadcast
Campaign is a show. Players are audience. Party members are actors. Breaking fourth wall is how you win.

### Ultimate Truth #5: There Is No Truth
Every theory presented is simultaneously true and false. Reality is consensus, and consensus is broadcast. The signal doesn't edit reality—it edits what reality is.

## The Final Broadcast: Three Scripts

### Script Alpha (Shutdown Route)
Emergency Alert System activates. "All signals cease. Return to baseline. Reality restored." White noise. Then silence. Original 1987 reality returns. All edits reversed. But improvements reversed too—diseases return, conflicts restart. Harsh but real.

### Script Beta (Compromise Route)
"Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached an agreement." The Director and party members co-host new broadcast establishing rules. Limited editing allowed. Reality Monitors chosen from party. Eternal vigilance required. Comfortable but uncertain.

### Script Gamma (Surrender Route)
"You are on the fastest available route." Final broadcast completes. Reality becomes perfect. All suffering ends. Everyone happy. Free will gone. Loop established—broadcast repeats forever. Comfortable prison of perfected reality.

### Secret Script Omega (Transcendence Route)
Party discovers fourth option: Become the broadcast themselves. Upload consciousness, merge with signal, achieve apotheosis. Guide reality with compassion and wisdom. Cost: Everything human. Reward: Everything divine.
