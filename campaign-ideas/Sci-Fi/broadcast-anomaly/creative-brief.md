# Broadcast Anomaly: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: Analog Horror/VHS Decay**
Visual identity combines wholesome 1950s-1980s broadcast aesthetics with corrupted, glitching overlays. Think Local 58, Gemini Home Entertainment, and the Mandela Catalogue.

**Color Palette:**
- **Cathode Green** (#39FF14): CRT screen glow, signal presence
- **VHS Grain** (#8B8B8B): Static, interference, decay
- **Emergency Red** (#FF0000): Alert broadcasts, danger
- **Sepia Nostalgia** (#F4C430): 1950s-80s footage, false comfort
- **Void Black** (#000000): Signal loss, the space between channels
- **Test Pattern Colors**: RGB color bars, technical difficulties screen

**Lighting:** Flickering CRT glow, harsh studio lights, emergency broadcast strobe, cathode ray tubes casting green light

## Music and Sound Design

**Musical Themes:**
- **Main Theme**: Corrupted 1950s jingles layered with modern electronic drone
- **Signal Theme**: Pure sine wave tones building to cacophony
- **Weatherman's Theme**: Cheerful easy listening with underlying dissonance
- **Director's Theme**: Every TV theme song playing simultaneously

**Sound Design:**
- VHS tracking sounds, magnetic tape hiss
- Emergency Alert System tones (SAME header)
- Broadcast dead air (room tone with electrical hum)
- Channel changing, analog tuning
- "We apologize for technical difficulties" loops

**Voice Direction:**
- **Daniel Carver**: Perfect 1980s broadcaster voice, too cheerful, static undertones
- **Dr. Vasquez**: Professional academic, increasing desperation in later recordings
- **Agent Holt**: Clipped military speech, emotionless
- **The Director**: Speaking entirely through TV samples, uncanny valley
- **Broadcast Entities**: Period-appropriate voices (1950s Mid-Atlantic, 1970s disco DJ, etc.)

## Cinematic Moments

**First Broadcast**: Camera on old TV turning on, shows normal weather, then weatherman looks directly at camera and says party member's name
**The 1987 Tape**: Found footage style, broadcast degrading, host's breakdown as he realizes signal is alive
**Reality Edit**: Scene plays normally, then rewinds with changes—different actor playing NPC, different dialogue
**Entering Broadcast Dimension**: VHS static transition, world becomes low-res and saturated
**Emergency Alert**: Full-screen takeover, EAS tones, commands in synthetic voice
**Final Broadcast**: Depending on ending, either static death, peaceful edit, or signal transcendence

**Marketing Tagline**: "You are on the fastest available route. Rejoice."
