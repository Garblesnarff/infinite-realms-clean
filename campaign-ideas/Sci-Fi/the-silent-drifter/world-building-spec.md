### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Silent Drifter**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The party awakens as Drifters—warriors afflicted with a terminal crystalline disease that prevents speech. They explore a post-apocalyptic world where four civilizations fell to an ancient titan war. Unable to speak, they communicate through gestures while seeking the Tower that might hold answers. The world tells its story through architecture and ruins, not words. There is no cure—only the dignity of facing inevitable death while seeking understanding.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Titan War—when god-like beings fought and shattered civilizations in the crossfire.
    *   Write the history of the four civilizations: North (scholars), South (military), West (bioengineers), East (mystics).
    *   Describe the crystalline disease—created as a weapon, became a plague, now consumes all afflicted.
    *   Explain the Tower's purpose—built as a last-ditch attempt to contain or understand the disease source.
    *   Detail the Drifters—those afflicted who can still fight, seeking meaning in their final days.
    *   Describe the fall of each civilization and how they tried and failed to survive.
