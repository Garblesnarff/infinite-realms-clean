The players are ARKS operatives—elite warriors defending humanity across parallel universes from the Darkers, manifestations of primordial darkness that corrupt and consume all life. Wielding Photon energy—solidified light that can become weapons or magic—they battle through dimensional gates on procedurally dangerous missions. They uncover the truth about the ancient Photoners who created humanity, the Dark Falz beings that embody destruction, and the cycle of creation and annihilation that has repeated across countless universes. The ultimate question: can they break the cycle, or will they become part of it?

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A tale of parallel worlds, ancient creators, and the battle against primordial darkness.

*   **Act I — ARKS Initiation (Sessions 1–5):** The players join ARKS aboard the Oracle Fleet, massive ships traveling between parallel Earths. They undertake missions to various planets fighting Darkers—corrupted creatures of shadow. They meet their Mag companions (sentient support AIs) and learn about Photon energy manipulation. A mysterious woman named Matoi appears in their visions.
*   **Act II — The Dark Falz (Sessions 6–11):** The party encounters the first Dark Falz—Elder, a massive embodiment of "Blind Destruction." They discover Dark Falz are eternal beings that appear across all timelines, corrupting Photoners and destroying civilizations. They must gather allies from parallel worlds and strengthen their Photon abilities. Matoi's connection to Darker corruption is revealed.
*   **Act III — The Profound Darkness (Sessions 12–15+):** The players learn the ultimate truth: the Photoners created humanity as soldiers against the Profound Darkness—the source of all Darkers, the universe's death-wish given form. They must enter the depths of Darkness itself, face multiple Dark Falz simultaneously, and either destroy the Profound Darkness (ending the cycle but removing a fundamental universal force) or find a way to seal it permanently, accepting the cycle must continue.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Photon Arts System**
*   Weapons can channel Photon energy into special attacks called Photon Arts (PAs).
*   Each weapon type has unique PAs: Hunter sword slashes, Ranger rifle shots, Force spell techniques.
*   PAs consume PP (Photon Points) that regenerate through normal attacks.
*   Learning new PAs through practice and discovery creates progression.

### 2. **Class and Subclass**
*   Players choose a main class and later a subclass, combining abilities.
*   Main classes: Hunter (melee tank), Ranger (ranged DPS), Force (magic), Braver (hybrid), Bouncer (support).
*   Subclasses provide passive bonuses and additional skill options.
*   Can change classes in ARKS lobby, encouraging experimentation.

### 3. **Mag Companion System**
*   Each player has a Mag—a sentient AI companion that floats beside them.
*   Mags provide stat bonuses, use support abilities in combat, and have personalities.
*   Feeding items to Mags changes their evolution and abilities.
*   Mags develop relationships with their owners, providing emotional support.

### 4. **Emergency Quest System**
*   Random high-priority missions can interrupt regular gameplay.
*   All available ARKS are called to participate in massive battles.
*   Rewards are significant—rare weapons, exclusive materials.
*   Failure has consequences—territories lost, NPCs killed, Darker corruption spreads.

### 5. **Parallel World Mechanics**
*   Different Earth parallels have different rules:
    *   Fantasy world: Magic is stronger, technology weaker.
    *   Sci-fi world: Technology enhanced, magic suppressed.
    *   Modern world: Balanced but more fragile.
*   Players must adapt strategies to each world's properties.

### 6. **Darker Corruption**
*   Prolonged exposure to Darkers risks corruption.
*   Corrupted characters gain power but risk losing control (becoming NPCs temporarily).
*   Corruption can be cleansed through special quests or sacrifice.
*   High corruption attracts Dark Falz attention.

### 7. **Weapon Grinding and Affixes**
*   Weapons can be enhanced (+10 to +35) using grinders and same-weapon fodder.
*   Affixes add special abilities: elemental damage, stat bonuses, unique effects.
*   High-level gear crafting is complex but rewarding.
*   Rare drops from bosses provide best base weapons.
