**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully defend a parallel Earth from Darker invasion.
    *   **THEN:** That Earth becomes an allied base, providing resources and unique missions.
    *   **IF:** The players defeat a Dark Falz.
    *   **THEN:** It reforms elsewhere weaker. Darkers become less coordinated temporarily. Rare loot drops.
    *   **IF:** A player becomes highly corrupted by Darker exposure.
    *   **THEN:** They risk temporary loss of control (becoming NPC). Dark Falz personally contact them with temptation.
    *   **IF:** The players save Matoi from re-corruption.
    *   **THEN:** She becomes a powerful NPC ally with unique Dark Falz knowledge.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to destroy the Profound Darkness entirely.
    *   **THEN:** Victory but cosmic imbalance—reality becomes unstable. Generate epilogue showing consequences.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to seal the Darkness with Xion's sacrifice.
    *   **THEN:** The cycle continues but humanity survives. Generate bittersweet epilogue.
    *   **IF:** The players forge a third path (using bonds/friendship anime-style).
    *   **THEN:** Both Xion and Darkness are transformed into balance. Generate hopeful epilogue of new coexistence.
