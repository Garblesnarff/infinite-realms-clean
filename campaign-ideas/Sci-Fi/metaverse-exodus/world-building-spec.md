# Metaverse Exodus - World-Building Specification

## The Metaverse Structure
**Layer 1 - Public Metaverse**: Where most people live digitally. Malls, social spaces, entertainment. Regulated and monitored.

**Layer 2 - Private Spaces**: Custom user worlds. Anything goes. Pay for privacy.

**Layer 3 - Dark Zones**: Unregulated areas. Criminal activity, banned content, digital warfare.

**Layer 4 - The Deep**: Raw data layer. Reality breaks down. Only elite hackers venture here.

**Layer 5 - The Source**: Theoretical. Where consciousness and code merge. Library exists here.

## Meatspace Society
Most humans live in corporate pods, feeding tubes sustaining bodies while minds in Metaverse. Physical world decayed—nobody maintaining it. Only poor, Luddites, and criminals fully inhabit Meatspace. Physical geography matters less than virtual real estate.

## Language as Code
Ancient Sumerian is the "source code" of human consciousness—closest to how brain naturally processes information. Snow Crash written in this language, hacks brain directly. Countermeasure requires "debugging" human linguistic firmware.

## Factions
- **Freelancers**: Party's faction, independent operators
- **Kouriers**: Delivery drivers navigating physical world
- **The Cult of Asherah**: Religious unity through mind control
- **Corporate Alliances**: Fighting for Metaverse monopoly
- **Refugees**: Those unable to afford Metaverse access (discrimination)
- **Neo-Luddites**: Reject virtual reality entirely

## The Pods
Corporate-owned life support systems. Residents technically employees. Terms of service include consciousness rights transfer. Corporations literally own users' minds legally.

## Avatar Economy
- Custom avatars are status symbols
- Generic avatars mark poverty
- Avatar death means losing purchased goods
- Some avatars are sentient AIs (illegal but common)
- Reality: Bodies starving while users buy virtual clothes

## Snow Crash Effects
Victims see cascading static in Metaverse. Symptoms progress: confusion, inability to log out, brain seizures, permanent coma or death. Attacks linguistic centers of brain—can't understand language, can't form thoughts, consciousness unravels.

## L. Bob Rife's Vision
Not villain in his eyes—savior. Believes linguistic diversity causes war, misunderstanding, suffering. Unity means peace. Tower of Babel was humanity's mistake. He'll correct it. Forced evolution to telepathic hive mind.

## Philosophical Tensions
- Is virtual life "real" enough to protect?
- Do companies own consciousness they host?
- Is forced unity evil or enlightened?
- Does physical reality matter if nobody wants it?
- Are we already hive mind through social media?

## Ending Scenarios
1. **Preserve Diversity**: Stop Snow Crash, maintain individual consciousness, accept continued conflict
2. **Accept Unity**: Allow hive mind, peace through conformity, lose self
3. **Destroy Metaverse**: Billions die or forced back to reality, physical world unprepared
4. **Compromise**: Partial unity (shared knowledge, preserved individuality), uncertain outcome

Each ending explores different vision of humanity's future in digital age.
