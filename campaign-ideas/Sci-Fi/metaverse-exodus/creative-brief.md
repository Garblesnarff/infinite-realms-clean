# Metaverse Exodus - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic
**Meatspace**: Decayed physical world, cyberpunk dystopia, neo-noir lighting
**Metaverse**: Impossible geometry, user-created worlds, vibrant and surreal
- Social spaces: Polished, corporate, sanitized
- Dark zones: Glitched, dangerous, reality-breaking
- Deep layers: Abstract, Lovecraftian data vistas

## Color Palette
- Meatspace: Grays, browns, washed out reality (people gave up on physical world)
- Metaverse Public: Vibrant neons, rainbow colors, sensory overload
- Metaverse Deep: Shifting impossible colors, reality instability
- Snow Crash Corruption: Glitching red/black, digital cancer spreading

## Music
- Meatspace: Depressing ambient, showing societal decay
- Metaverse Zones: Varies by location (club music, corporate jingles, user-created soundscapes)
- Action Sequences: Fast-paced electronic (digital combat)
- Snow Crash Scenes: Distorted, corrupted audio, Sumerian chanting
- Emotional Moments: Acoustic instruments (reminder of human authenticity)

## Voice Acting
- **Hiro Protagonist**: Confident hacker, action hero with surprising depth
- **Y.T.**: Sarcastic teenager, tough exterior hiding vulnerability
- **L. Bob Rife**: Southern televangelist, charismatic cult leader, genuinely believes
- **The Librarian**: Stereotypical British librarian, omniscient but emotionless
- **Raven**: Deep, menacing, tragic Native American warrior

## Cinematic Moments
