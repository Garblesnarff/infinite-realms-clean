# Iron Exodus
*In a world where cities eat cities, only the mobile survive*

## Campaign Overview

In the post-apocalyptic future, Earth's surface was devastated by the Sixty Minute War, leaving the world a wasteland. Humanity survived by mounting entire cities on massive tracks and wheels, creating mobile metropolises that hunt and consume smaller towns in a practice called Municipal Darwinism. The party begins aboard a predator city or prey town when they discover evidence of a static settlement—impossible in this mobile world—that may hold technology to restore the devastated earth.

They'll navigate traction city politics, pirate towns, the Anti-Traction League (static settlements fighting mobile cities), scavenger air-pirates, and the terrifying truth about MEDUSA—an ancient weapon capable of destroying entire cities. The campaign explores themes of survival, exploitation, environmental restoration vs. acceptance of changed world, and whether humanity's predatory nature can be overcome.

## Core Themes

- **Predation and Survival**: Eat or be eaten, mobility or death
- **Municipal Darwinism**: Social Darwinism made literal through city consumption
- **Environmental Catastrophe**: Can Earth be restored or must humanity adapt forever?
- **Class Stratification**: Vertical cities mirror social hierarchy
- **Ancient Technology**: Old-tech (our technology) as mystical artifacts

## Key NPCs

**Thaddeus Valentine** (Neutral Evil)
Legendary explorer, archaeologist, and assassin working for London's Guild. Charismatic, ruthless, genuinely believes municipal Darwinism must continue. Complex antagonist with sympathetic motivation.

**Katherine Valentine** (Neutral Good)
Thaddeus's daughter, questioning her father's methods. Potential ally or romantic interest. Represents hope for change. Pilots airship if party allies with her.

**Anna Fang** (Chaotic Good)
Anti-Traction League's best pilot and spy. Commands Jenny Haniver airship. Escaped from slavery in London's Gut. Driven by revenge but cares for innocents. Dangerous ally.

**The Lord Mayor** (Lawful Evil)
Corrupt ruler of London. Puppet of Engineers Guild. Desperate to restore London's former glory through conquest and ancient weapons.

**Engineer Master** (Lawful Neutral)
Guild leader who found MEDUSA blueprints. Believes activating it will secure London's future. Technically right but morally wrong. Not cruel, just coldly utilitarian.

**Shrike** (Lawful Evil)
Resurrected soldier—ancient cyborg stalker-killer. Hunts party for personal reasons (potentially one member is escaped ward). Nearly unkillable. Tragic monster seeking purpose beyond killing.

**The Green Storm** (Chaotic Evil subgroup)
Extremist faction of Anti-Traction League. Led by fanatics wanting to exterminate all mobile city dwellers. "Static good, mobile evil" ideology. Terrorist tactics.

**Hester Shaw** (Chaotic Neutral)
Scarred girl seeking revenge on Valentine for killing her parents. Potential party member or rival. Ugly exterior, fierce loyalty. Shrike's former ward trying to escape him.

## Major Locations

**London**
Seven-tier mobile city. Top tiers: wealthy estates and gardens. Middle: shops and Guild halls. Bottom: slums and Gut (processing consumed towns). Massive tracks, Gothic industrial aesthetic. Hunting smaller towns across Europe.

**The Hunting Ground**
Post-apocalyptic Europe. Scarred by ancient war. Mobile cities chase each other across plains. Occasional static forts. Dangerous terrain: rust deserts, green storms (radioactive), ancient minefields.

**Airhaven**
Floating marketplace suspended by hydrogen balloons. Neutral territory where all factions trade. Hundreds of balloons, platforms, airships docked. Precarious balance politically and physically.

**Batmunkh Gompa**
The Shield-Wall. Massive barrier protecting Shan Guo (Asia) from Traction Cities. Monastery-fortresses along wall. Anti-Traction League headquarters. Artillery defenses. Thousands of years old.

**Shan Guo**
Static civilization behind Shield-Wall. Traditional culture preserved. Rice terraces, temples, cities that don't move. Proof that alternatives to Municipal Darwinism exist. Military defending against mobile invasion.

**The Out-Country**
Lawless regions where pirate towns and scavengers operate. Harrowbarrow (burrowing suburb), pirate towns, independent communities. Freedom and danger.

**London's Gut**
Lowest tier where captured towns are dismantled. Slave labor. Recycling workers. Dark, dangerous, polluted. Where Valentine's crimes occurred. Party potentially enslaved here.

**The Dead Continent (America)**
Radioactive wasteland. Impossible to cross. Scavenger tales of lost treasure cities and ancient weapons. Potential late-campaign exploration.

## Unique Mechanics

**Vehicle Combat**
Cities, towns, and airships as combatants:
- **Town Chases**: Predator pursuing prey across terrain
- **Ramming**: Direct collision to disable
- **Jibing**: Cutting off escape routes
- **Gut Processing**: Consuming smaller town for resources
- **Airship Dogfights**: Three-dimensional aerial combat

**Faction Reputation**
- **Traction Cities**: Municipal Darwinism supporters
- **Anti-Traction League**: Static settlement defenders
- **Pirates**: Neutral scavengers and traders
- **Engineers Guild**: Technology hoarders
- **Green Storm**: Extremist terrorists

**Old-Tech Scavenging**
Finding ancient technology (our modern tech seen as mystical):
- **Quantum Energy Weapons**: MEDUSA and similar
- **Computers**: "Thinky-machines" barely understood
- **Stalker Technology**: Resurrecting dead as cyborgs
- **Aviation**: Airships and aircraft construction
- **Engines**: Massive reactors powering cities

**Airship Customization**
Party's ship (if acquired) can be upgraded:
- Speed vs. Armor vs. Cargo
- Weapons: Harpoons, gas bags (bombs), machine guns
- Stealth: Silent running, night-black paint
- Quarters: Crew comfort affecting loyalty

**Vertical Social Climbing**
Party moving between city tiers represents class mobility. Bottom Gut to Top Tier is epic achievement requiring social maneuvering, wealth, or revolution.

## Plot Twists

**MEDUSA's Instability**: Ancient weapon unstable. Using it risks chain reaction destroying all cities including London.

**Valentine's Tragedy**: His wife died in Anti-Traction attack. His villainy is grief-driven revenge. Sympathetic monster.

**Shrike's Creation**: Party member is his former "daughter"—girl he resurrected who escaped. He hunts not from malice but love (twisted).

**The Sixty Minute War**: Started by mistake. Ancient computers misinterpreted data. All apocalypse was accident.

**Green Storm Corruption**: Anti-Traction League infiltrated by extremists. "Good guys" becoming terrorists. Binary moral choice challenged.

**London's Secret**: Built atop ancient bunker containing MEDUSA. Founders knew. City exists to guard weapon, not coincidence.

**Municipal Darwinism's End**: System unsustainable. Cities running out of prey. Must transition to static or face extinction.

**The Dead Continent Base**: Ancient civilization survived in American bunker. Awakening could change everything.

## Victory Conditions

**MEDUSA Destroyed**: Weapon eliminated, London humbled, transition to static settlements begins. Anti-Traction victory.

**Controlled MEDUSA**: Weapon secured under international control. Détente between mobile and static. Uneasy peace.

**London Triumphant**: MEDUSA used to destroy Shield-Wall. Municipal Darwinism expands into Asia. Dark victory.

**New Compromise**: Mobile cities transition to sustainable orbits. Static settlements tolerate non-predatory movement. Innovative solution.

**Revolution Ending**: Overthrow city governments. Establish democracy of all tiers. Social reform regardless of mobile vs. static.

## Defeat Conditions

**MEDUSA Detonation**: Weapon overloads, destroys London and nearby cities. Thousands dead including party.

**Shrike Claims Target**: Resurrected stalker retrieves his "daughter," kills party, succeeds in his mission.

**Green Storm Victory**: Extremists destroy all Traction Cities. Genocide of mobile populations.

**Total War**: Mobile vs. Static escalates into mutual annihilation. Repeat of Sixty Minute War.

**Consumed**: Party's city eaten by larger predator. Enslaved in Gut of enemy city.
