# Iron Exodus - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Steampunk meets Mad Max. Gothic industrial cities on tank treads. Peter Jackson's Mortal Engines aesthetic—grounded impossibility. Rust, smoke, recycled everything.

## Color Palettes
**Traction Cities**: Rust Orange (#CD5C5C), Industrial Grey (#778899), Smoke Black (#1C1C1C), Brass Accent (#B5A642)
**Anti-Traction**: Jade Green (#00A86B), Mountain Stone (#8B8589), Prayer Gold (#FFD700)
**Sky**: Storm Grey (#708090), Balloon White (#FFFAFA), Sunset Amber (#FFBF00)
**Wasteland**: Dust Brown (#8B7355), Radioactive Green (#39FF14), Dead Earth (#3E2723)

## Music
Industrial percussion using actual machinery sounds. Engines as bass, pistons as rhythm, steam as atmosphere. Epic brass for city chases. Traditional Asian instruments for Anti-Traction League. Aerial themes for airships—woodwinds suggesting freedom.

## Voice Direction
**Valentine**: Cultured menace, explorer's charisma masking assassin's coldness.
**Anna Fang**: Accented English, fierce determination, underlying trauma.
**Katherine**: Youth struggling with conscience vs. loyalty.
**Shrike**: Mechanical voice with hints of human emotion breaking through.

## Cinematic Moments
- First town chase (massive scale vehicular hunt)
- Town consumption (city jaws opening, buildings dismantled)
- Airship battle through clouds
- MEDUSA activation (energy weapon destroying city)
- Shield-Wall breach attempt (artillery vs. city)
- London's crash (if it falls)
- Shrike's relentless pursuit (horror sequences)

## Player Experience
Scale—massive cities as characters themselves. Survival horror of being hunted. Moral complexity of exploitation-based civilization. Wonder at impossible engineering.
