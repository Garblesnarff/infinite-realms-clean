# Iron Exodus - World-Building Specification

## Historical Timeline

**Ancient Era (Our Present)**: Modern civilization reaches technological peak. Quantum energy weapons developed.

**The Sixty Minute War (approx. 60 minutes)**: Nuclear/quantum exchange destroys civilization. Continents shifted. Billions dead. Earth's surface devastated.

**Nomad Era (500 years post-war)**: Survivors scavenge ruins, living nomadically. Some cities (like London) preserved in bunkers. Gradual emergence.

**Traction Era Begins (1000 years ago in-game)**: Nicholas Quirke creates first Traction City by mounting London on tracks. Municipal Darwinism philosophy born: mobile cities hunt static settlements.

**Great Predator Era (500 years ago)**: Large predator cities dominate. Smaller towns flee or are consumed. Arms race of size and speed. Most brutal period.

**Shield-Wall Construction (300 years ago)**: Asian nations unite to build Batmunkh Gompa, protecting their static civilization from Traction Cities. Anti-Traction League formalizes.

**Modern Era**: Unsustainable system reaching crisis. Fewer prey towns. Larger cities struggling. MEDUSA's rediscovery threatens to restart apocalypse.

## Municipal Darwinism Philosophy

Survival of the fittest made literal. Cities that don't move are consumed. Larger cities eat smaller. "Town eat town" is natural law. Those who can't adapt deserve death. Social Darwinism applied to entire settlements. Predation justified as evolution.

## Traction Cities Detailed

**London (Tier 1 Predator)**:
- Population: ~30,000 on multiple tiers
- Top Tier: St. Paul's Cathedral preserved, Lord Mayor's mansion, gardens
- Upper Tiers: Merchants, guild halls, museums (our artifacts)
- Middle Tiers: Shops, residences, factories
- Lower Tiers: Slums, processing plants
- The Gut: Dismantling zone, slave labor, recycling
- Propulsion: Massive tracked wheels, nuclear-powered
- Weapons: Electromagnetic pulse weapons, conventional artillery
- Culture: Believes in restoring "London's glory" (British Empire nostalgia)

**Other Major Traction Cities**:
- **Manchester**: Industrial giant, competes with London
- **Panzerstadt-Bayreuth**: German predator, heavily armed
- **Cittamotore**: Italian city, artistic culture
- **Paris**: French predator (possibly consumed by now)
- **Nuevo-Maya**: South American mobile city
- **Arkangel**: Russian predator, largest and most feared

**Smaller Towns**:
- **Tunbridge Wheels**: Prey town constantly fleeing
- **Speedwell**: Fast but small, survives through evasion
- **Salthook**: Fishing town, eventually consumed by London

**Suburbs**:
- **Harrowbarrow**: Burrowing suburb, travels underground, emerges beneath prey
- **Pirate Towns**: Independent communities, predatory but mobile

## Anti-Traction League

**Ideology**: Static settlement is natural. Municipal Darwinism is evil. Must protect non-mobile civilization.

**Territory**: Shan Guo (China, Korea, Southeast Asia), protected by Shield-Wall.

**Structure**:
- **Military**: Shield-Wall defenses, air force
- **Spies**: Agents like Anna Fang infiltrating Traction Cities
- **Diplomacy**: Attempting to convince cities to settle
- **Green Storm**: Extremist wing, genocidal toward mobile populations

**Technology**: Focuses on aviation (superiority in air), artillery (defense), agriculture (static settlements can farm).

**Culture**: Traditional Asian, preserving pre-war ways. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism influences. Sees mobile cities as barbarians.

## Stalkers (Resurrected)

**Creation**: Ancient technology combining dead bodies with mechanical parts and computer brains. Created during Sixty Minute War as soldiers.

**Process**: Recently dead corpse, armor integration, computer brain programming, energy core installation.

**Capabilities**: Superhuman strength/speed, near-immortality, combat programming, inability to feel pain.

**Limitations**: Broken memories of life, occasional human emotion glitches, vulnerable to EMP.

**Famous Stalkers**:
- **Shrike**: Last surviving original model, ancient and deadly
- **Stalker-birds**: Flying reconnaissance units
- **Resurrected Fang** (potential dark timeline): Anna Fang killed and raised

## Old-Tech Categorization

**Thinky-Machines**: Computers, AI systems.
**Mag-Weapons**: Electromagnetic pulse guns.
**Screen Culture**: Books, films, media from Ancient times.
**Aviation**: Jet engines, radar, advanced aerodynamics.
**MEDUSA**: Quantum energy weapon, orbital laser.
**Bio-Tech**: Genetic engineering, medical advances.
**Stalker Tech**: Resurrection/cyborg technology.

## Geographic Zones

**The Hunting Ground (Europe)**:
- Former Europe, now wasteland

- Protected by Shield-Wall
- Static civilization
- Rice terraces, temples, cities
- Advanced culture
- Growing population

**The Dead Continent (Americas)**:
- Extreme radiation
- Impassable except at great risk
- Rumored ancient bunkers
- Lost cities of Ancients
- Potential treasure/horror

**Africa**:
- Largely unexplored in-setting
- Mix of mobile and static

**Weapons**: Machine guns, bombs, harpoons, flamethrowers.

**Culture**: Airship pilots elite class. Freedom of the skies. Romantic appeal vs. earthbound cities.

## Technology Levels

**Traction Cities**: Steam-punk industrial, scavenged tech, declining knowledge.

**Anti-Traction League**: More advanced in some areas (aviation, agriculture), traditional in others.

**Old-Tech**: Ancient (our) technology seen as semi-magical. Misunderstood but powerful.

## The Sixty Minute War Details

**Cause**: Automated defense systems misinterpreted satellite data. Launched without human authorization.

**Weapons**: Nuclear, quantum energy, biological, nanotech.

**Effects**: Continents shifted, orbit slightly altered, most life extinct, radiation everywhere.

**Survivors**: Those in bunkers, submarines, isolated areas. Thousands from billions.

**Legacy**: Fear of technology, preservation of some knowledge, loss of most.

## MEDUSA Weapon

**Type**: Quantum energy orbital laser.

**Power Source**: Ancient reactor, barely stable.

**Capability**: Can destroy entire cities in single shot.

**Range**: Line of sight, requires high elevation or orbital platform.

**Limitation**: Unstable. Repeated firing risks chain reaction destroying everything nearby.

**History**: Built by Americans during Sixty Minute War. Fired once, destroyed Washington D.C. by accident.

## Shrike's Background

**Original Name**: Grike in some tellings.

**Creation**: Soldier killed in Sixty Minute War, resurrected as Stalker immediately after.

**Age**: Over 1000 years old.

**Experiences**: Fought in countless wars, countless masters, countless purposes.

**Relationship**: Found dying girl (Hester Shaw or party member), tried to resurrect her. She fled. He pursues from twisted love.

**Goal**: Make his "daughter" immortal through Stalker resurrection. Sees it as salvation, she sees it as damnation.

**Tragedy**: Incapable of understanding why she runs. Broken programming confuses love with possession.

## Campaign Variations

**Pro-Traction**: Party loyal to mobile cities, fighting Anti-Traction terrorists.

**Pro-Static**: Party works for League, destroying predator cities.

**Neutral/Pirate**: Air-traders caught between factions, pursuing own goals.

**Revolutionary**: Overthrow entire system, establish new civilization model.

## Ending Scenarios

**Static Victory**: MEDUSA destroyed, Shield-Wall holds, cities begin settling. Municipal Darwinism ends. Long-term: sustainable civilization.

**Mobile Victory**: Shield-Wall breached, Anti-Traction defeated, hunting continues. Short-term prosperity, long-term extinction.

**Compromise**: Some cities settle, others continue moving in sustainable patterns. Coexistence achieved.

**Apocalypse Repeat**: MEDUSA firing triggers chain reaction. New wasteland created. Cycle continues.

**New World**: Discovery of surviving Ancient bunker with knowledge to restore Earth. Decades-long project begins.
