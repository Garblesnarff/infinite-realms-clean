## Art Style: Hot-Blooded Super Robot with Infinite Escalation (Gurren Lagann Aesthetic)

Vibrant, dynamic, and impossibly escalating. This style blends underground grit with surface freedom, evolving from small mechs to galaxy-sized gods. It captures hot-blooded determination, spiral energy as visual motif, and the sheer audacity of drilling through fate itself.

### Core Principles:

*   **Escalation:** Start grounded, end cosmic. Backgrounds go from caves to planets to galaxies.
*   **Spiral Motif:** Drills, spirals, rotation—visual metaphor for evolution and willpower.
*   **Hot-Blooded Action:** Dynamic poses, motion lines, characters shouting with passion.
*   **Vibrant Colors:** Saturated primaries—reds, blues, yellows. No muted tones in the endgame.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Underground:** Browns, grays, dim bioluminescent blues and greens.
*   **Surface:** Bright blue sky, golden sun, green grass—overwhelming after darkness.
*   **Spiral Energy:** Glowing green energy spiraling around drills and mechs.
*   **Cosmic Battles:** Deep space blacks with nebula purples, star yellows, galaxy blues.

**Character Design:**
*   Kamina: Tall, muscular, pointed sunglasses (iconic), flowing cape, bare chest showing tribal tattoos.
*   Yoko: Long red hair, minimal tactical outfit, massive sniper rifle taller than her.
*   Characters strike impossible poses, defy gravity, eyes glow with determination.

**Gunmen Design:**
*   Small, scrappy mechs early (Lagann—head-sized drill).
*   Mid: Combined forms (Gurren Lagann—humanoid with drills).
*   Late: Galactic scale (Super Galaxy Gurren Lagann—throwing galaxies).
*   Always feature drills, angular armor, glowing green spiral energy.

**Voice:** Hot-blooded shonen protagonist—yelling with passion, inspirational catchphrases ("Who the hell do you think I am?!"), dramatic pauses before attacks, voice cracks with emotion.

## Music Palette:
*   High-energy rock with orchestral elements, electric guitars during drills, triumphant brass for victories, choirs for cosmic battles.
*   Iconic: "Sorairo Days" (opening theme), "Libera Me From Hell" (rap+opera battle theme).
