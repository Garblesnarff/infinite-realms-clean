# Tinker Tailor Wizard Spy
## *"The Mole Must Be Found"*

### Campaign Overview

During the Cold War between the Eastern Dominion and Western Alliance, rumors surface of a deep-cover mole code-named "Gerald" within the Circus (Western magical intelligence). This traitor has compromised decades of operations, killed dozens of agents, and is preparing to hand over a list of every Western spy to the enemy. The players—veteran intelligence officers forced into retirement under suspicion—are quietly recalled to hunt the mole among their former colleagues, friends, and perhaps themselves.

This is a slow-burn investigation where every conversation matters, every detail could be crucial, and trust is impossible. No action sequences, no dramatic violence—just cups of tea, careful questions, and the devastating realization that someone you've known for decades has been betraying you all along. The spy game at its most cerebral and emotionally brutal.

### Core Themes

- **Betrayal and Loyalty**: Trust shattered by decades of lies
- **Paranoia**: Everyone is suspect, anyone could be Gerald
- **The Long Game**: Patience and attention to detail over action
- **Cost of Service**: What spying takes from human soul
- **Truth and Deception**: Lying is professional skill and personal curse
- **The Past Haunts**: Old operations cast long shadows
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No good guys, just less bad ones

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Witchcraft Operation**: Alleline's "brilliant" intelligence source is actually Gerald feeding controlled information.

**Budapest Ambush**: Failed operation was deliberate; Gerald set up team for capture or death.

**The Whole Network**: Gerald isn't one person—it's code name for systematic infiltration over decades.

**Player Connection**: One player has personal history with Gerald (friendship, romance, mentorship).

**Control's Death**: Spymaster dies before case solved, players truly alone.

**False Lead**: First suspect seems perfect fit but is red herring; real mole is less obvious.

**The Recording**: Gerald's confession reveals sympathetic or understandable motivation.

**Karla's Masterpiece**: Eastern Dominion ran long-term operation; Gerald is crowning achievement.

**No Clean Hands**: Exposing Gerald reveals Western Alliance's own crimes and betrayals.

**The List**: Gerald already transmitted spy roster; damage done, catching them is symbolic.

**Pyrrhic Victory**: Finding Gerald breaks Circus beyond repair, enemy wins anyway.

**The Next Mole**: Gerald caught but evidence suggests another deep-cover agent remains.

### Victory Conditions

**Primary**: Identify Gerald accurately; prevent or minimize further damage; protect remaining agents.

**Professional**: Build ironclad case; gather evidence; ensure mole is neutralized permanently.

**Personal**: Survive investigation without being scapegoated; maintain sanity despite paranoia; preserve some faith in system.

**Moral**: Expose truth without destroying entire intelligence community; balance justice with pragmatism; maintain principles in morally grey world.

**Perfect**: Find Gerald before list transmitted; turn them into double agent; use situation against Eastern Dominion; reform Circus to prevent future penetration; maintain friendships despite suspicion.

### Defeat Conditions

**Catastrophic**: Gerald escapes with list; entire spy network compromised; dozens of agents killed; Western Alliance intelligence collapse.

**Personal**: Players become scapegoats; blamed for Gerald's actions; careers and reputations destroyed; hunted by own side.

**Moral**: Become as paranoid and amoral as system they're investigating; lose humanity to job; trust nobody including each other.

**Tragic**: Find Gerald but revelation destroys everything and everyone; victory more damaging than ignorance would have been.

**Incomplete**: Investigation ends without certainty; mole possibly caught but possibly still operational; paranoia permanent state.

### Campaign Tone

This is John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy directly adapted—slow, cerebral, devastating emotional depth. Every session is conversations over tea, careful document review, and the growing horror of realizing how thoroughly you've been betrayed. There are no action sequences, no dramatic explosions, just the quiet dread of suspecting everyone and the gut-punch of being right.

The campaign should feel like assembling a jigsaw puzzle where pieces keep disappearing. Make paranoia justified—everyone has secrets even if not the secret. Use silence and pauses dramatically. Let players sit with uncomfortable truths. Make the betrayal hurt because the betrayer was someone they cared about.

This is for players who want intellectual challenge over action, who appreciate character drama over combat, who find tension in a conversation as much as in a swordfight. The spy game's cold, calculated, and utterly devastating examination of loyalty, betrayal, and what service costs the soul.
