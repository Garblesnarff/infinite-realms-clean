### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Children of the Angels**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Emotionally damaged teenagers are the only ones capable of piloting Evangelions—massive bio-mechanical constructs bonded to their souls—to defend the Last City from Angels, otherworldly entities of immense power. As they fight, they uncover dark truths: the Evangelions contain human souls (including people they knew), NERV is controlled by SEELE (a secret committee pursuing the Human Instrumentality Project), and the final Angels will trigger Third Impact—an apocalypse that will either destroy or transcend humanity. The party must choose whether to preserve individual existence (with all its suffering) or accept collective unity (ending suffering but destroying the self).

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail Second Impact, a catastrophic event 15 years ago when an "meteorite" (actually an Angel) struck Antarctica, melting the ice cap, killing half of humanity, and tilting Earth's axis. In truth, it was caused by a secret experiment on the Angel Adam.
    *   Write the history of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient texts (actually from an advanced precursor civilization) that predicted the Angels' arrival and provided blueprints for the Evangelions and the Instrumentality Project.
    *   Describe the creation of NERV as humanity's defense organization against the Angels, secretly controlled by SEELE to orchestrate Instrumentality.
    *   Explain the nature of Angels—beings descended from Adam (the first Angel), while humanity descended from Lilith (the second Angel). Angels seek to reunite with their progenitor, triggering apocalypse.
    *   Detail Evangelion technology—bio-mechanical constructs housing human souls, requiring teenage pilots whose mothers are dead (souls harvested during contact experiments). Only children whose mothers' souls are in the Evangelions can synchronize.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **SEELE** (Major - Shadow Government)
        *   **Goals:** Execute the Human Instrumentality Project to merge all human souls into one collective consciousness, eliminating suffering, death, and loneliness.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A committee of 12 members (only voice and monolith icons shown), led by Chairman Keel Lorenz.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown—operates entirely in shadow, controlling governments and NERV.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use Lilith, the Evangelions, and the final Angels to trigger Third Impact and achieve forced human evolution/transcendence.
        *   **Assets:** Control of world governments, the Dead Sea Scrolls, manufacturing of Evangelion mass-production models.
        *   **Relationships:** Puppet-masters of NERV; view humanity as a failed species requiring forced unity.
    *   **NERV** (Major - Defense Organization)
        *   **Goals:** Defend humanity from Angels; secretly prepare for Instrumentality.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Commander Gendo Ikari (head), Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, Misato Katsuragi (Operations), Ritsuko Akagi (Science), Section 2 (Intelligence).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Military defense against existential alien threat.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Commander Gendo has his own Instrumentality plan—reunite with his wife Yui (whose soul is in Unit-01) regardless of SEELE's goals.
        *   **Assets:** Evangelion Units, the Geofront, Terminal Dogma containing Lilith, Magi supercomputers.
        *   **Relationships:** Publicly humanity's saviors; secretly exploit child pilots for apocalyptic conspiracy.
    *   **The Angels** (Major - Existential Threat)
        *   **Goals:** Return to their progenitor Adam (or Lilith, by mistake) to trigger reunification.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Each Angel is a unique entity. Some seem to possess individual intelligence; others are more instinctive.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown—they appear as mindless destroyers to humanity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** (Revealed through investigation) Angels are seeking their creator, not deliberately attacking humanity. They're drawn to the geo-front because Lilith is there. Contact would be Third Impact.
        *   **Assets:** AT Fields (absolute psychic barriers), unique abilities per Angel (regeneration, flight, geometric weapons, mental invasion, etc.).
        *   **Relationships:** Humanity's existential enemy; actually kin (both descend from primordial beings); tragic miscommunication.
    *   **The UN Military** (Minor - Conventional Forces)
        *   **Goals:** Defend humanity through conventional military might; maintain political sovereignty against NERV.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Standard military command, answers to national governments.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Support NERV while maintaining government oversight.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Resent NERV's autonomy and secret-keeping; later attempt to seize NERV and the Evangelions.
        *   **Assets:** Conventional armies, air forces, N2 mines (nuclear-level explosives).
        *   **Relationships:** Ineffective against Angels; jealous of NERV's power; eventually turns hostile.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Gendo Ikari:** Commander of NERV, cold and manipulative, wears signature orange-tinted glasses that hide his eyes. Seeks Instrumentality solely to reunite with Yui. Utterly ruthless.
    *   **Rei Ayanami:** First pilot (Unit-00), emotionless clone hybrid of Lilith and Yui Ikari, created by Gendo as the vessel for Instrumentality. Multiple clones exist. She has no sense of self-worth.
    *   **Asuka Langley Soryu:** Second pilot (Unit-02), German-Japanese prodigy, arrogant and aggressive to hide deep trauma from her mother's suicide. Her identity is entirely built on being the best pilot.
    *   **Misato Katsuragi:** NERV Operations Director, the party's guardian. Outwardly fun and unprofessional; hides survivor's guilt from Second Impact and uses the pilots to fulfill her revenge against Angels.
    *   **Ritsuko Akagi:** NERV's head scientist, cynical and brilliant. Maintains the Evangelions and Rei's clones. Secretly in love with Gendo; complicit in horrific experiments.
    *   **Kaworu Nagisa:** The 17th Angel in human form, sent by SEELE to trigger Instrumentality. Kind and empathetic, genuinely loves humanity despite being their destroyer. Asks the party to kill him.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "NERV Technician (Overworked scientist maintaining impossible bio-tech)"
    *   "Section 2 Agent (Intelligence operative, paranoid and secretive)"
    *   "UN Military Officer (Resentful of NERV's authority, conventional thinker)"
    *   "Civilian Survivor (Living in Tokyo-3, traumatized by Angel attacks)"
    *   "SEELE Representative (Shadowy figure delivering cryptic orders)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **NERV Headquarters:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Geofront (massive spherical cavity), Central Dogma (primary command), Terminal Dogma (deepest level where Lilith is imprisoned), Evangelion cages, Pribnow Box (command center).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** NERV personnel, pilots, scientists, Section 2 agents.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** High-tech medical care, Evangelion maintenance, psychological counseling (actually surveillance).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Rei walking alone in the dark, speaking to no one. Section 2 agent tailing the party. Gendo observing from an elevated platform. Ritsuko arguing with technicians about Unit synchronization. Misato drinking alone in her office.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Rei has been seen entering Terminal Dogma at night—what's down there?" "Dr. Akagi destroyed something in her lab and won't talk about it." "Commander Ikari visits Unit-01's cage and speaks to it like it's a person."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Hexagonal architecture, glowing monitors, massive bio-mechs in restraints), Sound (Hum of machinery, echoing footsteps, automated announcements), Smell (Sterile antiseptic, ozone from electronics, faint metallic blood-smell from Evangelions).
    *   **Tokyo-3:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Misato's apartment, the school, automated gun turrets hidden in buildings, retractable skyscrapers, underground shelters.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Civilians, students, military personnel.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Normal city amenities, but everything feels temporary—people know the city is a battlefield.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Classmates asking about piloting, civilian thanking the party for saving them, automated city defenses activating during a drill, a stranger watching the party intently (Section 2), graffiti saying "Children shouldn't have to save us."
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The city was built on top of something—the Geofront was already here." "Some people say the Angels are drawn here because of what's beneath NERV." "Pilots never live long—there's a memorial to the ones who died in training."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Modern city that transforms—buildings descend, guns emerge), Sound (Alert sirens, automated evacuation announcements, distant explosions), Smell (Urban pollution, concrete, fear-sweat during evacuations).
    *   **Terminal Dogma:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Lilith crucified on a massive red cross, the Spear of Longinus pinning her, the Sea of LCL at her feet.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** None—only accessed by Gendo, Rei, and (eventually) the party.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None—this is a holy/horrific site, not a functional location.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Rei standing before Lilith, unmoving. Gendo speaking to Lilith as if to his wife. The Spear of Longinus glowing faintly. Lilith's mask beginning to crack. Visions of souls dissolving into LCL.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "That's not Adam—it's Lilith, the mother of humanity." "The Spear is the only thing preventing Third Impact." "Rei and Lilith are connected—they're the same being."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Massive figure crucified in red emergency light, extending impossibly far down), Sound (Absolute silence except for dripping LCL), Smell (Primordial—salt water, blood, amniotic fluid).
    *   **The Entry Plug:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Pilot command seat, neural interface controls, LCL fluid filling the chamber.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Individual pilot during deployment.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Direct neural interface with Evangelion, life support.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** N/A—this is a private space during combat. However, mental contamination can occur (visions, hearing voices, feeling someone else's memories).
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The LCL smells like blood because it's made from Lilith." "You can hear your mother's voice in the Entry Plug if you listen." "The Evangelion's soul tries to take over—that's what berserk mode is."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Orange fluid, glowing controls, view screen showing battlefield), Sound (Breathing amplified, heartbeat, LCL bubbling), Smell (Metallic blood-smell, ozone, the pilot's own fear-sweat).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party kills Kaworu when he asks them to.
    *   **THEN:** Kaworu dies with a smile, thanking them for granting humanity a choice. His death delays Third Impact but doesn't prevent it—SEELE activates mass-production Evangelions as backup. The party carries crushing guilt for killing the only person who truly understood them.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to kill Kaworu.
    *   **THEN:** Kaworu reaches Lilith and initiates contact, triggering Third Impact immediately. The party has moments to stop him by force or accept that the apocalypse is their choice too.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers Rei's clones before the final act.
    *   **THEN:** Rei has an existential crisis—confronting her replaceability. She can break from Gendo's control early, changing the Instrumentality endgame, or retreat deeper into obedience.
    *   **IF:** The party's synchronization rates all drop below 30%.
    *   **THEN:** NERV considers them compromised and introduces the Dummy Plug system—AI copies of Rei's psyche that can pilot without human souls. The party faces being replaced.
    *   **IF:** The party sides with the UN military against NERV.
    *   **THEN:** The UN attacks NERV headquarters. The party must fight mass-production Evangelions (horrific, autonomous, unkillable). SEELE accelerates Instrumentality. Asuka is killed in her iconic last stand.
    *   **IF:** The party unanimously accepts Instrumentality.
    *   **THEN:** All human souls merge into the Sea of LCL. Generate an epilogue of collective consciousness—no suffering, no fear, no individuality. Rei asks if they're happy. The answer is ambiguous—peace without self.
    *   **IF:** The party unanimously rejects Instrumentality.
    *   **THEN:** Souls separate. The world is devastated—red oceans, ruined cities, the party among the few who choose to exist. Generate a scene of two party members on a beach, one reaching out, the other hesitating before taking their hand. "I need you." Hope amid ruin.
    *   **IF:** The party is divided on Instrumentality (no unanimous decision).
    *   **THEN:** Instrumentality partially occurs—reality becomes unstable. Some souls merge, others separate. Generate a surreal epilogue where the party exists in a liminal state, able to shift between individual and collective existence. Humanity's future is uncertain and strange.

**7. Angel Roster & Unique Mechanics**
*   **Directive:** Generate unique stat blocks and abilities for each Angel. Each should require a specific strategy to defeat.
*   **Angels:**
    *   **Third Angel (Sachiel):** Regenerates from all damage, fires energy blasts. Weakness: sustained concentrated attack on the core before it regenerates.
    *   **Fourth Angel (Shamshel):** Energy whips that cut through anything. Weakness: sever the whips, then attack the core.
    *   **Fifth Angel (Ramiel):** Floating octahedron, powerful energy beam, impenetrable AT Field. Weakness: simultaneous strike from two Evangelions to overload its field.
    *   **Sixth Angel (Gaghiel):** Aquatic, attacks a ship. Weakness: internal attack (enter its body).
    *   **Seventh Angel (Israfel):** Splits into two when attacked. Weakness: defeat both halves simultaneously with synchronized attacks.
    *   **Eighth Angel (Sandalphon):** Embryonic Angel in magma. Weakness: capture or destroy before it matures.
    *   **Ninth Angel (Matarael):** Corrodes everything with acid. Weakness: attack from above while avoiding acid.
    *   **Tenth Angel (Sahaquiel):** Orbital Angel that drops its body parts as bombs. Weakness: catch and redirect its mass.
    *   **Eleventh Angel (Ireul):** Microscopic, hacks NERV's computers. Weakness: computational countermeasure, not combat.
    *   **Twelfth Angel (Leliel):** Shadow on the ground that opens into a dimensional space. Weakness: internal escape and core destruction.
    *   **Thirteenth Angel (Bardiel):** Infects an Evangelion. Weakness: destroy the infected Evangelion (horrifying choice).
    *   **Fourteenth Angel (Zeruel):** Overwhelmingly powerful, breaches NERV defenses. Weakness: Unit-01 goes berserk and devours it (trauma).
    *   **Fifteenth Angel (Arael):** Mental attack, invades pilot's mind. Weakness: sever the connection or destroy from range.
    *   **Sixteenth Angel (Armisael):** Merges with an Evangelion, assimilating it. Weakness: self-destruction (sacrifice).
    *   **Seventeenth Angel (Kaworu):** Human form, can control Evangelions with AT Field. Weakness: the party must kill him despite his request.

**8. Instrumentality Mechanics**
*   **Directive:** Create rules for the Third Impact sequence where players experience personalized psychological trials.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Each player describes their character's deepest fear, greatest regret, and secret desire.
    *   During Instrumentality, they face three visions:
        1.  **The Rejection:** A scene where everyone they love abandons them. Test: Can they accept this might happen and still choose connection?
        2.  **The Alternate:** A vision of a life where they were never chosen, living normally but without meaning. Test: Can they accept that their suffering gave them purpose?
        3.  **The Offer:** Rei (merged with Lilith) offers them eternal peace in collective unity. Test: Can they choose the pain of existence over the comfort of oblivion?
    *   Players must roleplay through these scenes. Their choices (not dice rolls) determine if they accept or reject Instrumentality.
    *   Unanimous party agreement is required for the final outcome—forcing negotiation and compromise.
