# Creative Brief: Children of the Angels

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Bio-Mechanical Horror Meets Clinical Depression (Evangelion Aesthetic)

Inspired by the unsettling fusion of organic and mechanical, the sterile depression of institutional facilities, and the cosmic dread of incomprehensible entities, this style creates a world where technology bleeds, angels defy geometry, and teenagers bear apocalyptic burdens. It aims to capture psychological horror, the violence of bio-mechanical fusion, and the visual weight of existential despair.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Bio-Mechanical Fusion:** Evangelions should look grown, not built—cables like veins, armor plating like ribs, eyes that seem conscious.
*   **Contrast Mundane and Cosmic:** Normal school life juxtaposed with apocalyptic Angel battles and incomprehensible conspiracies.
*   **Youth Carrying Adult Burdens:** Characters are teenagers but their eyes hold trauma and exhaustion beyond their years.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Psychological horror, bio-mechanical, cosmic dread, clinical depression, apocalyptic, parental abandonment, chosen suffering, existential crisis.
*   **Feeling:** The loneliness of the chosen. The horror of being the only solution. The weight of fighting incomprehensible beings with your soul as the weapon.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Evangelions:** Massive humanoid bio-mechs with organic curves beneath mechanical armor. Long, unsettling proportions. Faces with multiple eyes or mandibles hidden beneath helmets.
*   **Angels:** Geometrically impossible forms—shifting masses of light, crystalline structures that defy perspective, organic shapes with too many symmetries.
*   **NERV Facilities:** Harsh geometric architecture—hexagonal patterns, stark corridors, everything either blindingly white or shadow-black.
*   **Textures:** Smooth bio-armor that looks like it could bruise, cables and tubes pulsing with fluid, sterile metal surfaces, incomprehensible Angel geometries.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration of an Evangelion Unit-01 in dynamic pose. Bio-mechanical design with purple armor plating over sinewy artificial muscle. The face has a helmeted head with four glowing green eyes. Cables and tubes connect to its spine. The overall design suggests something grown in a lab, not built in a factory. Dark, moody lighting."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Evangelions:** Unit-01 (purple/green), Unit-02 (red/orange), Unit-00 (blue/white)—each with vibrant, unnatural colors suggesting artificial life.
*   **NERV Headquarters:** Sterile whites, institutional grays, with accent colors of warning yellow/black and emergency red.
*   **Angels:** Impossible colors—iridescent whites, glowing oranges, crystalline rainbows, colors that seem to shift when looked at directly.
*   **The Geofront:** Artificial daylight in a massive underground cavity—bright but wrong, like fluorescent tubes imitating the sun.
*   **Third Impact:** Reds and oranges bleeding into purples—the sky itself wounded, the world dissolving into primordial soup (LCL).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of sterile institutional white and cold gray for the facility, contrasted by the Evangelion's vibrant purple armor and toxic green bioluminescent accents. Emergency lighting casts harsh red shadows. The overall atmosphere is clinical yet organic, unsettling."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Pilots (Party):** Ages 14-16, drawn with tired eyes, poor posture suggesting depression, wearing school uniforms or form-fitting plug suits (with geometric patterns).
*   **Rei Ayanami:** Pale skin, short blue hair, red eyes, expressionless face. Always looks slightly distant, like she's not quite present.
*   **Asuka Langley:** Long red hair, blue eyes, aggressive expression hiding deep insecurity. Interface headset often worn.
*   **Gendo Ikari:** Middle-aged, glasses that hide his eyes (reflecting light), always in NERV commander uniform, hands in signature steepled position.
*   **Kaworu Nagisa:** Pale skin, gray hair, red eyes, gentle smile—angelic and unsettling, too perfect to be human.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A teenage pilot, age 14, with haunted eyes showing exhaustion and trauma. Messy dark hair, wearing a white and black plug suit with geometric orange accents. Standing in the Entry Plug cockpit filled with orange LCL fluid. Expression is determined but brittle, like they might break. Harsh overhead lighting."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **NERV Command Center:** Massive room with hexagonal ceiling displays, rows of computer terminals, dominated by a giant view screen. Everything is gray metal and glowing monitors.
*   **The Geofront:** A massive spherical cavity containing forests, lakes, and NERV's pyramid. Artificial sunlight from an unknown source. Utterly wrong.
*   **Entry Plug:** Claustrophobic cylindrical cockpit, pilot seated in command chair, surrounded by neural interface controls, filled with breathable orange liquid (LCL).
*   **Tokyo-3:** A modern city designed as a weapon—buildings retract underground, massive gun turrets emerge, all automated and cold.
*   **Terminal Dogma:** Deep underground chamber in perpetual red emergency lighting. Lilith crucified on a massive cross, her lower body dissolving into shadow. The chamber extends impossibly far down.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of NERV command center, vast and intimidating. Hexagonal ceiling patterns with glowing amber displays showing Angel data. Rows of staff at computer terminals below. Massive view screen at the front showing tactical map. Commander Gendo and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki standing on elevated platform. Cold blue-gray color scheme with amber accent lights. Brutalist architecture suggesting oppressive authority."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **NERV Facilities:** Harsh overhead fluorescent lighting creating minimal shadows, or dramatic spotlighting in command centers. Emergency scenes bathed in red warning lights.
*   **Angel Battles:** Unnatural lighting—Angels glow with internal light, casting colored shadows. Explosions create stark white flashes. The sun seems dimmer during Angel attacks.
*   **Entry Plug:** Diffused orange light from LCL fluid surrounding pilot, creating an amniotic, claustrophobic atmosphere.
*   **Third Impact:** The sky becomes a gradient of apocalyptic reds and oranges, bleeding light that dissolves shadows. Everything becomes overexposed as boundaries break down.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh white fluorescent overhead lights creating a sterile, overexposed atmosphere with minimal shadows. Emergency red warning lights pulse in the background. The Evangelion's eyes glow with toxic green bioluminescence cutting through the clinical white. The overall lighting suggests nowhere to hide, total exposure."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use extreme angles—low shots making Evangelions and Angels seem impossibly large, high shots making pilots seem small and isolated. Symmetry for NERV institutional shots. Broken symmetry and impossible geometry for Angels.
*   **Techniques:** Pilots shown alone in vast empty spaces (conveying isolation). Evangelions towering over cities (conveying scale and terror). Close-ups on eyes showing psychological weight.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dramatic low-angle shot of Evangelion Unit-01 standing over a destroyed cityscape. The bio-mech towers impossibly high, silhouetted against a blood-red sky. Small buildings in the foreground emphasize the scale. Smoke and debris swirl around its feet. The Evangelion's glowing eyes stare down at the viewer. Composition conveys overwhelming power and existential dread."

## Voice

A voice of a young teenager (14-16 years old) carrying unbearable weight—speaking with forced calm that occasionally cracks into despair or raw emotion. Neutral accent (Japanese-English or soft American) suggesting institutional upbringing that strips away regional identity. The pacing is slow and deliberate, with long pauses as if the speaker is dissociating or struggling to continue. Occasional tremors of suppressed emotion—fear, anger, grief. Audio quality is slightly hollow, as if speaking through an intercom or from inside the Entry Plug. Role: A pilot recording a testament, a confession, or a farewell message, knowing they may not survive the next battle.

## Sound Design

*   **Evangelion Movement:** Deep mechanical groans layered with organic wet sounds—cables stretching, artificial muscles contracting, breathing.
*   **AT Field Activation:** A rising crystalline hum that makes the air vibrate, like reality itself tensing.
*   **Angel Presence:** Incomprehensible sounds—backwards vocals, whale songs pitched wrong, mechanical screaming that hurts to hear.
*   **NERV Alarms:** Klaxons and automated warnings in calm, clinical voices announcing apocalyptic events matter-of-factly.
*   **LCL Fluid:** Bubbling, breathing sounds when pilots submerge—amniotic and claustrophobic.
*   **Third Impact:** All sounds begin to overlap and merge—voices, screams, music bleeding together as individuality dissolves.

## Music Palette

*   **Battle Themes:** Orchestral pieces mixing classical grandeur with discordant electronic elements—suggesting both heroism and wrongness.
*   **Psychological Scenes:** Minimalist piano or strings, isolated and lonely, occasionally building to overwhelming crescendos of strings representing emotional breakdown.
*   **Angel Themes:** Choir vocals singing in unknown languages, creating a sense of the divine and incomprehensible.
*   **Instrumentality:** All music fades into a single sustained tone—all melodies merging into one, representing the loss of individual voices.
*   **Iconic Reference:** "Komm, süsser Tod" (Come, Sweet Death)—a deceptively gentle pop song about choosing oblivion over suffering.

## Tone Guidance for AI Narration

*   **Maintain Clinical Distance:** Describe horrific events in matter-of-fact terms, letting the horror speak for itself.
*   **Emphasize Isolation:** Even in group scenes, highlight how characters are emotionally distant from each other.
*   **Body Horror:** Don't shy from describing the visceral reality of bio-mechanical fusion—blood, pain, the sensation of artificial nerves.
*   **Existential Dread:** Use cosmic terminology—"the geometry of the Angel defies comprehension," "the boundaries between souls begin to dissolve."
*   **Moments of Beauty:** Amid horror, include small moments of connection or beauty to make the stakes feel real—a shared meal, a moment of understanding, a sunset before battle.
