### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Subliminal control, working-class rebellion, alien infiltration, truth through glasses, obey consume conform
*   **Feeling:** The horror of realizing your reality is constructed lies. The isolation of seeing truth no one else can.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Normal Reality:** Full color, realistic 1980s urban America
*   **Truth Vision:** Black and white, high contrast, stark
*   **Subliminal Text:** Black text on white or vice versa
*   **Alien Flesh:** Grayish-green skull faces with hollow eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "Split-screen composition. Left: full color billboard advertising luxury products, beautiful model. Right: same scene in black and white through special glasses revealing hidden message 'OBEY' in stark black text. The model's face revealed as grotesque skull. High contrast black and white creating unsettling effect."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Working Class Heroes:** Construction workers, drifters, blue collar clothing
*   **Aliens in Disguise:** Appear as wealthy humans—suits, professional attire
*   **Aliens Revealed:** Skull faces with hollow eye sockets, elongated features
*   **The Awakened:** Those who can see truth, slightly haunted expressions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A working-class man in construction gear—jeans, work boots, flannel shirt. Wearing strange sunglasses with dark lenses. Through his perspective (black and white): a businessman transforms into skull-faced alien in expensive suit. The alien's face is grotesque—exposed skull, hollow eyes, minimal flesh. The man's expression shows horror of revelation."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Urban Decay:** 1980s American cities, homeless camps, industrial zones
*   **Advertising Everywhere:** Billboards, magazines, TV screens with hidden messages
*   **Upper Class Spaces:** Banks, corporate offices where aliens congregate
*   **Underground Hideouts:** Resistance bases in abandoned buildings
*   **Prompt Example:** "A 1980s city street lined with advertising. Normal view: colorful billboards promoting products, magazines in stands, TV displays. Through glasses view: every advertisement contains subliminal commands in stark black text: 'CONSUME,' 'OBEY,' 'NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT,' 'MARRY AND REPRODUCE.' The vibrant advertising becomes oppressive propaganda."

**5. The Glasses:**
*   **Iconic Object:** Simple black sunglasses with special lenses
*   **Transformation:** Wearing them shifts reality to black and white truth
*   **Visual Effect:** Split-screen showing before/after, color/truth
*   **Distribution:** Resistance distributes glasses to awaken humans
*   **Prompt Example:** "Close-up of hands holding simple black sunglasses. In the lenses' reflection: on one side, colorful normal reality; on other, stark black-and-white truth. The glasses themselves are unremarkable—just cheap sunglasses containing impossible revelation. Background split between color and black-and-white."

**6. Subliminal Messages:**
*   **Everywhere:** Every advertisement, magazine, paper contains hidden commands
*   **Typography:** Bold sans-serif in stark black on white
*   **Commands:** "OBEY," "CONSUME," "REPRODUCE," "CONFORM," "SUBMIT," "WATCH TV"
*   **Money:** Currency says "THIS IS YOUR GOD"
*   **Prompt Example:** "Magazine cover through the glasses. What appeared as fashion magazine now reveals in stark black text: 'CONSUME' across the top, 'NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT' in the center, 'THIS IS YOUR GOD' on price tag. Every inch of space contains commands. The pleasant imagery becomes vehicle for mind control."

**7. The Aliens:**
*   **Disguised:** Appear as normal humans in positions of power
*   **Revealed:** Grotesque skulls with minimal flesh, hollow eyes
*   **Watch Devices:** Aliens wear watches detecting awakened humans
*   **Business Like:** Treat Earth as corporate acquisition, not violent invasion
*   **Prompt Example:** "Comparison image. Left panel: handsome businessman in expensive suit at corporate office, smiling. Right panel (through glasses): same person revealed as skull-faced alien. Elongated skull, hollow eye sockets glowing faintly, remnants of flesh clinging to bone. Still wearing the suit. The horror is how normal they appear disguised."

**8. The Awakening:**
*   **Put on Glasses:** The moment of revelation, reality shattering
*   **Resistance:** Many fight to not see truth
*   **The Fight:** Extended combat to make someone wear glasses
*   **Mass Awakening:** Broadcast revealing truth to all humanity
*   **Prompt Example:** "A man struggling to put glasses on another man's face. Extended fistfight in alley. Both bloodied and exhausted. One desperate to show truth, other desperate to remain ignorant. Around them, normal city life continues—people unable to see either the fight's purpose or the hidden messages covering every surface."

**9. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Normal Scenes:** Realistic 1980s lighting, natural colors
*   **Truth Vision:** High contrast black and white, deep shadows, harsh whites
*   **No Grays:** Truth is stark—black text on white, white on black
*   **Horror Lighting:** Skull faces lit to emphasize grotesque features
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dual lighting approach. Normal reality has naturalistic 1980s color and lighting. Truth vision (through glasses) is high-contrast black and white—deep blacks, bright whites, minimal grays. Text appears in perfect contrast. Alien faces are harshly lit revealing every skull detail. The visual shift is jarring and unsettling."

## Voice

A working-class, matter-of-fact narration style like someone delivering terrible news with blue-collar directness. The pacing is deliberate—this is too important to rush. The tone shifts between exhausted cynicism and righteous anger, treating the conspiracy as both horrifying and grimly expected. Frequent use of the subliminal commands as emphasis. Role: The voice of uncomfortable truth, of the working class finally seeing how they're controlled, and deciding to fight even though it means giving up comfortable ignorance.
