**Campaign Type / Genre:** Conspiracy Thriller / Alien Infiltration / Social Commentary
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **10-12**
**Tone (keywords):** subliminal control, special glasses reveal truth, consume obey reproduce, alien infiltrators, working-class rebellion
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party consists of down-on-their-luck working-class drifters who discover special sunglasses that reveal the truth: advertising and media contain subliminal alien messages commanding humans to "OBEY," "CONSUME," and "REPRODUCE." The ruling class are actually skull-faced aliens using mind control to keep humanity docile while they drain Earth's resources. As the party joins the human resistance, they must navigate a world where most people are brainwashed sleepers, authority figures are aliens, and the simple act of making someone put on the glasses might require the world's longest fistfight. Truth hurts, but ignorance enslaves.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

An awakening from comfortable slavery to uncomfortable freedom and rebellion.

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1-7):** The party meets a mysterious drifter who leads them to an underground resistance group. When they acquire the special sunglasses, reality shatters—billboards say "OBEY," money says "THIS IS YOUR GOD," and some humans have skull faces. These are aliens who've infiltrated society's upper echelons, using subliminal signals to control humanity. The party must convince skeptical friends to see the truth while evading alien enforcers who kill anyone who awakens. Their first mission: destroy a local broadcast station spreading the signal.
*   **Act II — The Resistance (Sessions 8-13):** Joining the organized underground movement, the party learns the full scope: aliens arrived years ago, infiltrated gradually, and now control media, government, and corporations. The resistance has limited time before a signal amplifier is completed that will make control permanent. The party conducts operations—distributing glasses, sabotaging transmitters, exposing aliens—while trying to awaken more humans. But most people don't want to know the truth, fighting to remain in comfortable ignorance.
*   **Act III — Signal Zero (Sessions 14-20):** The resistance launches a desperate assault on the alien transmitter complex to broadcast the truth globally. The party must fight through alien security, human collaborators, and their own doubts about whether destroying the illusion will cause more harm than good. The climactic choice: destroy the transmitter and awaken all humanity to terrible truth, or preserve the signal and let people remain happy slaves. Either way, the aliens won't go quietly, and the cost of freedom is measured in lives.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of media manipulation, class warfare, comfortable slavery vs. uncomfortable freedom, and whether truth is always better than ignorance. It asks: Would you rather live happy lies or miserable truth? Is the working class kept poor by design? Can you force people to be free? The central conflict pits the party's awakened consciousness against a world of willing slaves and desperate alien refugees, with the meta-question being whether they're fighting for freedom or destroying humanity's last chance at happiness.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Glasses**
*   Special sunglasses reveal subliminal messages and aliens
*   Without glasses, appear to be normal but see truth
*   Aliens detect who's wearing glasses through their watches
*   Must convince others to wear glasses—often requires combat
*   Can be damaged or lost, making truth invisible again

### 2. **Subliminal Awareness**
*   Track party's awareness of hidden messages
*   Higher awareness causes stress but grants bonuses
*   Can read alien communications and predict moves
*   Too much awareness risks madness
*   Others can tell you "know" by subtle behavior changes

### 3. **The Great Persuasion**
*   Convincing NPCs to wear glasses is skill challenge
*   Some fight physically to avoid truth (extended combat)
*   Success depends on NPC's willingness to know
*   Failed persuasion makes them report you to authorities
*   Famous scene: longest fistfight to make friend put on glasses

### 4. **Alien Detection**
*   Aliens appear human without glasses
*   With glasses: skull faces, different speech patterns
*   They can detect awakened humans through behavioral tells
*   Pretending to still be asleep is skill challenge
*   Aliens have watches that alert to nearby conscious humans

### 5. **The Signal Strength**
*   Control signal has varying power levels
*   Strong signal areas make awakening harder
*   Destroying transmitters weakens local signal
*   Final transmitter will make control permanent
*   Party must work fast before amplification completes

### 6. **Collaborator vs. Sleeper**
*   Some humans know truth but serve aliens for power
*   Others are genuinely brainwashed sleepers
*   Must determine which is which
*   Collaborators are more dangerous—they fight willingly
*   Can potentially turn collaborators with evidence of alien plans

### 7. **Freedom vs. Happiness**
*   Track "Awakened" NPCs and their reactions
*   Many prefer return to ignorance
*   Forcing truth on unprepared causes trauma
*   Final choice: broadcast truth and cause mass suffering, or let comfortable slavery continue
