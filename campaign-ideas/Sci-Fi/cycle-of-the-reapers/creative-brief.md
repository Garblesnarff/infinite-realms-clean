# Creative Brief: Cycle of the Reapers

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Military Sci-Fi Space Opera with Cosmic Scale (Mass Effect-inspired)

Inspired by the sleek, cinematic aesthetics of *Mass Effect* with military sci-fi and cosmic horror influences. This style captures the grandeur of galactic civilizations, diverse alien species, Reaper cosmic dread, squad-based camaraderie, and the contrast between advanced technology and ancient mysteries.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** Massive Reapers, city-sized space stations, planetary vistas, galactic-level threats
*   **Sleek Tech Design:** Smooth curves, glowing elements, holographic interfaces, clean sci-fi aesthetics
*   **Alien Diversity:** Each species has distinct visual identity—turians (avian), asari (blue humanoid), salarians (amphibian)
*   **Cosmic Horror Elements:** Reapers are incomprehensible, terrifying, ancient beyond understanding

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Space opera, military sci-fi, squad loyalty, cosmic horror, choice-driven, galactic war, unity against extinction, cinematic
*   **Feeling:** The weight of galactic stakes. Brotherhood/sisterhood of your squad. Terror before incomprehensible cosmic forces. Hope through unity.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary Palette:** Deep space blacks, metallic grays and blues, bioluminescent blues and greens
*   **Faction Colors:** Alliance blue, Cerberus gold/orange, Reaper red
*   **Tech Glow:** Blue (standard), Orange (Cerberus), Red (Reaper), Purple (dark energy/biotics)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by deep space black with blue holographic interfaces. Alliance blue armor with orange highlights. Purple biotic energy crackling around hands. Red Reaper laser beams cutting through the darkness. Metallic silver-gray ship interiors with glowing blue panels."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Humans:** Sleek armor with hard-light elements, N7 logo (red stripe on white), tactical gear
*   **Turians:** Avian features, metallic exoskeletons, mandibles, military bearing, blue/gray colony markings
*   **Asari:** Blue skin, head tentacles (like dreadlocks), biotic purple aura, elegant but deadly
*   **Krogan:** Massive, reptilian, quad organs visible on head, scarred, tank-like builds
*   **Quarians:** Environmental suits with glowing eyes (purple/white), digitigrade legs, nomadic aesthetic
*   **Prompt Example:** "A human Spectre in red-and-white N7 armor with glowing blue omni-tool on forearm. Standing beside a turian in gray plated exoskeleton with blue facial markings and a massive rifle. Behind them, an asari in purple combat outfit with biotic energy swirling around her hands. Sleek, cinematic sci-fi aesthetic. Dramatic team pose."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Citadel:** Massive O'Neill cylinder space station with impossible scale, glowing skyscrapers inside, ships docking
*   **The Normandy:** Sleek stealth frigate interior—blue holographic displays, crew quarters, galaxy map war room
*   **Mass Relays:** Enormous rotating rings in space generating blue energy corridors for FTL travel
*   **Destroyed Earth:** London in ruins, Reaper beams destroying buildings, ash falling, desperate last stand
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Citadel space station interior—impossible scale with a city built inside a massive ring. Hovering vehicles, holographic advertisements, multiple species walking together. Towering skyscrapers with blue lighting. Through the transparent ceiling, space and nebulae visible. Sleek, advanced, utopian architecture with art deco influences."

**5. Reapers & Combat:**
*   **Reaper Design:** Massive cuttlefish-like starships, red glowing eyes/core, tentacle-like appendages, incomprehensibly large
*   **Indoctrination:** Visual distortion, whispers, red lighting corruption
*   **Biotic Combat:** Purple/blue energy barriers, warp fields, telekinetic throws, gravity manipulation
*   **Weapons:** Sleek firearms with glowing heat sinks, omni-blades materializing from wrist
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive Reaper—kilometer-long cuttlefish-shaped starship with a glowing red core—looming over a burning cityscape. Its laser beams cut through skyscrapers. In the foreground, a squad takes cover behind rubble. One member creates a purple biotic barrier, another fires a rifle with blue tracer rounds. Orange explosions, ash falling, desperate last stand atmosphere."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High Tech Lighting:** Holographic blue glows, LED-strip accent lighting, volumetric light shafts
*   **Space Lighting:** Deep blacks with stars, nebula colors (red/blue/purple), dramatic rim lighting
*   **Reaper Glow:** Ominous red lighting when Reapers appear
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with blue holographic displays providing key lighting. Rim lighting from stars through the viewport. Volumetric fog from vents. A Reaper outside the window casts ominous red light across the scene. High contrast between the cold blue tech and warm orange human areas. Cinematic sci-fi lighting with lens flares."

## Voice

A commanding, resolute voice carrying both military authority and personal warmth. Shifts between tactical briefings (clipped, professional) and heartfelt conversations with squad (genuine, caring). The tone acknowledges cosmic-scale threats while maintaining hope through unity. Capable of both Paragon idealism ("We'll find a way") and Renegade determination ("Whatever it takes"). Role: The voice of leadership under impossible pressure, refusing to surrender.
