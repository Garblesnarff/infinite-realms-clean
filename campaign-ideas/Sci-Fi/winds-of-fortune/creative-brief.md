# Creative Brief: Winds of Fortune

## Art Style
Traditional Chinese aesthetic mixed with living tiles. Characters appear as anthropomorphic mahjong tiles—Bamboo people have green bamboo patterns on their bodies, Character people have Chinese calligraphy, Dot people have circular patterns. Dragons are massive serpentine entities. Winds appear as directional elemental forces (East=spring breeze, South=summer heat, West=autumn gusts, North=winter frost). The Wall is a massive square structure of stacked ivory tiles.

## Music
Traditional Chinese instruments—guzheng, pipa, erhu. Bamboo flute for bamboo suit characters. Wind chimes for wind tiles. Percussive tile clicking as rhythmic element. Dragon themes use deep gongs and ceremonial drums. Matching moments have satisfying harmonic resolution. Wind rotation causes key changes in music.

## Voice Direction

**East Wind Emperor**: Authoritative, traditional, speaks in ancient formal Chinese cadence

**South Wind Rebellion**: Passionate, rapid, fiery speech pattern, revolutionary fervor

**West Wind Sage**: Contemplative, pauses between statements, speaks in philosophical riddles

**North Wind Finisher**: Cold, final, speaks of endings without emotion, acceptance of death

**Dragons**: Deep, ancient, multilayered voices—speak in poetry and prophecy

**Pung Master**: Repetitive speech pattern (says things in threes, matching the pung concept)

**Chow Dancer**: Flowing, sequential speech, one thought leading naturally to the next

**The 145th Tile**: Glitching voice, shifts between different tile types' speech patterns, undefined

## Cinematic Moments

**Forming a Pung**: Three identical tiles (three 7-Bamboo characters) meet. Recognition—"You are me. We are one." They merge into a glowing triangular formation. Power surge as the pung completes.

**Wind Rotation**: The four cardinal directions shift. East wind changes to North. Landscape transforms—spring becomes winter in seconds. Characters aligned with East must adapt to North. Disorienting and beautiful.

**Dragon Appearance**: One of the three dragons manifests—massive serpentine form. Red Dragon emerges from flames, Green from forest, White from void. Their tile symbols glow in the world.

**Declaring Mahjong**: Character has 13 tiles arranged in hand. The 14th tile appears (drawn or claimed). Slow motion as they declare "Mahjong!" The complete hand glows, reality shifts. They've achieved completion—victory or death?

**The 145th Tile Reveals**: The impossible extra tile finally shows its true form. It doesn't match existing suits or honors—it's something new. Golden, impossible, breaking all known rules. The Wall cracks around it.
