## SECTION 1: DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### The Origin Myth: The Great Scramble
Before the **Wall**, there was only the **Ivory Noise**—a screaming, infinite white void where geometry held no sway. There was no Up, only Out. Then came the **Three Great Dragons**: **Zhong (Red)**, **Fa Cai (Green)**, and **Bai Ban (White)**. They did not create the universe; they *curated* it. They reached into the Noise and performed **The First Sort**. They discarded the infinite chaos and kept only 144 concepts, binding them into rigid rectangular forms called **Tiles**.

To ensure these concepts would not dissolve back into the Noise, the Dragons built the **Great Wall**—a metaphysical barrier defining the boundaries of reality. They established the **Four Winds** to blow time across the surface of the world, creating the concept of "Next." But the discarded chaos, the **Noise**, never left. It waits outside the Wall, and sometimes, it leaks in. The **145th Tile** is not a new creation; it is a leak.

### The Timeline of the Table (20 Events)
1.  **Year 0:** **The First Deal.** The Dragons arrange the Wall. Time begins moving East to North.
2.  **Year 44:** **The Separation of Suits.** The original monolithic race splits into **Bamboo**, **Character**, and **Dot** phenotypes based on their utility.
3.  **Year 108:** **The First Pung War.** Identical triplets assert dominance over sequential **Chows**. The concept of "Class Segregation" is invented.
4.  **Year 200:** **The Year of No Wind.** The air went still for 300 days. No babies were born. The **Dead Wall** grew visible to the naked eye.
5.  **Year 333:** **The Ivory Rot (Low Prob).** A plague where the pips (dots/markings) fell off the faces of the **Dot Clan**. They became **White Dragons** temporarily, causing mass hysteria.
6.  **Year 404:** **The Glitch of the 8-Bamboo.** Every 8-Bamboo tile in existence simultaneously forgot their name.
7.  **Year 500:** **The Rise of the East.** **Dong Huang** establishes the Imperial Dealer protocol, enslaving the turn order.
8.  **Year 612:** **The Furiten Tragedy.** A major general discarded a tile he needed to win a war. Metaphysical backlash erased a city.
9.  **Year 777:** **The Jackpot Heresy (Low Prob).** A cult attempted to introduce "Jokers" into the Wall. They were calcified into the mountains.
10. **Year 888:** **The Kong Rebellion.** Four-of-a-kind groups demanded their own kingdom. They were banished to the **Center**.
11. **Year 901:** **The Whispering Fog (Low Prob).** Clouds descended that spoke the players' inner thoughts. Social order collapsed for a decade.
12. **Year 999:** **The Terminal Crisis.** The 1s and 9s attempted to pinch the timeline shut to create a time loop.
13. **Year 1000:** **The Great Reshuffle.** A massive earthquake rearranged the geography. The **South Kingdom** migrated North.
14. **Year 1111:** **The Singular Day.** Everyone woke up believing they were the 1-Bamboo (The Bird).
15. **Year 1234:** **The Chow Enlightenment.** **The Sequence Seeker** proves that flow is stronger than rigidity.
16. **Year 1300:** **The Bleeding Wall (Low Prob).** The Great Wall began leaking liquid gold. Drinking it caused madness.
17. **Year 1350:** **The Shadow Deal (Low Prob).** Someone played a hand from the **Discard Pool**. The dead walked for a night.
18. **Year 1400:** **The Current Era.** The **East Wind Emperor** declares the cycle eternal.
19. **Year 1443:** **The False Win.** A generic NPC declared "Mahjong" without a hand. Reality flickered.
20. **Year 1444:** **Present Day.** The count is wrong. There is one tile too many.

### Cosmology: The Patrons
1.  **The Dealer (The Hand Above):** An abstract horror concept. The force that distributes fate. Prayed to for luck, feared for bad draws.
2.  **The Discard (The River):** The goddess of lost opportunities and past mistakes. She governs the **Discard Pool**.
3.  **The Eye (The Pair):** The god of duality and grounding. Without the Eye, no victory is possible.
4.  **The Tenpai (The Wait):** The patron of anticipation and anxiety. Worshipped by snipers and lovers.
5.  **The Ron (The Thief):** The trickster god of claiming what isn't yours to achieve victory.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The universe is a game played by the Dragons against the Noise. The inhabitants are the pieces. If the game ends (a "Perfect Hand" is played), the universe is boxed up and ceases to exist. Therefore, the **Goal of Life** for the enlightened is to **keep the game going forever** (Draw) or to **break the rules** (Evolution). Winning is suicide.

## SECTION 8: MECHANICS & SYSTEMS

### Physics & Magic
*   **Tile Gravity:** Gravity pulls towards the nearest "Wall." In the open, it's down. Near the Wall, it's sideways.
*   **Magic Source:** Magic comes from "The Draw." Casting a spell is drawing a tile from the ether.
*   **Completion:** Characters gain buffs when near their "Match" (Pair/Pung/Kong).

### Subsystems
1.  **Sanity (Fragmentation):** Instead of HP, you have Integrity. At 0, you "Shatter" and become a pile of unplayable shards.
2.  **Reputation (The Face):** High rep = "Honor Tile." Low rep = "Simple Tile." Affects social checks.
3.  **Survival (The Shuffle):** Every rest, the map rearranges slightly. Navigation checks are mandatory.

### New Player Options
1.  **Feat: Tenpai Awareness:** You cannot be surprised. You sense when combat is about to end.
2.  **Feat: Richii:** Declare an attack. If it hits, auto-crit. If it misses, you are stunned.
3.  **Spell: Tile Shield (Level 1):** Summon 3 floating tiles (+3 AC). Each hit destroys one.
4.  **Spell: Discard Teleport (Level 2):** Teleport to the last place you stood.
5.  **Spell: Dragon's Roar (Level 3):** AOE fear/damage based on dragon color.
