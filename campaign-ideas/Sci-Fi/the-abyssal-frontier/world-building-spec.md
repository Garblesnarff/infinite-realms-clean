- Mystery: What are they protecting?

## Historical Database Entries

### Precursor Log 1: Initial Arrival
*Translation from alien language*
"We have designated this ocean world as viable for our research station. The abundance of diverse life forms presents unparalleled opportunities for biological study. Initial surveys reveal at least one species exhibiting signs of intelligence—large aquatic beings with apparent telepathic capabilities. First contact protocols approved."

### Precursor Log 2: The Specimen
*500 years before Kharaa outbreak*
"Specimen 42-E retrieved from world designation [UNTRANSLATABLE]. Bacterial cultures demonstrate unprecedented resistance to standard containment. Recommend extreme caution. Potential applications in medical research warrant risk."

### Precursor Log 3: Containment Failure
*Day 1 of outbreak*
"EMERGENCY PROTOCOL. Specimen 42-E containment breach confirmed. Three researchers symptomatic. Facility lockdown initiated. All personnel to report infection status immediately."

### Precursor Log 4: Planetary Infection
*Week 3 of outbreak*
"The disease has spread planet-wide. All colonies report 100% infection rate. The bacterium is waterborne, airborne, and incredibly resilient. Death rate: 100% within two weeks of symptom onset. We estimate three months until total extinction."

### Precursor Log 5: The Emperor Solution
*Month 2 of outbreak*
"Analysis of indigenous life reveals one species shows natural immunity: The creature we designated 'Sea Emperor Leviathan.' We have successfully captured a mature specimen. Containment established. Research into immunity mechanism begins immediately. This may be our salvation."

### Precursor Log 6: Failed Experiments
*Month 4 of outbreak*
"Seventh juvenile Emperor expired. The immunity is not transferable through standard means. We've harvested genetic material, synthesized antibodies, attempted forced evolutionary processes. Nothing works. The adult specimen is too genetically complex to replicate. Population down to 30% of original."

### Precursor Log 7: The Eggs
*Month 6 of outbreak, final log*
"We are too late. The Emperor's eggs...we never thought to study them. By the time we realized juveniles post-hatching might produce the enzyme naturally, our population could no longer support the research. I am the last researcher in this facility. I set the automated systems to maintain the Emperor's life support. Perhaps...someone...someday...will finish our work. I have only hours left. Quarantine protocols activated. No one must spread this beyond our world. Forgive us."

### Degasi Log: Paul's Final Entry
*500 years ago, Lost River*
"Father is gone. Marguerit too. I'm alone in these depths, and I can feel the sickness in me. My skin...it's changing. The creatures here avoid me now, like they know I'm contaminated. I've seen things I can barely describe—massive skeletons, alien facilities still lit with green light. There's technology here that could change everything, but I'll never see home again. If anyone finds this: Be careful. This planet is beautiful, but it doesn't want us here. It never did."

This detailed world-building ensures The Abyssal Frontier campaign has depth and internal consistency for a memorable alien ocean exploration experience.
