# The Abyssal Frontier
**Tagline:** *Stranded in an Alien Ocean, Survival is Only the Beginning*

## Campaign Overview

The planar vessel *Horizon's Promise* was on a routine expedition to catalog new worlds when something went catastrophically wrong. A massive energy pulse struck the ship mid-transit, tearing it from the planes and crash-landing on an uncharted water world designated only as "Planet 4546B." The crew's escape pods scattered across a vast alien ocean, and communication with the main vessel is lost.

The party awakens in a damaged lifeboat, floating in turquoise waters under alien constellations. Around them stretches an endless ocean punctuated by massive coral structures, bioluminescent creatures, and mysterious ruins from a long-dead civilization. Their survival beacon is transmitting, but will anyone hear it? The ship's AI gives the grim news: The *Promise* is in pieces, scattered across the ocean floor. The nearest known civilization is seventeen light-years away.

To survive, the party must dive into this alien ecosystem—gathering resources, building bases, exploring increasingly dangerous depths, and uncovering the secrets of this world. Why was the ship shot down? What happened to the ancient civilization whose ruins dot the seafloor? And what is the massive life form detected in the deepest trenches? The party will discover that Planet 4546B is under quarantine for a reason, that survival and escape require unraveling thousand-year-old mysteries, and that the ocean's most beautiful wonders hide its deadliest threats.

## Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Degasi's Fate**: Previous survivors lasted 500 years before dying—one may still live (Marguerit), but is she friend or foe?

2. **Alterra's True Mission**: Aurora wasn't on routine mission—it was sent to recover Degasi's valuable cargo and investigate Precursor technology

3. **The Warpers' Purpose**: These creatures are Precursor bioweapons designed to enforce quarantine by killing infected beings

4. **The Sea Emperor's Manipulation**: Has she been influencing party telepathically from the start? Can they trust her?

5. **ARIS's Restrictions**: AI has been programmed to prioritize Alterra profits over crew safety—may sabotage certain choices

6. **The Kharaa's Intelligence**: Disease may be more than bacteria—could it be a weapon or even a life form?

7. **The Void's Secret**: The dead zone exists because adult leviathans killed all life—what are they protecting in the depths?

8. **Precursor Survivors**: One facility has an AI still active—it may have its own agenda for the cure
