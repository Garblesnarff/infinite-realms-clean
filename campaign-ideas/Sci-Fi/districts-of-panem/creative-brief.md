# Creative Brief: Districts of Panem

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dystopian Excess Meets Survival Brutality (Hunger Games meets Battle Royale)

Inspired by the stark contrast between Capitol opulence and district poverty, this style juxtaposes grotesque luxury with desperate survival. It aims to capture the propaganda spectacle of televised death, the brutal realism of arena combat, and the simmering hope of rebellion against oppression.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Contrast:** Capitol scenes are oversaturated, artificial, and decadent. Arena and district scenes are muted, natural, and harsh.
*   **Survival Desperation:** Characters show physical and emotional wear—dirt, injuries, exhaustion, but also determination.
*   **Televised Spectacle:** The Games are entertainment—bright lights, cameras, dramatic staging—even during brutal violence.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Brutal, televised, oppressive, desperate, propagandistic, class warfare, survival, defiance, sacrifice, spectacle.
*   **Feeling:** The weight of being watched. The horror of murder as entertainment. The spark of hope in the face of tyranny.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Capitol:** Exaggerated, theatrical forms. Excessive ornamentation, impractical fashion, architectural grandeur that borders on absurd.
*   **Districts:** Utilitarian, worn structures. Functional design with visible age and poverty. Coal dust, dirt, and labor.
*   **Arena:** Natural wilderness augmented with unnatural perfection—too-green grass, engineered creatures, hidden technology in trees.
*   **Textures:** Capitol: Silk, gold leaf, holographic screens, artificial materials. Districts: Rough wood, coal dust, threadbare cloth. Arena: Natural textures (bark, leaves, water) with subtle technological undertones.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in gritty realistic style. The arena is a dense forest with impossibly lush foliage. A tribute in simple earth-toned clothing crouches behind a tree, bow drawn, face streaked with dirt and fear. In the distance, the golden Cornucopia gleams unnaturally."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **The Capitol:** Oversaturated jewel tones—vibrant purples, electric blues, hot pinks, metallic golds. Everything is too bright, too rich, too artificial.
*   **The Districts:** Muted, dusty colors—grays, browns, faded blues. The palette of poverty and labor. Occasional pops of color from natural elements (flowers, sunlight) that highlight what's being suppressed.
*   **The Arena (Forest):** Rich natural greens and browns during the day, with unnatural vibrancy that suggests genetic engineering. At night, cold blues and deep shadows with occasional firelight.
*   **The Reaping:** Harsh, ceremonial whites and blacks for the formal gathering, with splashes of color from the Capitol escorts.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of oversaturated Capitol excess—electric blue suits, neon pink wigs, gold-leafed architecture, holographic advertisements in garish colors. Citizens with dyed skin (lavender, mint green, silver) wearing impractical, theatrical clothing. The lighting is bright and artificial, creating harsh contrasts."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Tributes:** Ages 12-18, diverse builds depending on district background. Visible physical traits from their labor (muscular from mining, lean from fishing, calloused hands). Simple, practical clothing that contrasts with Capitol excess. Faces show fear, determination, and exhaustion.
*   **Capitol Citizens:** Exaggerated, grotesque fashion—elaborate wigs, dyed skin, surgical modifications, theatrical makeup. Bodies often surgically altered for aesthetic absurdity.
*   **Stylists:** Artistic, wearing unusual but beautiful designs. More understated than average Capitol citizens but still clearly wealthy.
*   **Peacekeepers:** Faceless white armor with visored helmets, carrying shock batons and rifles. Intimidating, uniform, dehumanized.
*   **President Snow:** Elderly, pale, white hair and beard, impeccably dressed in white suits. Cold eyes, thin smile, always wearing a white rose (hiding the scent of blood on his breath).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tribute from District 12, age 16, female, with dark hair in a practical braid, olive skin, gray eyes. Lean build from hunting in the woods. Wearing a simple black tunic and pants (Reaping Day clothes). Expression shows defiant fear—jaw set, eyes hard but wet with unshed tears. Behind her, a crowd of gray-clad district residents."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **District 12 (The Seam):** Run-down wooden houses, coal dust coating everything, poor lighting, crowded conditions. Gray sky from industrial pollution.
*   **The Capitol:** Massive glass and metal skyscrapers, holographic advertisements, impossibly clean streets, elaborate fountains and gardens. Everything pristine and excessive.
*   **Training Center:** High-tech facility with weapon stations, survival skill areas, climbing walls, and camouflage stations. Clinical but impressive.
*   **The Arena (Forest):** Dense wilderness with a massive golden Cornucopia at the center. Hidden dangers—tracker jacker nests, poisonous plants, manufactured streams. The arena dome is invisible but occasionally shimmers.
*   **The Cornucopia:** A giant golden horn, 20 feet tall, spilling weapons, supplies, and food. Gleaming metal that contrasts with natural surroundings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of the Cornucopia and the surrounding arena launch platforms. A massive golden horn structure sits in a grassy clearing, surrounded by dense forest. Twenty-four metal platforms are arranged in a circle around it, each with a tribute standing frozen (pre-gong). The sky is unnaturally blue. The Cornucopia gleams with weapons—swords, bows, spears—and colorful backpacks."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Capitol:** Bright, artificial lighting with no natural shadows. Everything is illuminated for cameras and spectacle.
*   **Districts:** Overcast, dim lighting suggesting poverty and oppression. Coal dust creates hazy air. Firelight from hearths provides warmth.
*   **Arena (Day):** Bright, natural sunlight that makes hiding difficult. Everything is visible to cameras.
*   **Arena (Night):** Deep darkness broken by campfires, bioluminescent mutations, and the glow of the fallen tributes' faces projected in the sky.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh, bright sunlight that eliminates shadows and hiding places. The forest is vividly green, almost too perfect. In the distance, cameras mounted on trees gleam with red recording lights. The tribute's face is illuminated clearly, showing dirt, sweat, and a healing burn on one cheek."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use surveillance camera angles to emphasize the tributes being watched. Show the arena from both ground-level (intimate, dangerous) and overhead (strategic, spectacle). Capitol scenes use symmetry and grandeur. District scenes use crowding and claustrophobia.
*   **Techniques:** Close-ups on fearful faces during Reaping. Wide shots showing the scale of the Capitol's power. Dynamic action shots during arena combat. Contrasting cuts between brutality and Capitol audience reactions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic composition showing a tribute running through the forest, photographed from a slightly elevated angle as if from a hidden camera. The tribute is mid-stride, glancing over their shoulder in fear. Behind them, the blurred forms of the Career pack give chase. The forest blurs with motion. A small red light in the corner suggests a camera recording."

## Voice

A dual voice: (1) The Capitol Announcer—theatrical, enthusiastic, treating death as entertainment. Smooth, trained broadcaster voice (think American radio host) with excessive excitement for brutal moments. Fast-paced during action, dramatic pauses for tragedy. (2) The Tribute—young (mid-teens), breathless, desperate, determined. Regional accent (Appalachian for District 12, Southern coastal for District 4, etc.). Shifts between tactical focus (during survival) and emotional exhaustion (during quiet moments). Audio quality shifts from Capitol's crystal-clear broadcasts to the tributes' raw, unfiltered survival reality. Roles: Caesar Flickerman announcing the Games, or a tribute's internal thoughts during the arena.
