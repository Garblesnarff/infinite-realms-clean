## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act journey from nameless nobody to legendary challenger.

*   **Act I — The Nameless Fighter (Sessions 1-7):** The protagonist boxes in underground fixed matches, throwing fights for survival money. After a chance encounter with champion Yuri, they're inspired to fight for real and take the name "Joe." With help from former trainer Nanbu, they enter sanctioned Megalobox matches fighting without Gear—making them impossibly disadvantaged but unforgettable. They must prove Gearless Joe can compete against enhanced fighters.
*   **Act II — Climbing the Ranks (Sessions 8-13):** Having gained notoriety as the "Gearless" fighter, Joe climbs the rankings facing increasingly powerful opponents with advanced Gear technology. Each match risks serious injury as flesh faces metal and hydraulics. They face corporate-sponsored fighters, former champions seeking comeback, and those who see Joe's style as an insult. The team struggles with poverty and the physical toll of fighting without enhancement.
*   **Act III — Megalonia Tournament (Sessions 14-20):** The championship tournament brings together the world's top Megaloboxers. Joe must face opponents with military-grade Gear and decades of experience. The final opponent is Yuri—the undefeated champion whose perfect technique and advanced Gear make him seem invincible. In the ultimate match, Joe must prove that human spirit—Gearless and unenhanced—can stand equal to perfection.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Gear vs Gearless**
*   Standard Megalobox uses powered exoskeletons (Gear) enhancing strength, speed, defense
*   Joe fights Gearless—no enhancement, only human ability
*   Gear provides mechanical advantages but adds weight and restricts movement
*   Gearless grants: superior mobility, unpredictability, lower energy consumption
*   Facing Gear requires: dodging enhanced punches, targeting Gear weaknesses, outlasting opponents

### 2. **Damage Accumulation**
*   Fighting without Gear protection means serious accumulated injuries
*   Damage persists between fights—broken ribs, concussions, internal bleeding
*   Must manage: fighting through pain vs risking permanent damage
*   Medical care expensive—team often can't afford proper treatment
*   Injury affects performance in subsequent matches

### 3. **Underground vs Sanctioned**
*   Underground fights are fixed, controlled by yakuza, survival income
*   Sanctioned matches have rules, rankings, path to championship
*   Underground connections can help or harm sanctioned career
*   Escaping underground requires burning bridges with dangerous people

### 4. **Resource Scarcity**
*   Team operates on minimal budget—can barely afford entry fees
*   Equipment is aging and barely functional
*   No corporate sponsorship means no advantages
*   Must choose spending: medical care, training equipment, or tournament fees
*   Creative solutions required to compete with funded opponents

### 5. **Ranking System**
*   Must climb rankings through victories to qualify for Megalonia
*   Each rank brings tougher opponents with better Gear
*   Losses drop ranking significantly
*   Top 8 ranked fighters enter Megalonia tournament

### 6. **Gear Technology Tiers**
*   Standard Gear: Basic enhancement available to most fighters
*   Advanced Gear: Corporate-sponsored top-tier technology
*   Experimental Gear: Prototype military-grade systems
*   Integrated Gear: Yuri's seamless human-machine interface
*   Each tier presents unique challenges to overcome

### 7. **Boxing Fundamentals**
*   Gearless fighting requires mastering pure boxing: footwork, head movement, counter-punching
*   Joe must be technically superior to compensate for power disadvantage
*   Can develop signature techniques: body shots to damage Gear connections, counter timing
*   Studying opponents' Gear patterns reveals exploitable weaknesses

### 8. **The Statement vs The Victory**
*   Two philosophies in tension: Fighting Gearless as statement about humanity vs fighting to win
