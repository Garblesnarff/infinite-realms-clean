# Creative Brief: The Melody of Fading Light

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Ethereal Musical Drama (Your Lie in April-inspired)

Inspired by the breathtakingly beautiful and emotionally devastating visual storytelling of Your Lie in April, this style captures the transition from monochrome depression to vibrant life, the beauty of musical performance, and the bittersweet nature of temporary beauty.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Color Transformation:** Show the progression from gray, lifeless scenes to vibrant, emotionally rich environments as healing occurs.
*   **Musical Visualization:** Depict music as visible magic—flowing lights, ethereal particles, and emotional energy that fills space.
*   **Beauty in Transience:** Capture the fleeting nature of perfect moments, like cherry blossoms falling or light fading at sunset.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Bittersweet, beautiful, melancholic, hopeful, ethereal, musical, vibrant, transient, emotional, poignant.
*   **Feeling:** A profound sense of beauty tinged with inevitable loss. The atmosphere should evoke both the joy of connection and the ache of impermanence. Emotionally overwhelming in the best way.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, elegant lines with flowing movement suggesting musical energy. Characters have expressive features capable of conveying deep emotion.
*   **Forms:** Graceful, dynamic poses during performances. Slumped, static postures during moments of trauma or depression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A beautifully detailed anime-style illustration of a young human bard hunched over a piano, the world around him rendered in grayscale. His eyes are downcast, lifeless. The piano keys are the only thing with faint color, hinting at dormant potential."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Transitions from grayscale/muted tones to brilliant, saturated colors. Cherry blossom pinks, sky blues, golden sunlight, and the violet of Kaori's presence.
*   **Luminosity:** Uses light symbolically—harsh, cold light for trauma; warm, golden light for healing; ethereal, glowing light for musical magic; soft, fading light for ending.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...the scene transitions from grayscale to vibrant color as musical notes, rendered as glowing particles of pink and gold light, fill the air. The color spreads from the music outward, painting the world with life and emotion."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic proportions with emphasis on expressiveness. Characters' appearances reflect their emotional states.
*   **Kousei Arima:** Human bard with dark hair and haunted eyes. Dresses formally but joylessly. As he heals, his posture straightens and life returns to his expression.
*   **Kaori Miyazono:** Elven violinist with golden hair and vibrant presence. Associated with the color violet. Ethereally beautiful but with increasing signs of physical fragility.
*   **Supporting Cast:** Each visually distinct—Tsubaki is athletic and casual, Watari is handsome and relaxed, Emi is small but fierce, Takeshi is elegant and serious.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vibrant elven girl with flowing blonde hair, holding a violin, surrounded by swirling particles of violet light. She wears a flowing dress and has an infectious smile that radiates warmth and life. Sakura petals fall around her."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Performance halls, schools, hospitals, parks with cherry blossoms. Settings that emphasize both intimate moments and grand performances.
*   **Atmosphere:** Early campaign environments are gray and lifeless. As healing progresses, they become rich with color and detail. Seasonal changes matter—spring's cherry blossoms, summer's bright light, autumn's warm tones, winter's contemplative quiet.
*   **Details:** Musical instruments prominently featured. Stages with dramatic lighting. Hospital rooms that become warm with personal touches. Practice rooms with excellent acoustics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A grand concert hall interior, ornate and beautiful, with a solo piano on stage under a spotlight. The audience area fades into shadow. As the performance begins, the entire hall fills with floating, glowing musical notes that paint the darkness with color."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, symbolic lighting. Spotlight effects for performances. Soft, diffused light for intimate moments. Harsh shadows for traumatic memories. Fading light for tragedy.
*   **Shadows:** Used to convey emotional weight. Kousei begins shrouded in shadow, gradually emerging into light. Kaori glows even when technically in shadow.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is the primary tool for showing emotional state and narrative progression. A scene's lighting tells you how the character feels.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm, golden afternoon sunlight streaming through windows, casting long, gentle shadows. Musical energy glows in the air, creating an ethereal double-light source that makes the scene feel magical and precious."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic and emotionally charged. Uses visual metaphors extensively—cherry blossoms for beauty and transience, piano keys for structure vs. freedom, the horizon for hope.
*   **Techniques:** Wide shots for performances showing the grandeur of music. Close-ups for intimate emotional moments. Dutch angles during traumatic flashbacks. Symbolic framing—characters separated by distance or barriers early on, together in frame as they grow close.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of two bards performing together on stage. The human at piano, the elf with violin, both surrounded by swirling, glowing musical magic in pink and gold. Cherry blossoms fall impossibly in the indoor hall, creating a dreamlike atmosphere."

## Voice

**Kousei Arima (Early Campaign):** A flat, emotionless male voice. Monotone, lifeless, going through motions. Occasionally cracks with suppressed trauma. As the campaign progresses, the voice gains warmth, emotion, vulnerability, and eventually passion.

**Kaori Miyazono:** A bright, energetic female voice full of life and laughter. Playful, encouraging, occasionally vulnerable when revealing her truth. Even when weak, her voice carries warmth. The voice of someone who has chosen to burn brightly rather than fade slowly.

**Narrator Voice:** Gentle, melancholic, but ultimately hopeful. The voice of someone recounting a beautiful tragedy. Tender during emotional moments, swelling with passion during performances. Like a beautiful piece of music itself—varied, emotional, purposeful. Studio-quality with subtle musical undertones, as if the narrator themselves is part of the song.
