## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–18 sessions)

A philosophical western about love, peace, and the weight of immortal life.

*   **Act I — Love and Peace (Sessions 1–4):** The party meets Vash, thinking he's a buffoon. Gradually they learn he's the legendary Humanoid Typhoon—cities destroyed wherever he goes. His pacifism seems idiotic until they see his inhuman marksmanship.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The $$60 Billion Man"
*   The party encounters a clumsy goofball in a red coat being chased by bounty hunters.
*   When cornered, he shoots with impossible precision—disarming dozens without killing anyone.
**Escalation:** He's Vash the Stampede, most wanted man on the planet. Traveling with him means danger.

### Session 2 — "Truth of Mistake"
*   A town blames Vash for a past disaster. He accepts their hatred without defending himself.
*   The party investigates and discovers the real culprit—but Vash still takes responsibility.
**Escalation:** Vash carries guilt for every death near him, even those he didn't cause.

### Session 3 — "Peace Maker"
*   Vash intervenes in a hostage situation using only ricochet shots and psychology.
*   The party sees his philosophy in action: "This is my love and peace."
**Escalation:** His pacifism isn't weakness—it's discipline harder than killing.

### Session 4 — "Love and Peace"
*   A bounty hunter nearly kills Vash. At the last moment, he chooses not to shoot.

**Escalation:** His optimism seems insane—but it's the only thing keeping him alive after 150 years.

### Session 5 — "Hard Puncher"
*   The first Gung-Ho Gun appears: Hard Puncher, a man with a massive mechanical arm.
*   He declares: "Knives sends his regards. Your suffering begins now."
**Escalation:** These aren't normal bounty hunters—they're superhuman and want Vash to break.

### Session 6 — "Lost July"
*   Vash has nightmares about a destroyed city. He wakes screaming: "I killed them all."
*   The party finds records: July City, population 230,000. Vashed destroyed. Zero survivors.
**Escalation:** The goofy gunslinger is responsible for genocide. How? Why?

### Session 8 — "And Between the Wasteland and Sky"
*   Another Gung-Ho Gun: Midvalley the Hornfreak, whose saxophone shoots sonic bullets.

**Escalation:** Vash admits: "I'm just scared. Scared of becoming like Knives."

### Session 9 — "Rem Saverem"
*   Flashbacks to the SEEDS ship. Vash and Knives as children, raised by Rem.
*   Rem taught: "Every life is precious. That's why we must try."
**Escalation:** Rem died saving humanity. Knives saw it as weakness. Vash as sacrifice worth honoring.

### Session 10 — "Diablo"
*   The party reaches the ruins of July. Vash breaks down: "I became a weapon. I killed them all because Knives forced me."
*   His left arm transforms—it's an Angel Arm, a Plant weapon of mass destruction.
**Escalation:** Vash isn't human. He's a Plant—bio-engineered beings sustaining all life on this planet.

### Session 11 — "Knives's Plan"
*   Knives's philosophy: Humans are parasites exploiting Plants. They must be eradicated.
*   He's been liberating Plants and merging them into a doomsday weapon.
**Escalation:** Genocide isn't theoretical—Knives is actively killing human cities.

### Session 13 — "Sin"
*   Vash breaks his vow. To save the party, he kills Legato.
*   His scream echoes across the desert: "REM! I'M SORRY!"
**Escalation:** Vash's spirit breaks. He becomes hollow, questioning if pacifism was ever real.

### Session 14 — "Wolfwood's Cross"
*   If the party includes a gunslinger priest (Wolfwood analogue), he dies protecting children.
*   His final words: "You were right, Vash. This world needs more love and peace."
**Escalation:** Loss compounds. Everyone who believes in Vash dies for it.

### Session 15 — "The Final Ticket"
*   Confrontation with Knives. He's merged with hundreds of Plants, becoming godlike.
*   "Brother, join me. Let's end this parasitic species."
**Escalation:** Knives offers Vash a choice: family or humanity.

### Session 16 — "Siblings"
*   Epic battle. Knives's Angel Arms versus Vash's refusal to kill.
*   Vash disarms and restrains Knives without killing him: "You're my brother. I won't give up on you."
**Escalation:** Pacifism's ultimate test—can you save someone who wants genocide?

### Session 17 — "Under the Sky So Blue"
*   Knives, defeated and crying, asks: "Why do you still believe?"
*   Vash: "Because Rem believed in me. And I believe in them." Gestures to party and humans.
**Escalation:** Philosophical victory. Knives accepts imprisonment rather than death.

### Session 18 — "Epilogue: The New World"
