**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In the scorching deserts of Athas—a world where wizards drained all life to fuel their magic—the party begins as slaves in the gladiatorial arenas of Tyr, ruled by the immortal sorcerer-king Kalak. Water is currency, metal is rarer than gold, survival means everything, and the gods themselves abandoned this dying world millennia ago. The party must survive arena combat, join or lead a slave rebellion, navigate the brutal politics of city-states ruled by dragon-kings, and decide whether to use the same defiling magic that destroyed their world to save what remains.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 18-22 sessions)

A three-act journey from slaves to potential liberators or tyrants themselves.

*   **Act I — Arena of Blood (Sessions 1-7):** The party meets as slaves in Kalak's gladiatorial stables, forced to fight for the entertainment of Tyr's noble templar class. They must survive against beasts, criminals, and each other while forging bonds in the slave pens. They learn the brutal realities of Athas: water is worth killing for, magic destroys the land, and the sorcerer-kings are unkillable. A charismatic mul (human-dwarf hybrid) named Rikus befriends them and whispers of rebellion as they earn their freedom through victories.
*   **Act II — Freedom's Price (Sessions 8-14):** Granted freedom as champions, the party becomes caught between the templars who enforce Kalak's will and the Veiled Alliance—underground preservers who use magic without destroying life. They discover Kalak is building a massive ziggurat for a dark ritual, and the rebellion needs allies from other city-states. The party ventures into the Tablelands' brutal wastes, facing thri-kreen mantis warriors, savage halfling cannibals, and the burning sun itself while seeking aid.
*   **Act III — The Gladiator's Revolution (Sessions 15-22):** The party leads the uprising against Kalak, storming the Golden Tower alongside freed slaves and allied factions. They learn the terrible truth: Kalak seeks to complete his transformation into a full dragon by draining the life force of Tyr's entire population. The party must stop the ritual, face the sorcerer-king's full power, and choose what kind of society will replace tyranny. Will they preserve what little life remains, or defile the world further to ensure victory? Their choice determines whether Athas has a future.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of freedom versus survival, the corrupting nature of power, environmental destruction for short-term gain, and whether ends justify means. It asks: Is it worth destroying the world to save yourself? Can a society built on slavery be reformed or must it burn? Is using your oppressor's weapons becoming them? The central conflict pits the party's desire for freedom against a system that has enslaved civilization for thousands of years.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Water & Survival**
*   Water is currency—track water consumption in this brutal desert world
*   Each day requires water (1 ceramic piece buys 1 day's supply)
*   Without water: exhaustion levels accumulate quickly, hallucinations, death
*   Metal is extremely rare; most weapons are bone, stone, or wood
*   Survival checks are frequent: heat exhaustion, sandstorms, predators

### 2. **Defiling vs. Preserving Magic**
*   All arcane magic users choose: defile or preserve
*   **Defiling:** More powerful spells, faster casting, kills plants and weakens living beings in radius
*   **Preserving:** Normal magic, carefully draws power without harming environment
*   Using defiling grants corruption points; high corruption changes alignment and appearance
*   Party witnesses visible environmental damage from defiling
*   Social consequences: defilers are hated, preservers are hunted by templars

### 3. **Gladiatorial Combat**
*   Arena fights have special rules: crowd reactions affect outcomes
*   Spectacular kills earn Crowd Favor—spend for advantages, freedom, or equipment
*   Boring fights anger crowd—templar may order execution
*   Fighting styles matter: brutal efficiency vs. flashy showmanship
*   Opponents range from beasts to other slaves to captured monsters

### 4. **Psionics**
*   Nearly everyone on Athas has minor psionic talent (wild talents)
*   Party members develop random psionic abilities as they level
*   No gods exist—clerics draw power from elemental forces instead
*   Psionics are seen as natural, not supernatural

### 5. **Dark Sun Races**
*   Standard races adapted to harsh world: humans, dwarves (focused artisans), elves (running nomads)
*   Unique races: muls (human-dwarf gladiator slaves, sterile but powerful), half-giants (easily swayed, enormous), thri-kreen (mantis warriors, no sleep)
*   Each has survival adaptations to brutal environment

### 6. **Revolutionary Momentum**
*   Track rebellion progress through Momentum points
*   Gained by: recruiting allies, successful missions, inspiring acts
*   Lost by: major failures, ally deaths, templar crackdowns
*   High momentum unlocks larger-scale rebellion actions
*   Low momentum means rebellion fragments and retreats
*   Final battle difficulty scales inversely with momentum
