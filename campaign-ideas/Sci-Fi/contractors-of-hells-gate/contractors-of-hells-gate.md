---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Contractors of Hell's Gate
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Noir / Episodic Mysteries / Emotionless Superpowers / Spy Thriller / Hell's Gate Conspiracy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 14–16 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **13–15**
**Tone (keywords):** "the stars are false", contractors lose emotions, remuneration cost, episodic spy missions, Hell's Gate anomaly, electric powers and broken dolls, "the moon is beautiful tonight"
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Ten years ago, Hell's Gate appeared in Tokyo—a mysterious zone where physics breaks and Contractors emerged: people with supernatural powers who lost their emotions and humanity. The party consists of Contractors and handlers working as spies, assassins, and investigators in the shadowy world around Hell's Gate. Each has a power and a price—remuneration they must pay after using abilities, like breaking fingers, eating flowers, or smoking cigarettes. It's a story about whether emotions define humanity, and what lurks inside Hell's Gate.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Contractors have reality-bending powers but must pay remuneration costs. Strategic power use is crucial.
*   **Investigation:** Episodic spy missions requiring intelligence gathering, infiltration, and assassination.
*   **Consequences:** Emotional detachment makes NPCs unpredictable. Hell's Gate mysteries are lethal to investigate.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Black Reaper"
*   The party meets Hei—"the Black Reaper," a legendary Contractor with electric powers.
*   They work together on a mission: assassinate a scientist researching Hell's Gate.
**Escalation:** Hei seems emotionless but his actions suggest otherwise. Is he truly a Contractor?

### Session 2 — "The Fallen Star"
*   Every Contractor is linked to a false star in the sky. When they die, their star falls.
*   A star falls mid-mission. The party must determine which ally just died.
**Escalation:** Death is constant. The stars mark every Contractor like prison numbers.

### Session 3 — "Remuneration"
*   After using powers, each Contractor must pay their price—breaking fingers, eating stones, smoking, drinking blood.
*   The party witnesses someone fail to pay remuneration and lose their power permanently.
**Escalation:** Powers come at humiliating, painful, or degrading costs.

### Session 4 — "The Doll Network"
*   Dolls—emotionless humans who lost their souls in Hell's Gate—are used for surveillance.
*   One party member encounters a Doll who seems to remember their past life.
**Escalation:** Dolls were once human. Hell's Gate steals souls.

### Session 5 — "MI6 Protocol"
*   British intelligence deploys November 11—a Contractor who manipulates temperature, always smokes.
*   He's charming and ruthless: "Nothing personal. It's just business."
**Escalation:** International agencies all hunt Hell's Gate secrets. No one is trustworthy.

### Session 6 — "Amber's Warning"
*   A mysterious Contractor named Amber appears, seemingly from Hei's past.
*   She warns: "Hell's Gate is a lie. The Syndicate knows the truth."
**Escalation:** The organization employing the party is hiding fundamental truths.

### Session 7 — "The Syndicate's Orders"
*   The party is ordered to assassinate a traitor who claims to know Hell's Gate's origin.
*   Before dying, he reveals: "It's not natural. Someone created it."
**Escalation:** Hell's Gate is artificial. Someone built this nightmare.

### Session 8 — "The Cost of Memory"
*   A Contractor whose remuneration is forgetting memories slowly loses their identity.
*   The party watches them become a shell: "Who am I? What was my name?"
**Escalation:** Remuneration can erase existence itself. Powers cost more than pain.

### Session 9 — "Evening Primrose"
*   Amber leads Evening Primrose—a Contractor terrorist organization.
*   She declares war: "We will destroy Hell's Gate and free ourselves."
**Escalation:** Not all Contractors accept their fate. Rebellion begins.

### Session 10 — "The Meteor Fragment"
*   Amber reveals Hell's Gate is a research facility accident that merged reality with another dimension.
*   Contractors are humans fused with alternate-universe selves who lack emotions.
**Escalation:** The truth is dimensional horror. The party isn't fully human anymore.

### Session 11 — "Yin's Awakening"
*   Yin—a Doll traveling with the party—regains emotions through anomaly.
*   Her awakening terrifies the Syndicate: "Dolls shouldn't have souls!"
**Escalation:** Recovery might be possible. Hell's Gate's effects aren't permanent.

### Session 12 — "The Moon is Beautiful Tonight"
*   Hei reveals he's not actually a Contractor—his sister was. He inherited her power but kept his emotions.
*   "I'm human pretending to be monster, surrounded by monsters pretending to be human."
**Escalation:** Identity crisis—who is human? Who is monster? Does emotion define humanity?

### Session 13 — "Amber's Sacrifice"
*   Amber plans to reverse time using Hell's Gate, erasing all Contractors but restoring the world.
*   She needs Hei's cooperation: "We can undo everything. Go back to before the Gate."
**Escalation:** Erasing Contractors means killing everyone the party has become.

### Session 14 — "Inside the Gate"
*   The party enters Hell's Gate—physics breaks, time loops, alternate selves appear.
*   They confront the source: a merged dimension leaking through.
**Escalation:** Hell's Gate isn't a place—it's a wound in reality.

### Session 15 — "The False Stars Fall"
*   Amber activates her plan. Reality begins rewinding.
*   The party must choose: let it happen (erase Contractors) or stop it (preserve this world).
**Escalation:** Neither choice is good. Erase existence or accept monstrosity?

### Session 16 — "Under the Sky"
*   Resolution. If time reverses, the world resets but everyone forgets. If preserved, Contractors remain.
*   Hei's choice: "I'll stay in this hell if it means protecting those I care about."
*   Final shot: False stars twinkling overhead. The noir continues.

## Central Conflict
