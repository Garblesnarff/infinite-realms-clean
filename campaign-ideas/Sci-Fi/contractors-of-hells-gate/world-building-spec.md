# World-Building Specification Brief: Contractors of Hell's Gate

**Core Concept:** Players are Contractors—emotionless superhumans linked to false stars who must pay remuneration after using powers. They work as spies around Hell's Gate, a Tokyo anomaly where physics breaks. Through episodic missions they uncover conspiracy: Hell's Gate is artificial dimensional wound, Contractors are humans fused with emotionless alternate selves. Amber plans to reverse time and erase all Contractors. The campaign is noir spy thriller—whether emotions define humanity, cost of power, choosing existence versus erasure.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Hell's Gate appearance—ten years ago, massive anomaly manifested in Tokyo, physics-breaking zone.
*   Contractor emergence—humans gaining powers but losing emotions, each linked to false star.
*   Remuneration system—mandatory cost paid after power use (smoking, breaking bones, eating, aging, forgetting).
*   Dolls—humans who lost souls in Hell's Gate, emotionless observers used for surveillance.

**Factions:**
*   **The Syndicate:** Shadowy organization employing Contractors as spies and assassins, studies Hell's Gate.
*   **Evening Primrose:** Contractor terrorist group led by Amber, wants to destroy Hell's Gate.
*   **International Agencies:** MI6, CIA, others competing for Hell's Gate secrets and Contractor assets.
*   **PANDORA:** UN research organization studying Hell's Gate officially, often at odds with covert ops.

**Locations:**
*   **Hell's Gate (Tokyo):** Massive anomaly zone, physics-breaking interior, militarized perimeter, false stars overhead.
*   **Gate Perimeter:** Walls and checkpoints surrounding Hell's Gate, multiple agencies monitoring.
*   **Syndicate Safehouses:** Shifting spy headquarters across Tokyo, surveillance networks.
*   **Inside the Gate:** Reality-warped nightmare landscape, time anomalies, dimensional rifts.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF Contractor doesn't pay remuneration, THEN they lose their power permanently.
*   IF false star falls, THEN that Contractor died somewhere in the world.
*   IF party enters Hell's Gate, THEN physics breaks, time loops occur, alternate selves manifest.
*   IF Amber's time reversal succeeds, THEN Hell's Gate never existed but all Contractors are erased.
