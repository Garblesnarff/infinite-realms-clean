# Reality Corrupted
**"Error 404: Consensus Reality Not Found"**

## Campaign Overview

The world is glitching. Not metaphorically—literally. People phase through walls. Gravity reverses randomly. Objects duplicate or vanish. Time loops. The laws of physics are corrupted like broken code. The party witnesses reality breaking down and discovers they have a unique ability: They can see and manipulate the glitches. They are "Reality Hackers," able to exploit bugs in existence itself.

Investigation reveals the cause: Reality is a simulation, and it's degrading. Whether this is natural decay, sabotage by something inside the system, or attack from outside is unclear. The party must navigate increasingly unstable reality while searching for the source of corruption. They discover others like them—some trying to fix reality, others exploiting glitches for power, still others who believe reality deserves to crash.

As the glitches intensify, the party uncovers evidence of the System Administrators—entities maintaining the simulation from outside. But the Administrators have gone silent. The party must make an impossible choice: Reboot reality (erasing everything including themselves), hack the system to stabilize it (risking worse corruption), ascend to Administrator status themselves, or embrace the chaos and see what emerges from crashed reality.

## Core Themes

- **Simulation Theory Made Manifest**: What if we are in the Matrix?
- **Reality as Code**: Physics as programming that can be hacked
- **Glitch Aesthetics**: Beauty in broken systems
- **Free Will vs. Determinism**: If programmed, are choices real?
- **The Nature of Reality**: What is real if everything is simulation?
- **Digital Divinity**: Becoming gods through understanding the code

- **Ascend**: Become new Administrators, control reality permanently
- Gather resources/allies for chosen path
- Opposition from other factions
- Time limit: Reality has 72 hours before total collapse

### Arc 4: The Final Code (Sessions 20-25)
**Sessions 20-22: Execution**
- Infiltrate The Console (physical location in glitched space)
- Face guardians: Error Entities and defensive systems
- Rival factions attempt to implement their own solutions
- Three-way conflict: Fixers vs. Breakers vs. Party
- The Console reached

**Sessions 23-25: Resolution**
- **Reboot Route**: Initiate reset, save data of specific people, rebuild reality
- **Patch Route**: Debug reality in real-time, stabilize corruption
- **Ascension Route**: Upload consciousness, become System Administrators
- Consequences play out
- Epilogue: New reality's first moments
