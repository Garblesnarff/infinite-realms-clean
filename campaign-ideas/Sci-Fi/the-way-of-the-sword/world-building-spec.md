# The Way of the Sword - World-Building Specification

## Historical Context
**Sengoku to Edo Period** (1584-1645): Warring States ending, Tokugawa unification, peace beginning. Samurai transitioning from warriors to bureaucrats. Ronin (masterless samurai) increasingly marginalized.

## Factions
- **Tokugawa Shogunate**: Victor of Sekigahara, establishes peace, bureaucratizes samurai
- **Surviving Daimyo**: Regional lords, employ samurai/ronin for security
- **Sword Schools**: Prestigious dojos teach specific styles, compete for students/reputation
- **Buddhist Temples**: Zen monasteries, philosophical centers
- **Common People**: Farmers, merchants rising in importance

## Sword Schools
- **Yoshioka-ryū**: Prestigious Kyoto school, destroyed by Musashi
- **Ittō-ryū**: "One-Sword School," minimalist efficiency
- **Hōzōin-ryū**: Spear school, sickle-spear specialists
- **Niten Ichi-ryū**: "Two Heavens as One," Musashi's two-sword style

## Philosophy
**Bushido** (Way of Warrior): Honor, loyalty, death before dishonor. Ronin exist outside this structure—freedom and stigma.

**Zen Buddhism**: Musashi influenced by Takuan Sōhō. Meditation in action, enlightenment through discipline.

**Heiho** (Strategy): Military tactics, philosophy, life principles. Musashi's synthesis in *Five Rings*.

## Historical Battles
- **Sekigahara** (1600): Decisive battle, Tokugawa victory establishes shogunate
- **Osaka Siege** (1614-15): Final destruction of Toyotomi, Musashi participates

## The Book of Five Rings
Written 1645, week before death. Five sections:
1. **Earth**: Foundation, overview
2. **Water**: Mindset, adaptability
3. **Fire**: Combat tactics
4. **Wind**: Other schools' strengths/weaknesses
5. **Void**: Transcendence, intuition

Modern impact: Read by businesspeople, strategists globally. Eastern alternative to *Art of War*.

## Causality Chains
1. **Sekigahara Victory/Defeat**: Changes political landscape
2. **Yoshioka School Destruction**: Reputation vs. disgrace
3. **Kojirō Duel Outcome**: If loses, legend dies with him
4. **Book Completion**: If unwritten, wisdom lost
5. **School Establishment**: Legacy through students vs. forgotten

## Legacy
Musashi elevated to near-mythical status. Films, novels, manga, anime based on his life. *Book of Five Rings* business bestseller. Two-sword style (Niten Ichi-ryū) still practiced. Greatest swordsman in Japanese history.
