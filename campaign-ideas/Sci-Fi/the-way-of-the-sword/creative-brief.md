# The Way of the Sword - Creative Brief

## Art Style
**Minimalist Samurai Aesthetic**: Clean lines, ink brush aesthetic, sudden violence in zen calm. Inspired by: Kurosawa films, samurai cinema, Japanese ink paintings, manga like *Vagabond*.

**Visual Evolution**: Bloody chaos (youth) → Disciplined precision (mastery) → Zen emptiness (enlightenment)

## Visual Design
**Musashi**: Scarred, rough, increasingly weathered. Two swords (katana + wakizashi). Ragged ronin clothes → Simple but quality gi. Ink-stained hands in later life.

**Duels**: Single-take intensity, silence before clash, explosive violence, aftermath contemplation.

## Color Palettes
- **Early**: Blood red, dirty earth, steel grey
- **Middle**: Balanced ink black/white, bamboo green
- **Late**: Zen neutrals, calligraphy black, void white

## Music
**Traditional Japanese**: Shakuhachi flute (haunting), taiko drums (sudden combat), koto strings (beauty), biwa (storytelling). Silence used powerfully—tension before duels.

## Voice Direction
**Musashi**: Deep, measured, scarred voice. Early: Aggressive. Mid: Calculating. Late: Serene wisdom.

## Cinematic Moments
- First kill (age 13): Accidental brutality
- Yoshioka massacre: Horror of one vs. many
- Ganryū Island: Perfect duel cinematography
- Final cave: Brush writing, peaceful death

## Technical Notes
**Combat**: Choreographed precisely like historical kenjutsu. One mistake = death. Duels are minutes (real-time), battles are chaos. Camera: Long takes, minimal cuts during duels.
