# Jaeger Protocol: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Industrial Heroism with Oceanic Horror**
- Massive mechs contrasted with human fragility
- Grungy, lived-in technology (wear and battle damage)
- Bioluminescent Kaiju vs. mechanical Jaegers (organic vs. constructed)
- Underwater sequences emphasizing depth and pressure
- Urban destruction on catastrophic scale

## Color Palettes

**Primary:** Steel Blues (#4682B4), Ocean Deep (#003B5C), Reactor Yellow (#FFD700), Kaiju Bioluminescence (#00F5FF), Toxic Blue Blood (#4169E1)

**Secondary:** Warning Red (alarms), Sunset Orange (destruction), Deep Purple (Drift sequences), Alien Green (Precursor dimension)

## Music and Sound Design

**Main Theme:** Heroic orchestral with electronic elements, taiko drums, massive brass sections

**The Drift:** Ethereal, overlapping thoughts, whispered memories, heartbeat synchronization

**Jaeger Movement:** Hydraulics, metal groaning, footsteps shaking earth, reactor hum

**Kaiju Roars:** Whale song mixed with industrial sounds, bio-mechanical horror

**Combat:** Massive impacts, ocean displacement, building collapse, plasma weapon charges

## Voice Direction

**Marshal Pentecost:** Gravelly authority, British accent, dying man projecting strength

**Dr. Geiszler:** Manic energy, enthusiasm turning unsettling, losing humanity gradually

**Mako:** Quiet intensity, Japanese accent, controlled rage under surface

**Chuck Hansen:** Australian accent, bravado hiding fear, eventual humility

## Cinematic Moments

**Jaeger Deployment:** Platform rising from ocean, pilots dropping into neural handshake, startup sequence, "ENGAGE!"

**First Kaiju Battle:** Massive scale combat, using environment as weapons, destroying city to save it

**The Drift Sequence:** Memories flowing between minds, seeing through partner's eyes, becoming one

**Breach Descent:** Diving into ocean's deepest point, pressure crushing, darkness giving way to alien light

**Precursor World:** Impossible geometry, Kaiju being grown in pods, horror of industrial genocide

**Final Detonation:** Nuclear countdown, Breach collapsing, escape attempt, uncertainty of survival
