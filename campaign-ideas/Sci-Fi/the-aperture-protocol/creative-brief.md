# Creative Brief: The Aperture Protocol

## Art Style: Sterile Sci-Fi Test Facility with Dark Undertones (Portal-inspired)

**Color Palette:** Sterile whites, warning oranges and blues (portal colors), industrial grays, black maintenance areas, green toxic glow

**Core Principles:**
*   Clean, minimalist test chamber aesthetic
*   Contrast between sterile white chambers and decaying behind-the-scenes
*   Portal colors (orange/blue) as primary accents
*   Dark humor through signage and GLaDOS's eye

**Prompt Example:** "A sterile white test chamber with orange and blue portal surfaces. A weighted companion cube with a heart on it. GLaDOS's single yellow eye watches from the ceiling. Clean sci-fi minimalism with subtle decay. Warning signs in Aperture Science branding."

## Voice

A synthesized, feminine AI voice dripping with passive-aggressive sarcasm. GLaDOS speaks in calm, measured tones while describing horrific testing outcomes. Cave Johnson's pre-recorded voice is enthusiastically insane. Turrets are politely apologetic while shooting. The tone is darkly comedic, absurdist, and sinister. Role: The voice of science without ethics, testing without mercy, but with impeccable comedic timing.
