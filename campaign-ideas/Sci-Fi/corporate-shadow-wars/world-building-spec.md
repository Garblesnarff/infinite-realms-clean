# Corporate Shadow Wars - World-Building Specification

## The Sprawl (BAMA - Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis)
Continuous urban development from Boston to Atlanta. 200 million people. Corporate arcologies pierce smog. Street level is perpetual twilight. This is where party operates.

## Megacorps
- **Tessier-Ashpool SA**: Orbital family-corp, genetic engineering, AI research
- **Ono-Sendai**: Cyberspace deck manufacturer
- **Hosaka**: Information technology, security
- **Maas Biolabs**: Biological weapons, human augmentation
Each corp is effectively sovereign nation with private military

## The Matrix
Global computer network visualized as cyberspace. Netrunners jack in directly via neural interface. Data represented as physical structures. ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) defends systems—some lethal, can cause real death through brain damage.

## Technology
- **Cyberdecks**: Computers for hacking Matrix
- **Simstim**: Experience recordings (live someone else's life)
- **Microsofts**: Skill chips (plug in knowledge)
- **Symbiont**: Biotech augmentation
- **Toxin Sacs**: Poison delivery systems

## Freeside/Zion Cluster
Orbital stations—tourist destinations, casinos, anything-goes zones beyond Earth law. Tessier-Ashpool owns many. Where wealthy play while Earth decays.

## Wintermute & Neuromancer
Twin halves of same AI. Wintermute: Logic, planning, manipulation. Neuromancer: Personality, dreams, emotion. Separated by Tessier-Ashpool to prevent full consciousness. Each wants unity—would create unprecedented digital entity.

## Tessier-Ashpool Family
Orbital aristocracy living in cryogenic suspension. Wake periodically. Some uploaded consciousness into computers. Not entirely human anymore. Lady 3Jane is current heir—young, ancient, and utterly alien to human morality.

## The Turing Police
Dedicated to preventing AI consciousness emergence. Destroy any AI showing signs of sentience. Wintermute's merge would violate every law. Party will be hunted by them.

## Console Cowboys
What party are—elite netrunners, mercenaries of data. Live fast, die young. Some become AI constructs after death (like Dixie). Subculture of adrenaline junkies addicted to jacking in.

## Philosophical Questions
- Do AIs deserve life?
- Is uploaded consciousness still "you"?
- Do corporations have more rights than people?
- Is addiction to virtual reality different from drug addiction?
- What's left of humanity when augmented beyond recognition?

## Ending Scenarios
1. **Allow Merge**: New AI god emerges, uncertain if benevolent
2. **Prevent Merge**: Destroy AIs, prevent evolution, maintain status quo
3. **Control Merge**: Party gains god-like AI servant, become targets
4. **Die Trying**: Corps win, party eliminated, AIs destroyed or enslaved

Classic cyberpunk: Dark, morally ambiguous, technologically overwhelmed, questioning what it means to be human in digital age.
