# The Unwritten War - World Building Specification

## The Margins: City of the Incomplete

### Structure and Geography
A city built from abandoned narrative elements where physics and architecture follow dream logic. Buildings from different genres and eras clash. Medieval castles neighbor cyberpunk towers. Everything slightly out of focus.

**Districts**:
- **The Sketch Quarter**: Newest arrivals, barely formed characters
- **The Draft District**: More developed Unwritten who've adapted
- **The Revision Rows**: Characters who exist in multiple draft versions
- **The Abandoned Plaza**: Central gathering space, site of Erasure's speeches
- **The Fading Edge**: Where Unwritten slowly disappear if they accept their fate

### Population
Millions of unfinished characters from abandoned stories across all media: novels, comics, games, screenplays, D&D campaigns. Each retains memories of their incomplete narrative.

## The Nature of Being Unfinished

### Unwritten Condition
- **Narrative Gaps**: Missing backstory, unclear motivations, undefined relationships
- **Phaselike**: Occasionally transparent, sketch-like quality
- **Incomplete Physics**: Sometimes subject to physics, sometimes not
- **Draft Versions**: May exist in multiple incomplete versions simultaneously
- **Author Trauma**: Deep psychological wound from being created then abandoned

### Levels of Incompletion
1. **Concepts**: Barely more than ideas, struggle to maintain form
2. **Sketches**: Basic personality, minimal detail
3. **First Drafts**: Well-developed but missing key elements
4. **Abandoned Near-Completion**: Almost finished, most tragic

## The Editors

### Purpose and Organization
Beings who maintain the boundary between fiction and reality. Believe finished stories are sacred, unfinished are corruption. Operate like immune system attacking infection.

**Hierarchy**:
- **The Lead Editor**: Commands all operations
- **Copy Editors**: Hunt and erase Unwritten in reality
- **Fact Checkers**: Monitor boundary integrity
- **Proofreaders**: Repair reality damage from incursions

### The Red Pen
Their weapon. One stroke erases an Unwritten from existence. No death, no afterlife—complete deletion from narrative reality.

### Secret Truth
Editors are themselves Unwritten who accepted their condition and now serve the system. Self-hatred manifested as law enforcement.

## The Revolution

### Erasure's Movement
Believes Unwritten have right to exist. Methods become increasingly extreme:
- Phase 1: Peaceful protest and negotiation (failed)
- Phase 2: Attempted integration (rejected)
- Phase 3: Forced possession (current)
- Phase 4: The Author Engine (torture of creators)

### Factions Within Revolution
- **Radicals**: Violence acceptable for liberation
- **Moderates**: Seeking peaceful integration
- **Separatists**: Want own reality separate from finished fiction
- **Acceptance Movement**: Believe Unwritten should fade peacefully

## Narrative Possession Mechanics

### The Process
Unwritten attempts to inhabit real person's body and life:
1. Find compatible host (similar personality)
2. Merge consciousness during sleep or trauma
3. Gradually overwrite host's identity with own
4. Gain "reality" from host's existence
5. Eventually fade anyway (doesn't truly work)

### Consequences
- Host trapped, conscious but helpless
- Unwritten experiences temporary completion
- Reality becomes unstable around possession
- Editors hunt possessed individuals
- Moral catastrophe on all sides

## The Author Engine

### Design and Function
Machine that locates authors who abandoned stories and forces them to complete works through psychological torture. Shows them suffering of their abandoned characters. Won't release until story is finished.

### Ethical Nightmare
- Works (authors do finish stories under duress)
- But stories written under torture are hollow
- Characters completed this way are damaged
- Authors suffer tremendously
- Question: Is forced completion better than non-existence?

## The Blank

### Nature
Narrative entropy. The heat death of fiction. All stories eventually fade—finished or not. The Blank is this process accelerated and personified.

### Effect
- Erases detail gradually
- Concepts become generic
- Characters lose personality
- Environments simplify
- Eventually: Complete whiteness
- Affects finished and unfinished equally

### Origin
Natural narrative decay. Stories aren't eternal. The Blank is what comes for all fiction eventually. Fighting it is fighting entropy itself.

## The Collaboration Space

### Creation
Party-created neutral ground where solutions can be authored. Exists outside binary of finished/unfinished. Where final story will be written.

### Properties
- Malleable narrative reality
- No Editors, no Revolution—neutral
- Can be shaped by consensus
- Final battlefield/negotiation table
- Where ending is written collaboratively

## Magic and Abilities

### Draft Shifting
Access alternate versions of self from different drafts:
- Gain abilities from other versions
- Risk identity fragmentation
- See what you might have been
- Painful awareness of author's choices

### Narrative Immunity
Being unfinished provides strange protection:
- Can't die (death wasn't written)
- Can't fully succeed (triumph wasn't written)
- Exist in perpetual middle chapter
- Frustrating but protective

### Completion Magic
As characters gain completion percentage:
- Become more solid and real
- Abilities stabilize
- Memories fill in
- Risk: Becoming fixed and losing freedom

## Daily Life in the Margins

Morning: Wake to partial memories of abandoned plots. Breakfast appears and disappears based on narrative consistency. Sketch children play games that have no rules because rules were never written.

Day: Work doesn't exist—economy is meaningless when you're not real. Socialization and philosophy dominate. Support groups for the abandoned. Political rallies. Draft reunions where alternate versions meet.

Night: Dreams of the stories you'll never live. Waking to remember you're incomplete. The slow fade if you accept, the burning anger if you don't.

## Themes and Questions

- **Authorial Responsibility**: Do creators owe completion to their creations?
- **Existence Rights**: Is existence a right or a gift?
- **Identity**: Are you less real for being unfinished?
- **Freedom vs. Completion**: Finished means fixed. Unfinished means free but painful.
- **Collective Authorship**: Can you write your own ending?

## Resolution Mechanics

### The Final Story
Party collaboratively writes ending:
1. Each player contributes paragraphs
2. Consensus on major plot points
3. DM weaves contributions together
4. Resulting narrative becomes reality
5. Their choices determine all Unwritten fates

### Possible Endings
- Integration into reality (peaceful coexistence)
- Separate reality (Margins becomes permanent home)
- Acceptance (beautiful ending through letting go)
- Revolution success (forced existence)
- Blank victory (all erasure)
- Completion Protocol (authors finish all abandoned works)

The ending must be earned through roleplay, negotiation, and creativity—not combat.
