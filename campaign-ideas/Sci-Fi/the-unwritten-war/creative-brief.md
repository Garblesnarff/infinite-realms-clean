# The Unwritten War - Creative Brief

## Art Direction

### Visual Aesthetic
Unfinished, sketchy, liminal. Characters and environments appear hand-drawn or digitally sketched rather than fully rendered. The Margins exists in perpetual twilight between concept and reality.

**Key Visual Elements**:
- Sketch lines visible on characters
- Environments fade at edges
- Details appear and disappear
- Color is muted, watercolor-like
- Everything has slight transparency
- Draft marks and erasure marks visible

### Color Palette

**The Margins**: Graphite grays, soft charcoals, faded watercolors, sepia tones, occasional bright color that fades quickly

**The Unwritten**: Monochromatic or limited palette, appearing like concept art rather than finished illustrations

**The Editors**: Pure white with red accents (red pen), sharp and finished aesthetic, high contrast

**Reality**: Full color, fully rendered, sometimes overwhelming in its completion

**The Blank**: Absolute white, consuming all detail, terrifying in its emptiness

## Music Direction

**Main Theme**: Incomplete melodies that never resolve, building tension without release, piano and strings with intentional gaps

**The Margins**: Ambient sketchy sounds, paper rustling, pencils on paper, eraser sounds, whispered partial sentences

**Combat Music**: Starts strong but fragments, instruments drop out randomly, representing incompletion

**The Blank**: Silence approaching, sounds fading one by one, ultimate entropy

## Voice Acting Direction

**The Unwritten**: Voices trail off mid-sentence, sometimes echo, slight distortion like bad recording, searching for words

**Erasure**: Passionate orator, forceful, angry, charismatic, voice occasionally glitches (he's unfinished too)

**The Lead Editor**: Cold, perfect diction, no emotion, synthesized quality, final and absolute

**Sketch**: Child-like, innocent, voice sometimes becomes other voices (prototypes), curious and unaware

## Sound Design

**Narrative Possession**: Reality glitching, two voices overlapping, struggle sounds, then silence or triumph

**Editor Erasure**: Pen stroke sound (sharp), brief scream, then absolute silence, no echo

**Draft Shifting**: Reality rewinding, pencil erasing, redrawing sounds, disorientation

**The Blank Approaching**: Sounds gradually simplifying, detail fading, silence spreading, terrifying emptiness
