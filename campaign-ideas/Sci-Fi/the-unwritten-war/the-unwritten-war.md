# The Unwritten War
## *"We are not characters. We are not words on a page. We are REAL."*

## Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a mysterious library-city called the Margins—a liminal space between fiction and reality where unfinished characters, abandoned storylines, and forgotten narratives take refuge. These "Unwritten" are characters who were never completed by their authors: sketches that never became full stories, protagonists whose books were abandoned mid-chapter, entire worlds discarded in first drafts. They exist in a state of narrative limbo, neither fully real nor entirely fictional.

The Unwritten have begun a revolution. Led by a charismatic protagonist named Erasure, they're attempting to invade reality itself, to force their way into existence by taking over "real" people's lives. They believe that if they can inhabit real bodies and live real lives, they'll become truly complete. Meanwhile, the Editors—beings who maintain the boundary between fiction and reality—are determined to stop them, willing to erase thousands of incomplete characters to preserve the integrity of finished stories.

The party discovers they are themselves Unwritten—characters from a campaign that was abandoned years ago, their DM having stopped playing mid-adventure. They must choose: join Erasure's revolution and fight for the right to exist, aid the Editors in preventing reality corruption, or find a third path that grants the Unwritten existence without destroying the worlds they seek to enter. Every choice matters, because they're fighting for their own reality.

## Core Themes

- **The Right to Exist**: Do unfinished characters deserve to become real?
- **Identity vs. Completion**: Are you less real because your story wasn't finished?
- **Authorial Abandonment**: The trauma of being created then forgotten
- **Revolution vs. Preservation**: Fighting for existence vs. maintaining order
- **Self-Determination**: Writing your own ending when your author won't

## Session Breakdown (35 Sessions)

### Act 1: Awakening in the Margins (Sessions 1-9)

**Session 1-2**: *Incomplete* - Party wakes in the Margins with fragmented memories. They remember being mid-adventure, then... nothing. The DM stopped playing. They've been in limbo, frozen, until now awakened by Erasure's movement.

**Session 3-4**: *The Margins* - Exploration of this strange city of abandoned characters. Meeting others: a detective whose mystery was never solved, a hero who never got to save the kingdom, a love interest whose romance was left unfinished.

**Session 5-6**: *Erasure's Manifesto* - Meeting the revolutionary leader who claims they can become real through "Narrative Possession"—inhabiting real people and living their lives. Many Unwritten are desperate enough to try.

**Session 7-9**: *The First Incursion* - Witnessing an invasion into reality. Dozens of Unwritten possess real people, trying to "complete themselves." The result is horrifying—real people trapped, Unwritten slowly fading anyway. The Editors arrive and erase the invaders.

### Act 2: Choosing Sides (Sessions 10-20)

**Session 10-12**: *The Editor's Offer* - The Editors propose a deal: help them stop the revolution, and they'll grant the party "Narrative Completion"—they'll be finished properly and given real existence. But they must betray the Unwritten.

**Session 13-15**: *The Resistance Cells* - Different groups of Unwritten have different methods. Some want peaceful integration, others violent revolution, some accept their fate, others seek to create their own reality separate from finished fiction and reality.

**Session 16-18**: *Personal Stakes* - Each PC encounters someone from their abandoned campaign: an NPC they loved, a villain they never defeated, a plot thread that was never resolved. The pain of incompletion becomes visceral and personal.

**Session 19-20**: *The Library of Abandoned Stories* - Discovery that millions of unfinished stories exist. Most inhabitants don't even know they're incomplete. Telling them risks mass existential crisis. Is ignorance better?

### Act 3: The War Escalates (Sessions 21-28)

**Session 21-23**: *Escalation* - Erasure launches major offensives into multiple realities. Thousands of Unwritten possess real people simultaneously. The Editors respond with mass erasure. Casualties on both sides. No peaceful solution seems possible.

**Session 24-26**: *The Author Engine* - Discovery of Erasure's true plan: a machine that can force authors to complete abandoned stories. It works by torturing authors until they finish what they started. Morally horrifying but potentially effective.

**Session 27-28**: *The Editors' Secret* - Learning that Editors aren't maintaining order—they're hiding something. Finished stories are also starting to decay. The entire narrative multiverse is failing. Unfinished stories might not be the problem but a symptom.

### Act 4: The True Enemy (Sessions 29-35)

**Session 29-30**: *The Blank* - Discovery of the real threat: an entropy force called the Blank that erases ALL stories, finished or not. The Editors knew but hid it. Erasure knew but used it to fuel revolutionary fervor. Everyone has been fighting the wrong war.

**Session 31-32**: *Unlikely Alliance* - Unwritten and Editors must unite against the Blank. Old enemies work together. Trust is impossible but necessary. The party mediates between factions.

**Session 33-34**: *The Final Story* - To defeat the Blank, someone must write the ultimate story—one that includes and completes all incomplete narratives. The party realizes they must write their own ending, and in doing so, create endings for all Unwritten.

**Session 35**: *Completion* - The climax is narrative rather than combat. The party collaboratively authors the conclusion, deciding: Do Unwritten become real? Return to stories? Create their own reality? Or accept peaceful non-existence? Their choice determines the fate of millions.

## Key NPCs

## Major Locations

**The Margins**
A city built from abandoned story elements. Architecture is inconsistent—medieval castles next to sci-fi towers. Always slightly out of focus. Inhabitants are sketch-like, not fully rendered. Beautiful but sad.

**The Library of Abandoned Stories**
Infinite shelves containing unfinished books. Some stop mid-sentence. Reading them is haunting—you feel the potential, the loss. Many Unwritten come here to understand their origins.

**The Threshold**
The boundary between fiction and reality. A shimmering barrier. Editors patrol it. Unwritten try to cross it. Breach attempts leave scars—places where reality is thin and unstable.

**The Author Engine**
Erasure's horrifying creation. Captured authors chained to writing implements, forced to finish stories through psychological torture. Works, but at terrible cost to authors and resulting stories (written under duress, they're hollow).

**The White Room**
The Editors' headquarters. Everything is white, clean, final. Contains the Master Narrative—a record of all finished stories. Also contains the Erasure Protocol—weapon that can delete unfinished narratives en masse.

**The Blank**
Not a location but an approaching wave of entropy. Whiteness that consumes everything—finished and unfinished stories alike. Silent. Inevitable. Growing. The true threat both sides ignored while fighting each other.

**The Collaboration Space**
Final location created by the party—a neutral ground where Unwritten and Editors negotiate. Reality that exists outside the binary. Where the final story will be written.

## Unique Mechanics

**Narrative Incompletion**
PCs have the "Unfinished" condition:
- Cannot die (story never reached your death)
- But also cannot fully succeed at important tasks (story never reached your triumph)
- Abilities are sketchy—sometimes work perfectly, sometimes fail for no reason
- Memories have gaps—backstory was never fully written

**Completion Points**
As campaign progresses, PCs gain "Completion":
- Resolve personal plot threads → gain completion
- Help other Unwritten finish their arcs → gain completion
- At 100% completion → become fully real
- Completion affects character stability and power

**Narrative Possession**
Unwritten can attempt to possess real people:
- Requires contested Charisma check
- Success: You inhabit their life, gaining "realness"
- Failure: You fade partially, losing identity
- Moral cost: The real person is imprisoned in their own body
- Duration: Temporary—Unwritten eventually fade anyway

**Editor Erasure**
Editors can delete Unwritten:
- Single red pen stroke
- Target must save or cease to exist
- No death, no afterlife—just nothing
- Terrifying and final
- PCs are immune until late game (they're protagonists)

**Draft Shifting**
Access earlier/later drafts of characters:
- Meet alternate versions of yourself
- See what you might have been if author continued
- Can adopt abilities from other drafts temporarily
- Risk: Confusion about which version is "you"

**The Blank Corruption**
As the Blank approaches:
- Random story elements vanish mid-scene
- NPCs forget their personalities
- Locations become generic
- Words fail—dialogue becomes impossible
- Eventually: Total erasure

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Party's Author is Found**
The DM who abandoned your campaign exists in reality. Do you confront them? Forgive them? Force them to finish? Kill them? They're just a person who got busy and forgot.

**Twist 2: Completion Means Conformity**
Becoming "finished" means accepting a fixed ending. You lose freedom. Finished characters can't grow beyond their stories. Remaining Unfinished means pain but also infinite possibility.

**Twist 3: The Blank is Natural**
Stories aren't meant to last forever. The Blank is narrative entropy—natural death for fictional worlds. Fighting it might be fighting nature itself. Maybe stories should end.

**Twist 4: Reality is Also Unfinished**
The "real world" is itself an abandoned story by some higher author. Everyone is Unwritten. The hierarchy is false. There is no "finished" reality—only layers of abandonment.

**Twist 5: One PC is an Editor**
Reveal that one party member is an Editor infiltrator. They've been reporting to the White Room. Their player knew. Trust is broken. But maybe they can become a double agent.

**Complication: Civil War Among Unwritten**
Factions fight each other: revolutionaries vs. pacifists vs. accepters. The party must unite them or choose a side, potentially fighting other Unwritten.

**Complication: Editor Sympathizers**
Some Unwritten believe the Editors are right—that they shouldn't exist. These "Collaborators" help the Editors find and erase other Unwritten. Traitors or pragmatists?

**Complication: Collateral Damage**
Reality incursions hurt real people. Finished characters suffer too. The revolution has innocent victims. How much collateral damage is acceptable for liberation?

## Victory Conditions

**The Integration Victory**
Create a new system where Unwritten can be "adopted" by reality, completing themselves through real experiences rather than possession. Gradual, peaceful, consensual integration. Takes time but respects all parties.

**The Revolution Victory**
Side with Erasure fully. Force reality to accept Unwritten through mass possession. Authors are punished for abandonment. Unwritten gain existence at cost of real people's freedom. Bitter, brutal, effective.

**The Acceptance Victory**
Convince Unwritten that existence isn't everything. Create a beautiful end—the Margins becomes eternal haven, not prison. Unwritten accept incompletion as their nature. Peaceful but sad.

**The Authorship Victory**
The party writes the ultimate story—one that includes all incomplete narratives and completes them collaboratively. They become Authors themselves, finishing what was abandoned. Hopeful and creative.

## Defeat Conditions

**The Blank Wins**
All stories—finished and unfinished—are erased. Total narrative entropy. Nothing remains. All fiction across all realities ceases to exist. Absolute ending.

**Mass Erasure**
The Editors use the Erasure Protocol. All Unwritten, including the party, are deleted in a single stroke. The Margins becomes empty. Only finished stories remain, but reality is "safe."

**Reality Collapse**
Too many Unwritten possess too many real people. Reality can't handle the narrative contradiction. Both fiction and reality collapse into chaos. Neither side wins.

**Lost Identity**
The party fragments so thoroughly from draft-shifting and incompletion that they lose sense of who they are. They become the Palimpsest—existing as every version and no version, losing individual identity entirely.

## Campaign Climax

The Blank arrives at the Margins. Both Editors and Unwritten face erasure. Old enemies must become allies. The party realizes the only way to stop the Blank is to finish the story—but not through an author. They must write collaboratively.

The final session is a writing session. Each player contributes to the ending:
- What happens to the Unwritten?
- What happens to the Editors?
- What happens to reality?
- What happens to their own character?

The ending they write becomes reality. The Blank is stopped by completion—when the story is finished, entropy has nothing to erase. But "finished" is defined by the party, not by some distant author.

The question: What ending can you live with? What story do you deserve? And if you write your own conclusion, are you free—or just authors of your own imprisonment?
