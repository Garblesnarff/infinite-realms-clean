In the post-war city-state of Equilibrium, all emotion is outlawed and citizens must take daily doses of Suppressant to eliminate feelings. The party are Clerics—elite enforcement monks trained in the deadly art of Gun Kata to hunt down "sense offenders" who feel. When one party member accidentally misses a dose and experiences emotion for the first time, they discover what humanity has lost and begin to question everything. Now they must hide their awakening while working to overthrow the Father and the Tetragrammaton Council that enslaves humanity to emotionless compliance.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Philosophical Conflict:** The campaign questions whether humanity can survive without emotion, creating moral complexity.
*   **Social Stealth:** The party must hide their awakening while operating within the system they're trying to destroy.
*   **Tactical Combat:** Gun Kata creates unique combat encounters blending martial arts and firearms.
*   **Investigation:** Discovering the truth about the Suppressant and the regime requires careful detective work.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A four-act arc about awakening, questioning, and ultimately rebelling.

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1–3):** A party member misses their Suppressant dose and experiences emotion. They introduce others to feeling, creating a secret cell of awakened Clerics. They must maintain their cover while learning what emotion means.
*   **Act II — The Underground (Sessions 4–7):** The party makes contact with the Resistance—ordinary citizens hiding books, art, and music. They learn the truth about the war that led to this world and discover the Father may not be who he claims.
*   **Act III — The Hunt (Sessions 8–10):** The party is suspected. They must evade investigation while gathering evidence to expose the regime. Elite Clerics hunt them using the same Gun Kata techniques they know.
*   **Act IV — The Revolution (Sessions 11–12):** With proof of the Father's lies, the party leads an assault on the Tetragrammaton Council chambers. The final battle combines Gun Kata mastery with the power of awakened emotion.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Gun Kata**

*   A martial art combining firearms and close combat in perfect geometric precision.
*   **Mechanics:** Allow characters to use DEX for firearm attacks and make firearm attacks in melee range without disadvantage. Special Gun Kata techniques cost resources but provide spectacular effects.

### 2. **Emotional Awakening**

*   Track each character's emotional journey from suppressed to awakened.
*   **Mechanics:** Awakened characters gain inspiration more frequently but also face emotional struggles that can impose disadvantage on certain checks.

### 3. **Cover and Social**

*   The party must maintain their cover as loyal Clerics while secretly working against the regime.
*   **Mechanics:** Failed Deception or Insight checks increase a "Suspicion" meter. High suspicion triggers investigations and assassination attempts.

### 4. **Suppressant Dosage**

*   Citizens take daily Suppressant. Missing doses causes withdrawal and emotional awakening.
*   **Mechanics:** Track dosage. Missing doses awakens but causes initial penalties as emotions overwhelm. Regular users who want to feel must detox over time.

### 5. **The Revolution Meter**

*   Track public awareness and willingness to rebel.
*   **Effects:** High revolution support means more allies and resources. Low means the party is alone. Major reveals and broadcast moments increase the meter dramatically.
