### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Standard Bearer**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The player wields the White Chronicle, jumping between two timeline branches to prevent world desertification. Standard History sees them as a military officer, Alternate History as an intelligence agent. Each timeline has exclusive NPCs and information. The war between Alistel and Granorg feeds the desert through meaningless death. Players must uncover conspiracies across timelines and ultimately choose which timeline survives, condemning the other and its people to non-existence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the mechanics of Sacrifice - when people die without meaning, their mana is lost, feeding desertification.
    *   Write the origin of the timeline split and Hugo's role in creating it.
    *   Describe the White Chronicle's purpose and the beings who guard it.
    *   Explain the war's true causes beyond propaganda from either nation.
    *   Detail the catastrophe in True History that Hugo tried to prevent, inadvertently creating the split.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **Alistel Military** (Major - Standard): Technological nation, player serves special forces.
    *   **Granorg Kingdom** (Major - Alternate): Traditional monarchy, player serves as intelligence.
    *   **Hugo's Faction** (Major - Antagonist): Time manipulators seeking to control all timelines.
    *   **Chronicle Guardians** (Minor): Teo & Lippti maintain rules of time travel.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** Stocke, Rosch (Standard only), Marco & Raynie (Standard only), Kiel & Gafka (Alternate only), Hugo, Eruca, Teo & Lippti.
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Alistel Soldier," "Granorg Knight," "Timeline-Specific Civilian."

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Locations:** Alistel capital, Granorg capital, expanding desert wasteland, Historia (Chronicle realm), True History regions.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Players prevent meaningless deaths and give purpose to sacrifice.
*   **THEN:** Slow the desert's expansion, unlock additional regions and quests.
*   **IF:** Players gather information from one timeline to solve problems in another.
*   **THEN:** Unlock new Nodes and access to True History path.
*   **IF:** Players choose Standard History as the "true" timeline.
*   **THEN:** Rosch, Marco, and Raynie survive; Kiel, Gafka, and Alternate-exclusive NPCs cease to exist.
*   **IF:** Players choose Alternate History as the "true" timeline.
*   **THEN:** Kiel and Gafka survive; Rosch, Marco, Raynie, and Standard-exclusive NPCs cease to exist.
*   **IF:** Players access True History and prevent the original catastrophe.
*   **THEN:** Unlock the "true ending" where fewer sacrifices are needed, but must still choose which timeline's people survive.
*   **IF:** Players build high relationships with timeline-exclusive NPCs.
*   **THEN:** Make the final choice more emotionally devastating but narratively satisfying.
