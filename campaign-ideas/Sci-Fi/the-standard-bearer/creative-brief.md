# Creative Brief: The Standard Bearer

Inspired by *Radiant Historia's* aesthetic - steampunk fantasy, branching timeline diagrams, desert wastelands contrasted with lush kingdoms, and visual representation of choice and consequence.

## Art Style: Steampunk Fantasy Timeline

### Core Principles:
*   **Timeline Visualization:** Branching paths, nodes, and decision points should be visually represented.
*   **Desert Encroachment:** Show the desert slowly consuming the world - maps change over time.
*   **Dual Perspectives:** Standard and Alternate timelines have subtly different aesthetics while sharing core elements.

### Color Palette:
Standard History uses cooler blues and silvers (Alistel technology). Alternate History uses warmer golds and browns (Granorg tradition). The desert is harsh yellows and oranges. True History is balanced greens and whites.

### Mood:
Strategic, contemplative, bittersweet. The weight of choice and the sorrow of necessary sacrifice permeate everything.

## Voice

A measured, strategic voice like a historian recounting a complex war. Pacing is thoughtful, with pauses at major decision points. Emotion is controlled melancholy - accepting that some sacrifices are necessary but mourning them nonetheless. Slight echo suggesting speaking across timelines.
