## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A three-act arc of regional conflict, escalating war, and united front against superweapons.

*   **Act I — Regional Skirmishes (Sessions 1-8):** The party serves as COs for their chosen nation (Orange Star, Blue Moon, Green Earth, or Yellow Comet). They fight territorial disputes over resources and strategic bases. Early missions are small-scale: capturing cities, defending chokepoints, learning CO Powers. They face rival COs with unique abilities and personalities. The fog of war mechanics and terrain advantages become crucial. Tension escalates when border conflicts become open warfare between nations.
*   **Act II — Total War (Sessions 9-16):** All four nations engage in massive campaigns. The party leads major offensives: fortress assaults, naval invasions, aerial bombardments. They face legendary enemy COs in increasingly difficult battles. Resource management becomes critical—capturing properties for income, building appropriate unit counters. CO Powers clash in spectacular fashion. A mysterious fifth faction—Black Hole—emerges with advanced technology and begins attacking all nations indiscriminately with superweapons.
*   **Act III — United Front (Sessions 17-25):** Black Hole's superweapons threaten mutual destruction: laser satellites, tsunami generators, volcanic activators. The four nations form uneasy alliance with party as neutral commanders. They infiltrate Black Hole's facilities, disabling superweapons before activation. Final battles involve commanding combined-nation armies against Black Hole's CO—a tactical genius with reality-warping CO Power. The climax involves simultaneous multi-front assault on Black Hole's command fortress, culminating in CO Power clash and final showdown.
