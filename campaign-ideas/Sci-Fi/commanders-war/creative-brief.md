## Voice

A voice that begins with military precision and tactical authority, carries enthusiasm for strategy, and celebrates spectacular CO Power moments. The pacing is measured during planning phase, excited during combat. The tone shifts between tactical command ("Move tanks to A3, target enemy artillery"), CO personality flourishes ("It's time to show them our strength!"), and climactic power activation ("CO Power ready! Activating Lucky Star!"). There's joy in tactical excellence. Slightly upbeat military radio voice. Role: The voice of tactical command and strategic mastery.
