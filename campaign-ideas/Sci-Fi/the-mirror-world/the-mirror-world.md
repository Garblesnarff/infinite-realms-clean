# The Mirror World
## *Where the Salt Flats Reflect Every Possibility*

### Campaign Overview

The Uyuni Expanse, an endless salt flat spanning 10,000 square miles, becomes a perfect mirror during the rainy season. The salt crust reflects the sky so perfectly that earth and heaven become indistinguishable—walking the flats feels like walking among the clouds. But the reflection shows more than just the sky. It shows every possible version of reality, every choice that could have been made, every path not taken. The salt flat is a window into the Infinite Mirror—a metaphysical construct where all possible timelines exist simultaneously.

For centuries, the Mirror Walkers, shamans who traverse the reflections, have maintained the boundary between possibility and actuality. They ensure that alternate timelines remain reflections, not realities. But a recent earthquake cracked the salt crust, and through those cracks, alternate realities are bleeding through. Impossible creatures appear. People encounter their own alternate selves. Buildings flicker between what they are and what they could have been.

The Mirror World isn't a separate dimension—it's every dimension, every timeline, every possible universe reflected in crystallized salt. And something is systematically breaking the mirrors. The party must navigate an landscape where cause and effect are optional, where they can meet themselves having made different choices, and where reality itself is negotiable. Victory means sealing the cracks and preserving this reality as the "real" one. Defeat means all possibilities collapse into superposition—everything and nothing simultaneously.

### Core Themes

- **Choices and Consequences**: Every decision creates branches
- **Identity Across Possibilities**: Who are you in other timelines?
- **The Weight of "What If"**: Confronting roads not taken
- **Observation Creates Reality**: The quantum mirror effect
- **Accepting One Path**: You cannot walk all roads

### Unique Mechanics

**Mirror Walking**
- Wisdom save DC 15 to maintain identity while viewing alternate timelines
- Failure: Confuse your memories with alternate-self's (1d4 hours)
- Extended exposure: Risk becoming "unstuck"—existing in multiple timelines

**Quantum Observation**
- Observing alternate timeline affects it
- The more you interact, the more "real" it becomes
- Danger: Make an alternate too real, it might replace prime reality
- Required: Choose carefully what to look at

**Alternate Self Encounters**
- Each player creates 4 alternate versions (one per crack)
- Stats similar but different based on life choices
- Can ally with, fight, or merge with alternate selves (temporary power boost but identity crisis)

**Choice Points**
- DM identifies major player choices throughout campaign
- Those choices create visible branches in the Mirror
- Can briefly experience what would have happened if different choice made
- Knowledge influences future decisions

**Reality Stability Tracker**
- Starts at 100%
- Each crack visited reduces 10%
- Below 50%: Random reality bleeds (impossible things happening)
- Below 25%: Mass quantum superposition (multiple timelines visible)
- At 0%: Total collapse, all timelines merge into chaos

### Plot Twists

**You've Been Here Before**
- Mid-campaign reveal: This has happened before in another timeline
- Previous party failed, created the Shatterer
- Are you doomed to repeat, or can you break the cycle?

**The Monastery Lies**
- Mirror Walkers haven't been maintaining boundaries
- They've been CHOOSING which timeline is real
- Playing god with infinite realities
- Elder Saya consumed with guilt

**Prime Reality Isn't Special**
- No objective "correct" timeline
- Each reality thinks it's the real one
- Party's timeline has no special claim to existence
- Makes sealing feel like genocide against alternate selves

**Causality's True Nature**
- Not neutral arbiter—actively prevents good timelines from being real
- Believes struggle and consequence create meaning
- Actively made disasters happen in prime timeline
- Is the real villain

**The Shatterer's Logic**
- They're not wrong—merging would restore lost loved ones (in a sense)
- Party must confront: Is our timeline worth all the others?
- No clear moral answer

**Your Future Self**
- One player meets their future self from prime timeline
- Future self warns about specific choice
- Do you listen? Create different future? Cause paradox?

### Victory Conditions

**The Great Sealing: Prime Timeline Preserved**
- Seal all four cracks
- Prevent reality merger
- Defeat or redeem the Shatterer

- Reality becomes fluid but stable
- Result: Prime timeline enriched by best aspects of others, requires eternal management

**The Shatterer's Redemption**
- Convince future-self that merger isn't the answer

- They become new Mirror Walker guardian
- Result: Cracks sealed, Shatterer finds peace, party knows they could become them

### Defeat Conditions
