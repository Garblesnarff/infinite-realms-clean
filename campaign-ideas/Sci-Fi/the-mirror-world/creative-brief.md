# Creative Brief: The Mirror World

## Visual Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: White salt (#FFFFFF), sky blue (#87CEEB), mirror silver (#C0C0C0), quantum shimmer (iridescent), reality distortion (prismatic glitches)
- **Visual Style**: Infinite flatness meets M.C. Escher, reflections that show different worlds, sky indistinguishable from ground
- **Key Imagery**: Walking on perfect mirrors, multiple versions of characters overlapping, salt hexagons extending to infinity, reality cracking like glass

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Minimalist piano with echoing reflections, each note repeated in variations (alternate timelines)
- **Alternate Timeline Themes**: War World (militaristic drums), Paradise (serene strings), Ruin (discordant decay), Ascension (digital synthesis)
- **Soundscape**: Echoes, reverb, sounds from multiple timelines overlapping, salt crunching underfoot, silence of infinite flatness

## Voice Acting
- **Elder Saya**: Distant, sometimes speaks to people who aren't there, gentle confusion
- **Causality**: Cold, precise, no emotion, speaks in absolutes
- **The Shatterer**: Broken, grief-mad, voice cracks between rage and sorrow
- **Alternate Selves**: Same voice actors but different delivery based on timeline (confident/broken/peaceful/alien)
