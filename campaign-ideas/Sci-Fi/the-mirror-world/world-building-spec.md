# World-Building Specification: The Mirror World

## The Infinite Mirror - Metaphysics

### How It Works
- Salt crystallizes into perfect hexagonal patterns
- Hexagons act as quantum mirrors—each reflects all possible states
- When water covers salt, reflection becomes perfect, veil between possible and actual thins
- Normally: Infinite possibilities remain reflections, one reality actualized
- Currently: Cracks allow possibilities to become semi-real, bleeding through

### The Four Cracks - Complete Details

**North Crack (War Timeline)**
- **Divergence Point**: 50 years ago, peace treaty failed
- **Current State**: Perpetual war, militarized society, 60% original population dead
- **Party Alternates**: Hardened soldiers, or dead, or refugees in hiding
- **Lesson**: Conflict without end destroys everything
- **Sealing Requirement**: Acknowledge war in prime timeline could have continued

**East Crack (Paradise Timeline)**
- **Divergence Point**: 80 years ago, great disaster prevented by hero's sacrifice
- **Current State**: Utopian peace, no growth, vulnerable to new threats
- **Party Alternates**: Comfortable, content, soft, unfulfilled
- **Lesson**: Too much peace weakens capacity for challenge
- **Sealing Requirement**: Accept that struggle has value

**South Crack (Ruin Timeline)**
- **Divergence Point**: 10 years ago, apocalypse not prevented
- **Current State**: 99% dead, desperate survivors, hope abandoned
- **Party Alternates**: Most dead, survivors brutal and broken
- **Lesson**: How close you came to total loss
- **Sealing Requirement**: Face mortality and fragility

**West Crack (Ascension Timeline)**
- **Divergence Point**: 30 years ago, magical/technological breakthrough achieved immortality
- **Current State**: Uploaded consciousness, physical bodies abandoned, post-human
- **Party Alternates**: Digital entities, beautiful and alien, barely recognize selves
- **Lesson**: Evolution might mean losing what makes you you
- **Sealing Requirement**: Accept limitations of mortality

## The Shatterer - Complete Profile

**Identity**: Future version of party's most hopeful/optimistic member
**Timeline**: 200 years in future of prime timeline
**Event**: All companions died in preventable tragedy
**Response**: Spent centuries studying mirror magic, became obsessed with "fixing" reality
**Plan**: Merge all timelines so all versions exist simultaneously (no loss, no grief)
**Flaw**: Doesn't understand merged existence is unlivable chaos
**Powers**: Can exist in multiple timelines, control reflections, weaponize possibilities
**Redemption Path**: Show them that accepting loss is part of living

## Mirror Walker Order

**Founded**: 1,000 years ago when first shaman discovered the Infinite Mirror
**Purpose**: Maintain boundary between possible and actual
**Methods**: Meditation in salt circles, quantum observation training, accepting their choices
**Secret Guilt**: Have been choosing which timelines become real (divine power they deny having)
**Current Crisis**: Elder generation dying, young generation untrained, cracks appeared during transition

## Magic System - Reflection Magic

**Mirror Walk** (2nd level): Step into reflection, view alternate timeline for 10 minutes
**Quantum Summon** (4th level): Summon alternate-self from another timeline to aid (30 minutes)
**Possibility Blade** (5th level): Weapon exists in multiple states, deals multiple damage types
**Choice Cascade** (7th level): Reroll any roll, see what would have happened with different result
**Timeline Collapse** (9th level): Temporarily merge two timelines, combine their properties

## Resolution Outcomes

**Great Sealing**: Cracks sealed, prime timeline preserved, alternates remain reflections. Future-self either destroyed or redeemed. Reality stable, but party haunted by roads not taken.

**Careful Merger**: Limited bleed allowed, some cross-timeline travel possible, reality fluid but managed. Requires Mirror Walkers to maintain balance perpetually. Cultural exchange between timelines.

**Shatterer's Redemption**: Future-self convinced, becomes eternal guardian, uses power to maintain seals rather than break them. Party knows their potential dark future but chooses differently.
