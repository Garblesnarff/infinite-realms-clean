# Creative Brief: The Ten Pledges

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Vibrant High-Fantasy Gaming (No Game No Life-inspired)

Inspired by the saturated, colorful aesthetic of *No Game No Life* and the strategic intensity of high-stakes gaming anime. This style aims to capture the clever, non-violent, mind-game nature of a world where everything is decided by games, blending fantasy elements with casino and game hall aesthetics.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Saturated Colors:** Use rich, vibrant colors that pop—especially contrasting primaries and neons. The world should feel alive and energetic.
*   **Game Imagery:** Incorporate playing cards, dice, chess pieces, game boards, and magical manifestations of game rules into scenes.
*   **Expressive Characters:** Focus on facial expressions and body language that convey cunning, confidence, surprise, and the psychological warfare of gaming.
