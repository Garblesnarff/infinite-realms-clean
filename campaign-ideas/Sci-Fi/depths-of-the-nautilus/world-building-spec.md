### **World-Building Specification Brief: Depths of the Nautilus**

**1. Core Concept:**
Captured by Captain Nemo on his advanced submarine, the party voyages through underwater wonders while uncovering his vendetta against imperial powers and deciding whether to support, escape, or stop him.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Nemo's backstory—the colony destroyed by imperialism, family killed, path to exile
*   Explain the technology behind the Nautilus—how it works in this magical world
*   Describe the lost civilization of Atlantis and what remains
*   Write about the ecology of the deep ocean—bioluminescent creatures, giant monsters, alien ecosystems
*   Detail the imperial powers Nemo opposes and their crimes

**3. Factions:**
*   **Captain Nemo and Crew** (Major) - The submarine's isolated society
*   **Imperial Naval Forces** (Major) - Nemo's targets
*   **The Scientific Community** (Minor) - Scholars who want to document discoveries
*   **Surface World Governments** (Minor) - Want to capture or destroy the Nautilus

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Captain Nemo, Professor Aronnax, Ned Land, Conseil, First Mate of Nautilus
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Nautilus Crew Member," "Imperial Ship Captain," "Deep Sea Creature," "Ancient Atlantean Guardian"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Nautilus** - Submarine interior (luxurious, scientific, mysterious)
*   **Sunken Atlantis** - Ancient ruins, treasures, dangers
*   **The Abyssal Trench** - Deepest point, bioluminescent horror
*   **Polar Ice Caverns** - South Pole underwater journey
*   **The Coral Cemetery** - Ships Nemo has destroyed

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party helps Nemo's revenge THEN they become complicit but gain his deep trust and share of discoveries
*   IF party attempts escape THEN Nemo must decide whether to let them go or ensure they can't reveal his location
*   IF party convinces Nemo to show mercy THEN potential redemption but incomplete revenge
*   IF Nautilus is destroyed THEN desperate underwater survival sequence
