# Creative Brief: The Astral Rebellion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Epic Space Opera Fantasy (Star Wars-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic aesthetic of *Star Wars*, this style blends classic space opera with high fantasy elements. It aims to capture the epic scope, mystical energy, and timeless good-versus-evil struggle of a galaxy-spanning conflict, reimagined through a D&D lens with the cosmic Weave replacing the Force.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Wonder:** Focus on massive starships, alien worlds, vast starfields, and the sense that this conflict spans entire civilizations.
*   **Detail the Mystical Elements:** Highlight the Astral Arts—glowing energy blades, telekinetic powers, and the visible connection between users and the cosmic Weave.
*   **Heroic Compositions:** Characters should look legendary, poised for action, silhouetted against epic backdrops.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, space opera, heroic, mystical, adventurous, galactic, rebellion, destiny, hope vs. tyranny.
*   **Feeling:** A lived-in universe of alien worlds and ancient mysteries. The thrill of space battles and lightsaber duels. The weight of destiny and the power of hope against impossible odds. A sense of timeless myth and legend.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, iconic forms for ships and technology. Dynamic, action-oriented poses for characters. Ralph McQuarrie-inspired concept art aesthetic—painterly but with strong, clear compositions.
*   **Textures:** Worn metal on ships showing battle damage, flowing robes, sleek Imperial technology, organic alien landscapes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A concept art painting in the style of Ralph McQuarrie. A Rebellion starfighter banks against a backdrop of a ringed gas giant, energy trails streaming from its engines."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Bold, saturated colors with high contrast. The Rebellion uses warm, hopeful colors (oranges, reds, yellows). The Imperium uses cold, oppressive colors (grays, blacks, deep blues).
*   **Accent Colors:** The bright blue or green glow of Astral Arts. The ominous red of Void Arts. The stars themselves providing white/blue ambient light.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Light comes from twin suns, nebulae, starship engines, and the glow of energy weapons.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...with a warm orange glow from a setting sun contrasting against the cold blue shadows. The rebel's Astral Blade glows bright cyan, cutting through the darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Heroic proportions and iconic silhouettes. Characters should be recognizable by their outline alone.
*   **Rebels:** Practical flight suits, mixed with robes for Astral Knights, showing wear and personalization. Earth-tone colors with pops of bright unit insignias.
*   **Imperials:** Uniform, oppressive design. Stormtrooper-like armor in black and gray. Officers in severe military uniforms.
*   **Astral Knights:** Flowing robes in natural colors (brown, tan, white), with glowing Astral Blades.
*   **Expression:** Determination, hope, or grim resolve for heroes. Cold efficiency or menacing presence for villains.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A heroic Astral Knight in flowing tan robes, standing in a ready stance with a glowing blue Astral Blade held before them, silhouetted against a binary sunset."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Diverse alien worlds—ice planets, jungle moons, desert wastelands, crystal forests, cloud cities. Each location should feel unique and memorable.
*   **Space Scenes:** Star-filled voids, colorful nebulae, massive capital ships, asteroid fields, ringed planets.
*   **Technology:** Lived-in, functional design. Ships show wear and damage. Bases are repurposed or makeshift.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hidden Rebellion base carved into a massive asteroid, with starfighters parked in caverns. Through the opening, a field of stars and a distant nebula glows purple and blue."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, cinematic lighting with strong key lights creating heroic compositions. God rays, lens flares (used sparingly), and atmospheric lighting.
*   **Shadows:** Used to create depth and drama but not to obscure—this is heroic fantasy, not noir.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the epic nature of scenes and creates emotional tone—warm for hope, cold for oppression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically backlit by the glow of an exploding space station, creating a heroic silhouette. Debris and light create god rays streaming past the character."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic wide shots for establishing scale, dynamic action shots for combat, intimate close-ups for emotional moments.
*   **Techniques:** Use of the rule of thirds, leading lines (starship trails, saber swings), framing characters against epic backdrops.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide cinematic shot of a fleet of Rebellion ships emerging from hyperspace above an Imperial shipyard. The composition emphasizes the scale of both fleets, with the largest ships framed against a planet."

## Voice

A clear, resonant male voice with gravitas and warmth—think of a combination of a wise mentor and a war hero. The accent is neutral American, measured and deliberate, with the pacing of someone who has seen history unfold and understands its weight. The emotion balances hope with determination, wisdom with urgency—someone rallying troops before a desperate battle or recording a message for future generations. Audio quality is pristine, with a subtle reverb suggesting a transmission across the stars or an echo in a grand hall. Role: A Rebellion leader giving a rousing speech, or an Astral Knight recording their final message before a suicide mission.
