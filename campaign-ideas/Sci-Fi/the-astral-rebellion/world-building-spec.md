**The Astral Rebellion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The Celestial Imperium—a tyrannical empire spanning a thousand worlds—has crushed freedom across the planes. The party joins the Starlight Rebellion, a ragtag alliance fighting against impossible odds. When an ancient prophecy reveals that one among them may be the "Voidborn Champion" destined to restore balance to the cosmic Weave, they must master the mysterious Astral Arts, unite fractured resistance cells, and strike at the heart of the Imperium before the Emperor completes a superweapon capable of severing entire worlds from the Weave itself.

    *   Describe the cosmic Weave—the interconnected fabric of reality that binds all worlds and allows for Astral Arts.
