# The Last Spice War
## "Control the Flavor, Control the World"

### Campaign Overview

In the interconnected world of culinary commerce, five great Spice Guilds have maintained an uneasy balance for centuries, each controlling vital trade routes and exclusive ingredients that define entire culinary traditions. The party begins as low-level merchants, caravan guards, or aspiring spice traders caught in the crossfire when the centuries-old peace suddenly shatters. Someone has burned the neutral Grand Bazaar to the ground, destroying stockpiles worth kingdoms and killing hundreds of traders. Each Guild blames the others, and the realm teeters on the edge of all-out war that could starve nations and destroy cultures.

As the party investigates the attack, they discover a conspiracy far deeper than simple rivalry. A mysterious figure known only as "The Flavorless" is orchestrating the conflict, seeking to monopolize all spice production and reduce the world's rich culinary diversity to bland uniformity under their control. The party must navigate treacherous guild politics, protect caravans from raiders, secure rare ingredients before they're destroyed, and broker peace between ancient enemies—all while racing to stop The Flavorless from achieving their goal of a world without flavor, variety, or choice.

The Last Spice War will be fought not just with swords and magic, but with trade agreements, culinary innovations, and the hearts of people who refuse to let their cultural food traditions die. In this campaign, the party will discover that the right spice at the right time can be more powerful than any spell, and that protecting flavor diversity is protecting freedom itself.
