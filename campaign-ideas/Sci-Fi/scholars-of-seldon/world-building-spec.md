### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Scholars of Seldon**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the twilight of the Radiant Imperium, a galaxy-spanning magical empire, the prophetic wizard Hari Seldon predicts the Empire's collapse into 30,000 years of barbarism. Using mathematical divination called psychohistory, he establishes two secret Foundations to preserve knowledge and shorten the dark age to 1,000 years. The players, agents of the First Foundation, must navigate collapsing empires, fulfill prophecies, protect accumulated lore, and face threats even Seldon couldn't predict.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the rise of the Radiant Imperium, from the First Empire 12,000 years ago to its current decaying state.
    *   Write the biography of Hari Seldon—his discovery of psychohistory, his trial for treason, and his establishment of the two Foundations.
    *   Describe the science of psychohistory: mathematical divination that predicts societal trends across centuries but cannot account for individuals.
    *   Explain the symbolism and purpose of the Vault—why Seldon created it to open only during crises.
    *   Detail the legend of the Encyclopedia Galactica—the stated purpose of the Foundation versus its true mission.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The First Foundation** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Preserve magical knowledge and establish a new civilization to shorten the dark age.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Initially led by appointed Mayors (Salvor Hardin, then Hober Mallow), later by elected councils.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Compile the Encyclopedia Galactica, the greatest repository of knowledge.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Follow the Seldon Plan's hidden directives to become the nucleus of the Second Empire.
        *   **Assets:** Advanced magical technology, economic power through trade, strategic location at galaxy's edge.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed by warlords and Imperial remnants; unaware of the Second Foundation initially.
    *   **The Second Foundation** (Major - Hidden)
        *   **Goals:** Protect the Seldon Plan through psychic manipulation and subtle guidance.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Council of psychic mages led by Speakers, operating in absolute secrecy.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown—they're completely hidden for most of the campaign.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use mental magic to adjust variables when the Plan deviates, ensuring mathematical predictions stay on course.
        *   **Assets:** Powerful psychic abilities, hidden location (Trantor's ruins), intelligence networks.
        *   **Relationships:** Secretly guide the First Foundation; opposed by the Mule; distrusted by the party when revealed.
    *   **The Radiant Imperium (Declining)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain control over the galaxy despite internal decay and rebellion.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Imperial throne, aristocratic governors, bureaucratic ministries, all increasingly corrupt and ineffective.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Bring peace and prosperity to all worlds under the throne.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Suppress any threat to Imperial authority, including the Foundation.
        *   **Assets:** Massive but outdated military, political legitimacy, centuries of accumulated wealth.
        *   **Relationships:** Views the Foundation as treasonous; unable to maintain control over outer territories.
    *   **The Four Kingdoms (Warlords)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Expand territory and consolidate power in the chaos of Imperial collapse.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military dictatorships led by former Imperial governors who declared independence.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Protect their people from Imperial tyranny.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Conquer neighbors and loot resources before civilization collapses entirely.
        *   **Assets:** Military forces, control of resource-rich worlds.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to each other and the Foundation; susceptible to religious manipulation.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully navigate a Seldon Crisis without violence.
    *   **THEN:** The Seldon Plan Tracker shows low Chaos. The vault opens with Seldon congratulating them, and the Foundation's reputation and influence increase across neighboring worlds.
    *   **IF:** The players use violence to solve a crisis.
    *   **THEN:** The Seldon Plan Tracker gains Chaos Points. The vault opens with Seldon expressing concern, and the Foundation gains enemies who fear military aggression.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the Second Foundation before Act IV.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where Second Foundation psychics approach the party, asking them to keep the secret in exchange for limited psychic training.
    *   **IF:** The players kill the Mule.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the Seldon Plan returns to course, but the Second Foundation reveals the Mule's death created new variables requiring another century of adjustment.
    *   **IF:** The players redeem the Mule.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the Mule joins the Second Foundation, using his powers to heal rather than control, becoming a force for good unpredicted by the Plan.
    *   **IF:** The players reject both Foundations and the Seldon Plan.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the party establishes a third path—neither mathematical destiny nor psychic control, but chaotic freedom. The dark age lasts longer, but humanity chooses its own fate.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully unite the First and Second Foundations.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the Second Galactic Empire is born—a civilization balancing knowledge, democracy, and ethical psychic guidance, fulfilling Seldon's ultimate vision.
