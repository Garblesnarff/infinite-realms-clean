# Scholars of Seldon

*A Historical Epic / Political Intrigue campaign — Long Campaign (15–20 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Scholars of Seldon
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Historical Epic / Political Intrigue / Prophetic Mystery
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **15–17**
**Tone (keywords):** epic, prophetic, scholarly, declining empire, mathematical destiny, preservation of knowledge
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the twilight of the Radiant Imperium, a vast magical empire spanning a thousand worlds, the party encounters the work of Hari Seldon—a prophetic wizard who used mathematical divination to predict the Empire's inevitable collapse into 30,000 years of darkness. Seldon established two Foundations in secret locations to preserve magical knowledge and shorten the dark age to merely 1,000 years. The party, recruited as agents of the First Foundation, must navigate the collapsing Empire's political chaos, protect the accumulated lore, and fulfill the prophecies of the Seldon Plan while shadowy forces seek to subvert destiny itself.

---

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Complex political negotiations where combat is a failure state, moral dilemmas with no clear right answer, and encounters scaled for high-level play including planar threats.
*   **Investigation:** Players must analyze historical patterns, interpret cryptic prophecies, and deduce which "Seldon Crisis" is approaching based on subtle signs across multiple worlds.
*   **Consequences:** The campaign spans centuries (using time skips). Player decisions shape the development of entire civilizations. Failure doesn't mean death—it means prolonging the dark age by thousands of years.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15–20 sessions)

A five-act arc spanning centuries, taking the party from the final days of Empire to the birth of a new galactic order.

*   **Act I — The Last Days of Empire (Sessions 1–4):** The party meets Hari Seldon's disciples in the Imperial capital of Trantor and learns of the prophecy. They witness the Empire's decay firsthand and are recruited to protect the First Foundation's secret location.
*   **Act II — The Foundation's Birth (Sessions 5–8):** The party travels to Terminus, an isolated world at the edge of known space, where scholars gather to create the Encyclopedia Galactica—a repository of all magical knowledge. They face the First Seldon Crisis: invasion by nearby warlords.
*   **Act III — The Merchant Princes (Sessions 9–12):** Time skip forward 50 years (the party is sustained by longevity magic or reincarnated). The Foundation has become a trading power, spreading magical technology. The party must navigate trade wars, religious manipulation, and the corrupting influence of power.
*   **Act IV — The Second Foundation (Sessions 13–16):** The party discovers hints of a Second Foundation, hidden somewhere in the galaxy, working in secret to safeguard the Seldon Plan through mental magic. They must decide whether to trust these mysterious guardians or oppose them.
*   **Act V — The Crisis of Destiny (Sessions 17–20):** The Seldon Plan faces its greatest threat—the Mule, a psychic anomaly Seldon couldn't predict, who conquers world after world through mind control. The party must unite both Foundations and stop the Mule before the Plan collapses entirely.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is between destiny and free will. Can the future truly be predicted? Should it be controlled by hidden guardians? The party must balance following the Seldon Plan with making their own moral choices, ultimately deciding whether humanity's salvation requires mathematical certainty or chaotic freedom.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Seldon Plan Tracker**

*   A campaign-long resource tracking how closely events follow Seldon's predictions. Major deviations add "Chaos Points."
*   **Effects:** High Chaos extends the predicted dark age. Low Chaos keeps the Plan on track. The DM reveals Seldon's predictions when the vault opens.

### 2. **Psychohistory Checks**

*   Players can make Intelligence (History/Arcana) checks to predict societal trends, giving advantage on diplomatic or strategic decisions.
*   **Limitation:** Psychohistory only works on large populations, never individuals—reflecting the Plan's core weakness.

### 3. **Time Skip Mechanics**

*   Between acts, decades pass. Players can invest in projects (build institutions, train successors, research magic) that pay off in future sessions.
*   **Reincarnation Option:** Players can choose to play their character's descendant or reincarnation, inheriting some abilities and reputation.

### 4. **Emotional Manipulation (The Mule's Power)**

*   During Mule encounters, players must resist psychic emotion-control. Failed saves don't impose conditions—they change how the player *wants* to act, creating roleplaying challenges.
