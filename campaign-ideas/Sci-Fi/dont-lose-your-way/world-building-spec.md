# World-Building Specification Brief: Don't Lose Your Way

**Core Concept:** Players navigate Honnouji Academy where clothing grants power through Life Fiber aliens. Student President Satsuki rules through fascist hierarchy while secretly planning rebellion against mother Ragyo, who wants to merge humanity with Life Fibers. Transfer student Ryuko challenges the system with talking uniform Senketsu. The campaign is absurdist revolution—clothing as oppression, nudity as liberation, sisterhood defeating corruption.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Life Fibers—alien organisms disguised as fabric, parasitic, grant power while consuming humanity.
*   Goku Uniforms—Life Fiber clothing ranked by stars, creating literal social hierarchy.
*   REVOCS Corporation—global fashion empire secretly distributing Life Fibers for Ragyo's apocalypse plan.
*   Kamui—ultimate sentient uniforms (Senketsu, Junketsu), require blood to activate, near-nudity for maximum power.

**Factions:**
*   **Honnouji Academy:** Fascist school-state ruled by Satsuki, training ground for revolution disguised as oppression.
*   **REVOCS Corporation:** Global conspiracy led by Ragyo, plans Life Fiber Override to consume humanity.
*   **Nudist Beach:** Anti-Life Fiber resistance, fights naked or in non-Life Fiber gear, led by Aikuro.
*   **Elite Four:** Satsuki's loyal generals, secretly preparing for rebellion alongside her.

**Locations:**
*   **Honnouji Academy:** Massive pyramid-shaped school-city, stratified by clothing rank.
*   **REVOCS Headquarters:** Fashion empire tower, Life Fiber research facilities.
*   **Nudist Beach Base:** Underground resistance bunker, anti-Life Fiber technology.
*   **Primordial Life Fiber:** Original alien beneath Japan, awakens for apocalypse.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF characters embrace shame, THEN Life Fiber uniforms grant limited power.
*   IF they reject shame, THEN transformations reach ultimate potential through near-nudity.
*   IF Ragyo activates Primordial Life Fiber, THEN global consumption begins immediately.
*   IF Senketsu sacrifices himself, THEN Ryuko survives re-entry but loses her power forever.
