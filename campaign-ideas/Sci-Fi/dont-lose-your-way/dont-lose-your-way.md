**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party arrives at Honnouji Academy where clothing literally grants power—the more you wear, the stronger you become. They discover this power comes from Life Fibers, parasitic alien organisms disguised as fabric.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **using oppressive tools for liberation**. Life Fibers grant power but consume humanity. Satsuki uses fascism to prepare revolution. The campaign explores whether evil means can achieve good ends, shame versus acceptance, and mother-daughter trauma. Clothing as metaphor for social control and bodily autonomy creates absurdist philosophy made literal.
