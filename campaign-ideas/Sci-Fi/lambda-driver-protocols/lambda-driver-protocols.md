**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are elite mecha mercenaries from Mithril (a secret military organization) assigned to protect a high school student who unknowingly possesses "Whispered" knowledge—subconscious understanding of advanced technology.

The campaign mixes absurd culture-clash comedy with serious military drama, culminating in discovering the Lambda Driver—a system that turns pilot emotion into reality-warping power.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Tactical mecha combat where positioning and environmental use matter. Lambda Driver sequences where willpower literally bends physics.
*   **Investigation:** Espionage, protecting the Whispered target, uncovering enemy organizations (Amalgam), maintaining civilian cover.
*   **Consequences:** Dual life creates complications—civilian relationships endanger missions, military actions affect school life. Failure means the Whispered is kidnapped and weapons of mass destruction are created.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — Undercover (Sessions 1–4):** The party infiltrates a high school to protect the Whispered target. Culture shock comedy as hardened soldiers navigate teenage drama. Minor terrorist threats introduce Arm Slave combat.
*   **Act II — Lambda Driver Discovery (Sessions 5–8):** The party encounters enemy Arm Slaves using Lambda Drivers—systems that materialize willpower. They must learn to use this reality-warping tech while protecting the Whispered from Amalgam.
*   **Act III — Amalgam's Gambit (Sessions 9–12):** Full-scale assault on the school. The Whispered is kidnapped. The party must rescue them before enemy Whispered knowledge creates apocalyptic weapons.
*   **Act IV — Resolution (Sessions 13–15):** Final confrontation using Lambda Drivers. The party chooses whether to destroy all Whispered knowledge (including their friend's mind) or protect it despite the danger.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dual Life Management**

*   The party maintains civilian and military identities simultaneously.
*   **Social Stats:** School relationships (friendships, rivalries, romance) provide bonuses or complications to missions.
*   **Cover Risk:** Failed social encounters can expose the party's true identities.

### 2. **Lambda Driver**

*   Advanced system that materializes pilot willpower as physical force—shields, weapons, impossible maneuvers.
*   **Activation:** Requires intense emotion (determination, fear, love, rage).
*   **Effects:** Add emotional intensity to physical actions—punch through steel, move faster than physics allows, create energy barriers.
*   **Drawback:** Unpredictable, drains the pilot, can backfire if emotions are conflicted.

### 3. **Whispered Knowledge**

*   The protected target occasionally has visions of advanced technology during stress.
*   **Mechanics:** Player controlling the Whispered can spend inspiration to intuit solutions to technical problems (hacking, repairing mecha, understanding enemy tech).

### 4. **Arm Slave Combat**

*   Tactical mecha battles emphasizing cover, ammunition management, and asymmetric warfare.
*   **Arm Slaves:** Smaller than Gundam-style suits (7-10 meters), more like powered armor. Vulnerable but mobile.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is protecting dangerous knowledge (the Whispered) while deciding whether said knowledge should exist. Whispered can revolutionize the world or doom it. The party must defend their friend while questioning if eliminating all Whispered (including their friend's mind) would save more lives.

## Themes

*   **Fish Out of Water:** Hardcore soldiers in a high school setting create absurd comedy.
*   **Duality:** Comedy and drama, civilian and soldier, high school slice-of-life and war.
*   **Knowledge as Burden:** The Whispered didn't ask for their knowledge and can't control it. Is ignorance safer than enlightenment?
*   **Emotion as Power:** The Lambda Driver turns feelings into weapons—strength through vulnerability.
*   **Protecting the Mundane:** The party fights so others can have normal lives they themselves can never have.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Protect the Whispered:** Keep Kaname safe, prevent Amalgam from weaponizing her knowledge. Bittersweet—she can never be truly normal.
*   **Destroy Whispered Knowledge:** Eliminate all Whispered (including Kaname's memories) to prevent apocalypse. Moral horror.
*   **Master Lambda Driver:** Defeat Amalgam using reality-warping power, prove Whispered knowledge can be used responsibly.
*   **Retire to Civilian Life:** Abandon Mithril, live as normal students, accept you can't save everyone. Peace but guilt.
