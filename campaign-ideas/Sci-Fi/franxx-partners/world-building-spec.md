### **World-Building Specification Brief: Franxx Partners**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   Teenage pilots raised in isolation operate two-pilot Franxx (male Stamen + female Pistil) against Klaxosaurs. They know nothing of emotions, reproduction, or freedom—only combat. As they discover forbidden knowledge, they learn their immortal rulers view them as tools. The campaign explores becoming human, forming partnerships, and rebelling for the right to define their own future.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail humanity's discovery of magma energy and the choice—use it to achieve immortality (losing reproduction) or remain mortal.
*   Explain APE (adult council) chose immortality, requiring child pilots to extract magma and fight Klaxosaurs.
*   Describe plantations—mobile fortresses where children live in simulated normalcy while being weapons.
*   Outline Klaxosaurs—former humans who rejected immortality, mutated by magma exposure. Now defend Earth from VIRM.
*   Reveal VIRM—alien collective consciousness offering "peace" through assimilation. APE secretly allied with them.

**3. Factions:**
*   **APE (Adults Council)** (Major - Antagonist): Immortal rulers who control plantations and child soldiers.
*   **Plantation 13 Parasites** (Major - Player Faction): The party's squad, child pilots discovering humanity.
*   **Klaxosaurs** (Major - Misunderstood Enemy): Former humans defending Earth from VIRM.
*   **VIRM** (Major - True Threat): Alien collective seeking to assimilate all life.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Zero Two** (hybrid pilot), **Hiro** (failed prodigy), **APE Council** (immortal rulers), **Kokoro & Mitsuru** (forbidden parents), **Klaxosaur Princess** (sentient defender), **VIRM** (collective consciousness).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Plantation 13** (mobile fortress), **The Birdcage** (sterile living quarters), **Magma Fuel Sites** (battlefields), **Gran Crevasse** (Klaxosaur hive entrance), **Orbital Cities** (adult paradises).

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** pilots discover reproduction **THEN** adults attempt memory erasure, triggering rebellion.
*   **IF** pregnancy occurs **THEN** proof pilots can continue humanity, threatens adult control.
*   **IF** Klaxosaur truth revealed **THEN** party can ally with them against VIRM.
*   **IF** VIRM defeated **THEN** children inherit Earth, must decide if they'll repeat adults' mistakes.

**7. Paired Piloting Mechanics:**
*   **Synchronization:** Based on emotional compatibility.
    *   High: Romance, trust, deep friendship = combat bonuses.
    *   Low: Conflict, distrust = penalties or piloting failure.
*   **Positions:** Stamen (male, controls movement), Pistil (female, controls weapons).
*   **Solo Piloting:** Ineffective—Franxx require partnership.

**8. Emotional Mechanics:**
*   Pilots start emotionally stunted (no understanding of love, sex, family).
*   Discovering emotions through roleplay:
    *   First love, first kiss, first conflict—narrative moments that improve synchronization.
*   **Yellow Blood Cells:** Life force drained by piloting. Depleted = aging/death.

**9. Klaxosaur Mechanics:**
*   **Types:** Conrad (small), Gutenberg (large), Lehmann (massive).
*   **Cores:** Must be destroyed to kill permanently.
*   **Intelligence:** Late-game reveals they're organized, protecting Earth.

**10. VIRM Threat:**
*   **Assimilation:** Offers collective consciousness (no suffering, no individuality).
*   **Seductive:** Promises peace through unity.
*   **Battle:** Final choice—accept assimilation or fight for messy individual humanity.
