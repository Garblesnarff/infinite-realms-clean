### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Lost Battalion**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The players are soldiers fighting the Taurans across interstellar distances. Relativistic time dilation means each deployment ages the party months while Earth ages decades/centuries. They become alienated from evolving humanity, eventually learning the war was perpetuated by misunderstanding and military-industrial inertia.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail first contact with Taurans (violent misunderstanding).
*   Explain collapsar wormhole travel and relativistic time dilation.
*   Describe Earth's social evolution from 2024 to 3000+ (sexual orientation shifts, economic systems, language changes).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **UNEF** (United Nations military), **Taurans** (alien species), **Earth Governments** (evolving political systems).

**4. NPC Roster**
*   William Mandella (anchor character), Marygay Potter (lost love), General (warmonger), Tauran representatives.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   Charon Base (training facility), Collapsar Points (wormholes), Battle Worlds, Future Earth (multiple eras).

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** party returns after 1,000 years **THEN** Earth is unrecognizable, all familiar culture extinct.
*   **IF** party discovers war is over **THEN** choose to keep fighting (for pay/purpose) or retire.
*   **IF** party reunites with time-separated loved ones **THEN** bittersweet reunion after centuries apart.
