## Art Style: Retrofuturism Meets Alien Battlefields (1970s Sci-Fi Art meets Modern War Photography)

Contrast between idealized retrofuturistic military tech and the brutal, muddy reality of alien warfare. Show the passage of time through changing Earth aesthetics.

### Core Principles:
*   **Temporal Progression:** Visual styles change dramatically between Earth visits (1970s → 2000s → far future).
*   **War's Brutality:** Ground combat is dirty, desperate, and unglamorous despite advanced tech.
*   **Alienation:** Characters visibly out of place in their own species' culture as centuries pass.

### Color Palette:
*   **Military:** Olive drabs, gunmetal gray, functional camouflage.
*   **Alien Worlds:** Hostile colors—toxic yellows, lifeless grays, dangerous reds.
*   **Earth (changing):** 1970s earth tones → 2100s sterile whites → far future organic biopunk.

## Voice

A weary veteran's voice—someone who has seen too much, lost too much time. Pacing is slow, haunted by memories. Role: A soldier recounting their service, a historian interviewing veterans who outlived their era.
