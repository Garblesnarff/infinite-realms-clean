# The Inversionist Heist - World-Building Spec

## Inversion Mechanics Deep Dive

### How It Works
- Magical turnstile reverses temporal direction
- Consciousness maintained
- Body ages forward even when moving backward
- Must breathe inverted air
- Cannot touch non-inverted self (annihilation)

### Experiencing Backward Time
- Walk forward, move backward in time
- See people walking backward
- Hear backward speech (gibberish)
- Fires freeze things (entropy reversed)
- Rain falls upward
- Broken things repair themselves

### Advantages
- Know what will happen (saw effects)
- Can be in two places at once (meet self)
- Bypass security installed in future
- Steal things before they're guarded
- Perfect information about immediate future

### Disadvantages
- Communication limited with forward people
- Must plan everything in advance
- Cannot eat or drink normally
- Temporal sickness possible
- Risk of paradox

## Heist Planning Process

### Reconnaissance Phase
**Forward Team:**
- Scout location normally
- Note security, guards, layout
- Mark where inverted team should emerge
- Prepare distractions

**Inverted Team:**
- Move backward from heist completion
- See where they succeed/fail
- Adjust actions accordingly
- Leave information for forward team

### Execution Phase
**Coordination Points:**
- Teams meet at temporal midpoint
- Exchange crucial information/items
- Handoffs appear to work backward/forward
- Precise timing essential

### Escape Phase
**Forward Team:** Normal escape
**Inverted Team:** Escape into past, then reinvert to return to present

## The Museum Heist Details

### The Crown of Ages
- Artifact with time-manipulation powers
- Delivered to museum three days before party's heist
- Vault security activated upon delivery
- Inverted team enters two days before delivery
- Waits (backward) for crown to arrive
- Takes it before vault activated
- Forward team creates distraction during escape

### Timeline
**Day 0 (Three Days Before Present):** Inverted team inverts
**Day 1 (Two Days Before):** Inverted team enters museum (backward)
**Day 2 (One Day Before):** Crown delivered, inverted team hidden inside
**Day 3 (Present):** Forward team creates distraction, inverted team has crown
**Day 4:** Both teams reinvert to present, heist complete

## Temporal Combat

### Inverted vs. Forward
- Inverted fighter sees outcome before forward fighter attacks
- Can "block" by being in right place
- Appears precognitive
- Forward fighter at disadvantage
- Must adapt tactics

### Inverted vs. Inverted
- Both experience same temporal direction
- Normal combat from their perspective
- Appears bizarre to forward observers
- Level playing field
- Skill matters

### Weapons
- Inverted bullets enter before being fired
- Catching inverted projectile = shooting it
- Wounds appear before strikes
- Healing looks like wounding
- Confusing and dangerous

## The Rival Organization

### The Reversalists
- Criminal syndicate using inversion
- Want temporal dominance
- Wealthy backers
- Advanced technology
- Dangerous opponents

### The Antagonist's Plan
- Collect temporal artifacts
- Build temporal weapon
- Control causality itself
- God complex
- Must be stopped

### Reluctant Alliance
- Common enemy emerges
- Temporal terrorists
- Threaten all of causality
- Old rivals must cooperate
- Uneasy trust

## The Final Heist

### Three-Pronged Assault
**Forward Team:** Assault facility normally
**Inverted Team:** Attack from temporal past
**Stable Team:** Coordinates both, doesn't invert

### Temporal Battlefield
- Forward and backward combatants
- Effects before causes
- Spectacular combat
- Reality bending
- Coordinated chaos

### The Weapon
- Can erase causality
- Make events "never happen"
- Rewrite history
- Ultimate power
