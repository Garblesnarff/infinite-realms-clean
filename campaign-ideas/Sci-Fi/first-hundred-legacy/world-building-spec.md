### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**First Hundred Legacy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** The players are members of the First Hundred colonists terraforming Mars. They fracture into ideological factions (Reds preserve Mars, Greens transform it, various political movements). Through decades of construction, scientific challenges, and revolution, they decide what civilization Mars becomes and whether Earth's systems corrupt their new world.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail the selection process for the First Hundred and journey to Mars.
*   Explain terraforming science (orbital mirrors, greenhouse gases, ice melting, atmosphere building).
*   Describe Earth's political situation (megacorporations, resource depletion, looking to Mars for expansion).
*   Write about Martian geography (Olympus Mons, Valles Marineris, polar caps, unique geology).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Reds** (preserve pristine Mars), **The Greens** (aggressive terraforming), **Arkady's Anarchists** (Martian independence), **Corporate Interests** (Earth exploitation), **Hiroko's Eco-Mystics** (spiritual Mars colonization).

**4. NPC Roster**
*   **Tier 1:** John Boone (first man on Mars, unifier), Frank Chalmers (politician), Arkady Bogdanov (revolutionary), Hiroko Ai (eco-mystic), Ann Clayborne (Red leader), Sax Russell (Green leader).
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Corporate Manager," "Red Militant," "Green Scientist," "Immigrant Worker."

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Underhill:** First base—cramped, functional, growing into city.
    *   **Olympus Mons:** Site of elevator construction and atmospheric processors.
    *   **Hidden Colony:** Hiroko's secret eco-sanctuary with radical genetic experiments.
    *   **Valles Marineris:** Canyon where first liquid water flows.
    *   **Burroughs:** Corporate-built city representing Earth's colonization.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF** party supports Green terraforming **THEN** Mars becomes habitable faster but Reds grow militant.
    *   **IF** party supports Red preservation **THEN** Mars remains pristine but corporate pressures intensify.
    *   **IF** John Boone is assassinated **THEN** unity fractures, revolution becomes inevitable.
    *   **IF** party leads successful revolution **THEN** Mars gains independence but faces Earth retaliation.
    *   **IF** party achieves Red-Green compromise **THEN** "Middle Way" emerges—selective terraforming preserving key pristine areas.
    *   **IF** party spans 40+ years **THEN** characters evolve, relationships deepen, new generation of Martians emerges with different values.
