# Creative Brief: First Hundred Legacy

## Art Style: Realistic Planetary Science (NASA Photography meets Kim Stanley Robinson's Vision)

Photorealistic depiction of Mars' actual geography with speculative terraforming stages. Scientific accuracy in engineering and ecology combined with the grandeur of planetary transformation.

### Core Principles:
*   **Scientific Realism:** Show actual Martian geography (Olympus Mons, Valles Marineris) and realistic terraforming technology.
*   **Temporal Progression:** Visually show Mars changing from red desert to partially green world across decades.
*   **Scale:** Emphasize the enormity of planetary engineering—tiny human settlements against vast landscapes.

### Color Palette:
*   **Early Mars:** Rusty reds, ochre, dark volcanic rocks, pink sky.
*   **Mid-Terraforming:** Introduction of blues (water), greens (lichen), white (ice caps melting).
*   **Late Mars:** Partial Earth-like colors—blue skies in valleys, green patches, red highlands remaining.

### Character Design:
*   **Colonists:** Practical spacesuits evolving to lighter gear, aging visibly across campaign despite longevity treatments.
*   **Factions:** Visual markers (Red faction wears natural fabrics, Greens wear green accents, Corporate in standardized suits).

### Environments:
*   **Habitats:** Geodesic domes, underground warrens, later open-air settlements in terraformed valleys.
*   **Landscapes:** Accurately depicted Martian features—massive volcanoes, canyon systems, polar ice, dust storms.

## Voice

A thoughtful, scientifically precise voice with slight awe—someone who has witnessed planetary transformation. Pacing is measured and contemplative. Role: A First Hundred member recounting the colonization, a historian of Martian independence.
