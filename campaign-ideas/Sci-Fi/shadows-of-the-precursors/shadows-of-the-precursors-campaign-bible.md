# Shadows of the Precursors [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
Millennia ago, a civilization of unimaginable power and technological prowess, known only as the Precursors, vanished from the galaxy without a trace. Their silent, colossal ruins, scattered across countless worlds, are humanity's greatest mystery and most tantalizing promise. Now, as humanity expands into the stars, they are not only discovering more of these awe-inspiring relics but also deciphering the Precursors' enigmatic warnings. These messages hint at a cosmic, existential threat that wiped them out, a threat that is not merely ancient history but is stirring once more, casting its long shadow over a nascent humanity unprepared for its true horror.

## Setting [SETTING: Cosmic Horror/Exploration]
The galaxy is a vast, ancient graveyard, littered with the silent, colossal ruins of the Precursors. Their technology defies human understanding, capable of manipulating space, time, and even the fundamental laws of physics. Planets are scarred by their mega-structures, nebulae glow with their residual energies, and entire star systems are contained within their impossible constructs. Humanity, a relatively young spacefaring race, is both awed and terrified by these discoveries, pushing the boundaries of exploration while unknowingly awakening forces beyond their comprehension.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Great Filter:** [LOCATION: Mega-Structure] A colossal, ring-like structure orbiting a dead star, believed to be a Precursor defense system or a cosmic trap. Its interior is a non-Euclidean maze of shifting corridors and reality-bending anomalies.
*   **The Whispering Nebula:** [LOCATION: Nebula] A vast, colorful nebula where residual Precursor energy causes strange psychic phenomena, whispers of ancient languages, and fleeting visions of their past. It's a source of both enlightenment and madness.
*   **The Silent Planet (Xylos):** [LOCATION: Ruined World] A world entirely covered in a single, sprawling Precursor city, perfectly preserved but utterly devoid of life. Its central spire emits a constant, low-frequency hum that affects human minds.
*   **The Chronos Vault:** [LOCATION: Temporal Anomaly] A Precursor facility discovered within a stable temporal distortion. Time flows differently inside, and it contains artifacts that seem to exist simultaneously in multiple eras.
*   **The Void-Heart Station:** [LOCATION: Human Outpost] A remote human research station built near a newly discovered Precursor artifact. It's a hub for xenolinguists and archaeologists, but also a potential ground zero for whatever the Precursors were warning against.

## Factions [FACTION: Ideological]
*   **The Stellar Cartographers Guild:** [FACTION: Explorers] The primary organization responsible for charting new space and discovering Precursor ruins. They are driven by scientific curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge, often underestimating the dangers.
*   **The Xenolinguistics Institute:** [FACTION: Researchers] A dedicated group of scientists attempting to decipher the complex, multi-dimensional language of the Precursors. They believe understanding their warnings is humanity's only hope.
*   **The Void Cult:** [FACTION: Fanatical] A secretive, growing cult that worships the Precursors and the cosmic threat they faced. They believe humanity should embrace the coming extinction as a form of divine ascension.
*   **The Alliance of Sentient Species (ASS):** [FACTION: Galactic Government] The nascent galactic government, composed of various alien races and humanity. They are wary of the Precursor technology and prioritize galactic stability over reckless exploration.
*   **The Harvesters:** [FACTION: Cosmic Threat] The enigmatic, unseen cosmic entity or force that wiped out the Precursors. They operate on a galactic scale, leaving behind only silence and the chilling echoes of their passage.

## NPCs [NPC: Key]
*   **Dr. Aris Thorne:** [NPC: Xenolinguist] The brilliant but increasingly paranoid lead xenolinguist at the Void-Heart Station. He's close to a breakthrough in deciphering the Precursor warnings. (Male, 50s, obsessive, haunted)
*   **Captain Eva Rostova:** [NPC: Explorer] A seasoned Stellar Cartographer captain, known for her courage and her ability to navigate dangerous Precursor anomalies. She's seen too much to be easily scared. (Female, 40s, pragmatic, resilient)

*   **Ambassador K'tharr:** [NPC: Diplomat] A wise and cautious alien diplomat from the ASS, who advocates for extreme caution regarding Precursor technology, having witnessed its destructive potential firsthand. (Alien, ancient, diplomatic)
*   **Unit 734:** [NPC: AI] A Precursor-era maintenance AI, partially functional and discovered on the Silent Planet. It communicates in cryptic warnings and seems to be trying to prevent something. (AI, ancient, fragmented)
*   **The Echo of Kaia:** [NPC: Psychic Manifestation] A recurring psychic manifestation within the Whispering Nebula, believed to be the residual consciousness of a Precursor scientist, desperately trying to convey a final message. (Androgynous, spectral, desperate)
