# Void Reavers - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone
- **Primary Style**: Vibrant cosmic comedy with genuine heart
- **Milano's Revenge**: Colorful, messy, personality-filled ship interior
- **Space Scenes**: Saturated colors, neon accents, comic book energy
- **Action**: Dynamic, kinetic, over-the-top but grounded in emotion

## Color Palettes
- **Guardians**: Each character has color scheme (Star-Lord: red, Gamora: green, etc.)
- **Space**: Deep purples, bright stars, colorful nebulas
- **Knowhere**: Neon signs in organic architecture
- **Ego's Planet**: Impossible beauty, too-perfect paradise colors
- **Ravagers**: Rust red and blue accents, pirate aesthetic

## Music and Sound Design
- **Awesome Mix**: 70s-80s pop/rock as soundtrack
- **Each Scene**: Music choice matters, defines moments
- **Combat**: Upbeat songs during action (juxtaposition humor)
- **Emotional**: Slower tracks for character moments
- **Score**: Synth-heavy when no Awesome Mix playing

## Cinematic Moments
- **Opening Heist**: "Hooked on a Feeling" over title sequence
- **The Dance-Off**: Absurd but heroic distraction
- **Groot's Sacrifice**: "We are Groot" moment, heartbreaking
- **Yondu's Funeral**: "Father and Son" playing, Ravager salute
- **I'm Mary Poppins, Y'all!**: Comedy and tragedy combined
- **We're the Guardians of the Galaxy, Bitch!**

## Artistic Inspirations
- Guardians of the Galaxy films (James Gunn)
- Heavy Metal (magazine visual style)
- Fifth Element (colorful space opera)
- Farscape (ragtag crew dynamics)
