# Creative Brief: The Eternal Shores of Tír na nÓg

## Art Style: Celtic Otherworld Enchantment

Inspired by Celtic knotwork, illuminated manuscripts, Irish landscapes, and Art Nouveau fairy art. Beautiful, enchanting, timeless, with intricate patterns and flowing organic forms. Colors: emerald green, gold, silver, twilight purples, the deep blue of Celtic seas.

### Core Principles:

*   **Timeless Beauty:** Everything is perfect, preserved, without age or decay. Unsettlingly beautiful.
*   **Knotwork Complexity:** Celtic patterns, interlacing designs, showing interconnection and entrapment.
*   **Fae Otherness:** Beautiful but alien. The fae are perfect but not quite human in expression or morality.

## Voice

Lyrical and bardic, like an Irish storyteller weaving tales. Musical cadence, poetic language, uses Irish Gaelic terms. Emotional range from enchanting wonder to sorrowful warning. The voice carries ages of storytelling tradition.

## Music Direction

Traditional Irish instruments: harp, fiddle, tin whistle, bodhrán. Haunting melodies that are beautiful but somehow sad. Songs that make you want to dance forever. The Dagda's harp controls emotions musically. Reference: Enya, Clannad, traditional Irish folk, "The Secret of Kells" soundtrack.

## Sound Design

Waves on blessed shores, wind through eternal orchards, crystal palace bells, harp strings, footsteps on soft grass, feasting and celebration, the mist swirling, time moving differently (audio distortion), birds that never stop singing.
