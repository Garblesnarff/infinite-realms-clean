# Threads of Fate - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Dark, moody, atmospheric. Sepia Past, muted Present, apocalyptic Future. Multiple eras visible simultaneously as ghostly overlays.

## Colors
- **Past:** Sepia and warm browns, candlelit
- **Present:** Natural but slightly desaturated
- **Future:** Cold blues and grays, nuclear winter
- **Cave:** Swirling all three palettes, reality blur

## Music
**Main Theme:** Haunting strings with music box, circular melody that loops, never fully resolves

**Era Themes:**
- **Past:** Period instruments, folk music
- **Present:** Modern orchestra
- **Future:** Distorted electronics
- **All Together:** Discordant harmony

**The Stranger's Theme:** Same melody in all eras, different instruments

## Voice Direction
**Family Members:** Similar voices across eras, genetic echo

**The Stranger:** Tired, ancient, seen too much

**Claudia:** Different ages in different eras, same core desperation

## Cinematic Moments

- **Timeline Overlap:** Three eras visible simultaneously
- **Family Revelation:** Genealogy tree illuminating connections
- **The Knot Visual:** Threads of fate tangling, tightening
- **Breaking/Accepting Cycle:** Cathartic conclusion
