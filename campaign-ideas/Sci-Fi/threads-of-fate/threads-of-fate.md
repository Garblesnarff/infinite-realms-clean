# Threads of Fate
**Tagline:** *"Everything is connected. Every when is now. The knot tightens."*

## Campaign Overview

In the town of Ravenmoor, three timelines exist simultaneously, layered on top of each other like sediment—Past (200 years ago), Present, and Future (200 years hence). The party discovers they can perceive and eventually travel between these layers, experiencing the same location across different eras. A mystery spans all three: a family curse, a town secret, and a catastrophe that connects past, present, and future in an inescapable causal knot.

The campaign is structured around revealing how events in each era affect the others, with the same families, locations, and conflicts appearing in different forms across time. The party must untangle the temporal knot by solving mysteries in all three eras simultaneously, discovering that their own actions create the very problems they're trying to solve—bootstrap paradoxes on a massive scale.

Inspired by Dark's complex intergenerational narrative, this campaign features a smaller scope than world-spanning adventures, focusing on one town and its inhabitants across 400 years, with deeply interconnected mysteries and the haunting realization that time is a closed loop.

## Core Themes

- **Cyclical Time**: History repeats, literally
- **Family Sins**: Generational curses and legacies
- **Interconnectedness**: Everything affects everything
- **Determinism**: Can fate be escaped or is it written?
