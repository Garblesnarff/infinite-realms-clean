# World-Building Specification: Voyage Through the Veins

## The Microscopic Universe: Scale and Physics

### Size Comparisons
- **Party members (miniaturized):** 2-5 micrometers (roughly the size of a small bacterium)
- **Red blood cells:** 6-8 micrometers diameter (larger than the party)
- **White blood cells:** 10-30 micrometers (much larger than party, some are giants)
- **Bacteria:** 0.5-5 micrometers (equal to or smaller than party)
- **Viruses:** 20-300 nanometers (tiny even to miniaturized party)
- **Antibody proteins:** 10 nanometers (visible but small)
- **Blood vessel diameters:** Capillaries 5-10 micrometers, arteries up to 25mm at normal scale (massive canyons at micro scale)

### Environmental Physics

**Blood Flow Dynamics**
- Velocity in arteries: 30-40 cm/second (feels like powerful rapids)
- Velocity in capillaries: 0.03 cm/second (gentle drift)
- Heart pressure waves create "tidal surges" that can sweep party away
- Laminar flow in healthy vessels, turbulent near damage or plague sites
- Swimming against flow requires DC 15 Athletics, with flow grants +10 movement

**Surface Tension**
- At micro scale, surface tension is incredibly powerful
- Crossing air-liquid boundaries requires special techniques
- Water "skin" is like rubber membrane
- Used in lung alveoli encounters—party can walk on air-water interface

**Brownian Motion**
- Random molecular collisions create environmental "tremors"
- Small objects (viruses, proteins) jitter and vibrate constantly
- Can be beneficial (harder to target small enemies) or problematic (precision tasks are difficult)
- DC varies: DC 10 for simple tasks, DC 20 for precision work in high-motion areas

**Temperature**
- Body temperature is constant 37°C (98.6°F) in healthy areas
- Fever zones (infection sites): 39-40°C, causes environmental heat damage
- Hypothermia zones (if Chancellor is externally cooled): slowed movement, lethargy
- Hypothalamus damage causes wild temperature fluctuations

**Osmotic Pressure**
- Moving between different concentration areas requires adaptation
- High salt areas (kidneys, if visited): dehydrating effect
- Low oxygen zones: suffocation mechanics
- pH changes: stomach acid (if ingested items bring it) is extremely dangerous

## The Leukocyte Collective: Immune System Society

### Social Structure

**The Three Castes**
1. **Neutrophils (Warrior Caste):** 60-70% of population, frontline defenders
2. **Lymphocytes (Mystic Caste):** 20-30%, specialized in recognizing threats and "magical" immunity
3. **Monocytes/Macrophages (Guardian Caste):** 5-10%, largest cells, leaders and protectors

### Government
- **The Lymph Council:** Ruling body of elder lymphocytes who coordinate immune response
- **Regional Commanders:** Macrophage leaders controlling specific organs
- **Emergency Powers:** During infection, military commanders (like Phagos) gain authority
- **Democracy of Survival:** All castes have voice, but decisions prioritize body's survival

### Culture and Beliefs
- **The Sacred Mission:** Protecting the Body (capital B) is religious duty
- **The Great Circulation:** Belief that traveling the bloodstream is pilgrimage
- **Recognition Rituals:** Cells identify self vs. non-self through molecular markers; party must obtain "recognition tags"
- **Memory Cells:** Some lymphocytes are ancient and hold "memories" of past infections
- **Martyrdom:** Cells routinely sacrifice themselves to stop infection—seen as highest honor

### Military Organization
- **Patrol Routes:** Established circuits through bloodstream
- **Outpost System:** Major junctions, organ entrances have fortified positions
- **Alert Levels:** Green (normal), Yellow (suspicious activity), Red (active infection), Black (body-wide crisis)
- **Tactics:** Engulfment (phagocytosis), chemical warfare (enzymes), swarming

### Language and Communication
- **Chemical Signals:** Primary communication method—cytokines are like messenger spells
- **Physical Contact:** Direct touch allows complex information transfer
- **Emotional Projection:** Bioluminescent patterns show mood and intent
- **Trade Language:** Simplified chemical signals that party's equipment can translate

### Relations with Other Cell Types
- **Red Blood Cells:** Seen as lesser beings (no nucleus/consciousness), but respected for their service
- **Platelets:** Emergency workers, activated during crisis
- **Endothelial Cells:** Border guards controlling access to tissues
- **Organ-Specific Cells:** Each organ's cells have different relationships with immune system

## The Plague Collective: The Enemy

### Origin and Nature
- **Created by:** Lord Dravus hired a cabal of dark biomancers
- **Composition:** Hybrid of bacteria, viruses, corrupted cells, and magical constructs
- **Goal:** Kill Chancellor Morvane by destabilizing his body's systems
- **Intelligence:** Hive mind with individual agents having tactical awareness

### Hierarchy

**Master Plague (Apex Entity)**
- Location: Hypothalamus
- Form: Massive biomechanical construct fused with magical artifact
- Power: Controls all plague entities, manipulates body systems
- Weakness: Depends on artifact for power; destroying it kills the Master

**Plague Architects (Commanders)**
- Form: Humanoid assemblages of viral particles and corrupted cells
- Role: Direct regional infections, command lesser plague entities
- Abilities: Shape-shifting, rapid adaptation, creation of new plague forms
- Personality: Each has distinct character—cruel intelligence, fanatical belief in "evolution through infection"

**Corrupted Leukocytes (Traitor Cells)**
- Origin: White blood cells converted through magical corruption
- Role: Sabotage immune response, provide intelligence to plague
- Identification: Dark coloration, erratic bioluminescence, aggressive behavior
- Tragedy: Some retain fragments of original personality

**Bacterial Legions (Foot Soldiers)**
- Types: Various bacterial species each with different abilities
  - *Streptococcus chains:* Chain-linked formations, hard to break
  - *Staphylococcus clusters:* Swarm tactics

- **Adaptation:** Learning from defeats, evolving resistances

## Organ Systems as Regions

### Cardiovascular System (Main Highway)
**Arterial Network**
- High-pressure, fast-flowing, oxygen-rich
- Major trade routes for nutrient and oxygen delivery
- Leukocyte patrol highways
- Clean, efficient, well-maintained in healthy sections

**Venous Network**
- Low-pressure, slow-flowing, oxygen-poor
- Return routes carrying waste products
- Less patrolled, more dangerous
- Darker, blue-tinted environment

**Capillary Beds**
- Narrow passages where exchange occurs
- Single-file travel required in smallest capillaries
- High surface tension effects
- Frontier regions, less civilized

**The Heart (Central Hub)**
- Four chambers: right atrium/ventricle (deoxygenated), left atrium/ventricle (oxygenated)
- Valvular gates: tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic
- Cardiac Guard headquarters
- Constant rhythmic pressure changes
- Most heavily defended region

### Respiratory System (The Air Exchange)

**Alveoli**
- 300 million tiny air sacs
- Oxygen-rich, bright environment
- Pneumocyte trading settlements
- Surfactant "lubricant" that reduces surface tension
- Capillary networks visible through thin walls

**Gas Exchange Mechanics**
- Oxygen molecules cross alveolar membrane
- Carbon dioxide expelled
- Party can witness respiration at molecular level
- Environmental bonuses in high-oxygen areas

### Hepatic System (The Great Filter)
**Liver Lobules**
- Hexagonal processing units
- Blood flows from periphery to center
- Kupffer cell guardians patrol
- Detoxification chambers

**Hepatic Portal System**
- Blood from digestive system brings nutrients
- Also brings toxins that must be filtered
- Plague exploits this as invasion route

**Bile Ducts**
- Dangerous escape routes
- Digestive enzyme hazards
- Lead to gallbladder and intestines
- Emergency evacuation option

### Nervous System (The Control Network)
**Blood-Brain Barrier**

## Timeline and Temporal Mechanics

### The 72-Hour Countdown
- Real-time: 72 hours from injection to mandatory extraction
- Game time: Roughly 24-25 sessions if each session = 3 hours of in-game time
- Tracking: Visible timer maintained by DM
- Consequences:
  - Hour 0-24: Miniaturization stable
  - Hour 24-48: Minor fluctuations, occasional dizzy spells
  - Hour 48-60: Increasing instability, random growth spurts (dangerous)
  - Hour 60-72: Critical instability, must extract immediately
  - Hour 72+: Uncontrolled expansion = death

### Body Time vs. Outside Time
- Cellular processes seem slow at this scale
- Neural firing feels instantaneous
- Heartbeats are regular checkpoints (72 BPM = one beat per 0.83 seconds)
- Immune responses can be seen developing in "real-time"

### Infection Progression
- Plague spreads according to its own timeline
- Party's actions slow but don't stop progression until Master destroyed
- Critical systems targeted in specific order: liver → lungs → heart → brain
- Timeline creates urgency—must reach brain before it's too late

## External World Integration

### Dr. Thinblood's Laboratory
- Located in Chancellor's sickroom
- Full medical team monitoring vital signs
- Psychic link maintained through magical apparatus
- Can provide limited assistance (information, guidance)
- Vulnerable to traitor's sabotage

### Lord Dravus's Interference
- External attacks manifest as internal disasters:
  - Physical strikes = earthquakes/tremors
  - Poison attempts = toxin floods
  - Magical attacks = reality distortions
  - Cold exposure = hypothermia zones
  - Suffocation attempts = oxygen deprivation
- Party must survive these "natural disasters"
- Creates environmental challenges mid-mission

### Political Consequences
- Chancellor's condition affects external politics
- Nobles positioning for succession
- Dravus manipulating events
- Party's success or failure determines realm's fate
- Evidence gathered inside can prove conspiracy outside
