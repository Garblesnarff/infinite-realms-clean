        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "This house feels warmer since Tohru arrived—like it's finally a home." "Shigure chose this isolated location intentionally as a safe space for cursed members." "The garden Tohru tends is thriving unlike anything the house had before."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (warm wood, lived-in comfort, Tohru's cleaning, seasonal garden), Sound (cooking, laughter, arguments, comfortable silence), Smell (home-cooked meals, tatami, garden flowers).

    *   **The Cat's Prison:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** A dark, isolated building with a single cell, bars on windows, chains and restraints, a small window showing the sky.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Previous Cats who died there (spirits/memories), destined for Kyo.

"This building represents the cruelest aspect of the curse—punishment for a crime committed by someone else long ago."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (darkness, bars, restraints, a single patch of sky visible), Sound (emptiness, wind, ghosts of past suffering), Smell (decay, isolation, despair).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Tohru successfully helps a zodiac member confront and process their specific trauma.
    *   **THEN:** That character's "Bond to God" weakens while their "Bond to Others" strengthens. They begin resisting Akito's summons. The curse loosens slightly for them. They express gratitude and growing affection for Tohru.
    *   **IF:** A zodiac member is embraced by the opposite sex or stressed enough to transform.
    *   **THEN:** They transform in a puff of smoke, clothes falling away, appearing as their animal form. This creates vulnerability, comedy, or drama depending on context. Outsiders must have memories erased unless accepted by Akito.
    *   **IF:** Kyo reveals his true monstrous form to Tohru.
    *   **THEN:** This is the ultimate test. Tohru's acceptance or rejection determines whether his healing is possible. If she accepts him, it's a breakthrough moment. Her love is genuine, not conditional.
    *   **IF:** Multiple zodiac members have healed sufficiently and assert their desire for freedom.
    *   **THEN:** The curse begins to destabilize. Akito feels this and may react violently or with despair. The God's bond is weakening. Akito must choose between control and genuine connection.
    *   **IF:** Tohru confronts Akito with understanding and compassion rather than judgment.
    *   **THEN:** Akito, expecting hatred, is disarmed. Begin Akito's own healing arc. Reveal that Akito is also a victim of the curse, raised in cruelty and fear.
    *   **IF:** The zodiac members and Akito mutually agree to break the curse, choosing genuine bonds over the forced connection.
    *   **THEN:** The curse shatters. Each zodiac member experiences their curse breaking individually—a moment of freedom mixed with unexpected sadness at losing the God's bond. They no longer transform. The God spirit leaves Akito, who becomes fully human. Generate individual epilogues showing each character's future, free but still choosing to be family.
