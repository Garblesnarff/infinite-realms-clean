### Core Premise
The Soma family bears an ancient curse: twelve members are possessed by the spirits of the zodiac animals, transforming into their animal form when embraced by someone of the opposite sex, or when under extreme stress. The family is controlled by their cruel patriarch, Akito, who uses the curse to keep them isolated and dependent. Enter Tohru Honda, a kind-hearted human cleric who lost her mother and now lives alone in a tent. When she accidentally discovers the Soma family secret, instead of rejection, she offers them unconditional acceptance. Through her gentle kindness and determination to break the curse, she helps each cursed family member confront their trauma, learn to love themselves, and ultimately find freedom—while falling in love with Kyo, the cursed Cat spirit rejected by the zodiac.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Discovery and Acceptance (Sessions 1-5)**
- Tohru loses her home and is taken in by Shigure (Dog), Yuki (Rat), and Kyo (Cat). She accidentally discovers their curse when she hugs them and they transform. Instead of fleeing, she accepts them completely. Akito summons her and tests her, ultimately allowing her to stay. She begins meeting other zodiac members, each with their own trauma and secrets. Her presence starts to shake the family's toxic dynamics.

**Act 2: Healing the Zodiac (Sessions 6-14)**
- Each session focuses on one or two zodiac members, exploring their trauma, the specific way the curse has wounded them, and how Tohru's kindness helps them heal. She helps Momiji (Rabbit) accept his mother's rejection, Hatori (Dragon) move past his lost love, Kisa (Tiger) find her voice, Hiro (Ram) accept vulnerability, Ritsu (Monkey) overcome self-loathing, Ayame (Snake) reconnect with his brother, and more. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Kyo, whose curse is the most severe—the Cat is hated and will be imprisoned for life when he comes of age.

**Act 3: Breaking the Curse (Sessions 15-20)**
- Tohru discovers the truth about the curse's origin and the God who binds the zodiac. She learns that Akito is also cursed, possessed by the God spirit itself, which explains their cruelty and control. A crisis emerges: Kyo's time is running out. Tohru must choose between accepting his fate or fighting to break the curse. She confronts Akito, offering understanding even to the God. Through genuine love and acceptance of all the zodiac members—and Akito's own realization that their bond has become a prison—the curse begins to break. In the climax, Tohru's love for Kyo and the zodiac members' own growth in self-love shatter the ancient curse. The family is freed, but the bonds of genuine friendship remain.

### Major NPCs

- **Yuki Soma, the Rat Prince**: The Rat spirit, perfect and popular but deeply insecure. **Role**: Secondary Love Interest / Brother Figure. **Personality**: Elegant, kind, but emotionally closed off from years of abuse. **Flaw/Secret**: Akito's control and abuse left him unable to form genuine connections until Tohru.

- **Akito Soma, the God**: The head of the family, possessed by the God spirit. **Role**: Antagonist / Victim. **Personality**: Cruel, possessive, violently protective of the curse bond. **Flaw/Secret**: Is actually female raised as male; fears abandonment above all; is a victim of the curse as much as anyone.
- **Tohru Honda, the Heart**: A human cleric of extraordinary kindness. **Role**: Protagonist / Catalyst. **Personality**: Selfless, optimistic, endlessly kind, sometimes to her own detriment. **Flaw/Secret**: Uses her mother's memory as a shield against processing grief; fears being abandoned.

### Key Locations

- **Shigure's House**: A traditional Japanese-style home in the woods where Tohru lives with Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo. Warm and becoming a real home.
- **The Soma Estate**: A massive compound housing the main family. Opulent but cold, filled with secrets and trauma.
- **The Cat's Prison**: A dark, isolated building where Cats are imprisoned for life. A haunting reminder of Kyo's fate.
- **Various Zodiac Homes**: Each member has their own space reflecting their personality and pain.
- **The School**: Where normal life happens, contrasting with the supernatural curse.

### Central Conflict
The struggle between the curse's binding "love" (possession and control) versus genuine love (acceptance and freedom). Each zodiac member must choose whether to remain bound by fear and obligation or risk rejection to find real connection. It's about healing generational trauma through compassion.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Transformation Triggers**: When zodiac members are embraced by the opposite sex, hugged by outsiders, or under extreme stress, they transform into their animal form in a puff of smoke. Clothes don't transform with them. This creates both comedic and dramatic moments.
- **The Bond Mechanic**: Each zodiac member has a "Bond to the God" meter and a "Bond to Tohru/Others" meter. As genuine relationships grow, the curse weakens. Track this secretly.
- **Healing Arcs**: Each zodiac member has a specific trauma and a healing quest. Successful completion raises their self-love and weakens the curse. These are primarily roleplay and social challenges, not combat.
- **Akito's Control**: Akito can summon any zodiac member and they feel compelled to obey. This creates tension between their growing autonomy and the curse's pull.
- **True Form Revelation**: Kyo's monstrous true form represents his complete self-loathing. Tohru's acceptance of it is the key to breaking his personal curse.
- **The Curse Breaking**: In the final arc, when enough zodiac members have healed and Akito accepts letting go, run individual scenes of each character's curse breaking—shown by them no longer transforming when embraced, feeling the God's bond disappear, and experiencing profound freedom mixed with unexpected sadness at losing that connection.
