# The Blood Circuit
**Tagline:** *Champions chosen. Sponsors watching. Only legends survive.*

## Campaign Overview

Welcome to the Blood Circuit—a corporate-sponsored battle royale where teams of three "Legends" compete for glory, fortune, and the adoration of millions. Set in a futuristic fantasy world where massive megacorporations control everything, the Circuit is the ultimate entertainment spectacle. Twenty teams (60 Legends total) drop onto various arenas with unique abilities, high-tech weapons, and experimental magic-tech gear, all while millions watch via magical broadcasts.

Each Legend has a unique backstory, special abilities, and corporate sponsorship. The Circuit isn't just about killing—it's about style, strategy, teamwork, and building your personal brand. Winners become celebrities, losers become forgotten. Between matches, Legends navigate corporate politics, upgrade their abilities, negotiate contracts, and deal with the psychological toll of constant combat.

But beneath the spectacle lies a darker truth: Legends are assets, not people. Corporations manipulate outcomes, rig matches, and eliminate troublesome champions. As players rise through the ranks, they'll uncover corporate conspiracies, illegal experiments, and the true cost of fame.
