Deep beneath the mountains lies Karak-Thun, the greatest dwarven kingdom ever carved from stone. For three thousand years, the Hollow Throne has stood empty, its rightful heir lost to legend. When the party discovers an ancient heir with legitimate claim to the throne, they're thrust into a brutal civil war between seven noble houses, each with their own vision for the kingdom's future. As ancient tunnels collapse, resources dwindle, and something stirs in the deepest mines, the party must navigate deadly politics, choose sides, and decide whether the kingdom should be united under one crown or allowed to fracture into warring city-states.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

* **Encounters:** Combat is frequent but tactical. Dwarven warriors are elite, disciplined fighters who use the terrain to their advantage. Expect tunnel warfare, siege battles, and assassination attempts.
* **Political Complexity:** The seven noble houses have complex relationships, shifting alliances, and hidden agendas. Every decision has political consequences.
* **Resource Management:** The kingdom is running out of food, water, and air. Managing these resources becomes crucial to success.

The central conflict is a multi-layered power struggle:
* **Political:** Seven houses fighting for control of the throne and kingdom
* **Personal:** The heir struggling with their identity and the weight of destiny
* **Survival:** The kingdom running out of resources as tunnels collapse
* **Existential:** An ancient evil awakening that threatens to destroy everything

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **House Loyalty System**

* The party earns loyalty points with each of the seven houses through their actions.
* High loyalty grants access to house resources, soldiers, and special abilities.
* Low loyalty results in assassination attempts, trade embargoes, and political sabotage.

### 2. **The Crushing Dark**

* Extended time in deep tunnels requires Constitution saves against claustrophobia and paranoia.
* Light sources are precious—running out of light can lead to panic and madness.
* The deeper the party goes, the higher the DC for these saves.

### 3. **Resource Scarcity**

* Food, water, and breathable air are limited resources tracked at the faction level.
* The party must secure supply lines, protect farms, and manage rationing.
* Resource shortages lead to riots, desertion, and weakened defenses.

### 4. **Tunnel Warfare**

* Combat in tight spaces uses special rules for formations, chokepoints, and cave-ins.
* Characters can use engineering to collapse tunnels, flood chambers, or redirect magma.
* Siege equipment is scaled for underground warfare.

### 5. **Whispers from the Deep**

* As the campaign progresses, characters hear whispers offering power and knowledge.
* Accepting the whispers grants dark powers but advances corruption.
* Corruption leads to physical and mental transformations.

### 6. **Political Influence**

* The party's reputation affects their ability to sway houses and the Hollow Court.
* Major decisions are made through political maneuvering, not just combat.
* Alliances are temporary, and betrayal is always a risk.
