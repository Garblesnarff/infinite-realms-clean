# Creative Brief: The Hollow Throne

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Dwarven Architecture meets Political Drama

Inspired by the monumental dwarven halls of Moria (Lord of the Rings), the dark political intrigue of Game of Thrones, and the oppressive underground atmosphere of Dwarf Fortress. This style aims to capture the grandeur and claustrophobia of an ancient underground kingdom torn apart by civil war, emphasizing massive stone architecture, dim firelight, and the weight of tradition.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

* **Emphasize Scale and Grandeur:** Massive pillars, enormous halls carved from solid rock, architecture that dwarfs humanoid figures.
* **Contrast Light and Shadow:** Limited light sources (forges, torches, lava flows) create dramatic shadows and emphasize the surrounding darkness.
* **Show Decay and Age:** Three thousand years of history visible in worn stone, ancient carvings, crumbling support pillars.
* **Political Symbolism:** House banners, heraldic symbols, the empty throne as a focal point.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
* **Keywords:** Gothic, monumental, claustrophobic, ancient, political, honor-bound, oppressive, dark, majestic, war-torn.
* **Feeling:** The weight of three thousand years of history pressing down. The sense of being miles below the surface with countless tons of stone overhead. Political tension you can cut with a knife. The paradox of magnificent architecture and desperate resource scarcity.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
* **Style:** Strong, heavy lines emphasizing the permanence and weight of stone architecture. Geometric precision in dwarven construction contrasted with organic cave formations. Deep shadows and dramatic angles.
* **Textures:** Rough-hewn stone, polished marble, beaten metal, worn tapestries. Everything shows age and use.
* **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed digital painting of a massive dwarven hall, carved from solid granite with geometric precision. Heavy stone pillars support a vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. Intricate geometric patterns and runic inscriptions cover every surface."

**3. Color Palette:**
* **Style:** Dominated by grays, blacks, and earth tones—granite gray, obsidian black, rust red, tarnished copper, aged bronze. Warmth comes only from forge fire (orange-red), lava flows (deep red-orange), and torchlight (amber-yellow).
* **Lighting Influence:** Dramatically limited. Most scenes lit by fire, with deep shadows everywhere. Occasional magical light (cold blue-white) in sacred spaces.
* **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of granite gray and obsidian black, dramatically illuminated by the warm orange glow of forge fires and the deep red of distant lava flows. Deep shadows dominate the scene."

**4. Character Design:**
* **Style:** Dwarves are stocky, heavily muscled, with elaborate braided beards decorated with clan rings and house symbols. Armor is heavy, practical, showing signs of battle. Each house has distinctive visual markers.
* **House Ironforge:** Heavy plate armor, iron gray and steel blue colors, angular designs.
* **House Blackstone:** Volcanic rock incorporated into armor, dark blacks and deep reds, brutal aesthetics.
* **House Goldvein:** More ornate decoration, gold and silver filigree, signs of faded wealth.
* **Prompt Example:** "A dwarven warrior in heavy plate armor of iron gray, with an elaborately braided beard woven with iron rings bearing house symbols. Battle-scarred but maintained armor, carrying a massive warhammer. Lit by torchlight against stone walls."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
* **Style:** Massive underground halls, tunnels of varying scales, forge complexes with rivers of lava, throne rooms with towering ceilings, cramped residential warrens, collapsed sections showing instability.
* **Atmosphere:** The air should feel thick, warm near forges, cool in distant chambers. Ever-present sense of weight from above.
* **Details:** Ancient dwarven runes everywhere, house banners hanging from pillars, the Hollow Throne as an ever-present empty symbol, signs of civil war—damage, barricades, refugee camps.
* **Prompt Example:** "A vast underground throne hall carved from a single piece of black granite. Massive pillars march into darkness. At the center, an enormous empty throne of polished obsidian, untouched by dust. Tattered banners of seven noble houses hang from the pillars. Lit by braziers casting long shadows."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
* **Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro—stark contrasts between illuminated areas and deep shadow. Multiple small light sources (torches, forge fires) rather than ambient light.
* **Shadows:** Long, dramatic shadows that emphasize the underground setting. Shadows hide dangers and create paranoia.
* **Purpose:** Lighting reinforces claustrophobia and the limited nature of resources. The darkness is always threatening to swallow everything.
* **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by forge fires casting long shadows on carved stone walls. Most of the scene is in deep shadow, with only key elements illuminated by warm orange firelight. The sense of vast darkness just beyond the light."

**7. Composition:**
* **Style:** Often uses low angles looking up at massive architecture to emphasize scale and the weight bearing down. Wide shots showing the grandeur of halls contrasted with tiny figures. Close shots in cramped tunnels emphasizing claustrophobia.
* **Techniques:** Use vertical lines to emphasize the crushing weight from above. Frame important elements (the throne, house leaders) in doorways or at the end of halls. Show depth through multiple layers of pillars receding into darkness.
* **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot looking up at a massive dwarven lord seated on a stone throne, towering pillars rising behind him into shadow. The viewer feels small, looking up from below. Dramatic lighting from braziers on either side."

**8. Political Symbolism:**
* **Style:** Heavy use of heraldry, house colors, symbolic objects. The empty throne is the central symbol. Scenes should show factional divisions through color, banner placement, and spatial positioning.
* **Prompt Example:** "The Hollow Court in session—representatives from seven houses arranged in a circular chamber, each section decorated in their house colors. The empty black throne at the center. Tension visible in their positions and postures. Lit by a ring of torches."

## Music Direction

**Overall Tone:** Epic, somber, tense. Heavy use of percussion (war drums, hammer on anvil), low brass, male chorus for dwarven themes. Strings for political intrigue.

**House Ironforge Theme:** Martial, disciplined, heavy percussion. Military drums and horn calls.

**House Blackstone Theme:** Brutal, rhythmic, volcanic. Deep drums, grinding sounds, raw power.

**The Heir's Theme:** Idealistic, soaring, but uncertain. Strings and woodwinds, hints of surface-world melodies.

**The Deep Threat:** Dissonant, disturbing, barely musical. Low drones, reversed sounds, whispers, unsettling rhythms.

**Battle Music:** Epic orchestral with heavy percussion. Sounds of combat—metal on metal, stone cracking.

**Political Intrigue:** Tense strings, quiet but menacing. Harpsichord or similar plucked instruments for scheming.

**The Hollow Throne Motif:** A single, empty chord that resolves only when the throne is filled. Used as a recurring theme.
