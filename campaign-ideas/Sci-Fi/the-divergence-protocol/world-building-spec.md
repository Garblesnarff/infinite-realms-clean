### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Divergence Protocol**

**1. Core Concept:** Party discovers time-messaging device and uses it to prevent a friend's death, triggering butterfly effect into dystopia. Trapped in time loops, they must find the perfect sequence to reach Steins Gate—the timeline where everyone survives.

**2. Lore Primer:** Time travel works through sending memories/messages backward, creates parallel worldlines not overwriting but branching, divergence numbers measure distance from original timeline, SERN secretly developing time travel monopoly, temporal attractors (fixed points) resist change, Reading Steiner effect lets some remember timeline changes.

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Party:** Time loopers trying to save everyone.
*   **SERN:** Secret organization monopolizing time travel.
*   **The Doomed:** Those fate seems to demand die.
*   **Regular Society:** Unaware, memories change with timelines.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Doomed Friend, Timekeeper, SERN Agent, Broken Time Traveler, The Constant.
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Timeline Variant" (same person, different timeline), "SERN Operative," "Temporal Casualty."

**5. Locations:** Laboratory/base, SERN facility, the friend's death site (varies by timeline), normal city that changes each loop, the temporal origin point.

**6. Triggers:**
*   **IF send time message:** Timeline shifts; divergence changes; butterfly effects cascade.
*   **IF doomed friend survives:** Creates path to dystopia unless other changes made.
*   **IF party member dies during loop:** Only they know; isolating and traumatic.
*   **IF madness reaches critical:** May lose ability to function; forget which timeline is real.
*   **IF perfect sequence achieved:** Steins Gate reached; everyone survives.
