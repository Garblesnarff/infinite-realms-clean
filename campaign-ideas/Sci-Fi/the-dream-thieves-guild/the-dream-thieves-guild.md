# The Dream Thieves Guild

*A Heist / Psychic campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Dream Thieves Guild
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Heist / Psychic / Mind-Heist
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** layered-realities, mind-bending, time-distortion, psychological, heist-thriller, surreal
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party are members of the Dream Thieves Guild—psychic operatives who use shared-dreaming magic to enter targets' minds and extract information, plant false memories, or manipulate thoughts. When a powerful noble hires them to perform "inception"—planting an idea so deep the target believes it originated from themselves—the party must construct multiple layers of nested dreams, each with its own reality and time flow. But as they go deeper, the line between dream and reality blurs, their own memories become suspect, and they discover the true target might be one of them.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Reality Confusion:** Tracking which layer of dream the party is in requires careful attention. Death in deep dreams can trap consciousness.
*   **Time Dilation:** Time flows differently in each dream layer (5 minutes = 1 hour = 1 day = 1 week), creating complex coordination challenges.
*   **Mental Defenses:** Targets have trained defenders called Extractors who hunt the party through their own subconscious.
*   **Psychological Stakes:** Characters must confront their own regrets, fears, and secrets as dream-layers draw on their subconscious.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act arc that descends through layers of reality and psychological complexity.

*   **Act I — The Job (Sessions 1–4):** The party is hired to perform inception on a business rival, making him dismantle his own company. They must recruit specialists, plan the layers, and begin the dive. The first layers go smoothly, but anomalies suggest something is wrong.
*   **Act II — Going Deeper (Sessions 5–8):** As they descend through nested dreams, the party encounters increasingly dangerous mental defenses and personal manifestations from their own subconscious. They discover their employer has a hidden agenda, and one party member may be a planted agent.
*   **Act III — The Kick (Sessions 9–12):** Trapped in the deepest layer—Limbo, where time flows so slowly that minutes are decades—the party must complete their mission, survive their own mental projections, and execute a perfectly synchronized "kick" to wake up through all layers. But first, they must determine what reality even is.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "The Architect"

*   **Focus:** Setup / World-Building
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Hook: The party receives the offer—inception for an unprecedented payday.
    *   The Rules: Exposition on shared-dreaming magic, layers, time dilation, and the dangers of going too deep.
    *   Team Assembly: They recruit specialists—The Architect (dream designer), The Forger (identity mimicry), The Chemist (sleep magic specialist).

**Escalation:** Their employer reveals the target has the most sophisticated mental defenses in the industry. This job is considered impossible.

### Session 2 — "Dream Within Dream"

*   **Focus:** Planning / Tutorial
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Plan: Design a three-layer dream structure. Each layer has a specific purpose.
    *   The Architect's Paradox: Build impossible spaces and test them in practice runs.
    *   Character Totems: Each character creates a "totem"—a personal object that behaves differently in dreams versus reality.

**Escalation:** During a test run, they encounter projections of their own subconscious that become hostile—a preview of deeper dangers.

### Session 3 — "Layer One: The Kidnapping"

*   **Focus:** Heist / Action
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Entry: The party sedates the target and enters his dream—a bustling city that's his normal daily life.
    *   The Ruse: Stage a kidnapping to take him deeper. His subconscious manifests as hostile crowds.
    *   Combat in Dreams: Introduce dream-combat rules where imagination and will matter more than weapons.

**Escalation:** The target's mental defenses are more extensive than expected. An Extractor—a trained dream-defender—begins hunting them.

### Session 4 — "Layer Two: The Hotel"

*   **Focus:** Stealth / Zero-Gravity Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Deeper: Layer two is a luxury hotel. Time moves 20x slower than layer one.
    *   The Chase: A spectacular fight through a hotel with shifting gravity as layer one experiences turbulence.
    *   The Forger's Art: One party member impersonates someone from the target's past to lower his defenses.

**Escalation:** Something goes wrong. The target's subconscious is more militarized than expected—he's been trained against extraction.

### Session 5 — "Layer Three: The Fortress"

*   **Focus:** Assault / Revelation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Mountain: Layer three is a snow fortress representing the target's deepest mental stronghold.
    *   The Secret: They discover the target was also a dream thief once. His mind has layers upon layers of defense.
    *   The Planted Idea: They finally execute the inception—but it feels too easy.

**Escalation:** The party member who stayed in layer two to coordinate doesn't respond. They're cut off from the upper levels.

### Session 6 — "Lost in Limbo"

*   **Focus:** Survival / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Too Deep: Someone went too deep into Limbo—the raw subconscious where time barely moves and reality dissolves.
    *   The Search: The party must dive deeper to rescue them, entering their own personal subconscious.
    *   Confronting Memory: Each character faces a manifestation of their deepest regret.

**Escalation:** In Limbo, they discover a city that shouldn't exist—someone's been building here for subjective centuries.

### Session 7 — "The Truth"

*   **Focus:** Mystery / Betrayal
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Real Target: The party discovers this entire job was inception—on them. Someone wanted them to plant a specific idea in their own minds.
    *   The Double Agent: Evidence suggests one party member is a planted agent who doesn't know they're planted (inception was used on them).
    *   Reality Check: Totems start behaving inconsistently. Are they even awake?

**Escalation:** Their employer appears in the dream—which should be impossible. Unless they never left the dream from their last job.

### Session 8 — "Extraction"

*   **Focus:** Chase / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Extractor: The ultimate mental defender appears—someone who can hunt them through all layers simultaneously.
    *   Trust Issues: The party must work together despite not knowing who might be compromised.
    *   Racing Time: They must reach the inception point before the extraction fails and they're trapped forever.

**Escalation:** Time in the real world is running out. If they don't wake up before the sleep spell ends, they'll be trapped in their own minds.

### Session 9 — "The Kick"

*   **Focus:** Coordination / Climax
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Synchronized Wake-Up: Execute simultaneous "kicks"—shock events in each layer that cause ascension.
    *   Fighting Through: Battle mental projections in each layer while timing is critical.
    *   The Sacrifice: Someone might need to stay behind to ensure others escape.

**Escalation:** The kicks start desynchronizing. They're waking up in the wrong layers or not at all.

### Session 10 — "Limbo's Truth"

*   **Focus:** Boss Battle / Philosophy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Architect's Secret: In Limbo, they discover their Architect built a entire world here decades ago (subjectively) and doesn't want to leave.
    *   The Final Layer: There's one more layer beneath Limbo—the raw chaos of the subconscious multiverse.
    *   Defeating the Self: Each character must defeat their shadow self to earn the right to wake.

**Escalation:** The Architect has become too powerful in this space, controlling the very laws of this reality.

### Session 11 — "Inception Complete"

*   **Focus:** Revelation / Twist
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Wake: The party finally reaches the real world—or do they?
    *   The Real Job: They discover the inception was on themselves all along. They've planted the idea that they succeeded, when the real job is about to begin.
    *   The Choice: Accept the inception (and the comfortable lie) or reject it (and face a harder truth).

**Escalation:** Their totems behave incorrectly. Consensus breaks down on what's real.

### Session 12 — "A Leap of Faith"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Ambiguous Ending
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Final Leap: To truly wake up, they must make a leap of faith—literally fall from a great height in the dream to kick to reality.
    *   The Reunion: They wake in the real world, but small details are wrong. Or are they?
    *   The Spin: The campaign ends with a character's totem spinning—but we don't see if it falls.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Waking World:** Reality (or is it?), where the party plans and prepares.
2.  **Layer One - The City:** A bustling metropolis representing the target's daily conscious mind.
3.  **Layer Two - The Hotel:** A luxury hotel with zero-gravity sequences and time-dilated action.
4.  **Layer Three - The Fortress:** A snow-covered mountain stronghold representing the target's deepest defenses.
5.  **Limbo:** Raw subconscious where time barely moves, reality is unstable, and lost dreamers build eternal prisons.

---

## Central Conflict

The central conflict explores identity, reality, and the reliability of perception. How do you know what's real? Can an idea be a prison or a liberation? Is it ethical to change someone's mind without their consent? The campaign forces players to question their own memories and motivations while executing an elaborate heist that takes place entirely in thought.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Layered Time Dilation**

*   Each dream layer has different time flow: Waking (normal), Layer 1 (×20), Layer 2 (×400), Layer 3 (×8000), Limbo (×infinite).
*   **Coordination:** Actions must be synchronized across layers. A 5-second countdown in Layer 1 gives 100 seconds in Layer 2.

### 2. **The Kick**

*   A "kick" is a shock that causes ascension to the previous layer—falling, explosion, sudden cold.
*   **Mechanics:** Kicks must be synchronized across layers. Miss a kick and you're stuck in the deeper layer.

### 3. **Dream Combat**

*   In dreams, willpower matters more than physical strength. Imagination can create weapons or change architecture.
*   **Mechanics:** Allow creative use of Arcana, Deception, or Performance checks to manipulate the dreamscape during combat.

### 4. **Totems**

*   Personal objects that behave one way in reality, differently in dreams. Used to verify what's real.
*   **Mechanics:** Only the owner knows their totem's true behavior. Players should keep this secret even from each other.

### 5. **Subconscious Manifestations**

*   Each character's unresolved issues manifest as NPCs or scenarios in dreams.
*   **Mechanics:** The DM creates personal challenges based on character backstories. Confronting them can grant bonuses; fleeing causes penalties.
