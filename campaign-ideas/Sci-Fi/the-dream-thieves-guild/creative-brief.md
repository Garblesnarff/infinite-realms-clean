# Creative Brief: The Dream Thieves Guild

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Architectural Surrealism (Inception meets Dream Logic)

Inspired by the impossible architecture and layered realities of Inception, this aesthetic combines clean architectural design with surreal dream logic. Reality bends, folds, and shifts. Gravity is optional. Everything is precisely designed yet fundamentally unreal.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Impossible Architecture:** Buildings fold onto themselves, staircases lead nowhere, spaces are non-Euclidean.
*   **Layered Reality:** Show multiple realities existing simultaneously or transitioning between each other.
*   **Surreal Precision:** Everything should be precisely rendered but fundamentally impossible or dreamlike.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Layered, surreal, precise, mind-bending, architectural, time-distorted, psychological, elegant-impossible, dream-logic.
*   **Feeling:** The unsettling beauty of impossible spaces. The weight of questioning reality. Elegant heists in landscapes of thought. The vertigo of not knowing which way is up or what's real.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, architectural precision for buildings and spaces, even when they're doing impossible things. Sharp edges and perfect geometry—folding, rotating, or existing in multiple states.
*   **Textures:** Smooth, modern surfaces—glass, polished stone, clean metal. Everything slightly too perfect to be real.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting of a city folding onto itself, buildings rotating 90 degrees to meet the sky becoming the ground. Every line is architecturally precise despite the impossible geometry."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Desaturated elegance with strategic pops of color. Dominated by steel grays, muted blues, champagne golds, and the stark contrast of black and white.
*   **Accent Colors:** The warm amber of old memories, the cold blue of deep dreams, rare pops of vibrant color when reality breaks.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Soft, diffused lighting that comes from everywhere and nowhere, creating minimal shadows in most scenes—except when drama requires chiaroscuro.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...rendered in a desaturated palette of grays and muted blues, with strategic warm amber highlights from the setting sun—even though the sun is somehow in three positions simultaneously. Lighting is soft and omnidirectional, reducing shadows and adding to the dreamlike quality."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Elegant, professional, wearing sharp suits and refined clothing even in combat. Everyone looks like they belong in a high-end corporate thriller.
*   **Expression:** Intense focus, the weight of hidden knowledge, the controlled calm of professionals operating in impossible spaces.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dream thief in an immaculate charcoal suit, standing calmly as the architecture rotates around them. They hold a totem—a small object—checking it with intense focus. Reality bends but they remain composed, professional."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Clean modern architecture that does impossible things—cities folding, hallways rotating, spaces existing in multiple orientations simultaneously.
*   **Atmosphere:** Precise, elegant, subtly wrong. The uncanny valley of spaces that look real but break fundamental laws.
*   **Details:** Glass and steel, reflective surfaces showing different realities, architecture that defies physics, impossible perspectives.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hotel corridor where the end is also the beginning, forming an impossible loop. The perspective is precise and architectural, but the space clearly violates three-dimensional logic. Doors lead to rooms that exist in different gravitational orientations."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, ambient lighting for most scenes—minimal shadows, even illumination. For dramatic moments, use stark contrasts and defined light sources.
*   **Shadows:** Generally minimal, adding to the unreality. When present, shadows are sharp and used for dramatic effect.
*   **Purpose:** The lack of normal shadows adds to the dream-like quality. When shadows suddenly appear, it signals a shift in reality or danger.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...illuminated by soft, sourceless light creating almost no shadows, adding to the surreal quality. Only the totem in the character's hand casts a shadow—a visual marker of what might be real."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use impossible perspectives, Escher-like spaces, architecture that folds or rotates. Show multiple planes of reality coexisting. Visual metaphors for layered consciousness.
*   **Techniques:** Transitions between realities in the same image, rotating architecture, reflections showing different versions of reality, visual time dilation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition showing the same space in three layers simultaneously: top third shows a city street, middle third shows a hotel hallway, bottom third shows a snow fortress—all the same location across dream layers, connected by falling figures transitioning between them."

## Voice

A smooth, professional voice with an undertone of uncertainty—as if the speaker is constantly verifying their own reality. Neutral accent suggesting international sophistication, with measured pacing that allows for the weight of complex ideas. The emotion is controlled but deeply philosophical, carrying the weight of someone who's seen too many realities to trust any single one completely. Audio quality is pristine but with subtle, almost subliminal layering—whispers of other voices, brief echoes, the sense of existing in multiple states. Role: A dream architect explaining the rules while questioning if rules exist at all.
