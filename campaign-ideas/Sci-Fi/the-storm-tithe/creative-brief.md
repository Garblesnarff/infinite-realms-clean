# The Storm Tithe - Creative Brief

## Visual Style
**Religious Meteorology** - Blend ancient religious iconography with weather phenomena. Storm gods as divine beings worthy of worship and fear.

## Colors
- **Storm Domains**: Blues, grays, whites with lightning yellow/purple accents
- **Tribute Festivals**: Rich ceremonial colors—gold, crimson, royal purple
- **Still Zones**: Washed-out, desaturated, oppressive gray uniformity
- **Weather-Warriors**: Crackling energy, elemental auras

## Environments
- **Port Monsoon**: Grand temples designed as storm shrines, rain always falling beautifully
- **Hurricane Palace**: Floating city in perpetual storm, dramatic seascapes
- **Still Zones**: Lifeless, unchanging, disturbing in their perfection
- **Storm Conclave**: Mountain peak wreathed in all weather types simultaneously

## Music
- **Storm God Themes**: Orchestral grandeur mixed with weather sounds
- **Tribute Festivals**: Ceremonial drums, choral music, celebratory yet reverent
- **Revolution**: Militant, driving, rock/metal edge
- **The Calm**: Absence of music, unsettling silence, ambient drones

## Voice Acting
- **Monsoon Empress**: Regal female voice + rolling thunder, rain percussion
- **Hurricane King**: Booming male voice + howling wind, crashing waves
- **Blizzard Council**: Three voices in harmony, crystalline chimes, cold precision
- **The Calm**: Anti-voice, words that absorb sound, uncomfortable silence
- **Cade Stormbreaker**: Passionate revolutionary, charismatic speaker
- **High Priestess**: Serene authority, channeling divine will

## Key Art
