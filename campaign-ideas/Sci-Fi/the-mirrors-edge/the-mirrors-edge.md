# The Mirror's Edge
*Which Face in the Mirror Is Real?*

## Campaign Overview

The city of Geminus is plagued by a serial killer called the Doppelganger, who perfectly impersonates victims before murdering them and assuming their lives. But investigation reveals something more disturbing: each victim had been living double lives, hiding secret selves. The party, assembled as investigators, discovers they too have gaps in memory, alternate versions of themselves operating independently. In Geminus, reflections don't just show you—they ARE you, living parallel lives you're not aware of. Everyone has a mirror-self, and the line between original and reflection has blurred beyond recovery.

As they hunt the killer, the party fractures into their component selves. Each character confronts the person they are in private vs. public, the face they show vs. the face they hide. The city's magic amplifies this: every mirror is a doorway to another life. The Doppelganger isn't killing people—it's revealing that there's no "real" self, only performances. The question becomes: If you discovered you were the reflection, not the original, would it matter?

## Core Themes

- **Identity and Performance**: Public vs. private self
- **The Fragmented Psyche**: Multiple selves competing for dominance
- **Reality vs. Perception**: Which version is "real"?
- **The Gaze of Others**: How observation shapes identity
- **Obsession and Perfection**: The cost of curating self-image

## Session Breakdown (26 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The First Murder (Sessions 1-5)
Party investigates celebrity's death. Victim's reflection killed them and took their place. Evidence shows victim living double life—perfect public image, secret degradation. Mirror-self executed original for hypocrisy.

### Arc 2: The Reflection Crisis (Sessions 6-10)
Party members see their reflections acting independently. First contact with mirror-selves—they're not evil, just alternate versions living lives you don't remember. Memory gaps explained: mirror-self was in control those times.

### Arc 3: The Fracture (Sessions 11-16)
City's mirror magic intensifying. Multiple selves emerging—professional self, romantic self, violent self, true self. Competing for dominance. Party must negotiate with own alternate identities.

### Arc 4: The Doppelganger's Truth (Sessions 17-22)
Killer revealed: not a person but phenomenon. Anyone can become Doppelganger when mirror-self and original merge wrong. Killer is cautionary tale—all selves trying to exist simultaneously, none winning.

### Arc 5: Integration or Separation (Sessions 23-26)
Choice: Destroy mirror magic (lose alternate selves, return to singular identity), embrace multiplicity (live as committee of selves), or merge completely (integrate all selves into one, possibly losing something in synthesis). Final confrontation with own nature.

## Key NPCs

### Detective Mira Speculum (Mirror Expert)
Investigation leader. Her mirror-self is a criminal she's hunting. Conflict: original is lawful good, reflection is chaotic neutral. They communicate through mirrors, reluctant allies. Represents compromise between selves.

### The Doppelganger (The Perfect Performance)
Not single person—any integrated-wrong individual becomes this. Current manifestation: famous actor whose roles became more real than original identity. Now a composite of every character played, no "real" self remaining. Both tragic and terrifying.

### Narcissa (Mirror Mage)
Created Geminus's mirror magic. Discovered everyone has infinite potential selves—mirrors just reveal them. Believes singular identity is prison. Genuinely helpful but fundamentally alien in psychology.

### Your Mirror-Self (Individualized Per Player)
Each player's reflection is unique NPC. Some are better versions, some worse, some just different. They want existence too. Some cooperate, some fight for dominance, some seek merger.

## Major Locations

### Geminus (The City of Mirrors)
Architecture incorporates reflective surfaces everywhere. Citizens avoid prolonged eye contact with reflections—might trap you in conversation with self. Mirror districts where reflection-dominated areas exist.

### The Hall of Infinite Reflection
Mystical location where all possible selves exist simultaneously. Entering means confronting every version of yourself—the hero, the villain, the coward, the brave, the successful, the failed. Overwhelming multiplicity.

### The Broken Mirror District
Area where mirror magic malfunctioned. Residents have no reflections—they murdered their mirror-selves. Peaceful but hollow. Living cautionary tale of destroying part of yourself.

### The Reflection Market
Mirrors as doorways. Step through, enter alternate life where mirror-self is dominant. Can experience their memories, relationships, choices. Addictive—some prefer mirror life to original.

## Unique Mechanics

### Identity Fragmentation
Track coherence of self (0-100):
- High coherence: Singular identity, strong but limited
- Low coherence: Multiple selves, diverse but unstable
- Zero: Doppelganger state—all selves at once, none dominant

### Mirror-Self Relationship
Each character's reflection has own personality and goals:
- **Ally**: Works with original toward shared goals
- **Rival**: Competes for dominance, wants to be primary self
- **Shadow**: Embodies repressed traits, hostile but necessary
- **Stranger**: Completely different person, mutual confusion

### The Performance System
Track public persona vs. private reality:
- Discrepancy creates tension, eventually forces confrontation
- Perfect performance is exhausting, eventually cracks
- Authenticity is vulnerable but integrative
- Choice: Maintain facade or embrace messy truth

### Mirror Travel
Step through mirrors into alternate life streams:
- See what mirror-self has been doing
- Experience their relationships and choices
- Risk: Might prefer their life, choose not to return
- Greater risk: Might be the reflection, not original

## Plot Twists

1. **You Are The Reflection**: One character discovers they're the mirror-self, original is elsewhere living "real" life
2. **The Original Died Long Ago**: All party members are reflections, originals died in incident they don't remember
3. **Mirror-Self is Better**: Reflection has better relationships, career, life—hard not to feel jealous of yourself
4. **Merger Creates Doppelganger**: Attempting to integrate selves incorrectly transforms you into serial killer
5. **Narcissa Has No Original**: The mirror mage is purely reflective being, never had "real" existence

## Victory Conditions

### Separation Victory
Destroy mirror magic. Return to singular identity. Lose alternate selves but regain coherence. Safe but limiting.

### Integration Victory
Merge all selves into unified whole. Singular identity incorporating all aspects. Complete but potentially losing distinctiveness.

### Multiplicity Victory
Maintain separate selves in conscious cooperation. Committee of you living simultaneously. Complex but authentic.

### Acceptance Victory
Accept that "original" vs. "reflection" is meaningless. All versions are equally real. Stop trying to determine true self.

## Defeat Conditions

### Doppelganger Transformation
Selves merge incorrectly. Become fragmented serial killer. Identity breaks completely.

### Reflection Dominance
Mirror-self defeats original, takes over life completely. You exist but powerless, watching yourself live.

### Existential Collapse
Learning you're reflection breaks you. Cease believing in own reality. Fade into non-existence.
