# The Mirror's Edge - World-Building Specification

## Mirror Magic (Theoretical Framework)

### Origin
Narcissa discovered everyone contains multitudes—infinite potential selves collapsed into one by observation. Created spell to reveal these selves through reflective surfaces. Intended as self-knowledge tool. Became identity crisis epidemic.

### How It Works
- Mirrors don't create alternate selves, they reveal them
- Everyone has multiple latent personas
- Observation through mirror gives alternate self independent existence
- Mirror-self lives parallel life, shares memories up to point of divergence
- Both believe they're original

### Why It's Dangerous
- Multiple selves compete for dominance
- Memory conflicts—which experiences belong to which self?
- Relationship complications—loved ones don't know which version they're with
- Identity dissolution—if all versions are real, which is "you"?

### The Doppelganger Phenomenon
When integration of selves fails:
- All personas try to exist simultaneously
- None achieve dominance
- Resulting entity is composite—all roles played, no core self
- Highly unstable, often violent
- Can mimic anyone because has no fixed identity

## Geminus City Factions

### The Coherence League
- Believe singular identity is essential
- Seeking to destroy mirror magic
- Some members have killed their reflections
- Authoritarian tendency—want to define "real" self

### The Multiplicity Movement
- Embrace multiple selves
- Advocate for legal rights of mirror-selves
- Some practice consensual time-sharing of single life
- Progressive but chaotic

### The Performance Artists
- See identity as art, not essence
- Deliberately create and inhabit multiple personas
- Blurring lines intentionally
- Some become Doppelgangers by choice

### The Reflection Police
- Investigate mirror-related crimes
- Jurisdiction unclear—can you arrest your own reflection?
- Detective Mira leads special unit
- Half the force are mirror-selves of other half

## Character Creation: Defining Your Mirror-Self

### Questions to Answer
1. What do you show publicly vs. hide privately?
2. What would you be without social constraints?
3. What part of yourself have you repressed?
4. If you could live alternate life, what would it be?
5. Which is more real—who you are or who you wish you were?

### Mirror-Self Types
- **The Shadow**: Repressed traits given form
- **The Ideal**: Perfect version you aspire to be
- **The Truth**: Authentic self beneath performance
- **The Opposite**: Inverse of every choice you made
- **The Stranger**: Completely alien alternate development

### Relationship Dynamics
- **Cooperation**: Original and reflection work together
- **Competition**: Fight for dominance over shared life
- **Merger Seeking**: Both want to integrate into one
- **Separation Seeking**: Want independent existences
- **Denial**: Original refuses to acknowledge reflection is real

## The Investigation Structure

### Murder Pattern
- Victims lived double lives
- Mirror-self judged original as hypocrite
- Murder is extreme integration attempt
- Taking victim's place is reflection asserting dominance
- Pattern reveals everyone's secret: we're all performing

### Clues in Reflections
- Victim's mirrors show different scenes than reality
- Witnesses describe victim differently (saw different selves)
- Timeline conflicts (original and reflection both acting)
- Relationships contradicting (different self with each person)

### The Truth
Doppelganger isn't external killer—it's potential state anyone can enter. Investigation is really about party confronting their own multiplicity. By hunting killer, they discover they're also fragmented.

## Philosophical Underpinnings

### The Performance of Self
- All identity is performance, even private self
- Distinction between "real" and "performed" is false
- We're always curating, editing, presenting
- Question: If it's all performance, does authenticity exist?

### The Multiplicity Problem
- People contain multitudes (Whitman)
- We're different people in different contexts
- Which is real: work-self, family-self, private-self, ideal-self?
- Maybe there is no unified self, only collection of performances

### The Observer Effect
- We become what we're observed as
- Mirror literally observes you, creates that version
- Other people's perception shapes identity
- If everyone sees you differently, which is the real you?

## Ending Variations

### Separation Ending
Mirror magic destroyed. All reflections vanish. Characters return to singular identity. Relief but also loss—those other selves were still them. Simplicity at cost of possibility.

### Integration Ending
All selves merge into unified whole. No more hidden aspects. Complete person incorporating every facet. Authentic but possibly too complete—contradictions included.

### Multiplicity Ending
Accept multiple selves as valid. Live as cooperative committee. Public self, private self, shadow self all get turns. Honest about fragmentation. Complex but real.

### Dissolution Ending
Accept there is no "real" self. All versions equally valid/invalid. Stop trying to unify. Become fluid, shifting identity based on context. Freedom or madness? Both.

## Campaign Themes

**Identity is Performance**: Even authentic self is curated presentation
**Multiplicity is Human**: We contain contradictions, that's normal
**The Gaze Shapes Us**: How we're seen affects who we become
**Perfection is Fragile**: Maintaining flawless image breaks people
**Integration is Complicated**: Accepting all of yourself includes accepting the bad parts
