# The Mirror's Edge - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone
Perfect Blue meets psychological thriller. Highly polished surfaces, obsessive attention to appearance, beauty masking horror. Film noir lighting with mirrors creating impossible angles. Reality questionable—is this memory or performance?

## Color Palettes
- **Public Personas**: Bright, saturated, artificial perfection
- **Private Selves**: Muted, natural, honest but less beautiful
- **Mirror World**: Reversed colors, slight wrongness, uncanny
- **Integration**: Colors blending, hard to distinguish original from reflection

## Music and Sound
- **Identity Crisis**: Distorted versions of character themes, familiar but wrong
- **Mirror-Self Encounters**: Dual audio—same voice from two sources, slight delay creating dissonance
- **Investigation**: Noir jazz with electronic glitch, past meeting future
- **Revelation**: Shattering glass, reality fragmenting audibly

## Voice Direction
- **Original Self**: How player voices character normally
- **Mirror-Self**: Same actor but different inflection, word choice, energy level
- **Doppelganger**: Multiple voices speaking as one, layers of performance
- **Narcissa**: Echoing, as if speaking from both sides of mirror simultaneously

## Cinematic Moments
- **First Mirror Movement**: Reflection doesn't match movement. Locks eyes with self. Reflection smiles when you don't
- **Mirror Travel**: Stepping through glass, world inverting, emerging in alternate life
- **Memory Conflict**: Two versions of same scene—did you do this or did mirror-self?
- **Doppelganger Reveal**: Person's face shifting between multiple identities, unable to settle
- **Integration Moment**: All selves overlapping visually, deciding which becomes dominant
