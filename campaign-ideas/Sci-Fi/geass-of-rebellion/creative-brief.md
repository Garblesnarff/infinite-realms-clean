# Creative Brief: Geass of Rebellion

## Art Style: Gothic Military Elegance Meets Chess-Board Tactics (Code Geass Aesthetic)

Inspired by theatrical rebellion, strategic genius, and supernatural mind control, this style blends ornate imperial aesthetics with stark revolutionary symbolism. It captures chess-like tactical battles, the duality of masked identities, and the corrupting allure of absolute power.

### Core Principles:

*   **Contrast:** Opulent imperial gold/purple vs. stark revolutionary black/gold.
*   **Theatrical:** Characters strike dramatic poses, wear elaborate costumes, use grand gestures.
*   **Strategic:** Show tactics through overhead tactical maps, unit positioning, chess metaphors.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Britannian Empire:** Imperial purple, gold trim, white uniforms with ornate decoration.
*   **Black Knights:** Black, gold accents, harsh angular designs, revolutionary simplicity.
*   **Geass Activation:** Crimson red with bird-like sigil appearing in eyes.

**Character Design:**
*   Tall, lean character designs with sharp features and impossibly long limbs.
*   Elaborate military uniforms with capes, high collars, and excessive decoration.
*   Zero (rebellion leader) wears iconic black mask with flowing cape.

**Knightmare Frames:**
*   Angular mecha with shoulder-mounted weapons, roller-skates for mobility.
*   Designs vary: bulky mass-production models vs. sleek custom ace units.

**Voice:** Theatrical strategist—speaking with dramatic flair, chess metaphors, and calculated pauses. Think Shakespearean villain meets tactical genius.
