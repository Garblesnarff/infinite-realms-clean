---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Geass of Rebellion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Strategic Intrigue / Revolutionary Drama / Tactical Mecha Combat
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 16–20 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **16–18**
**Tone (keywords):** strategic genius, rebellion, mind control, chess-like tactics, moral compromise, masks and identities, revolution vs. tyranny
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party lives under the Britannian Empire's oppressive rule in occupied territories. When one member receives the power of Geass—a supernatural ability to command absolute obedience—they form a rebellion using strategy, deception, and Knightmare Frames (mecha). As they fight for liberation, they must balance revolutionary ideals against the corrupting temptation of absolute power, all while maintaining secret identities and outmaneuvering imperial forces in chess-like tactical battles.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Battles are won through strategy, not power. Players must use terrain, deception, and asymmetric tactics against superior imperial forces. One wrong move can cost everything.
*   **Investigation:** Players maintain secret identities, gather intelligence, recruit allies, and expose imperial conspiracies while avoiding exposure.
*   **Consequences:** Using Geass corrupts—each use brings closer to losing control. Rebellion requires morally gray choices. Allies may betray you if they learn you've been mind-controlling them.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Geass Powers**

*   One party member receives Geass (or multiple members receive different Geass).
*   **Example Powers:** Absolute Obedience (command anyone once), Time Manipulation (see seconds into the future), Memory Alteration, Forced Truth.
*   **Corruption:** Each Geass use increases a corruption track. At maximum, the Geass activates involuntarily (e.g., Absolute Obedience activates when making eye contact).

### 2. **Strategic Battles**

*   Battles are puzzle-like—players plan tactics before combat using intelligence gathered beforehand.
*   **Victory Conditions:** Rarely "kill all enemies." Usually objectives like "hold position for X turns," "protect VIP during escape," "outmaneuver superior forces."

### 3. **Secret Identity**

*   Party members maintain civilian identities while leading the rebellion as masked Black Knights.
*   **Social Encounters:** Players must interact with imperial nobles and soldiers without revealing their identities.
*   **Exposure Risk:** Failed checks can lead to identity exposure, forcing the party to flee or eliminate witnesses.

### 4. **Knightmare Frame Customization**

*   Players design custom Knightmare Frames (mecha) with modular weapons and abilities based on their tactical role.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is whether liberation can be achieved through morally compromised means, and whether absolute power can be used justly or inevitably corrupts. The party must decide if the ends justify the means, and whether controlling others—even for good—is itself tyranny.

---

## Themes

*   **Masks and Identity:** Who you pretend to be vs. who you truly are. The rebellion wears masks literally and metaphorically.
*   **Means vs. Ends:** Is mind-controlling enemies acceptable to achieve liberation? How far can you compromise before you become the tyrant?
*   **Strategic Genius vs. Power:** Victory through intellect and planning, not raw strength.
*   **Martyrdom and Legacy:** The Zero Requiem—becoming the world's villain so your death creates peace.
*   **Friendship vs. Ideology:** Suzaku and the party leader love each other but fight on opposite sides.

---

## Victory Conditions

*   **Zero Requiem:** Become the world's tyrant, then arrange your own assassination to unite humanity in peace through shared catharsis.
*   **Righteous Revolution:** Defeat the empire, establish a just government, resist Geass corruption.
*   **Seize the Throne:** Use Geass to become Emperor, rule justly (if you can resist corruption).
*   **Abandon Power:** Destroy your Geass and the rebellion, return to normal life—save your soul but leave tyranny intact.
