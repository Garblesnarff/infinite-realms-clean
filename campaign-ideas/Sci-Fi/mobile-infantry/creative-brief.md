# Creative Brief: Mobile Infantry

## Art Style: Military Sci-Fi Propaganda (Starship Troopers Film meets WW2 Posters)

Clean, propagandistic military aesthetic contrasted with the brutal reality of bug warfare. Heroic soldiers in gleaming armor versus nightmarish insectoid swarms.

### Core Principles:
*   **Heroic Propaganda:** Official imagery shows clean, heroic soldiers in pristine armor.
*   **Brutal Reality:** Actual combat shows damaged armor, mud, blood, and swarms of bugs.
*   **Scale:** Emphasize overwhelming numbers—hundreds of Arachnids vs. small human squads.

### Color Palette:
*   **Military:** Gunmetal gray armor, olive drab uniforms, sterile white facilities.
*   **Arachnids:** Chitinous blacks, toxic greens, orange blood.
*   **Propaganda:** Bold reds, blues, and golds for recruitment posters.

## Voice

A recruitment announcer voice—enthusiastic, patriotic, almost satirically propagandistic, with underlying steel. Role: Federation recruitment officer, combat correspondent, drill instructor.
