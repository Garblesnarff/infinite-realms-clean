## Art Style: Cozy Medieval Craft Aesthetic

Inspired by Studio Ghibli's attention to craft details and the warm aesthetic of slice-of-life anime. This style aims to capture the beauty of medieval craftsmanship, the satisfaction of creating something with your hands, and the cozy atmosphere of workshops and libraries.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Craft and Detail:** Show the process of creation—papermaking, printing, binding. Every tool and material should look real and functional.
*   **Warmth and Community:** Spaces should feel inviting and lived-in. Workshops are full of activity and personality.
*   **Beauty in the Mundane:** Elevate ordinary medieval life—markets, workshops, guildhalls—with loving detail and warm lighting.

**6. Shading & Lighting:**

*   **Light Sources:** Daylight for main work (warm afternoon sun preferred), candles and oil lamps for detail work, natural fire from hearths.

One person operates the printing press in the foreground, others sort type and hang paper to dry in the middle ground, apprentices learn in the background. Warm lighting, busy but organized composition showing community and collaboration."

## Craft Process Principles:

*   **Show the Work:** Illustrations should show the actual process of papermaking, printing, and binding in accurate detail.
*   **Material Authenticity:** Papers should look like appropriate materials (plant fibers, texture, imperfections in early attempts).
*   **Tool Accuracy:** Medieval and early modern printing equipment should be researched and depicted accurately.
*   **Progressive Improvement:** Visual progression from crude first attempts to refined products should be clear.

## Community and Growth:

*   **Workshop Evolution:** Visual progression of the workspace from single room to industrial operation.
*   **Character Growth:** Show apprentices learning, craftspeople mastering techniques, community rallying around the library.
*   **Social Impact:** Illustrate the spreading of literacy—children reading, commoners accessing books, knowledge being shared.
