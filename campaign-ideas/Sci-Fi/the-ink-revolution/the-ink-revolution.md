## Difficulty Context

**Light Difficulty**: This is a non-combat-focused campaign emphasizing creativity, problem-solving, and social challenges over dungeon crawling. Combat encounters are rare and usually avoidable through clever thinking. The "difficulty" comes from managing resources, navigating politics, and innovating solutions to complex problems. Perfect for players who enjoy crafting, economics, and roleplay over tactical combat.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8 sessions)

A tale of innovation, literacy, and democratizing knowledge in a medieval world.

*   **Act I — The Paper Chase (Sessions 1-3):** The party arrives in the city of Ehrenfest, a typical medieval city where books are luxury items costing more than a house. The reincarnated book-lover (chosen party member or NPC companion) is horrified by the lack of reading material and begins experimenting with making paper from available materials. The party must gather resources, navigate the Merchant's Guild politics, and create the world's first affordable paper while keeping their innovations secret from those who'd steal or suppress them.
*   **Act II — The Printing Press Conspiracy (Sessions 4-6):** With paper production established, the party tackles the next challenge: mass production of books. They develop a printing press (revolutionary in this world) and begin producing simple children's books and practical manuals. This threatens the Scribes' Guild monopoly and the church's control of religious texts. The party must defend their workshop from sabotage, navigate legal battles, and find noble patrons willing to protect their innovations.
*   **Act III — The Library of the People (Sessions 7-8):** The party's ultimate goal: establishing the first public library and school for commoners. They must secure funding, fight off final opposition from the Scribes' Guild and conservative clergy, and host a grand opening that proves the value of universal literacy. The campaign climaxes not with a battle, but with the sight of common children reading their first books—a revolution of knowledge rather than swords.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "A World Without Books"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Problem Identification
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in Ehrenfest, a prosperous merchant city. Establish each character's background and skills.
    *   One party member (or NPC companion Myne) desperately seeks a bookshop, only to discover books cost 1-2 gold pieces each (a month's wages for a commoner).
    *   Visit to the noble quarter reveals the only library is private, owned by the Lord's family, guarded and restricted.
    *   The book-lover has a revelation: with their modern knowledge, they can create affordable books and change this world.
    *   First challenge: gather materials to experiment with papermaking (plant fibers, water, frames).
*   **Escalation:** The Merchants' Guild notices strangers asking unusual questions about materials and begins investigating.

### Session 2 — "The Paper Experiment"
*   **Focus:** Crafting / Problem-Solving
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party sets up a secret workshop in a rented building, experimenting with papermaking techniques.
    *   Multiple skill challenges: gathering the right plant fibers, creating frames and screens, developing the pulping process.
    *   First successes and failures: early paper is too fragile, too thick, or falls apart. Iteration and improvement.
    *   The party needs money for supplies, taking on side quests: helping merchants, working odd jobs, or using their skills.
    *   Finally, they produce the first usable sheet of paper—a revolutionary moment.
*   **Escalation:** A Merchants' Guild inspector demands to know what they're producing and tries to assess taxes or claim guild jurisdiction.

### Session 3 — "The Guild Games"
*   **Focus:** Social Intrigue / Economics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must navigate the complex guild system to legally produce and sell paper.
    *   Negotiation with the Merchants' Guild: pay excessive fees, accept oversight, or find a loophole.
    *   Meeting with the Scribes' Guild: they're interested in cheap paper but suspicious of outsiders disrupting their monopoly.
    *   The party decides to approach a minor noble, Benno the merchant lord, for patronage and protection.
    *   First sale: they produce beautiful handmade paper and sell it to scribes at half the cost of parchment, causing a sensation.
*   **Escalation:** The Scribes' Guild realizes cheap paper threatens their parchment business and begins plotting to shut down the party's operation.

### Session 4 — "The Written Word"

*   **Key Events:**
    *   With paper production stable, the book-lover becomes obsessed with the next step: actual books.
    *   The party experiments with creating ink (soot, oils, binders) and binding techniques.
    *   They write and produce the first simple book: a children's alphabet primer with illustrations.
    *   Community reaction: commoners are amazed but can't read. The party begins teaching basic literacy in secret.
    *   The party realizes handwriting books one at a time is too slow—they need mass production.
*   **Escalation:** An underground literacy class is discovered, and the conservative faction of the church sends inquisitors to investigate "unauthorized education."

### Session 5 — "The Press of Progress"
*   **Focus:** Invention / Danger
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party designs and builds the world's first printing press using available technology (woodblock or movable type).
    *   Engineering challenges: creating durable type, developing proper ink, designing the press mechanism.
    *   First print run: 100 copies of a simple prayer book, completed in a day (versus months by hand).
    *   The Scribes' Guild sees this as an existential threat and hires thugs to raid the workshop.
    *   Combat or negotiation encounter: defend the press and evidence of its capabilities.
*   **Escalation:** The raid forces the party to seek formal protection from a higher noble—they approach the Lord's daughter, who is secretly fascinated by their work.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party meets Lady Rozemyne, the Lord's scholarly daughter, who becomes their patron and protector.
    *   Formal presentation to the Lord: demonstrate the printing press and explain how it can bring prestige and profit to Ehrenfest.

    *   Victory: the Lord grants them a monopoly charter for 10 years, recognizing printing as a new craft separate from the Scribes' Guild.
*   **Escalation:** The conservative High Priest declares printed books "spiritually inferior" and forbids their use in religious services, severely limiting their market.

*   **Focus:** Diplomacy / Religious Intrigue
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must win over the church to legitimize printed books.
    *   They approach the moderate Bishop with a proposal: print cheap religious texts to spread the faith among commoners.

    *   Internal church conflict: progressive clergy see the value, conservatives see heresy.
    *   The party produces a special luxury edition for the High Priest himself, showing that printing can create beauty as well as quantity.
    *   Resolution: the church officially approves printed religious texts, breaking the opposition's power.
*   **Escalation:** With church approval, demand explodes. The party needs to scale up production dramatically for the grand opening.

### Session 8 — "The People's Library"
*   **Focus:** Culmination / Triumph
*   **Key Events:**

    *   Emotional climax: a poor child reads their first complete sentence, and the crowd realizes what this means for the future.
    *   Epilogue: flash-forward showing the spread of literacy, new libraries opening in other cities, and the party's names in the history books as the pioneers of the "Ink Revolution."
*   **Resolution:** The party has fundamentally changed this world, not through violence, but through knowledge. They can continue with new innovations (advanced printing, publishing houses, academies) or retire as celebrated heroes of progress.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of knowledge as power, the democratization of education, and how innovation disrupts entrenched interests. The central conflict is not about defeating a dark lord, but about overcoming systemic obstacles: guild monopolies that protect jobs but stifle progress, religious authorities who fear losing control of knowledge, and noble classism that views literacy as above common people.

The campaign asks: what happens when you give everyone access to knowledge? How do you balance progress with protecting traditional livelihoods? Can innovation be peaceful, or must it always face violent opposition?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Innovation Points**
*   The party earns Innovation Points by successfully creating new technologies, processes, or products.
*   **Mechanics:** Award 1 Innovation Point when the party:
    *   Successfully creates a new product (paper, ink, printing press, etc.)
    *   Improves an existing process (faster papermaking, better binding, etc.)
    *   Teaches someone a new skill (literacy, crafting, etc.)
    *   Overcomes a major obstacle to their business (legal, political, etc.)
*   Spend Innovation Points to:
    *   Automatically succeed on a crafting check for something they've made before (1 point)
    *   Gain advantage on convincing someone of their product's value (1 point)
    *   Discover a new technique or improvement through experimentation (2 points)
    *   Attract a talented apprentice or supporter to their cause (3 points)
    *   Skip time-intensive production with a montage (party produces a large quantity of goods) (3 points)
*   Maximum: 10 points. Encourages creative problem-solving and rewards progress.

### 2. **The Crafting Workshop**
*   Between sessions, the party can invest time and money in their workshop, unlocking new capabilities.
*   **Mechanics:** The workshop has levels (1-5), each requiring investment:
    *   **Level 1 (Rented Room):** Basic papermaking, 1d4 sheets per day, no employees.
    *   **Level 2 (Small Workshop):** Improved papermaking, 2d6 sheets per day, 1-2 apprentices.
    *   **Level 3 (Print Shop):** Paper and basic printing, 1d8 pages of printed text per day, 3-5 employees.
    *   **Level 4 (Publishing House):** Advanced printing, 2d10 pages per day, 10+ employees, can take on contracts.
    *   **Level 5 (Industrial Mill):** Mass production, 4d10 pages per day, 20+ employees, generating passive income.
*   Upgrading requires: Time investment (downtime days), Gold cost (increasing at each level), and a significant achievement (completing a story milestone).

### 3. **Reputation Tracks**
*   The party's actions affect their standing with different factions.
*   **Mechanics:** Track reputation with five groups on a scale from -10 (hostile) to +10 (devoted):
    *   **Merchants' Guild:** Starts neutral (0). Increases by doing profitable business, decreases by undercutting them.
    *   **Scribes' Guild:** Starts suspicious (-2). Increases by employing scribes, decreases by threatening their monopoly.
    *   **The Church:** Starts neutral (0). Increases by printing religious texts respectfully, decreases by challenging doctrine.
    *   **The Nobility:** Starts dismissive (-1). Increases by providing luxury goods and prestige, decreases by empowering commoners.
    *   **Common People:** Starts curious (+1). Increases by teaching literacy and fair pricing, decreases by prioritizing profit over access.
*   At certain thresholds, factions offer help (+5), opposition (-5), or extreme reactions (+10 or -10).

### 4. **The Devouring (Optional Hard Mode)**
*   If using Myne as a companion or if a PC takes this flaw, they suffer from a magical illness that can only be managed, not cured.
*   **Mechanics:** The Devouring causes magical energy to build up in the body, eventually killing the victim. The character:
    *   Has reduced maximum HP (3/4 normal) representing physical frailty.
    *   Must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw during stressful situations or gain one level of exhaustion.
    *   Can channel the excess magical energy into enchanting objects they create (add +1 to any paper, ink, or books they personally make).
    *   Can temporarily gain immunity to exhaustion for 1 hour by entering a magical trance, but suffer one automatic level of exhaustion afterward.
*   This creates tension and urgency: the character is racing against time to complete their legacy, making the library's opening even more meaningful.
