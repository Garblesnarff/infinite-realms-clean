**Neon Throne Rising**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A demon lord slain 500 years ago awakens in Neo-Tokyo 2099, a cyberpunk megalopolis where magic and technology have fused. To reclaim their power in this unfamiliar world, they must navigate corporate warfare, government demon hunters, criminal syndicates, and resistance movements. They discover corporations harvested their demonic essence to power the city, and their resurrection was engineered. Worse, their awakening coincides with an ancient sealed threat—the Void Sovereign—beginning to manifest. The campaign explores power reclamation, moral complexity, and what ancient authority means in a dystopian future.

**7. Techno-Magic System**
*   **Philosophy:** Magic and technology are no longer separate—they've evolved together creating hybrid possibilities.

*   **Tech-Enhanced Magic:**
    *   Spell circles projected as holograms with AR targeting.
    *   Magical energy routed through cybernetic implants for precision.
    *   Scrying using hacked surveillance networks.
    *   Teleportation utilizing transit network infrastructure.
    *   Summoning creatures with digital familiars mixed in.

*   **Magic-Enhanced Technology:**
    *   Weapons with elemental damage via inscribed runes.
    *   Cybernetic parts powered by mystical energy instead of batteries.
    *   Vehicles with anti-gravity enchantments and engines.
    *   Computer hacking assisted by divination magic.
    *   Medical tech combining nanobots with healing spells.

*   **Demon Essence Technology:**
    *   Corporations extract essence from demon lord remnants.
    *   Essence powers city infrastructure, weapons, enhancements.
    *   Extraction weakened ancient seals accidentally.
    *   Party reclaims their own essence from corporate vaults.

**8. Neo-Tokyo 2099 Details**
*   **Geography:** Covers former Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Chiba—merged into single megalopolis.
*   **Vertical Structure:** Lower levels in perpetual shadow, middle levels are working city, upper levels for corporate elite.
*   **Population:** 50 million, 30% cybernetically enhanced, 5% have magical abilities.
*   **Government:** Officially democratic, actually corporate oligarchy.
*   **Culture:** Hyper-consumerist, augmentation normalized, magic commercialized, ancient traditions persist in underground.
*   **Technology Level:** Flying vehicles, holographic interfaces, advanced AI, space colonization begun, cybernetic enhancement common.
*   **Magic Level:** Commercialized and regulated, raw power less common than ancient times but applications more refined.

**9. Power Reclamation Path**
*   **Starting State:** Demon lord remembers former power but body is weak, essence scattered.
*   **Essence Locations:** Corporate reactors, black market artifacts, ancient shrine sites, other demon lords' hordes.
*   **Recovery Methods:** Heists, negotiations, combat, puzzle-solving, essence naturally gravitates to demon lord when close.
*   **Power Progression:** Each essence fragment grants abilities—new spells, enhanced stats, signature techniques.
*   **Full Power:** Campaign end with all essence makes demon lord truly formidable, partial essence means manageable power, affects final battle.

**10. The Void Sovereign Threat**
*   **Nature:** Existed before current reality, sealed by combined forces of all magical beings including demon lords.
*   **Seal Location:** Deep beneath Neo-Tokyo in ancient shrine network.
*   **Weakening Cause:** Nexarcana extracting essence from seal sites for decades.
*   **Manifestation Signs:** Reality glitches, technology malfunctions, magic warps, impossible geometry, void corruption spreading.
*   **Powers:** Reality warping, corruption of matter and energy, incomprehensible to mortal minds, tech and magic both vulnerable.
*   **Defeat Requirements:** Combined power of demon lords, corporations, resistance, government—former enemies unified.

**11. Timeline (If Party Takes No Action)**
*   **Session 1:** Demon lord never escapes Nexarcana, becomes battery for corporate weapon.
*   **Session 2:** Without party, other demon lords remain scattered and weak.
*   **Session 3:** Crimson Syndicate gradually crushed by corporate expansion.
*   **Session 4:** SANCTUM continues creating threats they profit from eliminating.
*   **Session 5:** Resistance crushed without demon lord's power tipping scales.
*   **Session 6:** Void Sovereign manifests fully with no opposition.
*   **Session 7:** Reality begins collapsing as Void spreads.
*   **Session 8:** Neo-Tokyo consumed, corruption spreads globally, world ends. Demon lord witnesses apocalypse powerless.

This specification creates a world where ancient power must adapt to dystopian modernity, where magic and technology have merged into something new, and where moral complexity challenges traditional hero/villain narratives. The cyberpunk setting provides familiar dystopia critique while demon lord protagonist offers fresh perspective on power, legacy, and redemption.
