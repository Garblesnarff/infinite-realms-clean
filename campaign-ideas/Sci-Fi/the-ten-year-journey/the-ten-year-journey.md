# The Ten Year Journey
**Tagline:** *Every island hides a monster, every storm conceals a god, and home has never been further away*

## Campaign Overview

The war is over. Troy has fallen. The party, a crew of war-weary veterans, sets sail for home aboard their ship commanded by a charismatic but cursed captain. What should be a journey of weeks becomes an odyssey of years as the gods punish hubris, monsters lurk on every shore, and the very seas conspire to keep them from reaching home. Each island presents a new challenge: cyclops caves, witch goddesses, lands of the dead, sirens singing doom, and whirlpools that devour ships.

But the trials at sea are only half the story. Back home, the party's families and kingdoms suffer. Usurpers claim thrones, devour wealth, and court wives who wait faithfully. The crew must survive impossible challenges while racing against time itself. As years stretch into a decade, they transform from soldiers into legends, from mortals into myth. The journey becomes not about physical distance but spiritual transformation—can they return home after becoming monsters themselves to survive?

This campaign combines maritime adventure, Greek mythology, puzzle-solving, and moral complexity. Players face choices between safety and honor, between their crew's survival and doing what's right. Every decision has consequences, and the gods are always watching, always judging.

## Core Themes

- **Identity and Transformation:** Can you go home after becoming someone else?
- **Loyalty vs. Survival:** When crew, family, and honor conflict

## Session Breakdown (30 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Cursed Departure (Sessions 1-4)

**Session 1:** Victory celebration at Troy turns sour. The captain commits hubris that earns divine wrath. The ship departs with full crew, heavy with plunder, eager for home.

**Session 2:** First island: the Lotus Eaters. Crew members eat the flowers and forget home, family, everything. Party must rescue them while resisting temptation of blissful oblivion.

**Session 3:** The party encounters another Greek ship, also lost. Exchange stories and warnings. The other ship is destroyed by storm that night—omen of what awaits them.

**Session 4:** Cicones raid—what should be easy plunder turns disastrous. Divine retribution begins. Storm scatters the fleet. The party's ship is alone, blown off course into unknown waters.

### Arc 2: Islands of Monsters (Sessions 5-12)

**Session 5:** Land of the Cyclopes. The party seeks supplies and shelter in a massive cave, only to be trapped by Polyphemus, son of Poseidon. Must use cunning to escape.

**Session 6:** Escape requires blinding the Cyclops. Success, but the captain taunts Polyphemus, revealing his true name. The Cyclops calls upon his father Poseidon for vengeance. The curse is sealed.

**Session 7:** Aeolus, Lord of Winds, gives the party a bag containing all contrary winds. Smooth sailing for days until crew's greed opens it, sending them back to start.

**Session 8:** The Laestrygonians—cannibal giants who destroy most of the fleet. Only the party's ship survives through desperate seamanship and sacrifice of rear guard.

**Session 9:** Aeaea, island of Circe the witch-goddess. She transforms crew into pigs. Party must negotiate, resist her magic, or find another solution.

**Session 10:** Circe becomes ally after party proves worthy. She warns of trials ahead and provides crucial advice: they must visit the Land of the Dead.

**Session 11:** Descent to the Underworld. The party sails to the edge of the world, digs a ritual trench, and summons shades of the dead to question them about their path home.

**Session 12:** In Hades, the party encounters fallen comrades from Troy, family members who died while they were away, and the prophet Tiresias who reveals hard truths about their future.

### Arc 3: The Gauntlet of Death (Sessions 13-18)

**Session 13:** The Sirens—beautiful voices promising knowledge and glory. The party must resist or be dashed on the rocks. Different solutions possible (wax in ears, tied to mast, etc.).

**Session 14:** Scylla and Charybdis—the impossible choice. Sail close to six-headed monster or ship-swallowing whirlpool. Either path costs lives. No good options.

**Session 15:** Helios's sacred cattle on Thrinacia. Crew is starving. The gods forbid eating these cattle on pain of death. But starvation is certain. Crew mutinies if party doesn't act.

**Session 16:** Zeus destroys the ship for eating the sacred cattle. Only those who didn't participate survive, clinging to wreckage, drifting for nine days.

**Session 17:** Washed ashore on Ogygia, island of the nymph Calypso. She offers immortality and paradise if they stay. Players face choice: godhood in prison or mortality heading home.

**Session 18:** Escape from Ogygia after years of captivity. Athena intervenes, Zeus orders release. The party builds a raft and sails, but Poseidon sends one last storm that destroys it.

### Arc 4: Among Strange Peoples (Sessions 19-24)

**Session 19:** Shipwrecked naked on Scheria, land of the Phaeacians. Must gain help from Princess Nausicaa and convince her father King Alcinous to aid them.

**Session 20:** The party tells their tale to the Phaeacian court. Flashback opportunities for players to narrate their version of events. The Phaeacians are moved and offer help.

**Session 21:** The Phaeacians sail the party home on magic ships. They arrive during the night, asleep, and awaken on their home shore after ten years away.

**Session 22:** Disguised by Athena, the party scouts their homeland. Usurpers have taken over, claiming the party died at Troy. Families under siege.

**Session 23:** Reunion with loyal servants and family members who recognize them despite disguises. Planning the assault on the usurpers.

**Session 25:** The contest—party proposes a challenge only they can complete (string a bow, solve a riddle, etc.). Usurpers fail; party succeeds, revealing identity.

**Session 26:** The reckoning—massive battle in the hall. Party and loyal followers vs. usurpers and their mercenaries. Divine aid arrives at crucial moment.

**Session 27:** Aftermath of violence. Judging collaborators, dispensing justice, reclaiming what was lost. Not everyone forgives absence or methods.

**Session 28:** The final test—spouses/family test party's identity with personal questions only real person would know. Emotional reunions or painful separations.

**Session 29:** Prophecy unfolds—Tiresias's predictions come true. The party must undertake one final journey to appease Poseidon or face continued divine wrath.

**Session 30:** Epilogue—the party travels inland until they meet people who don't know what an oar is. Plant the oar, sacrifice to Poseidon, earn final peace. Return home to rule wisely, telling tales of their odyssey.

## Key NPCs

**The Captain (Odysseus-figure)** - Brilliant but cursed leader whose hubris doomed the journey. Quick-witted, silver-tongued, pragmatic. Struggles between pride and crew's safety. Player characters' commander and sometimes antagonist.

**Athena, the Gray-Eyed Goddess** - Patron deity who aids the party with disguises, wisdom, and divine intervention. Tests them to ensure worthiness. Represents intelligence and strategic thinking.

**Poseidon, Earth-Shaker** - Antagonist god pursuing vengeance for Polyphemus. Sends storms and monsters. Implacable until properly appeased through long journey and sacrifice.

**Circe, the Witch of Aeaea** - Beautiful and dangerous sorceress who transforms men into beasts. Can become ally if impressed. Offers warnings and wisdom about future trials.

**Calypso, the Hidden One** - Lonely immortal nymph who offers paradise and eternal life. Genuinely cares for the party but her love is a prison. Represents temptation to abandon duty.

**Polyphemus, the Cyclops** - One-eyed cannibal giant, son of Poseidon. Brutal but not mindless—he's a shepherd who talks to his rams. His blinding triggers Poseidon's curse.

**Tiresias, the Blind Prophet** - Shade in the underworld who reveals truths about past and future. Cryptic but accurate. Provides crucial information about appeasing Poseidon.

**The Suitors** - Collective antagonist of nobles who consume the party's wealth and court their families. Each has distinct personality, from sympathetic to despicable.

**Penelope/Faithful Spouse** - Represents everything worth returning for. Clever, loyal, resourceful in defending home despite pressure to remarry. Tests party's identity at reunion.

**Telemachus/Heir** - Child grown to adulthood during absence. Seeks missing parents, struggles with usurpers, needs guidance becoming adult. Emotional anchor for homecoming.

**Eumaeus, the Loyal Servant** - Represents those who remained faithful despite everything. Aids party's return, provides intelligence, emotional grounding that not everyone betrayed them.

**Antinous, Lead Usurper** - Primary villain at home. Arrogant, cruel, but politically savvy. Genuinely believes party is dead and he has legitimate claim. Makes moral complexity.

## Major Locations

**The Wine-Dark Sea** - Ever-changing waters hiding islands, monsters, and divine wrath. Each voyage is dangerous. Weather reflects the gods' moods. Navigation requires skill and luck.

**Island of the Cyclopes** - Lawless land where one-eyed giants herd sheep and live in caves. No civilization, no respect for xenia. Danger and plenty coexist.

**Aeaea, Circe's Isle** - Magical island where animals are transformed humans. Lush, beautiful, dangerous. Circe's palace contains wonders and terrors.

**The Underworld** - Realm of the dead at world's edge. Dark shore where shades gather when blood is spilled. Heroes encounter ghosts of their past.

**The Sirens' Island** - Rocky shore littered with bones of sailors. Meadow of flowers hiding death. Beautiful voices promise forbidden knowledge.

**Strait of Scylla and Charybdis** - Narrow passage with monster on one side, whirlpool on other. Symbolizes impossible choices where loss is certain.

**Ogygia** - Paradise island, Calypso's prison. Beautiful but isolated from mortal world. Time flows strangely here. Immortality offered, freedom denied.

**Scheria, Land of Phaeacians** - Peaceful, prosperous kingdom near the gods. Their ships sail by thought alone. Last stop before true homecoming.

**Ithaca/Home** - Island kingdom overrun by usurpers. Palace defiled, wealth consumed, family besieged. Reclaiming it is spiritual and physical battle.

## Unique Mechanics

**Nostos (Homecoming) Meter:** Measures progress toward home. Divine favor increases it; hubris reduces it. Reaching zero means cursed to wander forever. Reaching maximum brings miraculous aid.

**Crew Loyalty:** Track crew's faith in leadership. Drops after losses or hard decisions. Low loyalty means mutiny. High loyalty means sacrifices for the party.

**Xenia (Guest-Right):** Breaking hospitality laws angers gods. Honoring them earns boons. Complex because hosts and guests have reciprocal obligations.

**Divine Attention:** Gods notice heroic deeds and hubris. High attention brings both aid and interference. Must balance glorying deeds with avoiding divine jealousy.

**Identity and Disguise:** Athena grants disguises. Party can hide identity for strategic advantage. But true identity must be proven at crucial moments.

**Prophecy Interpretation:** Tiresias and others speak in riddles. Party must interpret meaning and decide how to fulfill or avoid prophecies.

**Tale-Telling:** When recounting adventures, players narrate their versions. Good storytelling earns mechanical bonuses, hospitality, and fame.

**Temporal Distortion:** Different islands have different time flows. Years pass differently. Builds tragedy of too-late homecoming.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**The Captain's True Sin:** Hubris was worse than initially revealed. Captain desecrated a temple, murdered innocents in Troy's sack, or angered multiple gods.

**Crew Culpability:** Party discovers crew members also committed atrocities at Troy. They're all cursed, not just the captain. Collective punishment.

**Home Invaded:** Usurpers aren't just greedy—they have legitimate grievances. Party's family wronged them, or they filled power vacuum to prevent chaos.

**Divine Conspiracy:** Multiple gods have competing plans for the party. They're pawns in Olympian politics. Athena vs. Poseidon is just surface level.

**Circe's Warning Ignored:** One crew member is prophesied to betray the party. They're identified but party must choose whether to act on prophecy.

**Calypso's Offer Real:** Immortality is genuine. Choosing mortality over godhood has cosmic consequences. Gods respect or resent the choice.

**Someone Else on Throne:** Spouse remarried, believing party dead. They love the new spouse. Reclamation means destroying innocent life.

**Child Doesn't Remember:** Heir has no memory of absent parent, doesn't want them back, resents their return and violence.

**Poseidon's Offer:** The sea god appears, offering to end curse if party will eternally serve him. Trade one prison for another.

**Final Journey Endless:** Appeasing Poseidon requires journey so far inland they can never return to sea. Must choose between sea life and peace.

## Victory Conditions

**Standard Victory:** Return home, reclaim kingdom, reunite with family, appease Poseidon through final journey. Earn peaceful retirement telling tales.

**Perfect Victory:** Complete journey without losing crew to hubris, honor xenia throughout, reclaim home without excessive violence, achieve reconciliation with all gods.

**Legendary Return:** Accomplish seemingly impossible—save entire crew, defeat usurpers without bloodshed, broker peace between Athena and Poseidon, return as living legend.

**Divine Apotheosis:** Reject homecoming for immortality with Calypso or other deity. Become minor god of travelers, losing mortality but gaining eternal existence.

**New Kingdom:** Realize home has changed too much. Establish new kingdom elsewhere with loyal followers, starting fresh rather than reclaiming past.

## Defeat Conditions

**Lost at Sea:** Nostos meter reaches zero. Cursed to wander forever like Flying Dutchman, never reaching shore, eternally journeying.

**Crew Mutiny:** Loyalty too low. Crew murders party leadership and becomes pirates/monsters themselves, abandoning homecoming for survival.

**Divine Destruction:** Anger too many gods. Zeus personally destroys ship. Only shades remain, dwelling in Underworld, ultimate failure.

**False Homecoming:** Reach home but fail identity tests. Family rejects them as imposters. Die as beggars in own halls, unrecognized and unmourned.

**Usurpers Triumph:** Defeated in reclamation battle. Executed as pretenders to throne. Legacy destroyed, names forgotten, families enslaved.

**Trapped Forever:** Accept Calypso's offer but discover too late it's eternal prison. Paradise becomes hell. Immortal but unfree.

**Broken Prophecy:** Try to avoid all prophesied events, angering Fates themselves. Reality unravels. Existence becomes eternal torment in time loop.
