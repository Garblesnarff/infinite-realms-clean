# Creative Brief: The Harvest Moon Academy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Honest Rural Realism with Seasonal Beauty

Inspired by the grounded, authentic aesthetic of Silver Spoon, with emphasis on realistic farm work, the beauty and harshness of agricultural life, seasonal changes, and honest portrayal of animals and labor. This style aims to capture the heartfelt, educational, wholesome, grounding, and reflective tone of "The Harvest Moon Academy."

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Honest Portrayal:** Show both the beauty and difficulty of farm work without romanticizing or condemning it.
*   **Respect for Labor:** Depict work as dignified and meaningful, with visible sweat, dirt, and effort rendered positively.
*   **Seasonal Authenticity:** Emphasize how seasons truly affect farm life, from muddy spring fields to harsh winter conditions.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Heartfelt, educational, wholesome, grounding, reflective, realistic, honest, seasonal, hardworking, meaningful.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of honest connection to real work and life cycles. The atmosphere should feel like earth under fingernails and satisfaction of a job well done.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, confident line work that conveys solidity and groundedness. Characters and animals drawn with realistic proportions and authentic detail. Farm equipment and buildings rendered accurately.
*   **Forms:** Strong, practical forms dominate – sturdy buildings, solid animals, useful tools. Characters develop from soft/uncertain to confident/capable in their postures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A realistic illustration of a farm barn and fields with clean, confident line work. Authentic agricultural details, solid construction, practical design emphasizing functionality."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Natural, seasonal colors – green growth of spring/summer, golden harvest tones of autumn, white and gray winter, brown earth throughout. Colors are realistic, not oversaturated. Sunrise and sunset lighting is common.
*   **Texture:** Slightly textured like quality paper or canvas. Colors feel natural and grounded. Dirt, mud, straw, and other farm textures are visible and authentic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a natural seasonal color palette with rich earth browns, green growing crops, golden grain fields, and realistic sky colors. Natural textures suggesting dirt, straw, and honest work."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic character designs showing visible progression from clean/uncertain city students to dirty/confident farm workers. Work clothes that get worn and stained. Expressions showing effort, satisfaction, and growth.
*   **Expression:** Initial confusion and exhaustion gradually shifting to competence and satisfaction. Pride in honest work. Sometimes sadness or contemplation regarding farming's realities.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A student character in worn work clothes with dirt smudges, realistic proportions, showing both exhaustion and satisfaction. Hands visibly roughened from farm work. Honest, grounded style."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Detailed, authentic farm environments – barns with realistic construction, fields in various states of cultivation, animal pens, equipment storage. Changes dramatically with seasons.
*   **Atmosphere:** Working farm atmosphere – always something happening, tools in use, evidence of labor. Early morning and late afternoon lighting common. Weather affects everything.
*   **Details:** Farm equipment accurately depicted, animals with individual characteristics, crops at various growth stages, mud/dust/straw everywhere, seasonal decorations for festivals.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed farm landscape at sunrise with realistic barns, tilled fields, grazing animals, and working equipment. Seasonal details suggesting spring planting. Authentic agricultural atmosphere with morning mist and golden light."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, realistic lighting that emphasizes time of day and season. Early morning and dusk are important farming times. Harsh summer sun, soft spring rain light, crisp winter clarity.
*   **Shadows:** Realistic shadows that convey time and atmosphere. Long shadows at sunrise/sunset during farm work. Shadows emphasize the physicality of work.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting conveys the reality of farm schedules (early mornings), seasonal differences, and the beauty in honest work at all times of day.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by golden sunrise lighting casting long shadows across dewy fields. Natural, realistic lighting emphasizing early morning farm work atmosphere. Warm but clear agricultural lighting."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Grounded, honest compositions showing work in progress. Wide shots of farm landscapes with human scale for perspective. Medium shots of work activities. Close-ups of hands working, animals' faces, and crop details.
*   **Techniques:** Before/after comparisons showing seasonal progression. Character growth shown through body language and capability. Respect for animals shown through careful portrayal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A composition showing students working in a field with realistic perspective. Foreground shows detailed farm work in progress, middle ground shows other students and animals, background shows full farm vista. Honest, grounded framing that respects the labor."

## Voice

A warm, mature male voice with a slight rural accent, speaking with the quiet authority of experience. The tone is patient and educational but never condescending, conveying genuine respect for farming and those who learn it. The pacing is measured and thoughtful, like someone explaining important things that take time to understand. The emotion blends satisfaction in honest work, respect for life and death, and gentle encouragement for those learning difficult lessons. Audio quality is clear and natural, like a mentor speaking while working alongside you, with subtle background sounds of farm life – animals, wind, distant equipment. Role: An experienced farmer teaching the next generation, or the narrator of a documentary about agriculture and growth.
