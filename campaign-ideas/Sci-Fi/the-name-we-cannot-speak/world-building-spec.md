### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Name We Cannot Speak**

**Core Concept:** In the conquered Palm (fantasy Renaissance Italy), Brandin of Ygrath magically erased the name "Tigana" in grief-fueled vengeance. Players are Tiganese resistance and allies fighting to kill Brandin, restore their name, and preserve cultural memory before the last generation who remembers dies.

**Key Factions:**
- **The Tiganese Resistance:** Led by Prince Alessan, seeking to kill Brandin and restore their erased name.
- **Brandin of Ygrath and Court:** Western tyrant who rules competently but erased Tigana, slowly dying from sustaining the spell.
- **Alberico of Barbadior:** Eastern tyrant ruling through brutal oppression, represents worse alternative.
- **Other Conquered Provinces:** Each with their own griefs, some support resistance, many just want peace.
- **Dianora and Palace Loyalists:** Those who serve Brandin, some genuinely, some as secret resistance.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Palm:** Nine conquered provinces in fantasy Renaissance Italy setting.
- **Chiara:** Brandin's island fortress and palace.
- **Stevanien:** Under Alberico's brutal rule, showing the alternative to Brandin.
- **Sanctuaries of Eanna:** Neutral religious sites where some truth survives.
- **Mountain Sanctuaries:** Where Tiganese culture is preserved in secret.

**Magic Systems:**
- **Sorcery (Rare):** Only Brandin and Alberico are true sorcerers, nearly god-like power.
- **The Spell of Erasure:** Brandin's magic makes "Tigana" unperceivable to those born after, slowly killing him to sustain.
- **Memory Magic:** Cultural preservation, art, and ritual can weaken sorcerous erasure.
- **Ember Night Ritual:** Ancient celebration that can disrupt Brandin's spell if performed correctly.

**Unique Mechanics:**
- **Perception Block:** Younger characters cannot perceive "Tigana" until inducted through ritual.
- **Memory as Power:** Preserving culture through art/music/stories grants mechanical benefits and weakens erasure.
- **Complex Loyalty:** Relationship tracking with multiple factions, no clear villains.
- **Cultural Resistance:** Teaching, performing rituals, creating art builds Resistance points.
- **The Impossible Choice:** Kill Brandin (justice but empowers Alberico) or find third path.
