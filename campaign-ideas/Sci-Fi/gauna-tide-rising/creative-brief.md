# Creative Brief: Gauna Tide Rising

## Art Style: Hard Sci-Fi with Cosmic Horror (Knights of Sidonia Aesthetic)

Realistic space physics, biomechanical mecha, and shapeshifting alien horror. This style emphasizes the loneliness of deep space, resource scarcity, and the terror of incomprehensible aliens.

### Core Principles:

*   **Hard Sci-Fi Realism:** Realistic physics—no sound in space, momentum matters, vacuum is hostile.
*   **Biomechanical Design:** Guardians look grown, not built—organic curves with mechanical components.
*   **Cosmic Horror:** Gauna defy geometry—shifting masses of gold/white that suggest intelligence but no pattern.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Sidonia Interior:** Grays, industrial metals, dim lighting. Utilitarian and crowded.
*   **Space:** Pure black with distant stars. Silence and isolation.
*   **Guardians:** White/gray biomechanical armor with glowing red sensors.
*   **Gauna:** Shifting gold/white masses that reflect light wrong, suggesting impossible geometries.

**Character Design:**
*   **Pilots:** Diverse but uniformed. Standardized flight suits. Many have subtle genetic modifications (pointed ears from photosynthesis, androgynous features from third gender).
*   **Captain Kobayashi:** Always masked, formal military uniform, unnaturally calm.
*   **Tsumugi:** Human upper body emerging from massive Gauna tentacles—beautiful and horrifying.

**Guardian Design:**
*   Humanoid biomechs, organic white armor with exposed muscle-like actuators.
*   Kabizashi appear as extending spear-like tentacles.
*   Damaged Guardians bleed and show viscera—they're alive.

**Voice:** Calm, measured, professional even under horror—trained to suppress panic in the void. Speaks in clipped military jargon. Occasional cracks showing terror beneath composure.

## Music Palette:
*   Minimalist electronic ambience—vast empty spaces conveyed through sparse notes.
*   Tense strings during Gauna encounters.
*   Melancholic piano for deaths and loss.
