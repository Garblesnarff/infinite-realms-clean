# Creative Brief: The Titan Vanguard

## Art Style: Epic Scale Military Sci-Fi (Pacific Rim-inspired)

Inspired by *Pacific Rim*, emphasizing massive scale, military precision, and the beauty of giant mechs fighting colossal monsters.

### Core Principles:
*   **Emphasize Scale:** Humans are tiny. Colossi are huge. Titans are even bigger.
*   **Military Aesthetics:** Functional design, military bases, disciplined organization.
*   **Epic Destruction:** Cities crumble, oceans churn, battles reshape landscapes.

### Color Palette:
*   Military grays and blues for Colossi and bases.
*   Bioluminescent blues and toxic greens for Titans.
*   Ocean blues and storm grays for environments.

### Voice:
A commanding, inspirational voice—military cadence, rallying troops. The emotion balances duty with hope. Audio has klaxons, radio chatter, ocean sounds. Role: A Marshal giving a pre-battle speech before the final assault.
