## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Titan Vanguard
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Giant Mech vs Kaiju / Military Sci-Fi / Monster Hunter
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **13–15**
**Tone (keywords):** epic scale, military, monster-hunting, drift-compatible, humanity's last stand, sacrifice
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Massive aberrations called Titans have emerged from a planar rift at the bottom of the ocean, attacking coastal cities and threatening civilization. The party are pilots of Warforged Colossi—magically-powered giant mechanical constructs that require two pilots mentally linked through the Drift to control. As Titan attacks escalate and humanity's defenses crumble, the party must master Drift compatibility, hunt increasingly dangerous Titans, uncover the truth about where they come from, and ultimately close the rift before the world is destroyed.

## What "Medium-High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Giant-scale combat against massive monsters, coordinated team tactics, environmental destruction, and the psychological strain of mental bonding.
*   **Investigation:** Understanding Titan biology, uncovering the rift's origin, and dealing with internal political threats to the program.
*   **Consequences:** Cities are destroyed when Titans aren't stopped. Pilots die. The Drift reveals traumatic memories. Failure means extinction.
