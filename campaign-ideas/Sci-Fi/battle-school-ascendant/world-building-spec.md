### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Battle School Ascendant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are exceptional young prodigies recruited to Strategos Academy, a military school training them to lead armies against the Formics—an insectoid alien race that nearly destroyed civilization. Through increasingly brutal war games and psychological manipulation, they discover they've been fighting real battles, not simulations. Their "graduation exercise" was actually genocide against a species trying to communicate peace, forcing them to grapple with complicity, redemption, and the ethics of war.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the First Formic War, when humanity first encountered the Formics and barely survived their initial invasion.
    *   Write the legend of Mazer Rackham, who discovered the Formic hive mind's weakness and won the Second Formic War by killing a Queen.
    *   Describe the creation of Strategos Academy and the International Fleet—humanity's desperate response to prepare for the Third Formic War.
    *   Explain Formic biology and hive mind psychology—individual workers lack sentience, but Queens possess profound intelligence and empathy.
    *   Detail the tragedy of miscommunication—why the First Formic War happened (Formics didn't recognize humans as sentient individuals) and why humanity never learned the truth.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The International Fleet** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Prevent Formic extinction of humanity by any means necessary.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Military command structure led by the Strategos (supreme commander) and Polemarch (fleet admiral).
        *   **Public Agenda:** Defend Earth and human colonies from alien annihilation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Use child prodigies as weapons through psychological manipulation; commit preemptive genocide to ensure Formic threat ends permanently.
        *   **Assets:** Strategos Academy, advanced starships, ansible communication (instant across any distance), global political authority.
        *   **Relationships:** Humanity's protectors; willing to sacrifice individuals (including children) for species survival.
    *   **Strategos Academy** (Major - Institutional)
        *   **Goals:** Train tactical geniuses to command humanity's fleets.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Commander Graff leads, with various teachers and psychological officers beneath him.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Education and elite military training for the best and brightest.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Psychologically condition children into weapons without empathy, using isolation, pressure, and manipulation.
        *   **Assets:** The Battle Room, advanced simulation technology (actually remote fleet command), psychological warfare expertise.
        *   **Relationships:** Serves the International Fleet; exploits talented children; produces war heroes at the cost of their humanity.
    *   **The Formic Collective** (Major - Extinct by campaign's end)
        *   **Goals:** (Former) Expansion and understanding of other sentient life.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Queens possess individual intelligence and telepathic connection. Workers are extensions of the Queen's will.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Unknown—humanity never established communication.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** (Revealed posthumously) The Formics sought peace after realizing humans were sentient, but couldn't communicate effectively before humanity's preemptive strike.
        *   **Assets:** (Former) Elegant biotechnology, faster-than-light travel, hive mind coordination.
        *   **Relationships:** Victims of xenophobic genocide; posthumously revealed as potential allies.
    *   **The Speakers for the Dead** (Minor - Emerges post-campaign)
        *   **Goals:** Speak truth about the deceased, particularly the Formics; prevent future xenocide through understanding.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized movement, individual Speakers who travel as truth-tellers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Memorialize the dead truthfully, without bias.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Atone for humanity's genocide by ensuring the Formic truth is never forgotten.
        *   **Assets:** Moral authority, telepathic connection to the last Formic Queen, the truth about the Third War.
        *   **Relationships:** Founded by the party; opposed by militarists; supported by pacifists and guilt-ridden survivors.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Commander Hyrum Graff:** Head of Strategos Academy, cold manipulator, believes he saved humanity through monstrous means.
    *   **Mazer Rackham:** War hero and instructor, blunt and pragmatic, carries trauma from killing the Formic Queen.
    *   **Bonzo Madrid:** Rival student leader, arrogant and cruel, embodies toxic military culture.
    *   **The Formic Queen (Last):** Sole survivor of her species, wise and mournful, offers forgiveness despite genocide.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Talented Cadet (Brilliant but pressured young prodigy)"
    *   "Rival Army Commander (Competitive student leader)"
    *   "Academy Instructor (Manipulative teacher using psychological warfare)"
    *   "Formic Worker (Insectoid drone, elegant and coordinated)"
    *   "Fleet Officer (Military professional comfortable with moral compromise)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **Strategos Academy:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Battle Room (zero-gravity combat sphere), the dormitories (assigned by "army"), the mess hall (social hierarchy made visible), Commander Graff's office.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Cadets (ages 6-16), instructors, psychological officers, support staff.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Military rations, basic supplies, no luxuries—austerity is part of training.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A cadet is being bullied and asks for help, an instructor administers a surprise psychological test, rumors spread about impossible Battle Room scenarios, Graff observes the party from a distance, a rival challenges the party to an impromptu competition.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Some cadets never return from Command School—where do they go?" "The Battle Room scenarios are getting impossible on purpose." "Graff is watching one of you specifically—he has a plan."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Sterile white corridors, uniformed children, harsh lighting, the Battle Room's impossible white sphere), Sound (Marching footsteps, whispered strategies, alarms signaling battle schedules), Smell (Antiseptic, recycled air, institutional food).
    *   **The Battle Room:**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The entrance gates (where armies spawn), the enemy gate (far end, goal to reach), geometric obstacles (floating cubes, cylinders, walls).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Combat teams during scheduled battles, empty otherwise.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None—purely a combat training environment.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** N/A—this location is only accessed during structured battles.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Battle Room's obstacles can change mid-match if Graff wants to test you." "Some armies practice forbidden tactics in secret sessions." "Zero gravity combat skills translate to real fleet command—somehow."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Blinding white in all directions, geometric obstacles, teams in colored uniforms), Sound (Echoes in the enclosed sphere, commanders shouting orders, the hiss of non-lethal weapons), Smell (None—sterile, temperature-controlled environment).
    *   **The Formic Homeworld (Ruins):**
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The destroyed hive cities (organic architecture now lifeless), the Queen's Chamber (where the last Queen lies in stasis), crystallized forests (alien ecosystem frozen by the M.D. Device).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** None—completely lifeless after the xenocide. Later, human colonists arrive.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Archaeological sites, Formic artifacts, moral horror.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** Party discovers Formic art and realizes its beauty, find a nursery with destroyed eggs, encounter human colonists who don't know the truth, stumble upon a Formic library of genetic memories, experience psychic echoes of the Queen's final moments.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Queen left something behind—a message or a last child." "The Formics were building a communication device when humanity attacked." "Some colonists claim to hear singing in the ruins—the Queen's grief made manifest."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Elegant organic structures now gray and lifeless, bioluminescent lights long extinguished, geometric patterns suggesting intelligence), Sound (Absolute silence, wind through empty corridors, the party's own breathing), Smell (Dust, decay, a faint sweetness from ancient Formic resin).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players refuse to activate the M.D. Device during the Final Exam.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where Graff takes control remotely and activates it anyway. The players realize they never had true agency—the genocide was inevitable. This deepens their trauma and guilt.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the truth about the simulations before the Final Exam.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a confrontation with Graff where he justifies the manipulation. The players can sabotage the Final Exam (saving the Formics but dooming Earth in the eyes of humanity) or play along to expose the truth later.
    *   **IF:** The players kill Bonzo Madrid during their confrontation.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where Graff uses the incident to further isolate the party, claiming it proves they have the ruthlessness needed for command. This becomes a source of guilt.
    *   **IF:** The players communicate successfully with the Formic Queen and learn the truth.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where they must protect the Queen's egg from military forces. Their choice determines whether humanity learns from xenocide or repeats it.
    *   **IF:** The players accept their role as war heroes and hide the truth.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where they live in luxury and fame but are haunted by nightmares and guilt. They become symbols of humanity's triumph through genocide.
    *   **IF:** The players expose the truth about the Third Formic War.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where humanity fractures—some see the party as heroes of conscience, others as traitors. The party founds the Speakers for the Dead movement.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully hatch the Formic Queen's egg and establish peaceful contact.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the new Formic Queen and humanity begin cautious coexistence. The party becomes ambassadors between species, redeeming genocide through understanding.
