# The Rainbow Veil
## *Where Water Spirits Paint the Sky*

### Campaign Overview

Victoria's Thunder, the world's largest waterfall, generates a perpetual rainbow so massive and brilliant that it can be seen from 50 miles away. For centuries, local tribes have revered the Prismatic Veil, believing it to be a bridge between the mortal realm and the Spirit Lands. They were right. The rainbow is a living gateway maintained by the Seven Keepers—primordial water spirits, each embodying one color of the spectrum, who use the waterfall's mist to paint reality itself.

But the Veil is fading. An upstream dam project is reducing water flow, weakening the Keepers' connection to the physical world. As the rainbow dims, the barrier between realms becomes unstable. Spirit creatures bleed through into mortality, trapped and confused. Mortals inadvertently cross into Spirit Lands and vanish. Worst of all, the Keepers themselves are fragmenting—their unified consciousness splitting as they lose the power of unified spectrum.

The party arrives when the first major breach occurs: An entire village phases halfway into the Spirit Lands, its inhabitants stuck between worlds. The Keepers reach out desperately, their voices carried on mist and light. The campaign becomes a race to restore the waterfall's power while navigating both political challenges (the dam serves thousands) and spiritual trials (earning each Keeper's trust). Success means unifying the seven colors again. Failure means the permanent collapse of the boundary between mortality and spirit—a merging that would destroy both realms.

### Core Themes

- **Unity in Diversity**: Seven distinct beings creating something greater together
- **Natural vs Industrial**: Progress threatens ancient balance
- **Liminal Spaces**: The threshold between worlds, neither one nor the other
- **Spectrum of Experience**: Each color represents different aspect of existence
- **Flow and Change**: Water teaches that nothing is permanent, all is transition

### Major Locations

**Victoria's Thunder** (The Waterfall)
- Height: 354 feet
- Width: 5,600 feet
- Flow rate: 1,088 cubic meters per second (full), currently reduced to 400
- The Rainbow: Visible arc spanning entire width, seven distinct color bands
- Effect: Standing in the mist induces visions, temporary spiritual sight

**The Phasing Village** (Partially in Spirit Lands)
- Population: 300, currently stuck between worlds
- Appearance: Buildings flicker between solid and translucent
- Inhabitants age differently (time flows strangely between realms)
- If not rescued within 40 days, trapped permanently

**The Seven Domains** (Trial Locations)
- **Red's Crucible**: Cave behind the waterfall, constant roar, intense pressure
- **Orange's Garden**: Sunlit clearing where mist creates perpetual rainbows
- **Yellow's Observatory**: Crystal cave where all light refracts perfectly

- **Blue's Depths**: Underwater cavern, must hold breath and face drowning
- **Indigo's Labyrinth**: Mist maze that changes based on thoughts
- **Violet's Threshold**: The exact point where realms touch

**The Spirit Lands** (Parallel Realm)
- Description: Physical world but more vibrant, more alive, more dangerous
- Geography mirrors mortal realm but exaggerated
- Time flows differently: One day there = one hour mortal, or vice versa
- Navigation: Requires spiritual sight or Keeper guidance
- Hazard: Mortals can become lost, eventually transform into spirits

**The Dam (Upstream Barrier)** (50 Miles Upriver)
- Modern construction, 200 feet tall
- Provides irrigation for 20,000 acres farmland
- Drinking water for three major towns
- Hydroelectric power for region
- Cannot simply destroy without causing humanitarian crisis

### Unique Mechanics

**Spiritual Sight**
- Standing in waterfall mist for 1 hour grants temporary ability to see spirits
- Duration: 24 hours
- Benefit: See Spirit Lands overlaid on physical world, communicate with Keepers
- Risk: Seeing both realms simultaneously is disorienting (Wisdom saves or confusion)

**Color Attunement**
- After passing each Keeper's trial, gain attunement to that color
- Mechanical benefits (DM choice):
  - Red: +2 damage when passionate about cause
  - Orange: Advantage on creativity/performance checks
  - Yellow: Cast *identify* or *detect magic* 1/day
  - Green: Advantage on mediation/diplomacy
  - Blue: Resistance to psychic damage
  - Indigo: Advantage on Insight checks
  - Violet: Brief intangibility 1/day (1 round)

**Realm Phasing**
- In unstable areas, reality shifts between mortal and spirit
- Dexterity save DC 15 when phasing occurs or become stuck between
- Stuck characters exist in both realms simultaneously (confusing, dangerous)
- Can be rescued by those with spiritual sight

**The Spectrum Unity**
- When all seven party members (or NPCs) channel different colors simultaneously:
- Combined magic becomes prismatic (all damage types)
- Can repair tears in reality
- Can fully manifest or banish spirits
- Required for final ritual to restore Veil

**Water Flow Tracker**
- Current flow: 400 cubic meters/second (37% of full)
- Each week, dam reduces it further (engineering needs)
- Below 300: Keepers can no longer manifest physically
- Below 200: Veil begins tearing permanently
- At 100: Complete collapse, realms merge

### Plot Twists

**The Dam Isn't the Only Problem**
- Natural drought upstream is reducing river flow
- Even removing dam wouldn't restore full flow immediately
- Must find magical solution: Rainmaking ritual, underground spring, etc.
- Time pressure increases

**Violet's True Plan**
- Violet secretly helping the drought along
- Believes merger is evolution, not catastrophe
- Has been whispering to mortal engineers, encouraging dam expansion
- Not evil, just fundamentally disagrees with other Keepers
- Can Violet be convinced, or must Violet be bound?

**The Phasing Village Wants to Stay**
- Some villagers prefer Spirit Lands
- Life is more vibrant, meaningful, magical there
- Split community: Some want rescue, some want full transition
- Party must decide: Respect choice or force rescue?

**The Eighth Color**
- Legends mention Eighth Keeper (Ultraviolet/Infrared—beyond perception)
- Eighth rejected physical existence, became pure concept
- Can be summoned as ultimate solution
- But Eighth doesn't care about mortal/spirit distinction
- Might solve problem by destroying both realms and remaking them

**Shaman's Heritage**
- Zephyra reveals she's child of previous realm-merger attempt
- Her existence proves merger CAN create stable hybrid beings
- She's living proof Violet might be right
- But she's also unique—most merger attempts fail catastrophically

**The Keepers' Doubt**
- After millennia maintaining the Veil, they're tired
- Some agree with Violet more than they admit
- Green Keeper especially is conflicted
- Party must convince them separation is still worth maintaining

### Victory Conditions

**The Restored Veil: Seven Colors United**
- Solve water flow problem (dam compromise or magical solution)
- Pass all seven trials, earn all Keepers' trust
- Perform Unity Ritual with all seven colors
- Violet Keeper convinced or bound to group decision
- Result: Veil fully restored, stronger than before, phasing village rescued, stable boundary maintained

**The Managed Merger: Violet's Compromise**
- Accept Violet's argument has merit
- Instead of preventing merger, control and limit it
- Create designated "thin places" where crossing is safe
- Establish regulated contact between realms
- Result: New hybrid reality, some mixing allowed, requires constant management

**The New Guardians: Mortal Keepers**
- Keepers retire, pass responsibility to worthy mortals
- Party members (or NPCs) become new Spectrum Guardians
- Must maintain Veil themselves going forward
- Result: More accessible relationship, but heavy burden on guardians

### Defeat Conditions

**The Shattered Spectrum**
- Fail too many trials, Keepers lose faith in mortals
- Unity Ritual impossible without all seven
- Veil collapses uncontrolled
- Realms crash together chaotically
- Both realms damaged, thousands die or transform involuntarily

**The Violet Ascension**
- Violet's plan succeeds, forced merger
- Spirit Lands overlay physical completely
- Mortals transform into spirits (lose physical form)
- Spirits gain physicality (trapped, vulnerable)
- Neither realm survives intact, hybrid existence unstable

**The Drought Victory**
- Water flow reaches zero before solution found
- Waterfall stops entirely
- Rainbow disappears
- Keepers fade from existence
- Veil gone forever, barrier maintained only by distance
- Spirit Lands become inaccessible (or vice versa)
