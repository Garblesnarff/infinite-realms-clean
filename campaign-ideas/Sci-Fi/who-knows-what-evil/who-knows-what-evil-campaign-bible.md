# Campaign Bible: Who Knows What Evil

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Pact of the Living Shade
Lamont Cranston did not merely learn hypnosis in the Orient; he became a vessel. Deep within the forbidden monasteries of the Himalayas, he discovered the *Tulpa-Vara*, the "Living Shade." It is not a technique, but a semi-sentient metaphysical parasite that feeds on human guilt. Cranston struck a pact: he would become its host, feeding it the terror of the guilty to prevent it from consuming the innocent. When The Shadow laughs, it is not performance; it is the entity within him vibrating with the anticipation of a meal. The power to "cloud men's minds" is the entity briefly overlapping the victim's consciousness with the Void, erasing their perception of the present moment.

### Timeline of the Metropolis
1.  **1899:** The City is founded on a drained swamp previously used as a mass grave for plague victims; the ground remains perpetually damp and cold.
2.  **1905:** The "Great Smog" lasts for 40 days; when it clears, three new skyscrapers exist that no one remembers building.
3.  **1912:** The Five Families form the Syndicate, signing the pact in blood on the skin of the previous mayor.
4.  **1918:** *The Whisper Plague* hits the city. Victims didn't cough; they confessed their darkest secrets in their sleep until they died of exhaustion.
5.  **1924:** Prohibition begins. The "Moonshine" sold by the Donatelli family is revealed to be distilled from ectoplasm, causing drinkers to see ghosts.
6.  **1929:** The Stock Market Crash. On Black Tuesday, bankers were seen jumping from windows but vanishing before hitting the pavement.
7.  **1931:** Lamont Cranston returns to the city. The first appearance of The Shadow; a mugger is found laughing hysterically, his hair turned stark white.
8.  **1933:** The "Day of No Shadows." For 24 hours, light sources cast no shadows in the city. Physics seemed to glitch. The Shadow was powerless this day.
9.  **1934:** The Subway Collapse. A new tunnel broke into a cavern filled with non-Euclidean geometry. The line was sealed, but things still crawl out.
10. **1935 (Current Year):** The construction of the *Zenith Spire* begins. It is designed to be a radio tower, but blueprints suggest it is a Tesla-coil weapon.

### The Metaphysical "Why"
The City acts as a "Psychic Capacitor." The sheer density of corruption, greed, and desperation has thinned the veil between reality and the *Umbra* (the shadow dimension). Evil here isn't just a moral choice; it is a conductive force that summons entities from the Umbra. The Shadow fights to keep the voltage from overloading the world.
