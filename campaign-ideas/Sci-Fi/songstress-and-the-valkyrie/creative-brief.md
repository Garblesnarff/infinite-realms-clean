# Creative Brief: Songstress and the Valkyrie

## Art Style: 80s Space Opera Meets J-Pop Idol Culture (Macross Aesthetic)

Vibrant space battles, transforming mecha mid-flight, and concert stages amid war. This style blends sleek sci-fi with pop culture spectacle, romantic drama, and explosive dogfights.

### Core Principles:

*   **Transformation:** Show Variable Fighters morphing seamlessly between jet, hybrid, and robot modes.
*   **Idol Spectacle:** Concert performances are as visually stunning as battles—lights, stages, dramatic singing poses.
*   **Romance:** Characters in romantic moments (blushing, longing looks, love triangle tension).
*   **Speed:** Dogfights emphasize motion blur, vapor trails, missiles streaking.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Variable Fighters:** White with red/blue accents (VF-1 Valkyrie), sleek and aerodynamic.
*   **Zentraedi Ships:** Organic purple/green bio-mechanical designs, alien and imposing.
*   **Concert Scenes:** Vibrant stage lights—pinks, blues, spotlights on the singer.
*   **Space Battles:** Black void with colorful explosions, laser fire, and transformation flashes.

**Character Design:**
*   **Pilots:** Flight suits with helmets, athletic builds, determined expressions.
*   **Lynn Minmay:** Idol outfit (frilly dress or sailor uniform), twin-tailed hair, bright eyes, holding a microphone.
*   **Zentraedi:** Giant aliens (15+ meters tall when un-micronized), pointed ears, warrior features. When micronized, human-sized but exotic.

**Variable Fighter Design:**
*   **Fighter Mode:** Sleek jet with swept wings, missiles under wings.
*   **Gerwalk:** Jet with extended legs, hovering awkwardly.
*   **Battroid:** Humanoid robot with jet parts forming backpack and armor.
*   Transformations shown in dynamic sequences—panels shifting, wings folding.

**Voice:** Dual tones—confident fighter pilot (military jargon, "Fox 2, missile away!") transitioning to romantic softness or excited idol enthusiasm ("Everyone, let's sing together!").

## Music Palette:
*   J-pop idol songs during concerts (upbeat, hopeful, romantic).
*   Orchestral space opera for battles (sweeping strings, triumphant brass).
*   Emotional ballads for character moments (piano, gentle vocals).
*   Iconic: "Do You Remember Love?" (romantic ballad that ends war).
