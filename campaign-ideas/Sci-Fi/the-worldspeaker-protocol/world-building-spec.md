### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Worldspeaker Protocol**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Twelve massive obsidian Monoliths appear simultaneously worldwide. The party's linguist is recruited to decode the strange circular script and sounds emanating from them. They discover the Monoliths house the Chronari—beings who perceive time non-linearly. As global tensions rise toward war, the party must master the language that rewrites time perception to understand the warning: a future war will end civilization, which only communication across time can prevent.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the day the Monoliths arrived and the initial global response—panic, wonder, and mobilization.
    *   Write the history of the Chronari—a species that evolved to perceive time non-linearly, experiencing past, present, and future simultaneously.
    *   Describe the Chronari language—a circular, palindromic system that restructures neural pathways to enable non-linear time perception.
    *   Explain why the Chronari came—in every timeline where they don't intervene, humanity destroys itself in a catastrophic war within a generation.
    *   Detail the formation of the international linguistic response team and the political tensions it creates.
    *   Describe the mechanics of how learning the language gradually shifts one's time perception.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Linguistic Team (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Establish communication with the Chronari, prevent war, understand the message.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by senior linguists, physicists, and the party members.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Scientific discovery and peaceful first contact.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some members have personal motivations—academic glory, redemption, or seeking answers about time and mortality.
        *   **Assets:** Access to the Monoliths, international support (initially), brilliant minds, emerging ability to perceive time non-linearly.
        *   **Relationships:** Supported by diplomatic factions; opposed by military hawks; scrutinized by global public.
    *   **The Diplomatic Coalition** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Prevent war between nations, facilitate peaceful contact, manage global panic.
        *   **Hierarchy:** International coalition of diplomats, UN-style organization.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Maintaining peace and coordinating research.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Deeply divided internally between those who see opportunity and those who see threat.
        *   **Assets:** Political influence, communication networks, legitimacy.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with the linguistic team; opposed by military faction; struggling to maintain control.
    *   **The Military Faction** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Protect national sovereignty, eliminate perceived threat, demonstrate strength.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Various national militaries, led by hawkish generals.
        *   **Public Agenda:** National defense and security.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some seek to capture Chronari technology; others genuinely fear alien invasion.
        *   **Assets:** Military force, political influence in some nations, public fear to exploit.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed to the linguistic team and diplomats; pressure from frightened populations.
    *   **The Chronari** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Prevent humanity's self-destruction by teaching non-linear time perception through language.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Unknown—they may not have hierarchy as linear beings understand it.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None that linear beings can fully understand.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** From their perspective, they've already experienced every possible outcome of their intervention simultaneously.
        *   **Assets:** Technology beyond comprehension, ability to exist partially outside time, infinite patience.
        *   **Relationships:** Neither hostile nor friendly by human standards—they simply are, trying to give a gift.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The linguist advances in Chronari language learning.
    *   **THEN:** They begin experiencing temporal visions—glimpses of future events. Generate prophetic dreams and waking visions. They begin speaking out of temporal order.
    *   **IF:** Global tensions reach critical levels.
    *   **THEN:** Military forces prepare to attack. Generate ultimatums, troop movements, and countdown to violence.
    *   **IF:** The party shares a temporal vision with world leaders.
    *   **THEN:** Those who see it are changed. Generate scenes of leaders grappling with foreknowledge of consequences. Some become advocates for peace.
    *   **IF:** A military attack on the Monoliths is launched.
    *   **THEN:** The attack fails but triggers international conflict. Generate scenes of war between human nations over the Monoliths. The Chronari remain patient.
    *   **IF:** The linguist fully masters the Chronari language.
    *   **THEN:** They perceive all time simultaneously—past, present, future. Generate a profound scene where they experience their entire life at once, including their death and all moments with loved ones.
    *   **IF:** The party prevents the war by facilitating understanding.
