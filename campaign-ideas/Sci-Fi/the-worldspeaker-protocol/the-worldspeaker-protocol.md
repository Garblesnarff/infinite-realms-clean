# The Worldspeaker Protocol

*A Linguistic Mystery / First Contact campaign — Medium Campaign (10–12 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Worldspeaker Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Linguistic Mystery / First Contact / Time Manipulation
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** contemplative, linguistic, mysterious, anti-war, temporal, peaceful, cerebral
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Twelve massive obsidian monoliths have appeared simultaneously across the world, floating above major cities and defying all attempts at divination or study. When the party's linguist is recruited to help decode the strange circular script and haunting sounds emanating from the structures, they discover the Monoliths are vessels for the Chronari—beings who perceive time non-linearly and communicate through a language that rewrites how one experiences causality. As global tensions rise toward war over the Monoliths' presence, the party must master the Chronari language to understand their message: a warning about a future war that will end civilization, which only communication across time can prevent.

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Primarily social, linguistic, and intellectual challenges. Combat is rare and usually represents failure of diplomacy.
*   **Investigation:** Decoding an alien language, understanding non-linear time perception, and preventing escalating political tensions.
*   **Consequences:** The party's success in understanding the Chronari determines whether peace or war prevails. Time itself may be malleable.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act journey from confusion to understanding to transcendence.

*   **Act I — The Arrival (Sessions 1–4):** The Monoliths appear. The party joins the linguistic team attempting first contact. They begin learning the circular language and experiencing non-linear time perceptions.
*   **Act II — The Language (Sessions 5–8):** As the linguist learns the Chronari language, they begin perceiving future events. Global tensions escalate as nations debate whether to attack the Monoliths. The party races to understand the message before war begins.
*   **Act III — The Choice (Sessions 9–12):** The party learns the truth—the Chronari came to prevent a future war by teaching humanity to perceive time non-linearly and thus understand consequences before acting. The party must use their knowledge to prevent the war that will doom civilization.

*   **Key Events:**

### Session 5 — "The General's Deadline"

    *   The Pressure: The linguistic team works around the clock to establish communication before the deadline.
    *   The Conversation: The linguist makes first breakthrough communication with the Chronari.

### Session 6 — "Thinking in Circles"

*   **Focus:** Action / Consequence
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Strike: Military forces attack one of the Monoliths.
    *   The Defense: The Chronari don't retaliate—they simply exist, unmoved.
    *   The Backlash: The attack fails but triggers a retaliatory response from other nations who see it as an act of war.

*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Full Translation: The party finally translates the complete Chronari message.
    *   The Purpose: The Chronari came because in every timeline where they don't, humanity destroys itself in war within a generation. By teaching the language, they give humanity the ability to see consequences before acting.
    *   The Choice: Humanity can reject the gift and remain linear, or accept and transcend.

**Escalation:** The linguist realizes their personal tragedy—in learning the language fully, they've seen every moment of their life simultaneously, including their eventual death.

### Session 12 — "First Words"

*   **Focus:** Resolution / Peace
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Broadcast: The party broadcasts the truth worldwide. Leaders who've learned even fragments of the language begin to see the consequences of war.
    *   The Peace: One by one, nations stand down. War is averted.
    *   The Departure: The Monoliths slowly ascend and vanish. The Chronari's gift remains—a language that teaches wisdom through temporal perception.
    *   The Epilogue: The linguist, now perceiving time non-linearly, says goodbye to the party—though from their perspective, they're simultaneously saying hello, goodbye, and having every conversation they'll ever have.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Capital City:** A major metropolis where one of the twelve Monoliths hovers, causing daily disruptions and wonder.
2.  **The Research Encampment:** A hastily constructed facility around the Monolith where the linguistic team works.
3.  **The Monolith:** A massive obsidian structure, perfectly smooth, with flowing circular script and emanating temporal distortions.
4.  **The Summit Hall:** Where world leaders gather to decide the Monoliths' fate—the site of crucial diplomatic encounters.

## Central Conflict

The external conflict is preventing a war driven by fear and misunderstanding. The internal conflict is the linguist's transformation—as they learn to think in the Chronari language, they lose linear perception of time, seeing past, present, and future simultaneously. This is simultaneously a gift (wisdom) and a curse (knowing all sorrow and joy at once). The campaign explores whether communication can overcome fear, and what it costs to truly understand someone completely alien.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Chronari Language Learning Track**

*   The linguist party member progresses through stages of language acquisition.
*   **Effects:** As they advance, they gain prophetic abilities—perceiving future events, but at the cost of linear experience.
*   **Stages:** Basic patterns → Simple messages → Complex concepts → Time-sight → Full perception (see all time at once).

### 2. **Temporal Visions**

*   At key moments, the linguist experiences visions of past or future events.
*   **Mechanics:** These visions provide clues, warnings, or emotional moments. Players must decide how to act on foreknowledge.

### 3. **Diplomacy Over Combat**

*   Combat encounters are failures—they represent the breakdown of communication.
*   **Effects:** The campaign rewards creative problem-solving, linguistic puzzles, and diplomatic solutions.

### 4. **The Peace Meter**

*   A running track of global tensions.
*   **Effects:** Player actions raise or lower the threat of war. High tension leads to military action. Low tension leads to peaceful coexistence.
