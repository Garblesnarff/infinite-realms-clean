---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Capsuleer Empires
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Sci-Fi / Political Intrigue / Economic Warfare / Space Opera / Immortality
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 14+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **15**
**Tone (keywords):** ruthless, political, economic, immortal, corporate-warfare
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are Capsuleers—immortal starship pilots whose consciousness transfers to clone bodies upon death, making them near-gods in New Eden. They build corporate empires, command fleets, manipulate markets, and wage wars where defeat means bankruptcy rather than death. They navigate the complex politics of four great empires while building their own power base. In New Eden, trust is a liability, and every ally is a potential betrayer—the only question is when.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 14+ sessions)

A tale of ambition, betrayal, and building empires among the stars.

*   **Act I — The Capsuleer's Rise (Sessions 1–5):** The party completes their capsuleer trials and establishes their corporation. They take on contracts for the four empires: Caldari (corporate), Gallente (democratic), Amarr (religious slavers), Minmatar (freed slaves). They learn that loyalty is purchased, not earned, and begin building wealth through trade, mining, and combat.
*   **Act II — The Corporate War (Sessions 6–10):** A rival corporation declares war on the party's organization. They must defend their assets, raid enemy stations, and manipulate markets to bankrupt opponents. They discover the Jovian Directorate's ancient technology and the mysterious wormholes leading to unknown space. Political alliances become crucial as they play empires against each other.
*   **Act III — The Sansha Incursion (Sessions 11–14+):** Sansha Kuvakei, a techno-cult leader, begins abducting entire populations for his "Nation." His incursions threaten all empires, forcing fragile cooperation. The party must unite their rivals, navigate backstabbing politics, and lead a massive fleet battle in null-sec space. They choose: build a lasting empire, burn it all for profit, or ascend to control immortal technologies.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of immortality's cost, corporate ethics, and whether power without consequence creates monsters or gods. The central conflict is philosophical—in a universe where death is temporary and wealth is eternal, what gives life meaning?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Capsuleer Immortality**
*   When "killed," players lose their ship but transfer consciousness to a new clone.
*   Clone costs scale with character level—high-level death is expensive.
*   If clone isn't updated, death causes skill loss (permanent stat reduction).
*   This makes players fearless in combat but creates economic consequences for defeat.

### 2. **ISK (Currency) and Economy**
*   Everything has a price: ships, modules, ammunition, station rent, clone insurance.
*   Players must maintain positive cash flow through trading, missions, mining, or piracy.
*   Bankruptcy means losing ships and being stuck in a starter vessel.
*   Market manipulation is a valid strategy—buy resources, corner markets, crash prices.

### 3. **Ship Fitting System**
*   Ships have high, medium, low slots for modules, and rig slots for permanent upgrades.
*   Modules: weapons, shields, armor, speed, electronic warfare, cloaking.
*   Fitting choices create rock-paper-scissors: shield vs armor, long-range vs close, tank vs DPS.
*   Lost ships and fittings must be repurchased—no easy replacement.

### 4. **Corporate Warfare**
*   The party's corporation can declare war on rivals or be war-dec'd.
*   During war, corp members are legal targets in all space (even "safe" high-sec).
*   Wars cost ISK weekly—must be maintained or they end.
*   Can hire mercenary corps to fight for you or negotiate surrender terms.

### 5. **Sovereignty and Territory**
*   In null-sec, corporations can claim systems and build stations.
*   Territory generates passive income but must be defended 24/7.
*   Losing sovereignty battles means losing everything built in that system.
*   Requires managing NPC defenders, setting up defenses, and coordinating multiple players.

### 6. **Fleet Battles**
*   Large-scale combat involves commanded fleets with specialized roles.
*   Logistics ships heal allies, tacklers prevent escape, DPS ships deal damage, scouts provide intel.
*   Fleet Commander (FC) calls primaries—everyone focuses fire.
*   Communication discipline is critical—speaking out of turn can cost battles.
