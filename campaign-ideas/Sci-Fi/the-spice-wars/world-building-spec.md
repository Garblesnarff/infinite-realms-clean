# The Spice Wars - World-Building Specification

## The Known Universe Political Structure

### CHOAM (Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles)
- Mega-corporation controlling trade
- Shares distributed among Great Houses
- Emperor is largest shareholder
- Spice monopoly crucial to power

### The Spacing Guild
- Monopoly on interstellar travel
- Navigators mutated by spice, can fold space
- Utterly dependent on spice supply
- Politically neutral (must be)
- Can embargo worlds (economic weapon)

### The Great Houses (Landsraad)
- Feudal nobility controlling worlds
- Balance of power prevents Emperor dominance
- Ancient codes and traditions
- Atomics forbidden (Great Convention)
- Political maneuvering constant

### The Bene Gesserit
- Sisterhood with secret goals
- Breeding program (90+ generations)
- Truthsayers, wives, advisors to power
- Prana-bindu (mind-body control)
- Voice (command through tone)
- Planted prophecies (Missionaria Protectiva)

### The Imperium
- Emperor Shaddam IV rules (weakly)
- Sardaukar: Elite terror troops
- Prison planet Salusa Secundus training
- Emperor fears strong houses (like Atreides)
- Conspiracy with Harkonnens to destroy Atreides

## The Spice Melange

### Properties
- Extends life (3x normal)
- Enhances awareness and cognition
- Enables prescience in some
- Navigators require it (no spice = no space travel)
- Blue-within-blue eyes (long-term use)
- Fatally addictive (withdrawal kills)
- Most valuable substance in universe

### Production
- Only on Arrakis
- Byproduct of sandworm lifecycle
- Sandtrout encyst water, become worms
- Worm excretions mix with sand
- Spice blooms appear, harvestable
- Massive harvester operations
- Worms attracted to vibrations, destroy harvesters

### Control
- Whoever controls Arrakis controls spice
- Spice ensures economic/political dominance
- Spacing Guild dependent (leverage)
- Great Houses compete for access
- Black market limited (Fremen smuggling)

## Arrakis Ecology (Detailed)

### Environment
- Desert planet, no rain
- Temperatures extreme (40-80°C daytime)
- Sandstorms with winds 700+ kph
- Water more precious than spice (to locals)
- Polar regions slightly less harsh
- Atmospheric moisture minimal

### Sandworms (Shai-Hulud)
- Largest up to 400m long
- Territorial, aggressive
- Attracted to rhythmic vibrations
- Produce spice as byproduct
- Fremen worship and ride them
- Makers of the desert (terraforming agents)
- Life cycle: Sandtrout → sandworm → death releases trout

### Native Life
- Limited but adapted
- Kangaroo mice (muad'dib)
- Lice, flies adapted to aridity
- No surface water creatures
- Everything recycles moisture

### The Water Cycle (Hidden)
- Fremen terraforming project
- Secret water caches in sietches
- Generations-long plan
- Green Arrakis = no worms = no spice
- Ecological paradox

## Fremen Culture (Detailed)

### Desert Survival
- Stillsuits: Reclaim 99% body moisture
- Water discipline: No waste
- Face wrapping (nose plugs, face mask)
- Desert boots (for walking without rhythm)
- Conserve water religiously

### Sietch Life
- Underground communities
- Water storage sacred
- Communal living
- Population 5,000-10,000 per sietch
- Hidden from outsiders
- Democratic councils

### Customs and Laws
- Water sharing: Ultimate trust
- Water debt: Serious obligation
- Trial by combat for leadership
- Crysknife: Sacred weapon from sandworm tooth
- Death water: Rendered from dead (disturbing but necessary)
- Tau: Strangers useful enough to keep alive

### Religion
- Zensunni wanderers (history)
- Missionaria Protectiva seeded prophecies
- Lisan al-Gaib: Voice from Outer World (Messiah)
- Reverend Mothers: Drink Water of Life
- Sayyadina: Fremen priestesses

### Military Capability
- Fedaykin: Death commandos
- Guerrilla warfare experts
- Sandworm cavalry (terror weapon)
- Knowledge of desert terrain
- Vastly underestimated by off-worlders

## Great House Atreides

### Characteristics

## Technology and Weapons

### Shields
- Holtzman effect: Slows fast objects

- Guns useless against shields
- Lasgun-shield interaction: Atomic explosion (deterrent)
- Attract sandworms (vibrations)

### Mentats

## The Butlerian Jihad (Historical)

### Origin
- 10,000 years before campaign

### Consequences
- "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind"
- Mentats replace computers
- Navigators replace navigation computers
- Guild monopoly results
- Bene Gesserit and other schools develop human potential

## The Golden Path (Paul's Vision)

### The Terrible Purpose
- Paul sees countless futures
- Nearly all lead to human extinction
- Jihad seems inevitable (12 billion dead)
- Only narrow paths to survival
- Each choice locks in consequences

- Following vision ensures it
- Trying to avoid it makes it happen
- Burden of knowledge
- Can delay but not prevent?
