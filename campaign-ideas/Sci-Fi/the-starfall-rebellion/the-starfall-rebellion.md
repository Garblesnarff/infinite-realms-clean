The war between empires is background to the personal story of survival, family, and hope.

### 4. **Lying Cat**

*   When Lying Cat is present, players cannot successfully lie—adding interesting social dynamics.

### 5. **The Narration**

*   Hazel (grown up) narrates the story from the future, occasionally providing hints or commentary on events, creating a unique storytelling layer.
