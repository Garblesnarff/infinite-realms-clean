# World-Building Specification: The Refracted Realm

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Campaign: The Refracted Realm**

## 1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook

**Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The world should operate on impressionist principles where perception creates reality, light determines truth, and fixed forms do not exist.

**Content:** The Refracted Realm is a dimension where the principles of impressionist art have replaced physics. Nothing has absolute form - everything shifts based on light quality, observer perspective, and emotional state. The party seeks the Prism of Absolute Truth to save their crystallizing home world, but discovers the Prism was shattered by Light-Weavers who believe fixed reality is death. The campaign explores whether unchanging truth is worth the cost of beauty, growth, and perceptual possibility.

## 2. Lore & History Primer

**Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

**Prompts:**

### The Birth of the Refracted Realm
Detail the origin of this dimension. It was created accidentally 500 years ago by an artist-philosopher named Claude Lumière who rejected the rigid realism of magical society. While painting at dawn, he created a masterwork so imbued with impressionist philosophy that it became a doorway. When he stepped through, his perception of reality reshaped an entire pocket dimension. His philosophy: "Truth is not fixed but flowing, like light on water." The Realm is his vision made manifest.

### The Creation and Shattering of the Prism
Write the history of the Prism of Absolute Truth. Claude Lumière, after creating the Realm, feared he'd made a mistake - that without fixed truth, knowledge would be impossible. In a moment of doubt, he created the Prism to crystallize reality into unchanging fact. The moment it was completed, the Realm began to die - colors faded, forms fixed, life became static. In horror, he shattered the Prism into seven fragments (one for each color of light) and scattered them across the Realm. The fragments became corrupted, each creating a Light-Weaver who embodies one aspect of perception to the exclusion of others. Claude himself fragmented into echoes across the Realm, becoming Monet's Echo.

### The Seven Light-Weavers - Fragmented Guardians
Explain how the Light-Weavers came into being. When the Prism shattered, each fragment absorbed ambient consciousness and created a guardian. But the guardians became prisoners - the Red Fragment created the Fire-Heart Keeper who can only perceive passion, the Blue created the Rain Keeper trapped in melancholy, etc. Each Light-Weaver protects their fragment because surrendering it means losing their existence, but each is also incomplete, yearning for the full spectrum of perception they cannot achieve while bound to a single color.

### The Impression Guild - Navigators of Flux
Describe the foundation of the Impression Guild. They are descendants of travelers who became trapped in the Refracted Realm over centuries. Unable to return home (the doorway sealed after Claude's fragmentation), they learned to navigate perceptual reality. The Guild developed techniques for consensus reality, emotional-color control, and light-based navigation. Led by Monet's Echo (one of Claude's fragments), they maintain the philosophy that embracing change is superior to imposing order. They've become the Realm's primary civilization.

### The Crystalline Heresy
Detail the rise of the Crystalline Queen and her followers. A century ago, a Guild member named Clarity became terrified of the Realm's uncertainty. She discovered a fragment of the Prism's original matrix (a crystal shard before it was whole) and used it to crystallize herself into unchanging form. Initially, this seemed like peace - no more shifts, no more doubts. But she discovered too late that crystallization is death by another name - no growth, no learning, no joy. Trapped but powerful, she gathered others who fear change, creating the Crystalline Heresy. They seek to reassemble the Prism and freeze the Realm forever, believing order is worth the price of life.

### The Convergence - Where All Light Meets
Explain the legend and nature of the Convergence. It's a location where all seven colors of light meet naturally, creating a space of complete perceptual malleability. In this place, reality is determined entirely by consensus and belief. The Convergence was Claude Lumière's studio, the spot where he first created the doorway. It's said that at the Convergence, all truths are simultaneously valid, all perceptions exist in superposition, and the boundary between observer and observed dissolves. The Light-Weavers avoid it because there, their singular nature is revealed as incomplete.

## 3. Faction Deep-Dive

**Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below.

**Factions Roster:**

### The Impression Guild (Major - Neutral Good)
- **Goals:** To preserve the Realm's perceptual nature, help travelers navigate fluid reality, oppose crystallization, maintain Claude Lumière's philosophy
- **Hierarchy:** Led by Monet's Echo (fragmented founder), council of senior navigators, teachers, and color-theorists
- **Public Agenda:** Aid those lost in perceptual flux, teach consensus reality techniques, maintain safe havens of relative stability
- **Secret Agenda:** Some members seek to reunite Monet's Echo fragments to resurrect Claude Lumière fully, believing he could resolve the Prism crisis
- **Assets:** Knowledge of light navigation, consensus reality techniques, maps of stable routes through shifting terrain, safe houses in Impression City
- **Relationships:** Allied with most Light-Weavers (tentatively), opposed to Crystalline Heresy, helpful to party initially

### The Seven Light-Weavers (Major - True Neutral)
- **Goals:** Each seeks to protect their fragment and preserve their existence, some yearn for completion through experiencing full spectrum
- **Hierarchy:** No unified structure - each is independent in their colored domain
  - Fire-Heart Keeper (Red) - passion and intensity
  - Twilight Sailor (Orange) - transition and change
  - Noon Gardener (Yellow) - clarity and certainty
  - Moss Oracle (Green) - growth and life
  - Rain Keeper (Blue) - melancholy and depth
  - Shadow Seer (Indigo) - intuition and mystery
  - Sky Dreamer (Violet) - transcendence and dissolution
- **Public Agenda:** Guard the fragments from those who would reassemble the Prism
- **Secret Agenda:** Each is trapped by their fragment, experiencing only one emotional-perceptual mode. Some secretly wish to be freed even if it means ceasing to exist.
- **Assets:** Complete control over their domains, elemental/emotional powers related to their color, knowledge of their fragment's history
- **Relationships:** Wary of the Impression Guild, hostile to Crystalline Heresy, each relates to party differently based on the party's approach to their philosophy

### The Crystalline Heresy (Major - Lawful Evil)
- **Goals:** Reassemble the Prism, crystallize the entire Realm into unchanging perfection, eliminate uncertainty
- **Hierarchy:** Led by the Crystalline Queen, tier system based on degree of crystallization (Fully Crystal, Partial, Aspirants)
- **Public Agenda:** Preach that change is chaos and pain, offer "salvation" through crystallization
- **Secret Agenda:** The Queen knows crystallization is a slow death but believes it's preferable to the "madness" of perpetual change. She's in denial about her mistake and desperately needs others to validate her choice by joining her.
- **Assets:** Ability to crystallize objects and beings, immunity to perceptual shifts, organized military structure, fragments of proto-Prism
- **Relationships:** Hostile to Impression Guild, hunted by some Light-Weavers, sees party as either potential converts or threats depending on party's philosophical stance

### The Color Refugees (Minor - Neutral)
- **Goals:** Escape from Light-Weavers' domains where they're trapped in single emotional states, find balance in full-spectrum light
- **Hierarchy:** Loose collective of beings who've fled monochromatic regions, no formal leader
- **Public Agenda:** Seek asylum in Impression City, warn others about getting trapped in single-color domains too long
- **Secret Agenda:** Some plan to steal fragments to free the Light-Weavers, others want to destroy fragments to end the colored domains entirely
- **Assets:** Firsthand knowledge of Light-Weavers' domains, techniques for resisting color-emotional influence
- **Relationships:** Grateful to Impression Guild for sanctuary, ambivalent toward Light-Weavers (victims of them but understand they're also victims), neutral to party

### The Spectrum Scholars (Minor - Lawful Neutral)
- **Goals:** Study the nature of light, perception, and reality in the Realm, remain objective observers
- **Hierarchy:** Academic structure led by the Prismatic Professor, organized by research specialties
- **Public Agenda:** Document perceptual phenomena, advise the Guild on light-based navigation, teach color theory
- **Secret Agenda:** Secretly experimenting with creating new colors beyond the visible spectrum, which could open doors to even stranger perceptual realities or potentially heal the fragmented Prism
- **Assets:** Deep theoretical knowledge, experimental devices that manipulate light/color, extensive libraries
- **Relationships:** Collaborative with Impression Guild, fascinated by Light-Weavers as research subjects, curious about party's foreign perspective

## 4. NPC Generation Roster

**Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed.

**Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**

### Monet's Echo (Claude Lumière Fragment)
- **Full Name:** Claude Lumière (fragmented into "Echo")
- **Role:** Guide, Mentor, Quest-Giver, Tragic Figure
- **Appearance:** Shifts with lighting - elderly man in bright sun, young woman in shade, androgynous in dawn/dusk. Clothing appears painted on in visible brushstrokes.
- **Personality:** Gentle, wise, accepting of contradiction. Speaks in metaphors of light and painting. Deeply regrets creating the Prism, even briefly.
- **Abilities:** Perfect Light Navigation (never lost), Consensus Reality Mastery (can convince others to perceive his version), Fragment Communication (can speak to other Echo fragments across distance), Color Theory Knowledge (teaches party mechanics)
- **Secret:** Is trying to gather all his fragments back together, but doing so might kill him permanently as the merger could cause paradox. Doesn't tell party because doesn't want to burden them.
- **Relationships:** Leads Impression Guild, mourns what the Light-Weavers have become (they're corrupted versions of his vision), pities the Crystalline Queen (she represents his own moment of doubt made flesh)

### The Fire-Heart Keeper (Red Light-Weaver)
- **Full Name:** None - has forgotten it
- **Role:** First Fragment Guardian, Embodiment of Passion
- **Appearance:** Humanoid figure wreathed in crimson light that pulses like heartbeat, features visible only as suggestions in red light, edges blur with intensity
- **Personality:** Experiences everything at maximum intensity - love burns, anger rages, joy explodes. Cannot understand moderation or calm. Exhausting but genuine.
- **Abilities:** Pyrokinesis (emotions manifest as fire), Passion Aura (emotions intensify near them), Red Vision (can see heat, desire, anger in others), Combat Prowess (fights with wild abandon)
- **Secret:** Terrified of feeling nothing. The Red Fragment is slowly burning out. Knows they're dying but can't stop burning.
- **Relationships:** Respects anyone who feels deeply, contemptuous of the emotionless Crystalline Queen, protective of the Red Fields, curious about party's capacity for passion

### The Rain Keeper (Blue Light-Weaver)
- **Full Name:** Grief (took on their emotion as name)
- **Role:** Blue Fragment Guardian, Embodiment of Melancholy
- **Appearance:** Surrounded by perpetual rain that refracts everything to blue, appears through veil of water, face partially obscured, movements slow and heavy
- **Personality:** Finds beauty in sadness, profundity in loss. Not depressed but perpetually melancholic. Speaks of endings as precious because they prove something mattered.
- **Abilities:** Hydrokinesis (creates and controls water), Melancholy Aura (those near them feel gentle sadness), Blue Vision (sees sadness and meaning in everything), Tears of Truth (their tears can reveal hidden emotions)
- **Secret:** Has forgotten what happiness feels like. Sometimes tries to remember by watching others laugh, but the memory slips away like water.
- **Relationships:** Finds kinship with anyone who's known loss, opposes the Noon Gardener's false clarity, protects the Blue Waters, sympathetic to party's quest to save their world (understands love that causes pain)

### The Crystalline Queen
- **Full Name:** Clarity (birth name lost to crystallization)
- **Role:** Primary Antagonist, Warning, Tragic Villain
- **Appearance:** Perfectly clear humanoid made of living crystal, no blur, no color shift, completely static in any light, light passes through her creating rainbows on surfaces behind
- **Personality:** Cold, certain, sees all change as corruption. Speaks with absolute conviction. Believes she's saving people by crystallizing them. Deep in denial.
- **Abilities:** Crystallization Touch (can turn living things to crystal), Crystal Construction (builds structures from light-crystal), Immunity to Perception (she's perfectly objective, which is her weakness), Shatter Command (can break crystals including crystallized beings)
- **Secret:** Knows she's trapped and dying slowly, but can't admit the mistake. If she admits it, centuries of suffering were for nothing. Desperately needs validation.
- **Relationships:** Leads Crystalline Heresy, hates Monet's Echo (he represents the philosophy that proved her wrong), fears the Light-Weavers (they're comfortable in their singular natures, she's not), sees party as last chance to prove she was right

### The Noon Gardener (Yellow Light-Weaver)
- **Full Name:** Verity (believes it means truth)
- **Role:** Yellow Fragment Guardian, False Prophet of Clarity
- **Appearance:** Surrounded by brilliant golden light that eliminates all shadows, face clearly visible but somehow empty, movements precise and angular
- **Personality:** Absolutely confident in their understanding. Sees everything in simple terms. Wisdom is uncertainty; they have no wisdom, only knowledge. Condescending without realizing.
- **Abilities:** Light Manipulation (creates noon-bright illumination), Clarity Aura (complexity seems to vanish near them, everything obvious), Yellow Vision (sees only surface, no depth), Oversimplification (can reduce complex problems to false binaries)
- **Secret:** Terrified of nuance, shade, shadows - anything that suggests their clear vision might be incomplete. The fragment has blinded them with light.
- **Relationships:** Contemptuous of the Shadow Seer (darkness represents what they fear), allied tentatively with Crystalline Queen (clarity and crystal both reject complexity), challenges party's perceptions constantly

### The Sky Dreamer (Violet Light-Weaver)
- **Full Name:** Transcendence (possibly never had another name)
- **Role:** Seventh Fragment Guardian, Dissolution Incarnate
- **Appearance:** Barely physical - violet light in vaguely humanoid shape, sometimes has features, sometimes is pure light, phases through objects unintentionally
- **Personality:** Speaks of incomprehensible things. Has nearly transcended physical form entirely. Barely remembers being solid or why that mattered.
- **Abilities:** Incorporeality (can phase through solid matter), Violet Vision (sees beyond physical into conceptual realms), Transcendent Wisdom (knows things they shouldn't, glimpses other dimensions), Dissolution Aura (physical forms weaken near them)
- **Secret:** Losing cohesion. Will soon dissolve into pure light and cease to exist as an individual. Might see this as victory or tragedy - can't tell anymore.
- **Relationships:** Barely aware of other factions, finds Monet's Echo fascinating (recognizes him as partial being like themselves), indifferent to party unless they show philosophical depth

**Tier 2 (Recurring Archetypes):**
- **Guild Navigator** - Members of Impression Guild who guide travelers through shifting terrain using light-based navigation
- **Color Refugee** - Beings who fled monochromatic domains, bearing traits of their escaped color (Red Refugees still passionate, Blue still melancholic, etc.)
- **Crystalline Convert** - Partially crystallized beings, caught between change and stasis, often tragic
- **Spectrum Scholar** - Academics studying perception and light, provide exposition and theories

**Tier 3 (Common Encounters):**
- **Perceptual Anomaly** - Creatures that exist differently for each observer (appear as loved one to one person, monster to another)
- **Light Elemental** - Pure color given form, embodies single emotion
- **Consensus Shade** - Being created accidentally by group agreement, exists only while observers maintain belief

## 5. Location Blueprints

**Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create detailed blueprints emphasizing impressionist principles, color-emotion resonance, and perceptual fluidity.

**Location Roster:**

### The Impression City
**Description:** Central hub settlement where the Impression Guild maintains relative stability through consensus reality. Architecture shifts subtly with time of day and observer mood, but Guild techniques keep it navigable. Buildings appear as impressionist paintings - suggested rather than defined.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Soft-Focus Marketplace (edges blur, goods identified by color rather than form)
- The Guild Hall of Echoes (where Monet's Echo teaches and coordinates)
- The Spectrum Archive (library containing light-based knowledge)
- The Consensus Plaza (public space where reality is determined by majority perception)
- The Clarion Tower (crystalline structure, the Heresy's outpost in the city)

**Primary Inhabitants:** Impression Guild members, Color Refugees, Spectrum Scholars, some crystalline converts

**Available Goods & Services:** Light-navigation lessons, consensus reality training, Clarity Point restoration, emotional-color therapy, maps (unreliable), light-based weapons

**Potential Random Encounters:**
1. Architecture shifts mid-navigation, streets reorganize based on collective mood
2. Crystalline Heresy preacher trying to convert citizens
3. Color Refugee losing grip on full-spectrum sight, regressing to single color
4. Accidental consensus creation - crowd believes in something, it manifests
5. Light-based festival celebrating transition (dawn or dusk)

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors:**
1. "Monet's Echo isn't one person - they're fragments, and sometimes the fragments disagree with each other."
2. "The Crystalline Queen was once the Guild's most talented navigator. What happened to her could happen to anyone."
3. "At the heart of the Archive is a sealed room containing Claude Lumière's original paintings - the ones that created this realm."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Soft-edged buildings in pastel colors, streets that curve gently, light dancing on surfaces, impressionistic citizens
- Sound: Gentle murmur of consensus discussions, water features everywhere (fountains, streams), wind chimes in various tones
- Smell: Fresh rain, oil paint (when near old buildings), floral scents from gardens
- Touch: Surfaces that feel slightly soft, as if not entirely solid, air that feels thick with light
- Taste: Air tastes of watercolor - clean, slightly mineral

### The Red Fields of Passion
**Description:** Endless grasslands under warm sky, everything in shades of crimson, scarlet, and rose. Emotions burn hot here - all feelings intensified. The Fire-Heart Keeper's domain.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Burning Heart Shrine (where the Red Fragment resides)
- The Passion Battleground (eternal combat between those caught in anger)
- The Lover's Labyrinth (maze of roses where desire overwhelms)
- The Rage Caldera (volcanic crater of pure fury)
- The Joy Meadows (field where happiness becomes manic)

**Primary Inhabitants:** Fire-Heart Keeper, Red Refugees (trapped in passion), Emotion Elementals (embodied feelings), Wild Hearts (animals made of pure desire)

**Available Goods & Services:** None - this is a trial region, not civilization. May trade with Fire-Heart Keeper for passage.

**Potential Random Encounters:**
1. Wave of anger sweeps through, party must save vs. violent rage
2. Two lovers locked in eternal embrace, cannot separate, need rescue
3. Pride manifestation challenges party to combat
4. Joy becomes so intense it's indistinguishable from pain
5. The Fire-Heart Keeper appears to test party's capacity for passion

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors:**
1. "The Red Fragment is dying. When it goes out, all passion in the Realm will fade."
2. "Those who stay too long in the Red Fields forget calm exists. They burn until they burn out."
3. "The Fire-Heart Keeper once loved someone. They're gone now. The grief would kill anyone who saw it - but grief is blue, and the Keeper can only feel red."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Everything crimson - grass, sky, even shadows are red, heat shimmer creates distortion
- Sound: Heartbeats, loud and everywhere, breathing of some vast beast, crackling flames in distance
- Smell: Heat, spice, something burning (cinnamon? smoke?), iron like blood
- Touch: Air is hot and dry, grass feels like it's generating warmth, ground pulses with rhythm
- Taste: Copper, spice, the taste of adrenaline

### The Blue Waters of Melancholy
**Description:** Region of lakes, rivers, rain-soaked landscapes, everything tinged blue. Beautiful sadness permeates. The Rain Keeper's domain.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Weeping Lake (where the Blue Fragment rests underwater)
- The Memory Shores (beach covered in lost memories as shells)
- The Grief Gardens (flowers that bloom only for those who mourn)
- The Falling Sky Fields (perpetual gentle rain)
- The Depth Cathedral (underwater structure of profound beauty and sorrow)

**Primary Inhabitants:** Rain Keeper, Blue Refugees (trapped in melancholy), Water Spirits (embodied grief), Mourning Creatures (animals made of tears)

**Available Goods & Services:** None directly, but Rain Keeper trades memories for passage.

**Potential Random Encounters:**
1. Party member overwhelmed by grief for something they've lost, needs comfort
2. Memory manifests from the lake, reenacts a sad moment from someone's past
3. Rain intensifies, visibility drops to impressionist blur
4. Beautiful but unbearably sad music from nowhere, must resist despair
5. The Rain Keeper appears asking party to share their deepest sorrow

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors:**
1. "If you cry in the Blue Waters, your tears join the lake and your grief lessens. But the lake grows."
2. "The Rain Keeper can't cry anymore. They've wept so much they're empty. Now they collect others' tears."
3. "At the bottom of the Weeping Lake is the truth of why Claude Lumière fragmented himself. It's too sad to bear."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Blue-tinted everything, rain creating curtains of perception, water reflections showing truer images than reality
- Sound: Constant gentle rain, distant thunder, soft weeping, water lapping on shores
- Smell: Rain on stone, wet earth, salt from tears, clean water
- Touch: Everything damp, cool, weight of water in air, ground soft with moisture
- Taste: Salt and rain, clean and sad

### The Convergence
**Description:** Where all seven colors meet naturally. Reality is completely mutable here, determined by perception and consensus. Claude Lumière's original studio.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Prismatic Fountain (where white light splits into spectrum)
- The Studio Ruins (Claude's original workspace, now partially phased out of reality)
- The Observation Dome (viewing platform where all colors converge)
- The Shatter Point (where the Prism was broken, reality is weakest)
- The Truth Threshold (doorway that leads to one of three endings based on party's choice)

**Primary Inhabitants:** None permanent - too unstable. Monet's Echo fragments sometimes congregate here.

**Available Goods & Services:** None - this is final location where choices are made.

**Potential Random Encounters:**
1. Party members perceive completely different realities, must achieve consensus
2. All seven Light-Weavers appear simultaneously if fragments collected
3. Reality flickers between multiple states - stability rolls required
4. The Crystalline Queen attacks if she's been tracking the party
5. Party sees themselves making different choices in parallel

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors:**
1. "At the Convergence, all truths are simultaneously real. Choose carefully what you believe."
2. "If all seven Light-Weavers can be brought to the Convergence, the Prism might reassemble itself."
3. "Claude Lumière is both alive and dead here. Both complete and fragmented. If you can see both at once, you can talk to him."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: All colors simultaneously, overlapping realities, prismatic light everywhere, impossible to describe coherently
- Sound: All sounds at once but somehow distinguishable, music that is all seven themes layered
- Smell: Every scent from every region simultaneously yet individually
- Touch: Sensation of being multiple temperatures, textures, states at once
- Taste: Full spectrum of experience, overwhelming

## 6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States

**IF:** Party member's Clarity Points reach 0
**THEN:** They perceive reality purely impressionistically - all Investigation/Perception at disadvantage, but gain ability to reshape minor elements through belief alone. Can "paint" small objects into existence 1/day. Begin to blur at edges visually.

**IF:** Party member's Clarity Points reach 20
**THEN:** They begin crystallizing. Gain +2 AC (hardening skin) but lose 5ft movement. Each long rest at 20 CP, make DC 15 Wisdom save or permanently crystallize one body part (lose function until healed).

**IF:** Party collects a Fragment without the Light-Weaver's consent (theft/combat)
**THEN:** Fragment's power is corrupted, grants ability but with major drawback. That Light-Weaver becomes permanent enemy. Their region destabilizes, bleeding into adjacent territories.

**IF:** Party convinces a Light-Weaver to willingly surrender Fragment
**THEN:** That Light-Weaver begins to fade but experiences full emotional spectrum in their final moments. Grants fragment and a blessing specific to their color. Their region slowly transitions toward balanced light.

**IF:** Party sides with the Crystalline Queen
**THEN:** Offered crystallization as "gift" - immunity to perceptual shifts, +5 AC, but lose ability to learn/change. Impression Guild becomes hostile. Path to Crystallization ending opens.

**IF:** Party destroys a Fragment
**THEN:** That color begins disappearing from the Realm. Red destroyed = passion fades, Blue = no more sadness, etc. Realm becomes less complete but more stable. NPCs react with horror or relief depending on faction.

**IF:** Party reaches Convergence with all seven Fragments through peaceful means
**THEN:** Light-Weavers can be healed, Prism reassembled in new configuration allowing balance, or Prism destroyed forever. All endings available. Final choice is philosophical debate, not combat.

**IF:** Party reaches Convergence through violence (killed Light-Weavers)
**THEN:** Fragments are corrupted, can only reassemble original Prism (crystallizing Realm) or attempt destruction (unstable, may destroy Realm entirely). Harmony ending unavailable.

## 7. Unique Mechanics Implementation

**Clarity Points:** Track 0-20. Spending/gaining based on philosophical choices, light exposure, emotional experiences. At extremes, transformation begins.

**Perception Creates Reality:** Roll Perception to determine what object IS, not what you discover. Results create truth for that character.

**Emotional-Color Resonance:** Track party's collective emotional state. Determines regional difficulty - angry party struggles in Blue Waters, sad party struggles in Red Fields.

**Light-Time Cycles:** Realm has dawn (2 hours), day (4 hours), dusk (2 hours), night (4 hours). Different challenges/opportunities at each.

**Consensus Reality Rolls:** When party perceives differently, group Persuasion check to agree on one version. Success = unified reality. Failure = continues in superposition until resolved.

**Fragment Powers & Prices:** Each collected fragment provides ability but influences personality. Collecting all seven without harmony = fragmented mind.
