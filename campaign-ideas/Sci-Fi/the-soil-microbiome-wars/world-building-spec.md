# World-Building Specification: The Soil Microbiome Wars

## Soil Ecosystem Science

### Scale
- Party: 1 micrometer (bacterial size)
- Bacteria: 0.5-5 micrometers
- Fungal hyphae: 2-10 micrometers wide
- Nematodes: 1mm long (gigantic to party)
- Soil particles: 0.002-2mm (pebbles to massive boulders)
- Soil pores: Variable, create pathways

### Soil Structure
- **Mineral particles:** Sand, silt, clay
- **Organic matter:** Dead plants/animals
- **Water:** Films coating particles
- **Air:** Pore spaces
- **Organisms:** Bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa

### Bacterial Diversity

**Nitrogen-Fixers (Rhizobia)**
- Convert N2 gas to ammonia
- Symbiotic with legume roots
- Benefit: Plants get nitrogen
- Cost: Plants provide carbon
- Campaign: Rhizosphere Kingdom

**Decomposers**
- Break down organic matter
- Release nutrients
- Essential for recycling
- Campaign: Decomposer Collective

**Actinobacteria**
- Filamentous bacteria
- Produce antibiotics naturally
- Smell like fresh soil
- Campaign: Sages and alchemists

**Spore-Formers (Bacillus/Clostridium)**
- Can form resistant spores
- Survive harsh conditions
- Campaign: Military culture

**Pseudomonas (Invader)**
- Versatile, adaptive
- Can be beneficial or harmful
- Campaign: Magically enhanced to dominate

### Fungal Networks
- Mycorrhizae: Symbiotic with plant roots
- Saprophytic: Decompose organic matter
- Hyphae: Thread-like structures
- Network: Connects across large areas
- Communication: Chemical and electrical signals

### Predator-Prey Dynamics
- **Bacterivores:** Protozoa and nematodes eat bacteria
- **Population Control:** Prevent bacterial overgrowth
- **Nutrient Release:** Death releases nutrients
- **Campaign:** Nematodes as kaiju predators

## Chemical Warfare

### Bacterial Weapons
- **Antibiotics:** Kill competing bacteria
- **Toxins:** Damage cellular functions
- **Enzymes:** Break down competitor defenses
- **Siderophores:** Steal iron from competitors

### Defenses
- **Resistance genes:** Enzymatic degradation
- **Efflux pumps:** Expel toxins
- **Biofilms:** Physical protection
- **Spores:** Dormancy until threat passes

## Plant-Microbe Symbiosis

### Rhizosphere
- Zone around roots
- Rich in root exudates (carbon compounds)
- Attracts beneficial bacteria
- Chemical signaling between partners
- Mutual benefit

### Nitrogen Fixation
- Bacteria convert N2 to NH3
- Occurs in root nodules
- Plants provide carbon and protection
- Bacteria provide nitrogen
- Essential for agriculture

### Mycorrhizae
- Fungal-plant symbiosis
- Fungi extend root reach
- Increase water/nutrient absorption
- Plants provide carbon
- 80% of plants have mycorrhizal partners

## The Sabotage

### Method
- Introduce magically enhanced invasive bacteria
- They out-compete beneficial species
- Disrupt nitrogen fixation
- Prevent decomposition
- Collapse ecosystem

### Motivation
- Rival kingdom wants agricultural failure
- Economic warfare
- Deny resources to enemy
- Biological weapon testing

### Solution
- Stop contamination source
- Eliminate enhanced invaders
- Restore bacterial balance
- Protect beneficial species
- Monitor soil health

## Campaign Science Accuracy

### Real Soil Ecology
- Based on actual soil microbiology
- Bacterial interactions authentic
- Symbiotic relationships real
- Chemical warfare accurate
- Educational value

### Fantasy Elements
- Sentient bacterial civilizations
- Magical enhancement
- Communication with microbes
- Size-shifting magic
- Party intervention

## DM Customization

### Difficulty
- Invader strength and spread rate
- Allied bacterial resources
- Environmental hazards
- Time before crop failure

### Tone
- **Scientific:** Emphasis on real ecology, educational
- **Warfare:** Focus on bacterial battles, strategy
- **Political:** Bacterial diplomacy, alliance building
- **Mystery:** Investigation of sabotage source

### Expansion
- Other soil types (forest, desert, wetland)
- Different crop fields
- Compost ecosystem
- Aquatic sediment bacteria
- Long-term soil restoration campaign

### Real-World Relevance
- Soil health crucial for agriculture
- Microbiome research growing field
- Environmental protection themes
- Antibiotic resistance parallels
