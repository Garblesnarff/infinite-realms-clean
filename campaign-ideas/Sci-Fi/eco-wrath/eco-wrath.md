# Eco-Wrath
**Tagline:** *Nature's revenge is biblical*

## Campaign Overview

Humanity pushed too far. Deforestation, ocean pollution, atmospheric poisoning, mass extinction—the planet absorbed it all until it couldn't. Then the Verdant Awakening began. Forests started fighting back. The first Eco-Titan emerged from the Amazon: a 300-foot creature of wood, vine, and fury. More followed from every biome—oceanic, desert, arctic, volcanic. Each embodying their ecosystem's wrath. Each here to reclaim Earth.

The party starts as members of the Global Environmental Coalition (GEC), reformed environmental activists turned survival organizers. They've fought for decades to prevent this through policy. They failed. Now they must navigate between three factions: humanity fighting for survival at any cost, eco-terrorists who welcome extinction, and the Eco-Titans themselves who may be open to negotiation—if humanity proves worthy.

The campaign explores environmental guilt, the cost of civilization, and whether coexistence is possible when one species has pushed others to extinction. Titans attack pollution sources: factories, cities, oil fields. They're not mindless destroyers but targeted surgeons removing cancers from their world. Humanity must choose: adapt and survive humbly, or fight and face extinction as another failed species.

## Core Themes

- **Environmental Consequences:** Humanity reaps what it sowed
- **Nature's Perspective:** Humans as the virus, Titans as antibodies
- **Eco-Terrorism vs. Pragmatism:** How far is too far?
- **Sacrifice for Survival:** What will humanity give up?
- **Communication Across Species:** Can understanding bridge the gap?
- **Guilt and Redemption:** Fixing mistakes before it's too late

## Session Breakdown

### Arc 1: The Awakening (Sessions 1-8)
Sessions 1-3: First Titan (Verdantus) emerges. Party deployed to São Paulo evacuation. Witnessing nature reclaiming city. Death toll millions. Government response: military force. Party knows this will fail.

Sessions 4-6: Second Titan (Aquaria) rises from Pacific. Attacks oil platforms. Creates tsunami. Coastal cities devastated. Pattern emerges: Titans targeting pollution sources. Third Titan (Pyros) from volcanic region destroys industrial zones.

Sessions 7-8: GEC proposes peace summit. Bring gifts of reforestation, pollution cleanup pledges. Approach Verdantus. Shocking discovery: Titan communicates through pollen spores creating shared visions. Nature demands humanity shrink its footprint by 90% immediately. Impossible demand. Or is it?

### Arc 2: Divided Humanity (Sessions 9-18)
Sessions 9-11: Factions form. Military Coalition wants to weaponize against Titans. Eco-Vanguard (extremists) want to help Titans finish the job. GEC seeks middle path. Party must navigate political warfare as dangerous as Titans.

Sessions 12-14: Eco-Vanguard sabotages military weapons. Party investigates terrorist cell. Discover their leader is someone party knows. Moral complexity: they're not wrong, just extreme. Can party stop them without betraying their own beliefs?

Sessions 15-16: Titans escalate. Coordinated global strikes. All major cities hit simultaneously. Millions displaced. Eco-Vanguard celebrates. Military retaliates with experimental bio-weapon. It wounds Verdantus badly. Nature's response is fury.

Sessions 17-18: Fourth and Fifth Titans emerge. Smaller ones, hundreds appearing. Party realizes: Titans can spawn defenders. Escalation leads to more Titans, not fewer. Military strategy failing. Billions will die unless new solution found.

### Arc 3: The Negotiation (Sessions 19-28)
Sessions 19-21: Party proposes radical plan: evacuate humanity to designated zones, rewild 80% of planet, strict environmental accords. Global government council debates. Corporate interests oppose. Time running out.

Sessions 22-24: Pilot program. One region voluntarily dismantles industry, rewildsrapidly. Party coordinates with environmental mages to accelerate growth. Titans observe. Tentative pause in that area. Proof of concept works.

Sessions 25-26: Corporations fund coup. Military hardliners seize power. Plan to deploy nuclear weapons against Titan nest sites. Party must choose: support coup to save human civilization, or stop it to prevent Titan extinction retaliation.

Sessions 27-28: Race against time. Party splits. Some sabotage nukes. Some negotiate with Titans. Some protect civilians from both sides. Climax: nuclear launch prevented/successful. Titan response: if prevented, negotiation opens. If successful, extinction war begins.

### Arc 4: New Earth (Sessions 29-36)
Sessions 29-31: Treaty established or war declared. If treaty: humanity accepts shrinkage. Mega-cities consolidated. Rewilding begins. Hardliners resist. If war: final desperate battles, humanity losing slowly.

Sessions 32-34: Titans reveal truth: they're not Earth's original guardians reawakening—they're Earth creating defenders from scratch. The planet is alive, conscious, and fighting back. Party witnesses planetary sentience. Perspective shift: everything re-contextualized.

Sessions 35-36: Final choice. Peaceful path: party becomes ambassadors between humanity and planet, helping both coexist. War path: party leads desperate evacuation to space or underground while surface reclaimed. Pyrrhic endings possible either way. Campaign ends 50 years later—epilogue shows result of choices.

## Unique Mechanics

### Eco-Karma System
- Track party and humanity's environmental actions
- Positive: Rewilding, cleanup, sacrifice = Titan cooperation increases
- Negative: Pollution, destruction, greed = Titan aggression escalates
- Mechanically affects Titan behavior and communication success

### Titan Communication
- Not language but shared visions through spores, pollen, water
- Wisdom checks to interpret meaning
- Two-way: Titans understand human emotion and intent
- Deception detected automatically
- Showing genuine change required for trust

### Resource Collapse
- As campaign progresses, modern resources fail
- No oil, metals scarce, plastic taboo
- Must adapt to low-tech sustainable methods
- Magic becomes crucial as technology fails

### Factional Influence
- Track reputation with all three factions
- Actions affect standing, alliances, resources
- Can't please everyone, must choose priorities
- Ultimate choice: which faction's vision wins

### Planetary Consciousness
- Late campaign: commune with Earth itself
- Understand non-human perspective
- See humanity as Earth sees it: fascinating but cancerous
- Humbling, perspective-altering

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1:** Titans trying to save humanity from self-extinction, not kill them

**Twist 2:** Previous civilization existed, destroyed same way, Earth has done this before

**Twist 3:** Eco-Vanguard leader was party's mentor, makes betrayal personal

**Twist 4:** Corporate interests planning to abandon Earth for colony ships—don't care about planet

**Twist 5:** Military bio-weapon backfires, creates Toxicus—Titan made of pollution

**Twist 6:** One party member descended from indigenous line, natural Titan speaker

**Twist 7:** Little Sparrow is Earth's avatar, innocent child with god-like connection

**Twist 8:** Nuking Titans would poison planet worse, triggering extinction including humans

**Twist 9:** Titans offer deal: humanity lives, but population capped at sustainable 500 million

**Twist 10:** Party discovers they can become Titan-human hybrids, bridge species

## Victory Conditions

**Ideal Victory:** Treaty established, humanity adapts, Titans stand down, coexistence achieved, hard but possible future

**Pragmatic Victory:** Humanity shrinks through managed decline, painful but peaceful, new world order

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Titans defeated via scorched earth, planet dying, humanity survives in bunkers/space, hollow victory

**Bittersweet Victory:** Most humans dead, survivors integrated into nature, civilization ends but species continues primitively

## Defeat Conditions

**Extinction:** Humanity wiped out, Earth heals, new species evolve, epilogue 1000 years later

**Mutual Destruction:** Both sides annihilate each other, lifeless planet

**Corporate Escape:** Elites escape to space, leave billions to die, dystopian continuation

**Nature Lost:** Titans destroyed but planet ecosystem collapses, slow death for all life
