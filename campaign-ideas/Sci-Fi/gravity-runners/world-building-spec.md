# Gravity Runners - World-Building Specification

## The City of Zenith Prime

### Historical Timeline

**The Before Times (Age Unknown)**
- Zenith Prime was built by an ancient civilization called the Architects
- The city was designed as a living organism, conscious and responsive
- Original purpose: A test of worthiness—only those who could master movement were allowed to ascend
- The Perfect Line was the graduation ceremony, leading to transcendence
- Something caused the Architects to vanish, leaving the city dormant

**The Founding Era (300 Years Ago)**
- Modern settlers discovered the ruins and began building upward
- Early colonists experienced strange phenomena—gravity fluctuations, impossible architecture
- First Runners emerged naturally, attuned to the city's dormant consciousness
- Running was seen as sacred art, Runners as priests of motion

**The Corporate Takeover (150 Years Ago)**
- Gravitas Corporation discovered how to harness the city's kinetic energy
- Installed gravity generators to "stabilize" and control the urban environment
- Commodified movement—certain routes required permits and fees
- Runners who resisted were labeled criminals and terrorists

**The Restriction Wars (75 Years Ago)**
- Massive conflict between free Runners and Syndicate enforcers
- Flow Restrictions first implemented, dividing the city by class
- The Freerunner's Haven created as sanctuary outside normal space
- Legendary Runners like Cipher's mentor fought and fell
- Uneasy truce established—Runners allowed in lower city, banned from upper

**The Modern Age (Present)**
- Syndicate controls all aspects of city life through movement restriction
- New generation of Runners emerging who never knew true freedom
- Rumors of the Perfect Line resurface after decades of suppression
- City's consciousness beginning to stir, causing dangerous anomalies
- Players arrive at the inflection point—revolution or extinction

### The Stasis Syndicate

**Member Corporations**:
1. **Gravitas Corp** (Gravity tech, main power)
2. **Stillborn Security** (Enforcement and military)
3. **Vertix Transit** (Transportation monopoly)
4. **SkyLine Media** (Propaganda and surveillance)

- Their signature move demonstrated by crew members
- Personal belongs scattered along their favorite line
- Annual remembrance where their best runs are recreated
- Belief that truly great Runners become kinetic echoes—ghosts that help future generations

### Momentum Magic System

**The Five Forms**:

1. **Kinetic Conversion**
   - *Theory*: Movement generates mystical energy that can be weaponized
   - *Practice*: Runners can convert speed into damage, healing, or shields
   - *Limitation*: Must maintain momentum—stopping breaks the effect
   - *Advanced Techniques*: Kinetic storage (banking energy), chain reactions
   - *Visual*: Cyan energy trails following limbs

2. **Gravity Defiance**
   - *Theory*: City's architecture responds to confident movement
   - *Practice*: Wall-running, ceiling-running, delayed falls, double-jumps
   - *Limitation*: Requires belief—doubt causes immediate failure
   - *Advanced Techniques*: Complete gravity reversal, walking on air
   - *Visual*: Footprints glow where defying physics

3. **Flow Vision**
   - *Theory*: The city shows optimal paths to those who listen
   - *Practice*: See routes before taking them, predict enemy movement
   - *Limitation*: Shows best path, not safe path—might lead through danger
   - *Advanced Techniques*: See multiple possible futures, timeline branching
   - *Visual*: Translucent blue pathways overlay reality

4. **Phantom Step**
   - *Theory*: At high speeds, consciousness can be in multiple places
   - *Practice*: Leave afterimages, create decoys, confuse pursuers
   - *Limitation*: Each phantom drains stamina significantly
   - *Advanced Techniques*: Solid duplicates, consciousness transfer
   - *Visual*: Magenta ghostly copies that fade after seconds

5. **Perfect Line Sense**
   - *Theory*: Fragments of the ancient route call to worthy Runners
   - *Practice*: Detect nearby Line fragments, hear city's whispers
   - *Limitation*: Only works for those with potential to complete the Line
   - *Advanced Techniques*: Communicate with city directly, access Architect memories
   - *Visual*: Golden light emanating from direction of fragments

**Learning Progression**:
- Level 1-5: Basic parkour with one magic form
- Level 6-10: Master one form, learn second
- Level 11-15: Combine forms, unlock advanced techniques
- Level 16-20: Access Perfect Line abilities, transform city around them

### Technology & Magic Integration

**Gravity Generators**:
- Massive devices buried in Under-Grid
- Create localized gravity fields that can be adjusted
- Powered by kinetic energy harvested from citizens
- Slowly draining the city's consciousness
- Can be sabotaged but will cause district-wide catastrophes

**Runner Gear**:

### Flora & Fauna

**Mutated Species** (from kinetic radiation exposure):
- **Momentum Moths**: Insects that only exist while moving, freeze solid if stopped
- **Echo Bats**: Create temporal duplicates of themselves
- **Gravity Worms**: Massive creatures in Under-Grid that create localized gravity wells
- **Flow Falcons**: Birds that can see and follow Flow Lines, sometimes guide lost Runners
- **Static Slimes**: Gelatinous organisms that absorb kinetic energy, deadly to touch while moving

**Trade Goods**:
- Runner gear and equipment
- Forged transit permits
- Safe house locations
- Route maps and Line fragment information
- Anti-surveillance tech
- Food and water (scarce in some districts)

**Scarcity Issues**:
- Clean water (rain is toxic from altitude)
- Fresh food (all grown in controlled corporate farms)
- Free movement (most valuable commodity)
- Information (Syndicate controls media)
- Hope (psychological scarcity)

### Religion & Philosophy

**The Way of Flow** (Runner spirituality):
- Belief that movement is life, stasis is death
- City seen as deity/mother figure
- Perfect Line is pilgrimage to enlightenment
- Death while running is honored ("going over the horizon")
- Reincarnation through kinetic echoes

**Stability Doctrine** (Syndicate propaganda):
- Safety through control
- Freedom is dangerous chaos
- Runners are addicts and terrorists
- Order benefits everyone
- Progress requires sacrifice (of lower classes)

**Architect Mysteries** (ancient forgotten lore):
- Original builders left behind philosophical texts
- Movement as universal language
- Cities as tests of sentient species
- Transcendence through mastery
- Hidden purpose of Zenith Prime yet to be revealed
