# Creative Brief: Princess of Barsoom

## Art Style: Sword and Planet Illustration (Pulp Planetary Romance)

Inspired by classic Edgar Rice Burroughs cover art and Frank Frazetta—heroic physiques, exotic costumes (or lack thereof), red desert landscapes, towering ruins, four-armed aliens, beautiful princesses.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Red dominates—ochre deserts, crimson skies, rust-colored ruins. Green Martians in olive and forest tones. Red Martians in copper skin tones with jeweled harnesses. Twin moons glow in alien sky. Radium weapons glow blue-white. Ancient gold gleams in lost tombs.

**Character Design:** Minimal clothing due to temperature-controlled harnesses—warriors in battle harnesses, princesses in jeweled costumes. Earth heroes in torn remnants of Earth clothes. Green Martians are massive, four-armed, tusked. Red Martians are humanoid perfection. Exotic jewelry and weapons denote status.

**Environments:** Endless red deserts with strange rock formations. Ancient cities crumbling to dust. Green Martian settlements in ruins. Helium's gleaming towers and bridges. Airships of elegant design. Arena with tiered seating. Atmosphere factories—mysterious and vital.

**Action:** Sword fighting on airship decks, leaping impossible distances, gladiatorial combat with exotic beasts, princess rescue, airship battles with ray weapons, riding eight-legged thoats, duels of honor.

## Voice

Romantic and adventurous with touches of melancholy. The voice of someone describing lost love and desperate battles on a dying world. When speaking of Barsoom, there's wonder mixed with sorrow—a beautiful civilization slowly perishing. Combat descriptions are visceral and personal. Romance is passionate and genuine. Descriptions of alien vistas are poetic. There's nobility even in savagery, and hope even in decline.

## Music Style

Orchestral romance meets exotic planetary adventure. Sweeping strings for vast deserts and eternal love. Alien instruments suggest the otherness of Mars—unusual scales, haunting melodies. Green Martian themes use heavy percussion and primal rhythms. Red Martian themes are elegant and civilized. The main theme is simultaneously triumphant and tinged with sadness—heroism on a dying world. Action sequences feature dramatic swells and clashing metal sounds. Romantic moments are achingly beautiful. The score captures both the glory of what Barsoom was and the tragedy of what it's becoming.
