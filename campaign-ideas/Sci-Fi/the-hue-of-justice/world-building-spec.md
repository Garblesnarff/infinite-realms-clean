### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Hue of Justice**

**1. Core Concept:** The Sibyl System judges all citizens' souls as Crime Coefficients. Party are Enforcers/Inspectors hunting latent criminals. A criminally asymptomatic genius exposes the System's flaws, forcing the party to question if algorithmic justice is true justice.

**2. Lore Primer:** Sibyl System implemented after chaos period, reads souls through magical technology, assigns coefficients, society has nearly zero crime, latent criminals become Enforcers or are eliminated, criminally asymptomatic people exist but are rare, the System's true nature (composed of criminal brains) is hidden.

**3. Factions:**
*   **Public Safety Bureau (Players):** Inspectors (clear hues) and Enforcers (latent criminals) hunting threats.
*   **The Sibyl System:** Omniscient judge controlling society.
*   **Criminally Asymptomatic Network:** Those the System can't read.
*   **True Believers:** Citizens who worship the System.
*   **Underground Resistance:** Those who reject System control (few and hunted).

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Makishima (asymptomatic criminal), Sibyl System, Chief Inspector, Veteran Enforcer.
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Latent Criminal," "Clear Citizen," "System Therapist," "Enforcer," "Inspector."

**5. Locations:** Public Safety Bureau HQ, Sibyl core chamber, sterile city districts, underground crime scenes, therapy facilities, the hidden truth location.

**6. Triggers:**
*   **IF party's hue clouds significantly:** Therapy required or risk becoming targets.
*   **IF party questions System openly:** Investigated, possibly eliminated.
*   **IF discover System's true nature:** Must choose sides.
