# The Chronomancer's Gambit - World-Building Spec

## Timeline Map

### Future (6 Months After Outbreak)
- 90% population dead
- Civilization collapsed
- Survivors in isolated pockets
- Cassian operating from Spire
- Sends party back from here

### Present (Campaign Start)
- Normal fantasy world
- Unaware of coming doom
- Various factions and conflicts
- Laboratory exists but innocuous
- Everything about to end

### One Year Before
- Plague research beginning
- Professor Ashford innocent curiosity
- Funding approved
- Early warning signs missable
- Last chance for "easy" solution

### Five Years Before
- Events leading to lab creation
- Political decisions enabling research
- Economic factors
- Social conditions
- Complex web of causality

### Twenty Years Before
- Ancient vault discovered
- Bioweapon found and studied
- Containment protocols established
- Slow contamination begins
- Point of no return possibly

### Centuries Past
- Demonic invasion threatens
- Vortigern creates bioweapon
- Weapon used successfully
- Demons repelled, weapon sealed
- Original sin

## The Plague

### Nature
- Magical bioweapon
- Targets specific genetic markers
- 90% mortality rate
- No known cure
- Spreads rapidly

### Evolution Across Timelines
- Adapts based on party's actions
- Different vectors each attempt
- Seems almost intelligent
- Possibly is sentient
- Responds to prevention efforts

### The Truth
- Not created artificially
- Released from containment
- Party's tampering destabilizes vault
- Self-fulfilling prophecy
- Bootstrap paradox incarnate

## Cassian's Journey

### Original Timeline
- Brilliant chronomancer
- Happy life
- Witnessed apocalypse
- Discovered time travel
- Sent first team back

### After First Failure
- Team died or failed
- Sent second team
- Started losing hope
- Moral compromises begin

### Current State
- Dozens of attempts
- Barely sane
- Desperate and dangerous
- May be lying to party
- Tragic villain/hero

## Temporal Madness Mechanics

### Stage 1: Disorientation
- Mixing up which timeline
- Déjà vu constantly
- Minor confusion
- Manageable

### Stage 2: Memory Bleed
- Multiple timeline memories
- Can't distinguish real from altered
- Increasing paranoia
- Difficult to trust

### Stage 3: Temporal Displacement
- Feeling unstuck from time
- Seeing multiple moments simultaneously
- Communication difficulty
- Combat penalty

### Stage 4: Breakdown
- Personality fragmentation
- Cannot function normally
- May become NPC
- Requires immediate treatment

## The Ancient War

### Demonic Invasion
- Otherworldly threat
- Would have destroyed civilization
- Vortigern's weapon stopped it
- Millions saved
- Justified at the time

### Moral Complexity
- Weapon was necessary
- But consequences terrible
- No clear right answer
- Both choices have costs
- Party faces similar dilemma

## Multiple Failed Attempts

### Evidence Party Finds
- Previous teams' remains
- Different approaches tried
- All failed
- Some teams went mad
- Some turned on each other
- Warning signs

### What This Means
- Party may be doomed too
- Cassian increasingly desperate
- Methods becoming extreme
- Trust issues
- Need creative solution

## The Third Option

### Revelation
- Cannot prevent plague
- Cannot allow apocalypse
- Must find middle path
- Containment instead of elimination
- Reduce casualties drastically

### Implementation
- Requires ancient magic
- Sacrifice from party
- Coordinate across timelines
- Partial success acceptable
- Better than alternatives

## Victory Details

### Containment Protocol
- Plague limited to small region
- Quarantine enforced magically
- 1-5% casualties vs. 90%
- Civilization survives
- Scars remain

### Sacrifice Required
- Party member stays in ancient past
- Maintains containment spell
- Eternal vigil
- Heroic choice
- Bittersweet victory

### Consequences
- Bioweapon never fully destroyed
- Remains contained indefinitely
- Future generations must maintain
- Vigilance eternal
- Price of survival

This structure creates mounting desperation and moral complexity as party works backward through time.
