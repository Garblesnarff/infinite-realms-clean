# The Chronomancer's Gambit
**Tagline:** *"Prevent the plague. Stop the madness. Save the future. But time is breaking."*

## Campaign Overview

A devastating magical plague will emerge in six months, killing 90% of the population and ending civilization. The party is recruited by a time-traveling chronomancer who has seen this future and sends them backward through time to prevent the plague's creation. However, each attempt to stop it fails, and the party must jump further and further back, discovering that the plague's origins are far more complex—and their own efforts to prevent it may be causing it.

The campaign structure involves jumping backward through time in increasingly desperate attempts to find and eliminate the plague's source. Starting six months before outbreak, then one year, five years, twenty years, and eventually centuries back. Each jump reveals new information that recontextualizes previous knowledge. The party experiences time in reverse, seeing effects before causes, and gradually realizes they're caught in a causal loop they themselves created.

## Core Themes

- **Desperation and Determination**: Fighting against inevitable doom
- **Reverse Investigation**: Working backward from effect to cause
- **Unintended Consequences**: Solutions becoming problems
- **Madness from Temporal Displacement**: Sanity eroding from time travel
- **The Road to Hell**: Good intentions, terrible outcomes

## Plot Twists

**Twist 1:** Plague already existed in nature, attempts to create it actually contain it

**Twist 2:** Cassian is from timeline where party succeeded—he's trying to restore that

**Twist 3:** Party member is descended from Vortigern, will become him through time loop

**Twist 4:** The plague is cure for worse disease party hasn't seen yet

**Twist 5:** Chronomancer is actually villain, manipulating party to create plague

**Twist 6:** Party's first jump back is what awakens dormant plague

**Twist 7:** Only way to prevent plague is one party member staying in past permanently

**Twist 8:** The entire campaign is one of many failed loops

## Victory Conditions

**Optimal Victory:** Find way to contain plague instead of preventing it, save most lives

**Standard Victory:** Prevent plague but accept other timeline problems

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Destroy plague but break causality, unknown consequences

**Tragic Victory:** Accept plague is necessary, minimize casualties instead

## Defeat Conditions

**Timeline Collapse:** Too many jumps break causality irreparably

**Eternal Loop:** Trapped sending teams back forever, never succeeding

**Madness:** Party loses sanity completely from temporal displacement

**The Plague Wins:** All attempts fail, apocalypse occurs anyway
