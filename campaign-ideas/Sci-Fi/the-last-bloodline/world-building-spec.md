### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Last Bloodline**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A magical plague swept across the world, killing every male of every species in a single day—except one. The party protects the Last Man and his loyal companion (a male monkey, somehow also immune) as they journey across a shattered world seeking answers. They must navigate newly-formed societies, desperate factions who want to control the Last Man, and uncover the truth behind the plague while asking: what kind of world will emerge from this catastrophe?

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail The Day of Dying—the moment the plague struck, how it manifested, the immediate chaos, the global scale of simultaneous death.
    *   Write the history of the secret research project that developed the plague as a radical solution to overpopulation and male-driven violence.
    *   Describe the immediate aftermath—infrastructure collapse, government breakdown, resource scrambles, the first days of survival.
    *   Explain how different regions responded—some organized quickly, others descended into chaos, new power structures emerged.
    *   Detail the various survivor philosophies that emerged: radical feminism seeing it as divine judgment, pragmatists focused on survival, scientists seeking solutions, traditionalists trying to maintain old structures.
