# Creative Brief: War of the Pantheons

Art Style: Gritty Americana with Mythic Intrusions. Realistic modern America (diners, highways, strip malls) suddenly pierced by the divine and mythological. Inspired by American Gothic, roadside Americana photography, and Neil Gaiman's aesthetic.

**Color Palette:** Faded American highway colors (dusty browns, faded signs), neon for New Gods (electric blues, screen whites), ancient colors for Old Gods (bronze, tarnished gold, weathered stone).

**Character Design:** Old Gods in shabby modern clothes hiding ancient nobility (Odin as con man, Czernobog as factory worker), New Gods as sleek corporate or tech aesthetic, mortals caught between worlds.

**Backgrounds:** American highways, roadside attractions, forgotten small towns, neon-lit casinos, corporate glass towers, sacred sites hidden in plain sight (gas stations built on Native burial grounds).

**Mood:** Mythic Americana, melancholy beauty in forgotten places, clash of ancient and modern, belief manifesting as reality.

Voice: A mythic American voice, like a storyteller mixing highway poetry with ancient sagas. The pacing is road-trip slow then battle-sudden. Emotion conveys both the grandeur of gods and the sadness of their decline. Role: The chronicler of America's secret divine history.
