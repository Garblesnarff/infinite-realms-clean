### **World-Building Specification Brief: War of the Pantheons**

**Core Concept:** In modern America, Old Gods (brought by immigrants) are dying as belief fades while New Gods (Media, Technology) rise. Players are recruited for a war between them, traveling America's backroads to discover the war itself is a con.

**Key Factions:**
- **Old Gods:** Immigrant deities (Odin, Anansi, Czernobog, Bast, etc.) scraping by in roadside America, led by Wednesday.
- **New Gods:** American deities of modern worship (Media, Technical Boy, Mr. World/Globalization), slick and powerful.
- **The Con:** Wednesday and Loki manipulating both sides for massive blood sacrifice to regain power.
- **Forgotten Gods:** Native American deities and spirits with legitimate grievances against all immigrants.
- **Mortals Touched by Divine:** Players and NPCs who serve gods but might forge new path.

**Key Locations:**
- **Roadside America:** Diners, motels, gas stations, forgotten attractions where Old Gods hide.
- **House on the Rock:** Bizarre Wisconsin attraction, meeting place for gods.
- **Sacred American Geography:** Geographic center, sites of sacrifice, power locations.
- **Corporate Towers and Data Centers:** Where New Gods manifest most strongly.

**Magic/Divine Systems:**
- **Belief as Power:** Worship gives gods strength. Forgetting kills them. Modern attention feeds New Gods.
- **Divine Aspects:** Gods grant powers to followers themed to their nature, but at cost.
- **Sacred Geography:** Certain American locations amplify divine power and rituals.
- **Death and Resurrection:** Gods and god-touched can return if remembered/believed.

**Unique Mechanics:**
- **Roadside Encounters:** Gods hiding in mundane jobs, visible only to those who see.
- **Belief Currency:** Players can strengthen gods through spreading stories, rituals, art.
- **The Con Revelation:** Discovering the war is manipulated sacrifice, choosing third path.
- **American Mythology:** Creating new gods or transforming relationship between human and divine.
