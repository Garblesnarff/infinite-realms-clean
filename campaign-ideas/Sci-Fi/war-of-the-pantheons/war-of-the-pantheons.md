*An Urban Fantasy / Modern Mythology campaign — Long Campaign (15+ sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** War of the Pantheons
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Modern Mythology / Gods in Decline / Americana
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **14**
**Tone (keywords):** mythic-americana, gods-among-mortals, belief-as-power, road-trip, old-vs-new, sacrifice
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In modern America, the old gods—brought by immigrants over centuries (Odin, Anansi, Czernobog, Bast, and countless others)—are fading as belief dwindles, scraping by in roadside attractions and seedy motels. Meanwhile, new American gods have risen—Media, Technology, Globalization—fed by contemporary worship and growing stronger every day. The players are a mix of mortals touched by the divine and minor deities themselves, recruited by Mr. Wednesday (actually Odin) for a war between Old and New, traveling America's backroads and encountering gods hiding in plain sight. But as they prepare for the coming storm, they discover the war itself is a con—and they must choose which America's soul they'll fight for: the one built on immigrant dreams and ancient stories, or the one built on innovation and progress.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

*   **Act I — The Recruitment (Sessions 1–5):** Players are recruited by Mr. Wednesday, a con man who reveals himself as Odin All-Father. They travel across America, meeting Old Gods hiding in poverty: Mad Sweeney (leprechaun), Mr. Nancy (Anansi), Czernobog (Slavic death god), Bast, and others. They learn that belief gives gods power, and America has forgotten the old ways. New Gods (Technical Boy, Media, Mr. World) actively hunt and destroy Old Gods. Players witness a god's death when belief is completely withdrawn—terrifying and permanent. They're inducted into the coming war and given their first missions: protect remaining Old Gods and gather allies.

*   **Act II — The Road to the Vigil (Sessions 6–11):** The players journey to iconic American locations where the divine intrudes: House on the Rock, Wisconsin (repository of weird Americana), New Orleans (where gods still thrive in voodoo), Las Vegas (where chance gods gamble), Lookout Mountain (Civil War ghosts), and Rock City. Each location contains a god or divine artifact needed for the war. They encounter gods who've adapted (like Easter, who commercialized her holiday), gods who've given up, and gods actively working for the New Gods. They discover that Mr. World (leader of New Gods) plans to eliminate all Old Gods through a grand sacrifice—but Wednesday has his own hidden agenda. Personal sacrifice: players must give up something precious to gain divine favor or powers.

*   **Act III — The Storm at the Heart (Sessions 12–15+):** All parties converge at the geographic heart of America for the promised battle. But players discover the truth: Wednesday manipulated both sides. The "war" is a massive blood sacrifice—Old and New Gods killing each other—all to feed Wednesday and his ally Loki so they can ascend to ultimate power. The real battle isn't Old vs New—it's about whether gods will continue to feed on humanity's belief-slavery, or whether humanity can be free of gods entirely. Players must choose: side with the Old Gods despite their manipulation, ally with New Gods and their sterile future, or forge a third path where gods serve humanity rather than rule it. The campaign ends with players potentially becoming new American gods themselves—but different ones, built on chosen ideals rather than worship-hunger.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Belief as Currency**
*   Gods' power comes from worship/belief. Old Gods are weak because few remember them.
*   Players can strengthen gods by: spreading stories about them, performing rituals, creating art depicting them, converting believers.
*   New Gods gain power from contemporary worship: scrolling social media feeds Media, buying products feeds Globalization.

### 2. **Roadside Divine Encounters**
*   Travel montages between locations where players encounter gods hiding in plain sight: a waitress who is Bast, a taxi driver who is a forgotten war god, a casino dealer who is Fortune.
*   Each encounter is both mundane and magical—gods working regular jobs but with divine quirks visible to those who see.

### 3. **Sacred Geography**
*   Certain American locations are inherently powerful: geographic center, sites of mass sacrifice, places where old and new worlds met.
*   Performing rituals at these locations has amplified effects.
*   The land itself remembers—Native American gods and spirits have legitimate grievances.

### 4. **Death is Not Always the End**
*   Gods can die if completely forgotten, but can resurrect if remembered/believed in again.
*   Players who die can be resurrected at cost—becoming touched by death, owing favors to death gods, or losing something precious.
*   Shadow's journey: dying, visiting the underworld, returning changed.

### 5. **Divine Aspect Powers**
*   Players touched by gods gain minor divine abilities themed to that god: Odin grants wisdom/tricks, Anansi grants stories/lies, War grants combat prowess.
*   But each gift has a price—Odin's wisdom comes with one eye's sacrifice, War's strength costs peace of mind.
*   Players can reject divine gifts, staying human but vulnerable.

## Central Conflict

Old immigrant dreams vs new American reality. Is worship slavery or symbiosis? Can gods exist without feeding on humanity? The question isn't whether Old or New wins, but whether humanity can be free of gods entirely—or needs to forge new relationships with the divine built on mutual respect rather than worship-hunger. What does it mean to be American, and which gods reflect that truth?
