## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A three-act arc of speed, danger, and uncovering a deadly conspiracy.

*   **Act I — Rookie Circuits & The Death Track (Sessions 1-8):** The party enters F-Zero racing with different sponsors, learning to survive tracks where one mistake means death. They compete in increasingly dangerous circuits while investigating why several racers have died under suspicious circumstances. They discover the death tracks are being modified by someone with access to race control systems.
*   **Act II — The Championship Hunt (Sessions 9-17):** Now veteran racers, the party competes in elite circuits across multiple planets—ice worlds, volcanic stations, and the legendary Mute City. The conspiracy deepens when they learn that Black Shadow, a crime lord who also races, is eliminating racers who get too close to discovering his smuggling operation hidden within F-Zero. Captain Falcon enlists their help off-track.
*   **Act III — The Ultimate Grand Prix (Sessions 18-25):** Black Shadow challenges all racers to a final, illegal Grand Prix on his personal death track with no rules and no survivors except the winner. The party must race while stopping his plan to use the championship platform to assassinate the Galactic Federation president. The final race becomes a battle at 1000+ km/h where racing and combat blur into one deadly challenge.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of honor in deadly competition, justice outside the law, pushing human limits, and the price of extreme speed. It asks: How fast is too fast? Can there be honor in a sport designed to kill? Is personal glory worth your life? The central conflict pits the party's desire to win and survive against forces that would corrupt even the dangerous purity of F-Zero racing.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Anti-Gravity Racing Physics**
*   Machines hover using anti-gravity generators, allowing impossible speeds and angles
*   Players must manage thrust, drift, and vertical positioning on tracks with multiple elevation levels
*   Crashing at high speed is often fatal—shield management is critical
*   Zero-friction environments allow for extreme speed but reduced control

### 2. **Energy Management System**
*   Machines have unified energy pool for shields and boost
*   Boosting drains energy—run out and your shields fail
*   Pit zones restore energy but cost time
*   Risk/reward: boost for speed or conserve for survival?
*   Damage further reduces maximum energy capacity

### 3. **Speed Threshold Mechanics**
*   Different mechanical challenges at different speed tiers:
    *   600-800 km/h: Technical racing, precise turns
    *   800-1000 km/h: Reaction time critical, mistakes deadly
    *   1000+ km/h: Reality blurs, requires enhanced reflexes or tech
*   Some characters have cybernetic enhancements for extreme speeds
*   G-force strain represented by Constitution saves at high speeds

### 4. **Machine Customization**
*   Four stats: Power (top speed), Body (durability), Grip (handling), Boost (acceleration)
*   Different machine classes: lightweight (fast but fragile), heavyweight (durable but slow), balanced
*   Custom parts earned through victories or purchased with prize money
*   Experimental illegal modifications available through black market

### 5. **Combat Racing**
*   In illegal races, machines can be equipped with weapons
*   Ramming opponents to drain their shields
*   Energy disruptors, EMP bursts, mine droppers
*   Defensive abilities: emergency shields, afterburner escapes
*   Combat effectiveness balanced against racing performance

### 6. **Reputation & Sponsors**
*   Performance builds reputation across categories: Clean Racer, Aggressive Driver, Show-Off, Survivor
*   Different sponsors prefer different styles, offering corresponding machines and support
*   High reputation unlocks exclusive races and experimental technology
*   Losing sponsor support mid-campaign has serious consequences

### 7. **G-Force Stress System**
*   Extended racing at extreme speeds causes physical strain
*   Characters make Constitution checks after races to avoid exhaustion
*   Cybernetic enhancements reduce strain but come with other costs
*   Medical treatment between races becomes strategic resource
*   Pushing too hard risks permanent injury or death

### 8. **Track Hazards at Speed**
*   Environmental hazards are more dangerous at higher speeds
*   Mines, energy barriers, collapsing sections, other racers
*   Some tracks have "kill zones" designed to eliminate racers
*   Knowledge of tracks allows pre-planning optimal lines
*   Track changes between laps—must adapt on the fly
