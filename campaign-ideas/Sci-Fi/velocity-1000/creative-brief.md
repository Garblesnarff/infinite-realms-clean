# Creative Brief: Velocity 1000

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Sleek Futuristic Racing (F-Zero-inspired)

Inspired by the high-tech, speed-focused aesthetics of *F-Zero* with emphasis on extreme velocity, anti-gravity machines, and deadly futuristic tracks. This style captures the danger of racing at 1000+ km/h, the sleek design of 26th-century technology, and the tension between honor and survival.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Extreme Speed:** Motion blur, speed trails, stretched backgrounds, sense of barely-controlled velocity
*   **Futuristic Tech Design:** Sleek anti-grav machines with glowing engines, holographic interfaces, advanced materials
*   **Deadly Track Architecture:** Impossible circuits with no guardrails, environmental hazards, vertical loops
*   **High-Contrast Lighting:** Neon against darkness, engine glow, energy trails in space

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Extreme speed, deadly precision, futuristic, anti-gravity, honor, life-or-death, technological marvel
*   **Feeling:** The rush of moving faster than thought should allow, with death one mistake away. Clean futuristic design masking brutal danger. Honor among racers facing mortality together.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Machine Design:** Metallic blues, reds, golds with glowing energy accents (blue/orange thrusters, green/purple energy shields)
*   **Track Environments:** Dark space backgrounds with bright track lighting, neon circuit lines, energy barriers in cyan/magenta
*   **Environmental:** Planet-specific—lava orange/red, ice blue/white, ocean deep blue, city neon multicolor
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by sleek metallic blue racing machine with glowing orange thruster trails against a dark space background. The track is illuminated with cyan energy strips. Purple shield energy crackles around damaged sections. Motion blur creates streaks of light."

**3. Machine Design:**
*   **Aerodynamic Forms:** Needle-like profiles, angular edges, intake vents, thrust vectoring exhausts
*   **Anti-Grav Tech:** Visible hover generators under the machine, energy field effects keeping them aloft
*   **Cockpits:** Streamlined canopies with visible pilots in racing suits and helmets with HUD displays
*   **Prompt Example:** "A sleek blue anti-gravity racing machine with an aerodynamic needle-nose design. Glowing orange thrusters at the rear emit energy trails. The bottom shows three circular anti-gravity generators with blue energy fields. Angular stabilizer fins. Reflective metallic hull. Cockpit has a tinted canopy showing pilot inside."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Space Tracks:** Circuits floating in asteroid fields, orbiting stations, crystalline formations
*   **Planetary Circuits:** Lava flows, endless oceans, urban megacities with building-integrated tracks
*   **Track Elements:** Energy barriers instead of walls, boost pads, pit zones, hazard warnings
*   **Prompt Example:** "A racing track made of metallic panels with glowing cyan circuit lines, suspended over an endless ocean on an alien planet. The track has no guardrails and curves upward into a vertical loop. In the distance, a futuristic city rises from the water. The sky shows three moons and a nebula."

**5. Racing Action:**
*   **Speed Visualization:** Extreme motion blur on everything except the focus machine, light trails, afterimage effects
*   **Energy Effects:** Shield sparks when scraping walls, boost flames, energy weapon trails in combat racing
*   **Danger Moments:** Machines mid-crash with debris flying, near-misses with hazards, desperate maneuvers
*   **Prompt Example:** "Three anti-gravity racing machines at 1000 km/h on a straightaway. The background is completely motion-blurred into light streaks. The lead red machine has intense orange boost flames erupting from its thrusters. The second blue machine is dangerously close, its purple shields sparking from near-contact. Energy trails streak behind each machine."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **High-Tech Sheen:** Reflective metallic surfaces, chrome highlights, polished futuristic materials
*   **Energy Glow:** Thrusters, shields, and boost systems emit bright colored light
*   **Environmental Drama:** Lava glow, starlight in space, neon city lights reflecting on machines
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit with the racing machine's glowing orange thrusters casting light on the dark track. Chrome surfaces reflect the cyan track lighting. The cockpit interior shows holographic HUD displays. The pilot's visor reflects the track ahead. Deep shadows contrast with bright energy effects."

## Voice

A focused, intense voice with controlled adrenaline, like a racer maintaining composure at lethal speeds. The pacing is rapid but precise during racing descriptions, slowing for technical details and strategy. The tone shifts between cool professionalism ("Energy at 40%, need pit zone"), intense focus during danger ("Left wall! Left wall!"), and solemn respect for fallen racers. There's an underlying theme of honor in the face of death. Slightly breathless from G-forces but never panicking. Role: The voice of deadly precision.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** High-energy electronic/rock fusion with driving bass and synthesizers. Each track location has distinctive music matching environment (industrial for cities, ethereal for space, intense for volcanoes).
*   **Sound Effects:** Anti-gravity hum at different pitches by speed, thruster roar, boost ignition, shield impacts sparking, explosion of crashed machines, pit zone energy restoration.
*   **Dynamic Music:** Intensifies during final lap, changes pitch as speed increases, triumphant when overtaking, ominous when shields are critical.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** Track-specific—wind howl, lava bubbling, ocean waves, space silence broken by machine sounds.
