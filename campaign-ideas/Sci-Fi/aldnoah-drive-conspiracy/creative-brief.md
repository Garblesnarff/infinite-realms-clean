# Creative Brief: Aldnoah Drive Conspiracy

## Art Style: Military Realism vs. Ornate Superweapons (Aldnoah.Zero Aesthetic)

Stark contrast between Earth's gritty, mass-produced tech and Mars's elegant, golden superweapons. This style emphasizes the class divide—dirty, desperate Earth vs. pristine, powerful Mars.

### Core Principles:

*   **Contrast:** Earth is gray/brown industrial rubble vs. Mars is gold/white ornate design.
*   **Asymmetry:** Show scale difference—small Earth mechs vs. towering Martian Kataphrakts.
*   **Tactical Precision:** Battles shown as chess matches—positioning, planning, exploiting weaknesses.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Earth:** Grays, browns, military greens, dust and rubble. Desperate and functional.
*   **Mars:** Gold, white, royal blue, ornate decoration. Elegant and superior.
*   **Aldnoah Energy:** Golden glow for Martian tech activation.

**Character Design:**
*   **Inaho:** Short orange/brown hair, dead emotionless eyes, military cadet uniform. Never shows emotion.
*   **Asseylum:** Platinum blonde hair, elegant royal dresses or simple civilian clothes, kind eyes.
*   **Slaine:** Dark hair, Terran slave clothing or stolen Martian uniform, eyes showing desperation and obsession.

**Kataphrakt Design:**
*   **Earth Mechs (Kataphrakts/KG-7s):** Boxy, industrial, tank-like humanoids. Gray/green, utilitarian.
*   **Martian Kataphrakts:** Elegant golden/white mechs with unique silhouettes (wings, massive cannons, ornate armor). Each visually distinct.

**Voice:** Deadpan tactical analysis—speaking in clipped military terms, emotionless recitation of enemy capabilities and countermeasures. Think combat AI or emotionally stunted genius.

## Music Palette:
*   Electronic and orchestral hybrid—cold synths for tactical planning, swelling strings for emotional beats.
*   Iconic: "Heavenly Blue" (melancholic opening), "aLIEz" (intense battle theme with tragic undertones).
