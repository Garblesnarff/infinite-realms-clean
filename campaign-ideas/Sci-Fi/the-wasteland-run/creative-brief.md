# Creative Brief: The Wasteland Run

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Apocalyptic Opera (Mad Max meets High-Octane Fantasy)

Inspired by the saturated colors, practical effects, and kinetic energy of Mad Max: Fury Road, this aesthetic combines post-apocalyptic brutalism with operatic intensity. It's a world of chrome, rust, fire, and sand—where every frame bursts with color despite the desolation, and where vehicular combat is choreographed like a violent ballet.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Kinetic Energy:** Everything should feel like it's moving at high speed, even when still. Motion blur, dynamic angles, impossible stunts.
*   **Saturated Desolation:** Despite the apocalypse, use bold colors—the blue of sky, orange of rust and fire, the chrome of engines.
*   **Practical Brutalism:** Vehicles and equipment should look cobbled together, functional, and real. Nothing is pristine or factory-made.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Adrenaline-fueled, desperate, vehicular-mayhem, survival, chrome-and-rust, operatic, explosive, frenetic, hope-in-desolation.
*   **Feeling:** The thunder of engines and the howl of wind. Vehicles held together with prayer and scrap metal racing across endless desert. The desperate beauty of fighting for survival. Everything saturated with color despite the end of the world.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Angular, aggressive forms for vehicles—all spikes, exposed engines, and cobbled armor. Characters lean and scarred, marked by the wasteland.
*   **Textures:** Rust, chrome, leather, bare metal, sand-scoured paint, welded scrap, scorched rubber.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting of a heavily-modified war vehicle racing through desert, all chrome pipes, rust, and welded armor plates. Practical modifications everywhere—harpoon guns, reinforced rams, flame throwers cobbled from scrap."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Surprisingly vibrant despite the apocalypse. Dominated by the deep blue sky, orange-rust earth, chrome reflections, and fire.
*   **Primary Colors:** Desert oranges and reds, deep blue sky, chrome silver, rust brown.
*   **Accent Colors:** The orange-red of flames and explosions, the blue of rare water, the chrome of polished engines, the red of blood.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Harsh desert sun creates stark shadows and blinding highlights. Everything is over-saturated, hyperreal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...set against a deep blue desert sky with harsh sunlight creating intense highlights on chrome and rust. Orange-red sand kicks up in roostertails behind racing vehicles. Colors are pushed to saturation—hyperreal apocalyptic beauty."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Wasteland survivors marked by their environment—scarred, lean, wearing cobbled armor and leather. War Boys are pale, covered in ritual scars and chrome spray paint.
*   **Warriors:** Each fighter's equipment tells their story—skulls for trophies, scavenged armor, weapons made from vehicle parts.
*   **Expression:** Manic intensity, desperate hope, religious fervor (for War Boys), weary determination (for survivors).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wasteland warrior in leather and scrap-metal armor, face half-covered by a breathing mask made from car parts. Weapons cobbled from vehicle components. Their eyes show desperate determination. Chrome spray paint marks their hands—the mark of a former War Boy seeking redemption."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Endless desert punctuated by rock formations, rusted vehicle graveyards, and the towering Citadel carved from rock.
*   **Atmosphere:** Vast, hostile, beautiful in its desolation. The sense of being exposed under endless sky.
*   **Details:** Vehicle wrecks half-buried in sand, rock formations carved by wind, dust clouds on the horizon, the shimmer of heat distortion.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast desert vista under deep blue sky. In the distance, the Citadel rises—a massive rock formation carved into a fortress. The foreground shows a vehicle graveyard where rusted war machines slowly disappear under orange sand. Heat distortion shimmers on the horizon."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, direct sunlight creating intense highlights and deep shadows. Everything washed in the golden-orange light of desert sun.
*   **Shadows:** Sharp and dark, offering no relief from the sun. Characters often squint against the glare.
*   **Purpose:** Emphasize the hostile environment, create intense visual contrast between chrome (reflecting) and rust (absorbing), make fire and explosions even more spectacular.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...illuminated by brutal desert sun creating blinding highlights on chrome surfaces and pitch-black shadows beneath vehicles. Dust in the air catches light, creating golden haze. An explosion blooms in orange-red against the blue sky, every detail hyperreal and saturated."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic vehicular perspectives—low angles showing vehicles from below to emphasize power, motion blur for speed, camera positioned as if mounted on racing vehicles.
*   **Techniques:** Dutch angles for chaos, tracking shots showing vehicles racing in parallel, extreme close-ups of determination followed by wide shots of vast landscape.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle tracking shot of multiple war vehicles racing in parallel across desert, kicking up massive roostertails of orange sand. The camera is positioned as if on a vehicle moving with them, creating motion blur in the background. War Boys lean out of vehicles, weapons raised. The composition emphasizes speed, danger, and the thin line between survival and death at 100 mph."

## Voice

A gravelly, exhausted but fierce voice—male or female, raspy from breathing sand and shouting over engines. The accent is indeterminate wasteland—a mix of influences suggesting cultural collapse and rebirth. Pacing is urgent, intense, with the rhythm of engine thunder beneath words. Emotion ranges from desperate determination to manic joy in survival to rage against tyranny. Audio quality includes engine roar, wind howl, the shriek of metal on metal. Role: A survivor, a warrior, someone who's seen the worst but chooses to fight anyway—shouting to be heard over the chaos of the wasteland.
