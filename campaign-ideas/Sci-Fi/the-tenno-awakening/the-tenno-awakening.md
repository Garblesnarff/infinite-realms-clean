The players are Tenno—ancient warriors awakening from cryosleep after centuries. They pilot bio-mechanical Warframes, granting superhuman abilities and making them feared across the Origin System. They must navigate a complex war between the capitalist Corpus, militaristic Grineer, and techno-organic Infested, all while uncovering the truth about their own nature. The Tenno are not heroes—they are living weapons created by the extinct Orokin empire, and must choose what that means in a new age.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12+ sessions)

A tale of awakening, identity, and choosing sides in endless war.

*   **Act I — Awakening (Sessions 1–4):** The party awakens from cryosleep in crumbling Orokin facilities, guided by the mysterious Lotus. They must learn to pilot their Warframes and fight through Grineer and Corpus forces. They discover the Origin System is embroiled in factional warfare with no clear good guys.
*   **Act II — The Balance (Sessions 5–9):** The Tenno take on missions for various factions, maintaining balance of power while gathering resources and knowledge. They uncover clues about the Orokin's fall and the truth about Warframes—they're not suits, but transference-controlled bio-weapons with their own consciousness. The Infested threat grows.
*   **Act III — The Revelation (Sessions 10–12+):** The Lotus reveals she is a Sentient—living AI machines that destroyed the Orokin. The players must choose: follow her into uncertain future, join one of the warring factions, or forge their own path. They confront the truth about the Tenno—children who survived the Void and gained impossible powers.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity, the nature of consciousness, and whether living weapons can choose their own purpose. The central conflict is internal—are the Tenno heroes, monsters, or simply tools?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Warframe Switching**
*   Each player controls a Tenno who can pilot multiple Warframes (one primary, others in reserve).
*   Warframes are specialized builds: Tank, DPS, Support, Stealth, Crowd Control.
*   Players can swap Warframes during long rests, allowing different loadouts for missions.
*   Each Warframe has unique signature abilities beyond standard class features.

### 2. **Transference**
*   Tenno don't fight directly—they control Warframes remotely via Void energy.
*   If a Warframe is destroyed, the Tenno can either build a new one or temporarily Transference into enemies.
*   This creates asymmetric gameplay where the "real" Tenno are vulnerable children in hidden pods.

### 3. **Mod System**
*   Warframes and weapons can be upgraded with Mods—collectible enhancements.
*   Mods provide: increased damage, elemental effects, ability tweaks, utility powers.
*   Capacity limits prevent over-modding, creating meaningful build choices.
*   Rare mods from bosses create progression goals.

### 4. **Faction Standing**
*   Track reputation with: Corpus, Grineer, Infested Hives, Syndicates (neutral groups), Sentients.
*   High standing grants access to unique gear and information.
*   Helping one faction often harms another, creating strategic choices.
*   Some factions (Infested, Sentients) can never be allied with long-term.

### 5. **The Parkour System**
*   Tenno are incredibly mobile: wall-running, bullet-jumping, sliding, gliding.
*   Environmental traversal challenges are common in missions.
*   Combat emphasizes movement—standing still is death.
*   Bonus actions can be used for parkour maneuvers mid-combat.
