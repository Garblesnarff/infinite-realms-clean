# Creative Brief: Echoes of the Dying Sun

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Handcrafted Cosmic Wonder (Outer Wilds-inspired)

Inspired by the contemplative space exploration and whimsical-yet-profound aesthetics of *Outer Wilds*. This style captures the majesty of cosmic phenomena, the loneliness of space, the wonder of alien archaeology, and the bittersweet beauty of endings.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** Tiny wooden ships against massive planets, lone explorers dwarfed by ruins
*   **Cosmic Beauty:** Supernovas, black holes, quantum phenomena, and celestial mechanics rendered beautifully
*   **Handmade Aesthetic:** Wooden technology, handcrafted instruments, rustic-yet-functional designs
*   **Ancient Mystery:** Alien ruins that feel genuinely ancient and otherworldly, elegant Nomai architecture

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Contemplative, curious, cosmic wonder, lonely beauty, archaeological mystery, bittersweet, awe-inspiring
*   **Feeling:** The simultaneous insignificance and importance of being small in a vast universe. The melancholy of discovering a dead civilization. The beauty of watching a sun die.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Space Scenes:** Deep blacks with vibrant nebulae, star fields, cosmic purples and blues
*   **Timber Hearth:** Warm browns, orange geysers, green trees, cozy campfire glow
*   **Nomai Ruins:** Pale stone whites and beiges, glowing blue-white text, elegant geometry
*   **Dark Bramble:** Sickly greens, deep shadows, bioluminescent seeds, threatening red anglerfish eyes
*   **Supernova:** Brilliant white-gold explosion transitioning through orange-red to blinding light
*   **Quantum:** Shifting translucent overlays, impossible geometry, multiple states visible simultaneously
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a handcrafted wooden spaceship floating near a massive ocean planet. Giant water tornados spiral from the surface into space. The dying sun in the background is swelling into a red giant, casting orange-red light across everything. A small astronaut in a handmade space suit looks out the window. The scene has a watercolor-like quality with cosmic wonder."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Travelers:** Four-eyed amphibious beings with simple, expressive features, wearing handmade space suits
*   **Space Suits:** Stitched fabric with wooden air tanks, brass fixtures, glass helmets, lanterns attached
*   **Personal Items:** Musical instruments (harmonica, flute, drums), roasting sticks, journals
*   **Nomai (Ghosts/Memories):** Tall, three-eyed, graceful beings with flowing robes, seen only as memories or skeletons
*   **Prompt Example:** "A four-eyed amphibious astronaut wearing a handmade orange space suit with a round glass helmet. They carry a wooden air tank and have a scout launcher tool on their hip. Their expression is curious and slightly melancholic. Behind them, ancient white stone Nomai ruins with glowing blue spiral text. Low-poly style with soft shading."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Timber Hearth:** Wooden village with geysers, pine trees, cozy campfire, observatory dome
*   **Giant's Deep:** Endless ocean with islands lifted by water tornados, orbital stations breaking apart
*   **Brittle Hollow:** Hollow planet with hanging gravity city, chunks falling into central black hole
*   **Ash Twin & Ember Twin:** Connected by a pillar of sand flowing between them, ancient towers
*   **Dark Bramble:** Organic seed pod interior with twisted vines, spatial distortion, anglerfish silhouettes
*   **Quantum Moon:** Six versions overlaid, shifting between locations, temple at the north pole
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive hollow planet with its surface crumbling away. An ancient alien city hangs from the ceiling on the inside, lit by glowing lanterns. In the center, a black hole swirls with purple and blue accents, pulling in debris. A tiny wooden spaceship flies through the scene, emphasizing the scale. Rendered in a stylized, painterly style."

**5. Cosmic Phenomena:**
*   **Black Holes:** Purple-blue event horizons with visible time dilation effects
*   **Supernovas:** Expanding shells of brilliant light that consume everything
*   **Quantum Objects:** Multiple overlapping translucent states, flickering between possibilities
*   **Ghost Matter:** Sickly green crystalline formations, deadly and beautiful
*   **Warp Cores:** Swirling contained black holes in brass devices
*   **Prompt Example:** "The moment of supernova—a sun exploding in brilliant white-gold light. Shockwave expanding outward. Wooden spaceships and planets silhouetted against the blinding explosion. The quantum statue in the foreground glows blue, its many eyes watching. A sense of inevitable beauty and doom."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Atmospheric:** Soft, painterly shading with atmospheric perspective in space
*   **Dying Sun:** Orange-red light in early loops, intensifying to white-hot in final moments
*   **Campfire Intimacy:** Warm glow creating safe, contemplative spaces
*   **Quantum Glow:** Soft blue-white illumination from Nomai technology and quantum objects
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the warm glow of a campfire under an alien sky. The dying sun casts long shadows. A traveler plays a harmonica while another roasts a marshmallow. Ancient ruins glow softly with blue text in the background. The mood is contemplative and bittersweet. Low-poly art style with atmospheric lighting."

## Music & Sound

An acoustic, folk-inspired soundtrack featuring banjo, harmonica, flute, and drums that transitions to ambient synths for cosmic scenes. Music represents both the homey warmth of travelers around campfires and the vast loneliness of space. Each traveler has a musical signature. The sound design emphasizes silence in space, the roar of tornadoes, the terrifying breathing of anglerfish, and the peaceful crackling of campfires. Outer Wilds-inspired: intimate instruments against cosmic ambience.

## Voice

A contemplative, curious voice that asks questions more than it declares answers. Sometimes awed whispers ("What is that?"), sometimes scientific observation, sometimes philosophical musing about endings and beginnings. The pacing is patient, never rushed, allowing silence and wonder. At the ending, the voice should be accepting and at peace with letting go. Role: The voice of cosmic curiosity and acceptance of natural endings.
