# Creative Brief: Rapture's Fall

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Art Deco Underwater Dystopia with Body Horror (Bioshock-inspired)

Inspired by the 1960s art deco aesthetics of *Bioshock* with underwater pressure and genetic horror elements. This style captures the beauty of failed utopia, the terror of Splicers, the majesty of Big Daddies, and the contrast between Rapture's elegant design and its horrific fall.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Art Deco:** Geometric patterns, brass and gold accents, 1940s-60s aesthetic, elegant decay
*   **Underwater Atmosphere:** Water leaks, pressure groans, distant whale sounds, claustrophobia
*   **Body Horror:** Genetic mutations visible on Splicers, grotesque ADAM addiction
*   **Philosophical Weight:** Objectivist slogans, Ryan's propaganda, failed ideals visible everywhere

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Underwater dystopia, art deco, body horror, philosophical failure, free will, "Would you kindly," failed utopia, genetic nightmare
*   **Feeling:** The horror of a dream turned nightmare. Beauty corrupted. Free will questioned. Power corrupting absolutely.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary Palette:** Brass golds, art deco greens (oxidized copper), underwater blues, blood reds
*   **Accent Colors:** Neon signs (pink/blue/green), glowing ADAM orange, Plasmid blue
*   **Atmosphere:** Murky underwater greens, yellow lighting, deep shadow pools
*   **Prompt Example:** "...art deco color palette with brass gold fixtures oxidized green, deep underwater blue-green atmosphere, vintage 1960s neon signs in pink and blue, glowing orange ADAM vials, blood red accents. Murky water, volumetric lighting through water. Elegant but decayed."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Splicers:** Once-elegant citizens mutated by ADAM—facial deformities, visible tumors, tattered 1940s fashion
*   **Big Daddies:** Massive brass diving suits with glowing portholes for eyes, drills/rivet guns attached, lumbering
*   **Little Sisters:** Young girls in tattered dresses holding giant ADAM syringes, glowing yellow eyes
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Splicer—once human, now genetically mutated. Face partially dissolved, visible tumors, one arm grotesquely enlarged. Wearing tattered 1940s suit, now blood-stained. Hunched, aggressive posture, wielding a pipe wrench. Glowing veins visible under skin from ADAM addiction. Body horror but still recognizably human. Wet from seawater."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Rapture Architecture:** Art deco underwater city, massive glass tunnels showing ocean, brass and marble halls
*   **Districts:** Medical Pavilion (surgical horror), Fort Frolic (frozen theaters), Neptune's Bounty (frozen seafood)
*   **Decay:** Water leaks, flickering lights, flooded sections, shattered glass, bodies everywhere
*   **Prompt Example:** "An art deco underwater ballroom in Rapture. Geometric patterns on walls, brass fixtures oxidized green, marble columns with gold accents. Massive curved glass windows show the deep ocean and passing fish outside. Elegant 1940s furniture overturned, water pooling on floor. Neon signs flickering. A chandelier hangs broken. Atmospheric underwater lighting with god rays through windows."

**5. Plasmids & Combat:**
*   **Plasmid Effects:** Blue electricity crackling, orange fire from hands, purple telekinesis auras
*   **Big Daddy Combat:** Drill charges, rivet gun salvos, ground pounds, protecting Little Sisters
*   **Environmental:** Explosive barrels, electrical water hazards, security turrets
*   **Prompt Example:** "A party member's hand crackling with blue Electro Bolt Plasmid energy. In the background, a massive Big Daddy (Bouncer model) with brass diving suit and glowing yellow porthole eyes charges with drill spinning. A Little Sister cowers behind him. The Big Daddy's drill throws sparks. Art deco hallway with water-damaged walls and flickering lights. Dynamic combat scene."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Underwater Ambiance:** Green-blue murk, god rays through windows, pressure darkness
*   **Art Deco Lighting:** Warm brass reflections, neon signs, emergency lights
*   **Plasmid Glow:** Character hands glow with active Plasmid color
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by failing art deco lamps casting warm brass light. Blue-green underwater ambiance from windows. Volumetric god rays shine through murky water. Neon signs provide pink and blue accent lighting. Deep shadows pool in corners. Emergency lighting flickers red. High contrast between warm interiors and cold ocean outside."

## Voice

A smooth, mid-Atlantic radio voice with underlying menace. Atlas's friendly Irish accent ("Would you kindly...") contrasts with Fontaine's cruel sociopathy. Andrew Ryan's philosophical speeches are delivered with absolute conviction. The tone shifts between 1940s elegance and visceral horror. Capable of both genteel conversation and genetic nightmare screams. Role: The voice of failed utopia and questioning free will.
