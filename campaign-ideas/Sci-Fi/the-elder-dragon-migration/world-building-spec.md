### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Elder Dragon Migration**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Players are Hunters on the Fifth Fleet expedition to the New World where Elder Dragons migrate. They must track, hunt, and study colossal monsters while uncovering why they all converge here, discovering Xeno'jiiva gestating underground.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Hunter's Guild and its mission to maintain ecological balance through monster management.
    *   Write the history of the previous four fleets sent to the New World and what they discovered.
    *   Describe the Elder Dragon classification and what makes these monsters so dangerous.
    *   Explain the bioenergy cycle—how Elder Dragons come to the New World to die, their energy gestating new life.
    *   Detail Astera's construction and the Fleet's mission parameters.
    *   Write about the Wyverians—long-lived humanoids who serve as researchers and lorekeepers.

    *   **The Elder Dragons** (Major Force of Nature)

        *   **Hierarchy:** No hierarchy; each is a solitary apex predator.
        *   **Public Agenda:** N/A—they're not sentient antagonists.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** N/A—but they're drawn by Xeno'jiiva's bioenergy.
        *   **Assets:** Immense power, ecosystem-altering abilities, regeneration.
        *   **Relationships:** Territorial, some prey on others (Nergigante), most ignore humans.

        *   **Hierarchy:** Loose networks led by profiteers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they operate in secret.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Some seek to capture Elder Dragons alive for private collectors.
        *   **Assets:** Illegal traps, poison, no regard for ecology.

    *   **IF:** The players fail a hunt (cart three times).
    *   **THEN:** The monster remains in ecosystem, continues causing problems. Must re-attempt.
    *   **IF:** The players achieve high research level on a monster.
    *   **THEN:** Weaknesses fully revealed. Optional quests to study behavior unlock.
    *   **IF:** The players craft full armor sets from specific monsters.
    *   **THEN:** Set bonuses activate. NPCs comment on their hunting prowess.
