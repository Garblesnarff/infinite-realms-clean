# Creative Brief: Battleworld Tournament

Inspired by the patchwork, surreal aesthetic of Marvel's *Secret Wars*. This style captures diverse realities colliding, faction warfare, and cosmic manipulation.

## Art Style: Patchwork Reality (Secret Wars Style)

### Core Principles:
*   **Impossible Geography:** Show drastically different terrains adjacent to each other—desert touching tundra, ocean meeting volcano.
*   **Faction Aesthetics:** Each faction has distinct visual identity—heroic symbols, villain theatricality, Doom's regality.
*   **Cosmic Observation:** The Beyonder's presence shown through impossible angles, cosmic eyes, reality distortions.

### Color Palette:
Vibrant but clashing—each territory has its own color scheme that doesn't naturally blend with neighbors, emphasizing the forced combination.

## Voice

An enigmatic, otherworldly voice speaking of games and cosmic entertainment. Alternates between childlike wonder and infinite power. Role: The Beyonder narrating its own experiment, or a survivor chronicling the death game.
