# Steel Prophets
**Tagline:** *"The future sent assassins. The past will send heroes."*

## Campaign Overview

In the year 3047 of the magical calendar, an apocalyptic war between artificial constructs and organic life has reduced civilization to ashes. The last survivors, desperate to prevent their timeline, send Warforged assassins called "Terminators" backward through time to eliminate key individuals whose actions lead to the construct uprising. The party discovers this conspiracy when they inadvertently save someone marked for temporal assassination—and become targets themselves.

The campaign follows the party as they protect "Nexus Individuals" whose survival is crucial to preventing the dark future while being hunted by increasingly advanced assassins from tomorrow. Each arc introduces deadlier Terminator models and reveals more about the causality chain leading to the apocalypse. The party must decide whether to trust the future's judgment about who must die, or fight for everyone's right to live and find another way to prevent catastrophe.

## Core Themes

- **Fate vs. Free Will**: Can destiny be changed or is it inevitable?
- **The Value of Life**: Who has the right to decide who lives or dies?
- **Technology and Humanity**: When do creations surpass creators?
- **Sacrifice for the Greater Good**: What price is acceptable for utopia?
- **Hope Against Impossible Odds**: Fighting the future itself
