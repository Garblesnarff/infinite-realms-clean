# The Macedonian Conquest - World-Building Specification

## World Overview

The campaign takes place in the real historical world of 336-323 BCE, with fantasy elements integrated to create a playable D&D experience. The known world (Oikoumene) consists of the Mediterranean basin, Near East, Central Asia, and northwestern India. Beyond these boundaries lie unknown lands, mythical creatures, and divine mysteries.

Magic exists but is rare and often tied to divine sources, ancient bloodlines, or esoteric mystery cults. The gods are real and occasionally intervene, though their motives are inscrutable. Historical events occur largely as they did in reality, but player choices can alter outcomes, create alternate timelines, or reveal hidden supernatural elements behind famous moments.

## Causality Chains and Historical Turning Points

### Chain 1: The Assassination of Philip II

**Historical Event**
- Philip murdered by Pausanias, bodyguard, at wedding 336 BCE
- Motives unclear: Personal revenge? Political conspiracy?

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Party Prevents**: Philip lives, leads Persian invasion, Alexandros's story never happens (campaign doesn't happen)
- **If Party Investigates**: Uncover conspiracy involving Olympias, Persian gold, Macedonian rivals
- **Consequences**: Determines Alexandros's initial legitimacy, internal enemies

**Causality Branch**
- Assassination succeeds → Alexandros becomes king → Campaign happens
- Pausanias acts alone → Simple revenge → No purges needed
- Wider conspiracy → Alexandros must eliminate rivals → Bloodier start → More opposition later

### Chain 2: The Gordian Knot

**Historical Event**
- Ancient knot, prophecy: whoever unties rules Asia
- Alexandros cuts it with sword (or cleverly unties, sources differ)

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Cut**: Alexandros rejects complexity, takes direct path—soldier not politician
- **If Untied**: Alexandros shows cunning, intelligence—strategist approach
- **If Refused**: Reject prophecy, deny destiny—harder campaign, less divine favor
- **If Failed**: Omen of doom, army morale drops, divine favor questioned

**Causality Branch**
- Cutting → Prophecy fulfilled violently → Encourages hubris → Divine favor but recklessness
- Untying → Prophecy fulfilled cleverly → Balanced approach → Both wisdom and favor
- Refusing → No prophecy boost → Harder but more grounded campaign
- Failing → Bad omen → Morale penalties, divine disfavor, potential defeat

### Chain 3: Treatment of Darius's Family

**Historical Event**
- Capture Darius's mother, wife, daughters at Issus
- Alexandros treats them with perfect courtesy, respect
- Calls Sisygambis "mother"

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Respectful** (Historical): Earns Persian nobility's respect, fusion becomes possible
- **If Harsh**: Persian resistance hardens, no integration, endless insurgency
- **If Ransomed**: Darius might pay, but dishonor prevents cooperation
- **If Murdered**: Darius fights to death, no legitimacy transfer, campaign becomes genocide

**Causality Branch**
- Respectful → Persian integration path unlocked → Cultural fusion possible
- Harsh → Persian hatred → Only rule by fear → Constant rebellions
- Ransom → Tactical benefit, strategic loss → No cultural change
- Murder → Monstrous act → Persian endless revenge → Campaign becomes darker

### Chain 4: The Burning of Persepolis

**Historical Event**
- 330 BCE, Persepolis burned
- Accident, revenge for burning Greek temples, or drunken mistake unclear
- Alexandros reportedly regretted it

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Burned** (Historical): Point of no return, Persians horrified, cultural destruction, regret
- **If Preserved**: Shows respect, easier integration, but Greeks disappointed (wanted revenge)
- **If Looted Only**: Pragmatic, take wealth but preserve culture
- **If Made New Capital**: Ultimate fusion statement

**Causality Branch**
- Burned → Persian integration harder → Greeks satisfied → Regret haunts Alexandros
- Preserved → Persian respect → Greek resentment → Balancing act
- Looted → Pragmatic → No strong feelings either direction
- New Capital → Bold statement → Mixed reactions → Symbolic power

### Chain 5: Proskynesis (Persian Prostration)

**Historical Event**
- Alexandros attempts to introduce Persian court custom of prostration
- Macedonians refuse, see it as worship (appropriate only for gods)
- Creates major cultural rift

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Enforced**: Alienates Macedonians, pleases Persians, accelerates divine pretensions
- **If Abandoned**: Keeps Macedonians happy, Persians see as cultural disrespect
- **If Compromised**: Two systems (Persians prostrate, Macedonians don't), awkward but functional
- **If Explained**: Cultural education reduces tensions

**Causality Branch**
- Enforced → Macedonian resentment → Conspiracies increase → Cultural revolution
- Abandoned → Persian disappointment → Less integration → Macedonian dominance maintained
- Compromised → Awkward but works → Both sides moderately unhappy
- Explained → Understanding → Slow cultural fusion → Best long-term

### Chain 6: The Murder of Kleitos

**Historical Event**
- 328 BCE, drunken argument at banquet
- Kleitos criticizes Alexandros, Persian fusion, divine claims
- Alexandros kills him with spear in rage
- Immediate devastating regret

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Murder Happens** (Historical): Alexandros's guilt, isolation deepens, companions terrified
- **If Prevented**: Party intervenes, saves both, but tension remains
- **If Kleitos Wins Argument**: Alexandros moderates, less hubris, longer life?
- **If Kleitos Dies Otherwise**: Different death, same grief without guilt

**Causality Branch**
- Murder → Guilt destroys Alexandros → Accelerates mental decline → Paranoia increases
- Prevented → Kleitos lives → Voice of opposition remains → Moderating influence
- Kleitos Wins → Alexandros reconsiders → Pulls back from edge → Alt-history
- Other Death → Grief without guilt → Sadness but not self-loathing

### Chain 7: The Mutiny at Hyphasis

**Historical Event**
- 326 BCE, army refuses to march further east
- Veterans exhausted, eight years of campaigning
- Alexandros rages, sulks, yields
- Dream of reaching Ocean dies

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Army Marches On**: Face Nanda Empire (massive), likely defeat, alt-history
- **If Alexandros Accepts** (Historical): Dream dies, begins return, depression sets in
- **If Compromise**: Limited advance, partial satisfaction
- **If Mutiny Crushed**: Execute leaders, force march, army breaks

**Causality Branch**
- March On → Face overwhelming forces → Possible defeat → End of legend
- Accept → Historical path → Depression → Drinking increases → Earlier death?
- Compromise → Some satisfaction → Partial dream achieved
- Crush → Army morale destroyed → Desertions → Campaign collapses

### Chain 8: Hephaistion's Death

**Historical Event**
- 324 BCE, dies of fever (possibly typhoid)
- Alexandros devastated; excessive grief
- Enormous funeral, cities ordered to mourn
- Never recovers emotionally

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Dies** (Historical): Alexandros's sanity cracks, drinking escalates, death follows within year
- **If Saved by Magic**: Alexandros's last anchor survives, possible better ending
- **If Murdered**: Investigation, conspiracy, paranoia explodes
- **If Dies Heroically**: Easier to process than meaningless disease

**Causality Branch**
- Natural Death → Alexandros broken → Accelerates own death
- Saved → Stabilizing influence → Possible moderation → Longer life
- Murdered → Paranoia justified → Purges → Terror
- Heroic Death → Grief with meaning → Easier processing

### Chain 9: The Death of Alexandros

**Historical Event**
- 323 BCE, dies in Babylon age 32
- Fever, possibly malaria, typhoid, or poison
- Theories: Natural disease, assassination, divine punishment
- Dies without clear successor

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Historical Death**: Campaign ends, Wars of Successors begin, empire fragments
- **If Saved**: Alt-history, conquest continues, divine ascension possible?
- **If Assassinated**: Whodunit, investigation, revenge campaign
- **If Becomes God**: Mythic ending, ascends to Olympus

**Causality Branch**
- Historical → Empire fragments → Hellenistic period begins → Player chooses successor
- Saved → Campaign continues → Rome? Carthage? Arabia? India again?
- Assassinated → Hunt conspirators → Political intrigue ending
- Ascends → Divine ending → Becomes constellation, myth, legend

### Chain 10: The Succession

**Historical Event**
- "To the strongest" (ambiguous last words)
- Wars of Successors (Diadochi) for 40+ years
- Empire splits: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Asia, Antigonid Macedon
- Alexandros's family (Roxana, infant son, mother, half-brother) all murdered

**Campaign Implications**
- **If Party Supports Ptolemy**: Egypt path, Alexandria focus, cultural preservation
- **If Party Supports Seleucus**: Asia path, maintain larger empire piece
- **If Party Supports Kassandros**: Macedon path, traditional values, murders Alexandros's family
- **If Party Supports Unity**: Nearly impossible, but trying is quest

**Causality Branch**
- Ptolemy → Egypt thrives → Library, Lighthouse → Cultural legacy maximized
- Seleucus → Largest territory → East-West fusion continues
- Kassandros → Macedonian restoration → Cultural fusion rejected → Shorter dynasty
- Unity → Heroic failure → Everyone fights anyway → But legacy of trying

## Additional Lore and World History

### Pre-Campaign History

**Rise of Macedon**
- Barbaric backwater → Philip II transforms into military power
- Phalanx innovation: 20-foot pikes, deep formation
- Conquest of Greece: Battle of Chaeronea 338 BCE

- Panhellenic revenge motive for campaign
- Greeks see Alexandros as completing ancestral vendetta

**Alexandros's Education**
- Tutored by Aristotle 343-340 BCE
- Learned philosophy, science, medicine, literature
- Aristotle's botanical/zoological interests influence Alexandros's specimen collection
- Tension: Aristotle's rationalism vs. Alexandros's divine ambitions

### The Nature of the Gods

**Greek Pantheon**
- Zeus, Hera, Athena, etc. are real entities
- Not omnipotent, not omnibenevolent—complex personalities
- Intervene rarely, usually through signs/omens
- Jealous of mortal achievement

**Persian Zoroastrianism**
- Ahura Mazda (good) vs. Angra Mainyu (evil)
- Dualistic cosmology
- Fire as sacred element
- Truth-telling central virtue

**Egyptian Deities**
- Very old, very powerful
- Animal aspects represent divine attributes
- Pharaoh is living god (Horus)
- Afterlife extremely important

**Eastern Philosophies**
- Hinduism/Buddhism/Jainism in India
- Different conception: Karma, reincarnation, dharma
- Gods are aspects of cosmic unity
- Challenges Greek polytheism fundamentally

**Divine Mechanics**
- Actual divine intervention rare but possible
- Miracles: Ravens guiding in desert, rain saving army, prophetic accuracy
- Alexandros's success suggests divine favor (or incredible luck)
- Question: Is he god-born, god-favored, or just brilliant and lucky?

### Magic in the World

**Rarity**: Magic is uncommon, mysterious, often divine
**Types**:
- **Prophetic**: Oracles, augury, dream interpretation (most common)
- **Priestly**: Temple magic, blessings, curses
- **Mysteries**: Initiatory magic from secret cults
- **Eastern**: Different systems (Indian mysticism, Persian magi)
- **Scholarly**: Aristotelian natural philosophy borders on magic

**Magical Items**
- Historical artifacts with legendary properties
- Achilles's armor (Alexandros exchanges at Troy)
- Gordian knot (magical binding)
- Sacred weapons, blessed armor
- Ancient relics from conquered lands

**Magical NPCs**
- The Oracle at Siwa
- The Chaldean priests of Babylon
- Egyptian priest-mages
- Indian yogis and gymnosophists
- Persian magi

### Historical Accuracy vs. Playability

**What's Accurate**
- Major battles, dates, outcomes
- Key NPCs existed, general personalities
- Geography, cities, cultures
- Alexander was never defeated in battle
- Died at 32, empire fragmented

**What's Adapted**
- Magic is real (historical world had no confirmed magic)
- Gods directly observable (ancients believed but modern skepticism applies)
- Playable timescale (13 years compressed into 60 sessions)
- Combat is survivable (historical battles had massive casualties)
- Player agency (history is alterable)

**Why Historical**
- Alexandros's actual life is already incredible story
- Real historical events are dramatic enough
- Educational value: Learn actual history while playing
- Resonance: These events shaped world history

**When to Diverge**
- Player choices should matter
- Alternate history is valid outcome
- Magical elements enhance drama
- Don't be slave to history if it ruins fun

### Legacy of the Campaign

**Immediate Impact** (In-game world)
- Largest empire ever created (to that point)
- Greek culture spreads to India
- East-West fusion creates Hellenistic civilization
- Cities founded (70+, many named Alexandria)

**Long-term Impact** (Real history, players learn)
- Hellenistic kingdoms last centuries
- Greek becomes lingua franca of Eastern Mediterranean
- Cultural fusion: Greco-Buddhist art, Septuagint translation, etc.
- Enabled Roman expansion (conquered fragmented Hellenistic kingdoms)
- Shaped course of Western and Eastern civilizations

**Personal Legacy** (Character-focused)
- Alexandros becomes legend: "Alexander the Great"
- Never defeated in battle
- Name synonymous with conquest
- But: Died young, family murdered, empire didn't last
- Question: Was it worth it?

**Campaign Question**
- Is glory worth the cost?
- Can you change history, or does fate determine outcomes?
- Is Alexandros hero, villain, or tragic figure?
- What does it mean to serve a genius who's also a monster?

## DM Notes

This world-building spec provides deep historical detail while maintaining flexibility for player choice. The campaign should feel historically grounded while still being playable and responsive to player decisions.

Key principles:
1. **History as Framework**: Use real events as skeleton, flesh out with player choices
2. **Characters as People**: NPCs are complex, not cartoons—Darius isn't evil, he's unlucky
3. **Moral Complexity**: No clear heroes/villains—conquest is brutal even when brilliant
4. **Cultural Respect**: Persians, Egyptians, Indians are sophisticated, not exotic barbarians
5. **Player Agency**: History can be changed, though some outcomes are difficult to prevent
6. **Tragic Structure**: Even success is tinged with loss—Greek tragedy arc

The campaign explores timeless questions through historical lens: What is greatness? Is conquest justified? Can one person change the world? What is the cost of ambition? These questions resonate across 2,300 years because they're fundamentally human.

Recommended reading for DMs:
- Arrian's *Anabasis Alexandri* (most reliable ancient source)
- Plutarch's *Life of Alexander*
- Robin Lane Fox's *Alexander the Great*
- Mary Renault's historical novels (fictional but deeply researched)

Use this historical framework to create living, breathing world where player choices matter and Alexandros's campaign feels epic, tragic, and ultimately human.
