# The Macedonian Conquest
*Forge an empire that spans the known world, or die trying*

## Campaign Overview

When the young King Alexandros ascends to the throne of Macedon after his father's assassination, the realm teeters on the brink of chaos. Rebellious city-states, vengeful enemies, and doubting generals surround him on all sides. Yet this golden-haired warrior-king harbors a vision that transcends the petty squabbles of Greek politics: to unite the known world under one banner and spread civilization to the farthest reaches of existence.

The party serves as Alexandros's trusted Companions—elite warriors, advisors, and champions who will stand beside their king through impossible battles, treacherous political machinations, and the gradual transformation of a mortal man into something approaching divinity. From the snow-capped mountains of Thrace to the burning deserts of Persia, from the legendary cities of Egypt to the mysterious kingdoms of the Far East, they will conquer, explore, and ultimately face the question: how far is too far?

As the campaign progresses, the line between divine destiny and mortal hubris blurs. Alexandros's genius tactics win impossible victories, but each conquest plants seeds of resentment among his men. Ancient prophecies speak of a conqueror who will unite East and West, but also warn of the price of godhood. The party must balance their loyalty to their king, their own moral compasses, and the weight of empire building on their souls.

## Core Themes

- **Brotherhood and Loyalty**: The bonds of the Companions tested by war, politics, and changing ideals
- **Cultural Fusion**: Blending Hellenic, Persian, Egyptian, and Eastern cultures to create something new
- **The Cost of Conquest**: Exploring the human toll of empire building and endless warfare

## Campaign Notes

This campaign explores the intoxicating allure of conquest and the crushing weight of empire. Alexandros is simultaneously protagonist and antagonist—the party serves him, loves him, but must grapple with the monster his ambition creates.

The historical Alexandros died at 32, having conquered most of the known world. His empire immediately fragmented. He was never defeated in battle. These facts should anchor the campaign but not constrain it—the party's choices can alter history.

Themes of sexuality (Alexandros and Hephaistion's relationship), alcohol abuse, PTSD from constant warfare, and moral injury should be handled with maturity. The campaign asks: What is the cost of greatness? Is immortal fame worth mortal happiness?

The campaign can end at session 60 with Alexandros's historical death, or continue into the Wars of Succession (potentially many more sessions). Party may even attempt to prevent his death through magic, creating alternate history.

Recommended level range: Start at 5th level (already established Companions), reach 20th level by campaign end. Epic levels possible if continuing past death into divine ascension or successor wars.
