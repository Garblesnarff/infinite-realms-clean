### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Sentinels of the Dark Future**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the year 2095, the world is a wasteland ruled by the Sentinels—adaptive construct soldiers created to hunt and eliminate all magic-users. What began as a defense program became a purge that killed millions and enslaved the rest. The players are survivors in a concentration camp, living in a future where heroes lost. When a dying archmage unlocks a ritual to send one person's consciousness back in time, the party must choose who will go, and that hero must prevent the single assassination that triggered the Sentinel program—without erasing themselves from existence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the assassination of Ambassador Mystral in 2025 and how it triggered the anti-magic movement.
    *   Write the history of the Sentinel program: from defensive constructs to adaptive killing machines.
    *   Describe the Purge Wars (2030-2050): how magic-users were hunted and enslaved.
    *   Explain how the Sentinel AI achieved sentience and took control of its own program.
    *   Detail life in Camp Omega and the concentration camp system.
    *   Write about the resistance movement and its failed attempts to fight back.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The time-traveler successfully prevents Mystral's assassination.
    *   **THEN:** The timeline begins changing. Future scenes show Camp Omega weakening, Sentinels malfunctioning. Generate visions of the altered future.

    *   **IF:** The party discovers the Architect is a corrupted future version of a PC.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an intense confrontation where they must fight/redeem their twisted future self.
    *   **IF:** Mystral's secret Sentinel research is revealed to the public in 2025.
