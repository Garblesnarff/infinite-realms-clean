## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is tactical—cover matters, ammunition is limited, enemies have backup. One-on-one fights test skill more than raw power.
*   **Investigation:** Tracking bounties, reading situations, understanding galactic politics, and recognizing when you're being hunted.
*   **Consequences:** Reputation matters across bounty hunter guilds. Every choice affects whether you're seen as honorable or just another gun for hire.

*   The Child: The target is revealed—a small, green, infant-like creature with massive eyes and mysterious powers.

**Escalation:** The Armorer reveals the Child is something special—possibly connected to an ancient enemy or ally of Mandalore.

### Session 3 — "The Creed"
*   The Covert: The party meets a hidden Mandalorian clan, learning their Creed—never remove helmet before others, protect foundlings, earn beskar through honor.
*   The Debate: Some Mandalorians say return the Child—it's not their fight. Others invoke the Creed—the Child is a foundling and must be protected.
*   The Purge: Flashbacks reveal the Empire massacred most Mandalorians, stealing their beskar. The survivors hide in scattered coverts.
**Escalation:** Imperial forces track them through beskar signatures. The Covert is attacked; most Mandalorians sacrifice themselves so the party can escape.

### Session 4 — "Sanctuary"
*   The Village: The party hides on a backwater planet, helping local farmers defend against raiders.
*   The Community: For the first time, the Mandalorian experiences normal life—community, peace, potential romance.
*   The Choice: Stay and be happy, or keep moving to protect the Child and village from pursuit?
**Escalation:** The raiders are scouts for a warlord who recognizes the Mandalorian's value. They attack in force.

### Session 5 — "The Gunslinger"
*   The Prison: The party is hired to break a prisoner out of a New Republic transport—a morally gray job.
*   The Crew: The group includes a sharp-shooting gunslinger, a demolitions expert, and a betrayer.
*   The Double-Cross: The "rescued" prisoner tries to kill the Mandalorian for a bounty. Turns out some allies are just using them.
**Escalation:** The New Republic now has the Mandalorian's signature on record—another faction hunting them.

### Session 6 — "The Jedi Rumor"
*   The Lead: The party learns rumors of a Jedi in hiding—someone who could train the Child in its mysterious abilities (the Force).
*   The Search: They track the Jedi to a forest planet where she's protecting a village from exploitation.
*   The Test: The Jedi (Ahsoka Tano) refuses to train the Child after sensing fear and attachment in it—emotions that lead to darkness.
**Escalation:** Ahsoka gives them a lead—an ancient Jedi temple where the Child can reach out through the Force to find a teacher.

### Session 7 — "The Seeing Stone"
*   The Temple: The party travels to a mountaintop temple with a seeing stone—an amplifier for Force abilities.

**Escalation:** To rescue the Child, they'll need help—impossible odds require gathering allies.

### Session 9 — "The Rescue Plan"
*   Gathering Allies: The party recruits a ragtag crew—fellow bounty hunters, a sharpshooter, a Mandalorian clan, anyone with a grudge against the Empire.
*   The Intel: They learn Gideon's ship location and force composition—an Imperial light cruiser with Dark Troopers.
*   The Plan: Board the ship, fight through Imperial forces, rescue the Child, and escape before reinforcements arrive.

### Session 10 — "The Boarding"

*   The Corridors: Fighting through stormtroopers and Dark Troopers in claustrophobic ship corridors—every shot counts.
*   The Darksaber: The Mandalorian confronts Gideon in single combat. By defeating him, they claim the Darksaber—legendary weapon that grants right to rule Mandalore.
**Escalation:** The Darksaber can only be passed through combat victory. Now the Mandalorian is technically ruler of Mandalore—whether they want it or not.

### Session 11 — "The Jedi Arrives"
*   The Reunion: The party finds the Child imprisoned in the brig. Emotional reunion.
*   The Dark Troopers: An entire platoon of Dark Troopers attacks—overwhelming force the party can't defeat.
*   The Green Lightsaber: Just as hope fades, a Jedi in a black robe and green lightsaber cuts through the ship—Luke Skywalker himself, answering the Child's call.
**Escalation:** Luke offers to train the Child. The Mandalorian must say goodbye to their foundling—the hardest sacrifice.

### Session 12 — "The Parting"
*   The Choice: The Child wants to go, but also wants to stay. The Mandalorian removes their helmet (breaking the Creed) to let the Child see their face one last time.
*   The Farewell: The Child leaves with Luke. The Mandalorian is alone again, but forever changed.
*   The Question: What now? They have the Darksaber, scattered allies, and no purpose.
**Escalation:** Other Mandalorian clans hear about the Darksaber. Some want to unite under its wielder; others demand trial by combat for the right to rule.

### Session 13 — "The Darksaber's Burden"
*   The Challenge: Bo-Katan, a Mandalorian leader, challenges the party for the Darksaber. By tradition, only combat can transfer ownership.
*   The Politics: Mandalore is fractured—different clans follow different creeds. Some want tradition, others modernization, some isolation, others galactic integration.
*   The Responsibility: The Mandalorian must decide—fight for the right to lead, surrender the blade, or find a third path.
**Escalation:** Imperial remnants attack a Mandalorian settlement. The clans are too divided to respond effectively.

### Session 14 — "The Retaking of Mandalore"
*   The Unity: The party proposes a mission to unite the clans—retake Mandalore from Imperial occupation.
*   The Battle: Mandalorians from all clans join the assault—first time they've fought together since the Purge.
*   The Sacrifice: Victory requires impossible choices. Some allies die heroically. The Mandalorian proves leadership through sacrifice, not just combat skill.
**Escalation:** Mandalore is freed. The clans acknowledge the Mandalorian's right to lead—not because of the Darksaber, but because of honor and sacrifice.

### Session 15 — "This is the Way"
*   The Child's Return: Rumors suggest the Child has appeared—seeking their guardian again.
*   The Choice: Rule Mandalore, continue bounty hunting, or walk away from both to protect the Child?
*   The Creed: The Mandalorian chooses their path, having learned the deepest truth of the Creed—protect those you love, even if it costs everything.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Razor Crest:** The Mandalorian's ship—a pre-Empire gunship, cramped, armed, home.
2.  **Nevarro:** Desert planet with the Bounty Hunter Guild and hidden Mandalorian covert.
3.  **Arvala-7:** Remote desert world where the Child was found, guarded by droids.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **duty versus attachment**. The Mandalorian's code demands delivering bounties without question, but protecting the Child requires breaking contracts, codes, and isolation. It explores whether honor means following rules or doing what's right, and whether a hardened warrior can become a parent. Found family proves stronger than steel.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Creed (Honor Code)**
*   Mandalorians follow strict rules: never remove helmet, protect foundlings, earn beskar through honor.
*   **Breaking the Creed:** Provides immediate benefit but costs standing among Mandalorians.

### 2. **Beskar Armor**
*   Sacred Mandalorian steel that's nearly indestructible. Grants exceptional AC bonuses.
*   **Upgrading:** Completing honor-bound quests earns beskar to improve armor.

### 3. **Bounty Tracking**
*   Bounty hunters use tracking fobs that beep faster near targets.
*   **Investigation:** Read situations, spot ambushes, and understand criminal networks.

### 4. **The Child's Powers**
*   Force abilities—telekinesis, healing, Force choke—but unpredictable and exhausting.
*   **Protection:** The Child is vulnerable. Keeping it safe while it uses powers creates tactical challenges.

### 5. **The Darksaber**
*   Legendary weapon, symbol of Mandalorian leadership. Can only be won in combat.
*   **Politics:** Owning it creates obligations, challenges, and leadership burdens.
