### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Conqueror's Heir**

**1. Core Concept**
*   The party consists of young heroes mentored by Titanius, who's secretly an advance agent for the Viltrumite Empire. When they discover his betrayal, they must protect Earth from invasion while grappling with whether they can become strong enough to matter against overwhelming power.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Viltrumite Empire—philosophy of might makes right, systematic conquest of thousands of worlds, warrior culture.
    *   Write Titanius's history—sent to Earth decades ago, grew to love the planet but remained loyal to the Empire.
    *   Describe Earth's superhero community—various heroes with different power levels, the Guardians as Earth's premier team.
    *   Explain Viltrumite physiology—near-invulnerable, super-strong, able to fly, centuries-long lifespan.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **The Viltrumite Empire** (Major): Conquering alien civilization, believes they improve worlds through authoritarian rule.

*   **Viltrumite Warship:** Alien technology and brutal efficiency.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Party keeps collateral damage low.
    *   **THEN:** Public supports them; resources increase; moral high ground maintained.
    *   **IF:** Party battles cause massive civilian casualties.
    *   **THEN:** Public turns against heroes; government oversight increases; guilt affects party.
    *   **IF:** Party kills Titanius.
    *   **THEN:** Empire declares total war; no mercy; but Earth's heroes are free of his influence.
    *   **IF:** Party accepts Viltrumite rule.
    *   **THEN:** Dark ending where Earth is "improved" at cost of freedom; party must justify collaboration.
    *   **IF:** Party finds way to repel invasion without killing Titanius.
    *   **THEN:** Complex resolution; Titanius exiled; Empire withdraws temporarily; Earth on borrowed time.
