# Serenity Rising [CAMPAIGN: Sci-Fi]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In a galaxy where the totalitarian Alliance reigns supreme, having crushed the independent "Browncoats" in a brutal civil war, a ragtag crew aboard a beat-up Firefly-class transport ship, the *Serenity*, struggles to make a living on the fringes of civilized space. They take on smuggling runs, salvage operations, and any job that pays, all while evading the ever-present Alliance patrols and the shadowy operatives who hunt a mysterious passenger. This campaign is about survival, found family, and fighting for freedom in a universe that wants to keep you down, as the crew inadvertently stumbles upon a conspiracy that could shake the very foundations of Alliance power.

## Setting [SETTING: Space Western]
The galaxy is a vast, sprawling expanse, divided into the gleaming, technologically advanced "Core Worlds" controlled by the Alliance, and the dusty, lawless "Border Planets" and "Rim Worlds" where life is cheap and opportunities are scarce. The aesthetic is a blend of advanced spacecraft and frontier towns, high-tech gadgets and old-fashioned six-shooters. The vacuum of space is traversed by FTL drives, but on the ground, life often resembles the American Old West, complete with saloons, dusty plains, and desperate folk trying to carve out an existence.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **Persephone:** [LOCATION: Border Planet] A bustling, semi-civilized border planet with a mix of Alliance presence and independent settlements. Known for its rich agricultural exports and a thriving black market. It's a common stop for supplies and illicit dealings.
*   **Ariel:** [LOCATION: Core World] A pristine, technologically advanced Alliance medical research planet. Beneath its gleaming surface, dark experiments are rumored to take place. Heavily guarded and difficult to access.
*   **Regina:** [LOCATION: Rim World] A desolate, mining planet ravaged by environmental exploitation. Its inhabitants are fiercely independent and deeply resentful of the Alliance, making it a haven for Browncoat sympathizers and outlaws.
*   **The Blue Sun System:** [LOCATION: Corporate Territory] A system dominated by the powerful Blue Sun Corporation, a megacorp with vast influence and a private army. Their planets are industrial hubs, often with harsh working conditions.
*   **The Reaver Territory:** [LOCATION: Dangerous Space] A vast, lawless expanse of space infested by the cannibalistic, insane Reavers. Navigating this territory is a death sentence for most, but it's also a shortcut for those desperate enough to risk it.

## Factions [FACTION: Political]
*   **The Alliance:** [FACTION: Totalitarian Government] The dominant political and military power in the galaxy. They maintain order through strict control, advanced technology, and a pervasive propaganda machine. They are actively hunting Browncoat remnants and anyone who defies their authority.
*   **The Browncoats (Remnants):** [FACTION: Rebel Underground] The defeated forces of the Independent Faction from the Unification War. They are scattered, disillusioned, and often operate in secret, still clinging to ideals of freedom and self-determination.
*   **The Blue Sun Corporation:** [FACTION: Megacorporation] A powerful, influential corporation that often operates outside Alliance law, or bends it to their will. They have vast resources, private security forces, and are involved in everything from terraforming to advanced weaponry.
*   **The Reavers:** [FACTION: Monstrous Threat] A terrifying, feral race of humans driven to madness by an unknown force. They are cannibalistic, sadistic, and a constant threat to anyone traveling through their territory.
*   **The Guild of Smugglers & Scavengers:** [FACTION: Criminal Network] A loose confederation of independent operators, criminals, and honest folk trying to make a living on the fringes. They often work together, sharing information and resources, but are fiercely independent.
