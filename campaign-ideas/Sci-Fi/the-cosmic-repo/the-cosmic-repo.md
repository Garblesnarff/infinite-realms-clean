## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A journey through Los Angeles conspiracy underground toward cosmic revelation.

*   **Act I — Ordinary Generic Life (Sessions 1-7):** The party works as repo men, taking back goods from debtors in a surreal LA where everything is bizarrely generic—food in plain white packaging labeled "FOOD," stores called "DRINKS." When they repo a 1964 Chevy Malibu for a $20,000 bounty, strange things begin: government agents pursue them, the trunk contains dead aliens, radioactive materials glow green, and reality follows the Plate o' Shrimp coincidence theory. A mysterious man named Miller seems to know everything but speaks in cryptic punk wisdom.
*   **Act II — The Lattice of Coincidence (Sessions 8-13):** Following seemingly random connections, the party discovers Los Angeles is a hotspot for alien activity. The car's trunk contains bodies of repo men who tried to complete the delivery before them. They join the punk underground who recognize the conspiracy, evade both government agencies and rival repo men, and learn about the cosmic radiation that powers the car. Each session, coincidences mount impossibly—"the more you drive it, the dumber you get."
*   **Act III — The Big One (Sessions 14-20):** The truth emerges: aliens are using generic products to prepare humanity for assimilation, the car is their beacon, and Los Angeles will be ground zero for an invasion unless the car reaches its destination. But the destination might trigger the invasion or stop it—nobody knows. The party must navigate between government coverup, alien infiltrators, rival repo organizations, and punk revolutionaries to make the final delivery while reality itself becomes increasingly unstable from cosmic radiation.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity vs. conformity (generic products), the nature of coincidence and connection, punk rebellion against cosmic control, and whether ignorance is bliss. It asks: Is reality truly connected or are we seeing patterns in chaos? Can you fight alien assimilation through punk attitude? What's the repo code when reality itself is debt? The central conflict pits the party's desire to complete a simple job against cosmic forces using coincidence and generic conformity to prepare Earth for aliens.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Plate o' Shrimp (Coincidence Theory)**
*   Players can invoke coincidences—think of something, it appears soon
*   The more radiation exposure, the stronger coincidences become
*   Eventually coincidences become impossible (think of person, they call immediately)
*   Overuse causes reality to fracture
*   "You know what I mean? You think of a plate of shrimp, someone says shrimp"

### 2. **Cosmic Radiation Exposure**
*   Exposure to the Malibu's trunk grants visions and perception
*   Can see aliens disguised as humans
*   Generic products reveal hidden purposes
*   Side effects: paranoia, reality distortion, eventual transcendence or madness

### 3. **The Repo Code**
*   Sacred rules repo men live by
*   "Always intense," "Never question the job," "Respect the code"
*   Following the code grants mechanical benefits
*   Breaking the code causes bad luck (radiation-fueled karma)

### 4. **Generic Products**
*   Everything labeled generically is actually alien control node
*   Can hack generic products for information
*   Destroying them alerts aliens
*   The more generic your life, the more controlled you are

### 5. **The Malibu Itself**
*   The car is an NPC with its own agenda
*   Resists going certain places, encourages others
*   Trunk contains cosmic horrors and revelations
*   Eventually revealed as spacecraft

### 6. **Reality Stability**
*   Track reality coherence as campaign progresses
*   Cosmic radiation makes reality more surreal
*   Generic products maintain false stability
*   Final sessions, reality becomes totally fluid

### 7. **Faction Reputation**
*   Repo Underground, Government Agents, Alien Factions, Punk Scene
*   Each faction wants different outcome for the Malibu
*   Can play factions against each other
*   Your choice determines ending
