# Creative Brief: The Ruins of Determination

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Retro Pixel Art with Emotional Depth (Undertale-inspired)

Inspired by the deceptively simple aesthetic of *Undertale*. This style captures nostalgic 8/16-bit graphics that subvert expectations, cute monsters hiding tragedy, simple sprites expressing complex emotions, and the power of minimalism to deliver maximum emotional impact.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Pixel Art Charm:** Low resolution sprites, limited color palette, expressive despite simplicity
*   **Subversion of Expectations:** Cute appearance hiding darkness, comedy adjacent to tragedy
*   **Black Backgrounds:** Encounters happen in black void, UI is functional and visible
*   **Expressive Minimalism:** Few pixels conveying huge emotion through design and animation

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Determination, mercy, pixel art, meta-narrative, subversive, bittersweet, love vs violence
*   **Feeling:** A child alone underground facing monsters—but the monsters are kind. The weight of choices. Bullet patterns like danmaku.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **The Ruins:** Purple stones, warm orange lighting, motherly comfort
*   **Snowdin:** White snow, cool blues, orange scarves and lights, cozy
*   **Waterfall:** Dark blue, glowing cyan echo flowers and crystals
*   **Hotland:** Orange-red lava, yellow industrial lights, neon signs
*   **New Home:** Golden yellow halls, melancholic warmth
*   **Combat:** Black background, white UI, colorful bullets and hearts
*   **Prompt Example:** "...pixel art style, 8-bit aesthetic. A purple stone ruin hallway with orange lighting from flames. A small child sprite in a blue and purple striped shirt. A motherly goat monster in purple robes. Simple but expressive sprites. Limited color palette. Black background around the scene."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **The Fallen Human:** Simple child sprite, blue/purple striped shirt, minimal features, gender ambiguous
*   **Toriel:** Purple robed goat mother, soft appearance, kind eyes
*   **Sans:** Skeleton in blue hoodie, white eyes with black sockets, perpetually grinning
*   **Papyrus:** Taller skeleton in battle body armor, enthusiastic pose
*   **Flowey:** Small flower with face—cute until it reveals teeth and horror
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art character sprites: a short skeleton in a blue hoodie with white glowing eyes, hands in pockets, grin. Beside him, a taller skeleton in white armor with red scarf, animated enthusiastically. 8-bit style, limited color palette, expressive despite simplicity."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Minimalist Design:** Simple repeated tiles, few colors, functional
*   **Atmospheric Details:** Echo flowers, save points (glowing stars), environmental storytelling
*   **Encounter Spaces:** Black void with character sprites and bullet patterns
*   **Overworld:** Top-down RPG style, simple but charming
*   **Prompt Example:** "A pixel art underground cave scene. Dark blue background with glowing cyan crystals. Simple stone path. Echo flowers (blue flowers with notes) scattered. A golden star SAVE point glows. Minimal details but atmospheric. 16-bit style top-down view."

**5. Combat & Bullet Patterns:**
*   **Black Background:** All combat happens in black void
*   **The Heart:** Red heart representing the soul, dodges white bullets
*   **Bullet Patterns:** Bones, spears, fireballs in geometric patterns
*   **Boss Patterns:** Elaborate bullet-hell designs, colorful and rhythmic
*   **Prompt Example:** "Pixel art combat screen: black background. Bottom center shows UI box with FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, MERCY in white. In the center, a red heart sprite dodges white bones moving in patterns. Simple pixel effects for movement. Minimalist but clear."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Minimal Shading:** Flat colors mostly, occasional dithering for depth
*   **Glow Effects:** Simple but effective—SAVE points glow, magic sparkles
*   **Contrast:** High contrast for readability, especially in combat
*   **Prompt Example:** "...pixel art lighting using limited color palette. Orange fire glow on purple stones creates warm tones. No complex shading, just flat colors with occasional dithering. High contrast for clarity. Small glowing yellow star for SAVE point stands out."

## Voice

A gentle, determined voice like a child refusing to give up, but carrying weight beyond their years. The pacing is thoughtful with moments of hope. The tone shifts between innocent optimism, dark revelation, absurdist comedy, and heartbreaking compassion. There's an underlying theme of choosing kindness when violence is easier. Role: The voice of pure determination.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Theme:** Toby Fox-inspired leitmotifs, emotional chiptune, piano for serious moments, synthesizers for environments. Every character has a musical theme.
*   **The Ruins:** "Heartache" motif, warm but melancholy piano and strings
*   **Snowdin:** Light-hearted, xylophone and bells, "Snowy" theme
*   **Waterfall:** Peaceful piano, "Memory" leitmotif, nostalgic
*   **Hotland:** Electronic, industrial sounds, "CORE" theme complex and layered
*   **Battle Theme:** "Enemy Approaching" energetic chiptune
*   **Boss Battles:** Each boss has unique theme—"Bonetrousle," "Spear of Justice," "Death by Glamour," "ASGORE"
*   **Flowey Battle:** Glitchy, disturbing, breaks conventional music structure
*   **Asriel Battle:** "Hopes and Dreams" triumphant yet bittersweet, leading to "SAVE the World"
*   **Megalovania:** Sans's theme, one of most intense tracks, reserved for Genocide Route
*   **Undertale (Main Theme):** Emotional piano, plays during key story moments, brings tears
