## Voice Direction

**Doc Mercy**: Maternal but tough, Brooklyn accent, warm concern

- Return to consciousness: Horror at what was done

### Full-Body Conversion Offer

- Display of perfect chrome body waiting
- Show sacrifice: Current body in pieces

## Environmental Design

**Doc Mercy's Clinic**: Underground, red emergency lighting, surgical tools, cozy despite horror
**ChromaTech Tower**: Brutalist architecture, too clean, corporate dystopia
**Night City Streets**: Vertical slums, holographic ads, perpetual night/rain
**Cyberspace**: Different from other campaigns—more visceral, bio-mechanical aesthetic
**Badlands**: Desert wasteland, freedom from neon prison, harsh beauty

This campaign should feel physically uncomfortable—body horror mixed with seductive power, the slow loss of self, and desperate fight to remain human in increasingly inhuman world.
