# The Underground Stars
## *Where Glowworms Paint Constellations in Stone*

### Campaign Overview

The Waitomo Depths, the world's largest cave system, extends for hundreds of miles beneath the mountain ranges. But these aren't ordinary caves—the ceilings are covered with millions of bioluminescent glowworms creating living constellations that shift and change with mysterious purpose. For generations, the cave-dwelling Lumari people have navigated by these underground stars, believing them to be random natural beauty. They were wrong.

The glowworms are a collective intelligence called the Constellation Mind, and they're not creating random patterns—they're writing star maps. Maps to places that shouldn't exist: other worlds, other planes, paths through space and time. The patterns are navigation charts for something trying to find its way home. Recently, the patterns changed dramatically. The glowworms spelled out a clear message: "They are coming." Now the party must decode the Constellation Mind's warnings and discover what's approaching through the darkness before it arrives.

The campaign becomes a race to understand an alien intelligence that communicates through bioluminescent art, decipher cosmic navigation charts written in living light, and prepare for the arrival of beings from beyond the stars who've been following the glowworms' beacon home for ten thousand years. Success means establishing first contact with extradimensional travelers. Failure means the depths become a beachhead for invasion—or worse, a tomb for lost souls forever seeking a home that no longer exists.

### Core Themes
