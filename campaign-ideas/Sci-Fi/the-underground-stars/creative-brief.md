# Creative Brief: The Underground Stars

## Visual Aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Cave darkness (#0A0A0A), glowworm blue-green (#00FFAA), star-map white (#F0F8FF), dimensional purple (#9B59B6), refuge gold (#FFD700)
- **Visual Style**: Waitomo Glowworm Caves meets cosmic observatory, living constellations shift and change, underground reflecting cosmos above
- **Key Imagery**: Cave ceiling covered in millions of glowing points like stars, patterns forming navigation charts, dimensional tears leaking otherworldly light

## Music and Sound
- **Main Theme**: Quiet, sparse, emphasizing silence and rare sounds (water drips as percussion, cave acoustics)
- **Constellation Mind**: Layered humming (thousands of glowworms), creates harmonics spelling patterns
- **Dimensional Gateway**: Reality tearing sound, cosmic winds, voices from beyond
- **Soundscape**: Cave echoes, underground river, glowworms' collective hum, stone drips marking time

## Voice Acting
- **Starkeeper Lysa**: Wonder-filled, speaks of caves like poetry, soft and reverent
- **Constellation Mind**: Thousand whispers in unison, patient as stone, cosmic perspective
- **First Refugee**: Exhausted relief, alien cadence but understandable emotion, gratitude overwhelming
- **Chancellor Grimstone**: Gruff caution, protecting his people, fear masked as practicality
- **The Pursuer**: No voice—only sound effects, breathing of the void, inevitable approach
