# Whalefall Conspiracy - Creative Brief

## Art Style
Victorian steampunk meets supernatural noir. Heavy shadows, whale oil lamps, industrial Gothic. Dishonored's painted aesthetic—reality slightly stylized, emphasizing mood over realism.

## Color Palettes
**Dunwall Day**: Grey stone (#696969), Whale Oil Amber (#FFBF00), Industrial Iron (#545454), Royal Blue (#002366)
**Plague Zones**: Sickly Green (#9ACD32), Rot Brown (#654321), Rat Black (#0F0F0F), Weeper Red (#8B0000)
**Void Realm**: Absolute Black (#000000), Outsider White (#F0F0F0), Void Blue (#000080)

## Music
**Main Theme**: String quartet with industrial percussion. Victorian elegance corrupted by whale oil machinery. Drunken Whaler-style sea shanties.
**Stealth**: Minimal ambient drones, heartbeat percussion when detected.
**Outsider**: Atonal choir, unsettling harmonies, reality distortion sounds.

## Voice Direction
**The Outsider**: Billy Lush's detached amusement, calm narration of horrors.
**Burrows**: Officious bureaucrat, never admitting wrongdoing.
**Havelock**: Naval authority degrading to paranoid raving.
**Emily**: Child's innocence hardening based on chaos level.
**Samuel**: Working-class dignity, disappointment hitting harder than anger.

## Cinematic Moments
- Empress assassination (slow motion, fatal moment)
- First Blink (reality tearing as teleportation activates)
- Outsider's shrine (void realm pulling party into black ocean)
- Plague ward horrors (weepers and rats overwhelming)
- Havelock's suicide or judgment (lighthouse confrontation)
- Emily's coronation (tone based on chaos level)
- The Heart's revelations (NPCs' darkest secrets exposed)

## Player Experience
Immersive sim where every choice matters. Feel like supernatural assassin or ghost thief. Moral weight to kills—not just mechanical consequence.
