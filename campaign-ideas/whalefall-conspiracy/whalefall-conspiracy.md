# Whalefall Conspiracy
*In a city powered by leviathan blood, everyone drowns in corruption*

## Campaign Overview

The industrial city-state of Dunwall thrives on whale oil extracted from massive leviathans hunted in the surrounding seas. This steampunk empire is built on exploitation—of whales, of the poor, of conquered nations. The party begins as operatives of various factions when the beloved Empress is assassinated and her daughter Emily kidnapped. Framed for the crime or caught in the aftermath, they must navigate a city under plague quarantine, supernatural assassination plots, and political conspiracy while choosing between revenge, justice, or revolution.

Dunwall's unique magic system draws power from The Outsider—a mysterious void god who grants abilities to chosen individuals. The party must decide whether to accept his "gifts" (gaining powers but attracting otherworldly attention) or remain purely mundane. As they uncover the conspiracy behind the Empress's death, they'll discover the rat plague is engineered, the Lord Regent is a tyrant, and the city's industrial foundation is collapsing as whales go extinct. Can they save Dunwall or should they let it burn for its sins?

## Core Themes

- **Chaos vs. Order**: Low-chaos playstyle (stealth, mercy) vs. high-chaos (murder, vengeance)
- **Supernatural Cost**: Powers from eldritch entities always have hidden prices
- **Class Exploitation**: Aristocrats' comfort built on workers' suffering
- **Environmental Collapse**: Whale extinction threatens entire civilization
- **Revenge vs. Justice**: Is punishment enough, or must systems change?

## Unique Mechanics

**Chaos System**
Track party's lethality and detection. High kills + high alerts = high chaos. Affects:
- More plague rats and weepers in city
- Darker dialogue from NPCs
- Harsher ending outcomes
- Emily's personality becomes cynical
- Samuel's final loyalty

**Outsider's Mark (Supernatural Powers)**
**Blink**: Short-range teleportation. Core mobility.
**Dark Vision**: See through walls, detect enemies.
**Possession**: Inhabit animals and people temporarily.
**Bend Time**: Slow or stop time briefly.
**Windblast**: Force push enemies off ledges.
**Devouring Swarm**: Summon plague rats to consume corpses/enemies.
**Shadow Kill**: Bodies disintegrate when killed stealthily.

**Runes and Bone Charms**: Scattered supernatural items. Runes upgrade powers. Bone Charms provide passive bonuses. Rewarding exploration.

**Gadgets (Non-Supernatural Alternative)**
- Spring Razors (traps)
- Arc Mines (electricity)
- Grenades (various types)
- Crossbow (sleep darts, poison, explosive bolts)
- Rewire Tools (hack security)
- Pistol and sword (lethal combat)

**Stealth vs. Combat Balance**
Every mission solvable without kills or detection. Equally solvable with maximum carnage. Rewards adapt to playstyle.

**The Heart**
Magical artifact made from Empress's actual heart. Reveals secrets about NPCs and locations. Provides lore and helps find runes. Increasingly unsettling to use.

## Plot Twists

**The Plague is Engineered**: Burrows weaponized rat plague for population control and emergency powers.

**Loyalists' True Goal**: Havelock, Martin, and Pendleton seek power, not justice. Planned Emily's puppet rule from start.

**Party's Mark**: The Outsider chose party specifically to create "interesting outcome"—caring only for entertainment.

**Granny Rags' Identity**: Former Lady Vera Moray, Outsider-marked aristocrat driven mad. Cautionary tale of power's cost.

**Whale Extinction**: Industrial foundation collapsing. In 20 years, no whales left. Civilization crisis inevitable.

**The Outsider's Origin**: Once human, murdered in ritual, became void god. Can potentially be killed or freed.

**Emily's Father**: Empress's secret lover was Royal Protector (potentially party member's backstory connection).

**Samuel's Judgment**: If high chaos, he shoots party before final mission. Trusted ally becomes enemy through disgust.

## Victory Conditions

**Low Chaos Ending**: Emily crowned wise ruler. Plague cured. Dunwall enters golden age. Party honored. Bittersweet but hopeful.

**Medium Chaos**: Emily rules but scarred. City recovers slowly. Some NPCs dead. Functional but damaged future.

**High Chaos**: Emily becomes tyrant or party rules brutal regime. City in permanent decline. Dark victory.

**Revolution Ending**: Overthrow entire system. Establish democracy or workers' council. Risky but potentially best long-term.

**Void Ending**: Accept Outsider fully. Become supernatural enforcers. Power but loss of humanity.

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Chaos**: Emily killed or corrupted beyond redemption. Dunwall collapses completely into plague wasteland.

**Outsider's Claim**: Party consumed by void powers, become monsters serving eldritch god.

**Whale Extinction**: Take too long, industrial base collapses, mass starvation.

**Betrayal Successful**: Havelock wins, party killed, tyranny continues under new management.
