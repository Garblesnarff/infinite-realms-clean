# World-Building Specification Brief: The Endless Delve

**Core Concept**: Epic mega-dungeon campaign taking characters from level 1 to 20+ through 23+ levels of increasing danger and strangeness. Each level is a mini-campaign with its own theme, creatures, and mysteries.

**Lore Prompts**:
* The Undermaze's origins—began as dwarven mine, built upon by successive civilizations.
* The Twenty-Three Levels—each documented to some degree; what's known and unknown.
* The Delve Guilds—surface organizations supporting expeditions, mapping progress.
* The Bottom—terrible secret about what the Undermaze really is and what dwells below.

**Structure Per Level**:
Each of the 23+ levels includes:
* **Theme**: Architectural style, dominant feature.
* **Inhabitants**: Monsters, NPCs, factions.
* **Hazards**: Environmental dangers, traps, challenges.
* **Mystery Component**: Clue about overall Undermaze purpose.
* **Boss/Challenge**: Major obstacle to descending.
* **Treasure**: Rewards appropriate to level difficulty.
* **Connection**: How it connects to levels above and below.

**Sample Factions (recurring across levels)**:
* **The Delve Guild**: Surface organization funding expeditions.
* **The Architects Cult**: Worshippers of the Undermaze builders.
* **Rival Parties**: Other adventuring groups competing for glory.
* **Level Inhabitants**: Each level has own native factions.
* **The Descended**: Previous adventurers who never returned but still "live" below.

**Key NPCs**:
* **The Delve Master**: Mysterious guide appearing at key moments.
* **Rival Party Leaders**: Competing adventurers, some become allies.
* **The Last Architect**: Ancient being on Level 18, knows the truth.
* **Halaster's Echo**: Mad wizard-clone on Level 15, provides insane insights.
* **The Thing Below**: Final boss/revelation at campaign's end.

**Progressive Difficulty**:
* **Levels 1-5**: CR 1-5 encounters, standard dungeon crawling.
* **Levels 6-10**: CR 6-10, complex puzzles, faction politics.
* **Levels 11-15**: CR 11-15, reality-bending challenges.
* **Levels 16-20**: CR 16-20, legendary threats.
* **Levels 21-23+**: CR 21+, near-impossible challenges, campaign climax.

**Mechanics**:
* **Base Camp System**: Establish safe zones on cleared levels.
* **Supply Lines**: Managing resources from surface to deep levels.
* **The Map**: Literal hex-crawl mapping of three-dimensional space.
* **Death and Recovery**: Bodies remain in Delve; recovery possible but dangerous.
* **Progressive Revelation**: Mystery unfolds through discovered documents, NPCs, and exploration.
* **Multiple Paths**: Can skip levels or explore side areas; not purely linear.

**Causality Chains**:
* IF party rushes too deep too fast THEN face overwhelming challenges; must retreat or die.
* IF party allies with level inhabitants THEN gain safe havens and information.
* IF party destroys all factions THEN face united opposition from survivors.
* IF party discovers the truth about Undermaze THEN must choose to proceed or turn back.
* IF party reaches Level 23 THEN learn whether to descend further or seal entrance forever.

**The Bottom Mystery (Progressive Reveals)**:
* **Level 10**: Undermaze was built deliberately as multi-layered structure.
* **Level 15**: Not just dungeon—it's a seal, prison, or gateway.
* **Level 20**: Something ancient and terrible is at the bottom.
* **Level 23**: The final door—warning says going further ends everything.
* **Beyond 23**: Party's choice—open the last door or not.
