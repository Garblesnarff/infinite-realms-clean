# Creative Brief: The White Wolf's Hunt

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Slavic Dark Fantasy with Naturalistic Grit (Witcher-inspired)

Inspired by the grounded dark fantasy aesthetics of *The Witcher 3* with Eastern European folklore influences. This style captures the moral grayness of monster hunting, the beauty of wild landscapes scarred by war, detailed character designs, and the contrast between civilization and wilderness.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Naturalism:** Grounded, realistic details in armor, weapons, environments—fantasy but believable
*   **Slavic Folklore:** Monster designs from Eastern European myths—leshens, drowners, griffins, wraiths
*   **War-Torn Beauty:** Landscapes are gorgeous but scarred—burned villages, hanged corpses, refugees
*   **Weather & Atmosphere:** Dynamic weather crucial—storms, fog, sunset lighting, rain

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Morally gray, grounded fantasy, Slavic folklore, monster hunting, war-torn, naturalistic, lesser evil, bittersweet
*   **Feeling:** A world of beauty marred by cruelty. Professional monster slayers in a world that fears and needs them. No easy answers.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Natural Palette:** Earth tones, forest greens, muddy browns, steel grays
*   **Accent Colors:** Witcher yellow eyes, silver swords, magical purple Signs, blood reds
*   **Environmental:** Rich natural lighting—golden hour, stormy skies, moonlit nights
*   **Prompt Example:** "...naturalistic color palette with deep forest greens, muddy browns, and overcast gray skies. A Witcher with distinctive yellow cat eyes and silver sword. Purple magical energy (Quen sign) shimmers around them. War banners in red and black. Golden sunset breaking through storm clouds."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Witchers:** Leather and light armor, two swords (steel and silver), yellow cat eyes, scars, weathered
*   **Armor Style:** Functional—chainmail, leather straps, fur mantles, no excessive fantasy
*   **Ciri:** White hair, scar across face, practical combat gear, fierce expression
*   **Monsters:** Grounded in folklore—realistic anatomy with fantastical elements
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Witcher in worn black leather armor with steel studs and fur mantle. Silver wolf medallion on chest. Two swords crossed on back—steel and silver. White hair, yellow cat eyes, facial scars. Holding a hand forward with purple magical shield (Quen) manifesting. Determined, weathered expression. Realistic proportions and details."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Velen:** Swampy lowlands, burned villages, hanging trees with corpses, war refugees, overcast skies
*   **Novigrad:** Medieval city with cramped streets, canals, gothic architecture, market squares, gallows
*   **Skellige:** Rugged islands, Viking longhouses, stormy seas, pine forests, cliffs, snow-capped mountains
*   **Kaer Morhen:** Mountain fortress, crumbling walls, courtyard for training, surrounded by peaks
*   **Prompt Example:** "A war-torn swamp landscape (Velen). Burned wooden houses smolder in the background. A hanging tree with corpses silhouetted against gray storm clouds. Muddy paths, scattered weapons, refugees with carts fleeing. Crows circling overhead. Overcast natural lighting with breaks of sunset orange on the horizon. Highly detailed, naturalistic vegetation."

**5. Monsters & Combat:**
*   **Creature Design:** Based on Slavic folklore—Leshen (forest spirit), Drowners (water ghouls), Griffins, Wraiths
*   **Combat:** Fast, tactical swordplay with Signs (magic) used strategically
*   **Blood & Gore:** Present but not gratuitous—realistic consequences of monster hunting
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Witcher mid-combat with a Leshen—a towering creature made of wood, antlers, and moss. The Leshen summons roots from the ground. The Witcher rolls aside, silver sword gleaming, casting Igni (fire sign) with orange flames. Forest clearing with ancient trees. Dynamic action with motion blur on the sword strike. Realistic anatomy and physics."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Natural Dramatic Lighting:** Sunset/sunrise god rays, storm lighting, torch light in darkness
*   **Weather Integration:** Rain, snow, fog affecting visibility and mood
*   **Sign Glow:** Purple (Quen), orange (Igni), white (Aard), green (Yrden), blue (Axii)
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by late afternoon sun breaking through storm clouds, creating god rays. Volumetric fog in the forest. The Witcher's Quen sign casts purple light on their face. Deep shadows in the underbrush. Wet surfaces reflecting light from recent rain. Naturalistic color grading with slight desaturation except for magical effects."

## Voice

A gravelly, world-weary voice that's seen too much but maintains dry humor and professionalism. Speaks in clipped, practical sentences when tracking monsters, becomes warmer when discussing Ciri or allies. Occasional Slavic accent influences. The tone shifts between cynical monster-hunter professionalism and protective father-figure warmth. Role: The voice of a professional survivor who's learned to care despite trying not to.
