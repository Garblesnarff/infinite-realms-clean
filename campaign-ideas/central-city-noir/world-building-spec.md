### **World-Building Specification Brief: Central City Noir**

**1. Core Concept:**
Masked vigilantes protect Central City—a noir metropolis where corruption runs deep—navigating femme fatales, mob bosses, and moral ambiguity while maintaining connection to honest citizens, proving individual action matters even when the world seems rotten.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Central City's character—art deco architecture, elevated trains, distinct neighborhoods
*   Explain the corruption's roots—how crime embedded itself in government and police
*   Describe the Spirit's origin—Denny Colt's "death" and rebirth as masked hero
*   Write about Wildwood Cemetery and its significance
*   Detail the honest citizens who make city worth saving
*   Explain the noir aesthetic—why it always rains, why shadows matter

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Spirit and Allies** (Major) - Masked heroes, Commissioner Dolan, honest cops
*   **The Octopus Organization** (Major) - Criminal syndicate controlling underworld
*   **Corrupt Officials** (Major) - Police, politicians, judges on criminal payroll
*   **Ordinary Citizens** (Major) - Shopkeepers, workers, families—what heroes protect
*   **Femme Fatales** (Minor) - Morally ambiguous women with own agendas
*   **Independent Criminals** (Minor) - Thieves, killers, not part of Octopus
*   **Reform Movement** (Minor) - Citizens trying to clean up city legally

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** The Spirit, Ellen Dolan, Commissioner Dolan, P'Gell, The Octopus, Silk Satin, Ebony White (respectfully reimagined)
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Corrupt Detective," "Honest Beat Cop," "Femme Fatale," "Mob Enforcer," "Street Informant," "Crime Boss," "Taxi Driver," "Club Singer"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Wildwood Cemetery** - Spirit's hidden base beneath his "grave"
*   **Central City Streets** - Rain-slicked, neon-lit, art deco architecture
*   **The Rooftops** - Vigilante highway above city
*   **City Hall** - Corruption's seat, also reformers' base
*   **The Docks** - Smuggling, warehouse fights, noir atmosphere
*   **The Slums** - Where ordinary people struggle
*   **The Club** - Upscale nightspot, criminals and elite mingle
*   **Police Headquarters** - Mix of honest cops and corrupt

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Spirit's identity exposed THEN Denny Colt's life endangered, allies compromised
*   IF Octopus organization fully exposed THEN chaos as power vacuum creates gang war
*   IF Commissioner compromised THEN lose main law enforcement ally
*   IF Ellen endangered THEN personal stakes conflict with professional duty
*   IF city loses hope THEN citizens stop helping, heroes isolated
*   IF corruption fully defeated THEN new threats emerge—city always needs guardian

**7. MacGuffins & Artifacts:**
*   **The Domino Mask** - Simple but iconic symbol
*   **Wildwood Base** - Hidden headquarters, resources
*   **The City Map** - Detailed knowledge of urban terrain
*   **Street Network** - Informants providing intelligence
*   **Evidence Files** - Proof of corruption if protected
*   **The Blue Suit** - Becomes symbol recognized by citizens

**8. Investigation Types:**
*   Murder mysteries, missing persons, smuggling operations, political corruption, protection rackets, kidnappings, art theft, serial crimes, organized crime infiltration, corporate malfeasance

**9. Respectful Updates:**
*   Ebony White reimagined from racist caricature to fully realized character with agency
*   Femme fatales given complexity beyond "dangerous woman"
*   City's working class portrayed with dignity
*   Minorities as heroes and allies, not just stereotypes
*   Maintain noir aesthetic while updating problematic elements
