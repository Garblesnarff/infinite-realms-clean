## Central Conflict

Hope versus cynicism in urban decay. Central City is corrupt, violent, and seems beyond saving. Yet ordinary citizens—shopkeepers, taxi drivers, beat cops—still try to be decent. Party represents belief that individual action matters, that one person can make difference. Must fight crime without becoming criminals themselves. Navigate moral complexity—some criminals are victims of circumstance, some cops are corrupt, some femme fatales have valid reasons for their actions. The question: can you save a city that might not deserve saving, simply because it needs it?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The City as Character**
*   Central City provides clues, complications, and opportunities. Street knowledge checks reveal secrets. City "rewards" those who protect it.

### 2. **Detective Work**
*   Investigation checks to follow clues, interrogate witnesses, piece together conspiracies. Solving crimes is as important as fighting criminals.

### 3. **Urban Mobility**
*   Use Athletics and Acrobatics to navigate rooftops, fire escapes, subways. The city is playground for those who know it.

### 4. **Femme Fatale Encounters**
*   Social encounters with morally ambiguous women. Charisma and Insight checks to navigate seduction and deception.

### 5. **Reputation with Citizens**
*   Track how ordinary people view the masked heroes. High reputation means civilians provide information and assistance.

### 6. **Noir Narration**
*   Encourage players to provide hard-boiled internal monologue describing their actions.

### 7. **The Mask's Meaning**
*   Simple domino mask or equivalent. About what it represents—dedication to city—not elaborate disguise.

## Tone and Atmosphere

Urban noir meets superhero. Rain falls constantly on Central City's streets. Jazz plays in smoky clubs. Danger lurks in alleyways. Yet there's beauty too—neon reflections in puddles, honest citizens trying their best, moments of genuine connection. Femme fatales are dangerous and alluring. Violence is personal, usually fistfights not gun battles. Moral ambiguity everywhere except in heroes' dedication to the city. Cynical world, idealistic heroes. The city is simultaneously beautiful and terrible—art deco architecture houses corruption. Romance is complicated. Humor is dark and sardonic. Victory is rarely clean.
