# Colossal Regret: Creative Brief

## Art Style: Dual Reality

**Human Scenes:** Realistic, mundane, muted colors, intimate framing, documentary feel

**Manifestation Scenes:** Vibrant, massive scale, kaiju destroying Seoul, news footage aesthetic

**Parallel Editing:** Intercut between small human moment and huge monster action, connection visual

**Kaiju Design:** Each reflects owner's psychology—addict's is gaunt and desperate, abused's is defensive spines, depressive's is slow and massive

## Colors

**Human World:** Washed Out (#B0B0B0), Institutional Green (#6B8E23), Depression Blue (#4682B4), Addiction Yellow (#DAA520)

**Manifestation:** Vivid unnatural colors contrasting mundane life, each kaiju unique palette

**Seoul:** Urban grays suddenly disrupted by impossible colors

## Sound

**Human Scenes:** Quiet, uncomfortable silence, realistic dialogue, ambient noise

**Manifestation:** Sudden volume increase, city destruction, screams, news broadcast overlay

**Transitions:** Audio bridge from human cry to kaiju roar, emotional sound to physical

**Silence:** Used heavily, discomfort in quiet

## Voice Direction

**Party Members:** Natural, hesitant, damaged, growth audible over campaign

**Dr. Martinez:** Professional warmth, non-judgmental, safe voice

**Agent Kowalski:** Cold efficiency, views party as threats not people

**Oscar:** Charming then controlling, gaslighting audible in tone shifts

**Victims:** Grief, rage, humanity facing party with consequences

## Cinematic Moments

**First Recognition:** Party member sees news, realizes timing, horror dawning on face

**Controlled Test:** Deliberate small anger in private room, cut to Seoul, small kaiju appears, confirmation

**Support Group Meeting:** Five broken people realizing they're connected by impossible secret

**Oscar's Reveal:** His kaiju appearing, controlling party member's through intimidation, abuse made literal

**Healing Crescendo:** Therapy breakthrough causes massive manifestation, then peaceful dissolution, growth painful

**Accountability:** Party member facing victim's family, no defense possible, accepting responsibility
