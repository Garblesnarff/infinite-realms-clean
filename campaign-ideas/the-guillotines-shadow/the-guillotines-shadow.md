**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **9**
**Tone (keywords):** revolutionary, paranoid, idealistic, bloody, transformative
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are revolutionaries who helped overthrow a corrupt monarchy in the name of "liberté, égalité, fraternité," only to watch their movement devour itself during the Reign of Terror when yesterday's heroes become today's enemies of the Revolution. As activists, politicians, soldiers, and idealists, they must navigate the impossible contradiction between revolutionary ideals and revolutionary violence, choosing whether to feed the guillotine, become its victims, or somehow stop the terror they helped create. The campaign explores how noble revolutions turn bloody, the horror of purity testing run amok, and whether anything justifies the Terror. This is a story of revolution—where heroes must decide if they're willing to die for their ideals or kill for them.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Storming the Bastille"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Revolutionary Triumph
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players join the people storming the Bastille, the symbolic beginning of the Revolution.
    *   They witness aristocratic excess contrasted with popular suffering that justifies revolt.
    *   The old regime falls and the Declaration of Rights is proclaimed: liberty, equality, fraternity.
**Escalation:** The king is arrested but remains alive—raising the question of what to do with the old regime.

### Sessions 2-3 — "The Republic Rises"
*   **Focus:** Building the New World / First Compromises
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Players help build revolutionary government, write new laws, redistribute aristocratic land.
    *   Factions emerge: moderates wanting constitutional monarchy, radicals demanding complete transformation.
    *   Foreign monarchies declare war to restore the French king—external threat unites Revolution.
**Escalation:** The Revolution faces invasion. Radicals argue that internal enemies make victory impossible—purges begin.

### Sessions 4-5 — "The King's Trial"
*   **Focus:** Justice or Vengeance / Line Crossed
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Louis XVI stands trial for treason against the people. Players must vote: exile, imprisonment, or execution.
    *   The decision divides the Revolution: moderates see execution as tyranny, radicals see it as justice.
    *   The king is guillotined. Europe recoils in horror. The Revolution can never go back.
**Escalation:** With the king dead, radicals purge moderates as counter-revolutionary sympathizers. The Terror officially begins.

### Sessions 6-7 — "The Committee of Public Safety"
*   **Focus:** Organized Terror / Paranoia
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Committee gains emergency powers to root out enemies of the Revolution through revolutionary tribunals.
    *   Players witness show trials where accused are guillotined on suspicion alone—guilt by association.
    *   The Revolutionary Calendar erases Christian time itself—total transformation demanded.
**Escalation:** Accusation becomes power. Anyone can denounce anyone for insufficient revolutionary fervor. Paranoia becomes policy.

### Sessions 8-9 — "Virtue and Terror"
*   **Focus:** Ideological Purity / Accelerating Death
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Robespierre preaches the cult of Virtue—Revolution must purify France through blood.
    *   Mass executions accelerate: aristocrats, clergy, moderates, radicals, anyone accused.
    *   Players or their allies are accused of counter-revolutionary sympathy—requiring defense or flight.
**Escalation:** The guillotine runs daily. Bodies pile up. The Revolution has become the monster it fought.

### Sessions 10-11 — "The Thermidorian Reaction"
*   **Focus:** Stopping the Terror / Revolution Eating Itself
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Even radical revolutionaries realize the Terror must end or it will kill everyone.
    *   Players must choose: support ending the Terror (making them "traitors"), flee, or defend it to the end.
    *   The Thermidorian Reaction arrests Robespierre and the Committee—the Terror turns on its leaders.
**Escalation:** Robespierre is guillotined by the system he created. The Terror ends not from morality but from exhaustion.

### Session 12 — "What We Built"
*   **Focus:** Resolution / Legacy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The Terror is over. Players survey what the Revolution achieved and what it cost.
    *   Some ideals survived: legal equality, end of feudalism, secularism, nationalism.
    *   But thousands died, terror was normalized, and Napoleon waits in the wings to seize power.
**Escalation:** The campaign ends asking: Was it worth it? Can revolution happen without terror? Would they do it again?

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores how revolutionary idealism transforms into revolutionary terror and whether the ends justify the means. The central conflict is the players' realization that their noble revolution has become a killing machine that devours friends and enemies alike. They must navigate impossible choices between ideological purity and human compassion, supporting the Revolution while watching it become monstrous, and deciding whether to stop the Terror or be consumed by it. The campaign asks: Can revolution happen without violence? When does justice become vengeance? Who decides who's a true revolutionary? And what's worth dying—or killing—for? The answer: revolutions are born in hope but sustained by fear, and stopping the terror you helped create may require the same courage as starting the revolution itself.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Revolutionary Virtue Tracker**
*   Measures each PC's perceived loyalty to the Revolution in others' eyes.

### 2. **The Denunciation System**
*   Anyone can denounce anyone to the Committee for counter-revolutionary activity.
*   Denunciations can be sincere, political, or vengeful—tribunal rarely distinguishes.
*   Players may be denounced and must defend themselves or flee.

### 3. **Faction Allegiance**
*   Track whether players support Radicals, Moderates, or Opportunists.
*   The dominant faction controls the guillotine and determines who's an enemy.
*   Factions purge each other as the Revolution accelerates.

### 4. **The Guillotine's Shadow**
*   Track everyone the players save from execution versus those they let die or condemn.
*   Each execution weighs on them morally even if justified ideologically.
*   The final session reveals what kind of revolutionaries they became.

### 5. **Revolutionary Calendar**
*   The campaign uses the Revolutionary Calendar, erasing traditional time.
*   This mechanic reinforces how the Revolution demands total transformation.
*   Special "Festival of Reason" events replace religious holidays with revolutionary celebrations.
