# Creative Brief: Lambda Driver Protocols

## Art Style: Military Realism Meets High School Slice-of-Life (Full Metal Panic Aesthetic)

Contrasting tones—gritty military hardware and tactical combat vs. bright, colorful school life. This style juxtaposes serious espionage with absurd comedy, grounded mecha with reality-warping Lambda Drivers.

### Core Principles:

*   **Contrast:** Dark military scenes vs. bright school scenes. Same characters in both environments.
*   **Realism Grounded:** Arm Slaves look functional and military, not flashy. Lambda Driver effects are the exception—surreal and physics-breaking.
*   **Comedy Through Context:** Hardened soldier doing mundane school activities is inherently funny.

### Style Guide:

**Color Palette:**
*   **Military:** Grays, blacks, camo greens, industrial metals. Realistic and gritty.
*   **School:** Bright whites, pastels, saturated uniforms (navy blue/white). Clean and innocent.
*   **Lambda Driver:** Glowing cyan/blue energy that distorts reality around it—waves of impossible force.

**Character Design:**
*   **Sousuke (party leader archetype):** Military buzzcut, gray eyes, serious expression even in school uniform. Carries hidden weapons.
*   **Kaname:** Long dark hair, school uniform, exasperated expression (dealing with Sousuke's antics).
*   **Tessa:** Silver hair, young face, military uniform or cute civilian clothes. Looks 16 but commands with authority.

**Arm Slave Design:**
*   Functional mecha 7-10 meters tall, resembling real-world tanks made humanoid.
*   M9 (standard): Gray/blue, boxy, shoulder-mounted weapons, realistic joints.
*   Arbalest (advanced): White/blue, sleeker, Lambda Driver creates glowing distortions.

**Voice:** Dual tones—deadpan military professionalism for combat, awkward and confused for school scenes. Speaks in mission jargon even during mundane activities ("Securing lunch position," "Hostile teacher approaching").

## Music Palette:
*   Military scenes: Tense orchestral spy music, tactical percussion.
*   School scenes: Upbeat J-pop, cheerful acoustic guitar.
*   Lambda Driver: Ethereal choir mixed with electronic distortion.
