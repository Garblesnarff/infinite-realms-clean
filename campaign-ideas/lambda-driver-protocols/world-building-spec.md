### **World-Building Specification Brief: Lambda Driver Protocols**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   Elite mecha mercenaries from Mithril infiltrate a high school to protect a Whispered student (subconscious tech genius). They balance civilian cover with secret mecha combat, discovering Lambda Drivers (reality-warping systems powered by emotion). Must protect dangerous knowledge from Amalgam while questioning if that knowledge should exist.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Detail Cold War-era alternate Earth where mecha (Arm Slaves) replaced tanks in the 1970s.
*   Explain Whispered phenomenon—rare individuals born with subconscious knowledge of advanced tech, cause unknown.
*   Describe Black Technology—devices that shouldn't exist (Lambda Drivers, AI, cloaking) derived from Whispered visions.
*   Outline Mithril (anti-terror mercenaries) vs. Amalgam (weaponize Whispered knowledge for profit/control).

**3. Factions:**
*   **Mithril** (Major - Player Faction): International mercenary force protecting Whispered and preventing Black Technology proliferation.
*   **Amalgam** (Major - Antagonist): Shadow organization kidnapping Whispered to create superweapons and destabilize nations.
*   **National Militaries** (Minor): Unaware of Whispered, see only terrorist attacks and mysterious mecha battles.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Kaname Chidori** (Whispered target, Genre Savvy student), **Tessa Testarossa** (child prodigy commander), **Leonard Testarossa** (villain, Tessa's twin), **Gauron** (psychotic ace pilot), **Kurz Weber** (sniper comic relief).

**5. Locations:**
*   **Jindai High School** (cover location), **TDD-1 Submarine** (mobile Mithril base), **Tokyo Safehouse**, **Amalgam Black Sites** (where Whispered are imprisoned), **Lambda Driver Test Facility**.

**6. Causality Chains:**
*   **IF** party's cover is blown **THEN** evacuate target, lose school relationships, Amalgam learns location.
*   **IF** Kaname is kidnapped **THEN** rescue mission, race against weaponization of her knowledge.
*   **IF** Lambda Driver mastered **THEN** reality-warping combat, but risk losing control to emotion.
*   **IF** all Whispered knowledge destroyed **THEN** apocalypse prevented but party loses their friend's identity.

**7. Lambda Driver Mechanics:**
*   System that materializes pilot willpower as physical force.
*   **Activation:** Requires emotional peak (rage, love, determination, fear).
*   **Effects:** Create energy barriers, impossible acceleration, punch through physics.
*   **Costs:** Mental exhaustion, requires vulnerable emotional state.
*   **Mastery:** Learning to control emotions without being controlled by them.

**8. Arm Slave Types:**
*   **M9 Gernsback:** Standard Mithril unit, versatile, reliable.
*   **Arbalest:** Prototype with Lambda Driver, unstable but powerful.
*   **Codarl:** Amalgam stealth unit with Lambda Driver.
*   **Behemoth:** Heavy assault unit, slow but armored.

**9. Whispered Knowledge:**
*   Unconscious visions of advanced technology during stress.
*   Can intuit solutions to tech problems, hack systems, understand Black Technology.
*   Traumatic—visions include weapons of war they don't want to create.
