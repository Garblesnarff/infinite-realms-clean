# The Dalí Dimension

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Surrealist Fantasy / Existential Mystery / Dimensional Horror
- **Estimated Length**: 18-24 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-15
- **Tone**: Dreamlike, Illogical, Disturbing, Philosophical, Absurd

### Core Premise
The Dalí Dimension is a plane of existence where dream logic has replaced physics, causality is a suggestion rather than a law, and the impossible is mundane. Time melts like wax, objects exist in states that defy comprehension, and the very concept of "reality" is negotiable. The players find themselves trapped in this surrealist nightmare after a failed ritual or planar accident. To escape, they must navigate a world where elephants walk on spider legs, clocks drip like honey, and their own bodies may betray the laws of anatomy. The only way home is to find the "Dreamer" - the entity whose subconscious maintains this dimension - and either wake them or become lucid enough to dream their own exit.

### Core Themes
- **Illogical Causality**: Effects precede causes, actions have symbolic rather than practical consequences
- **Fluid Identity**: Self is mutable, memory is unreliable, bodies are suggestions
- **Symbolic Reality**: Objects and creatures represent concepts rather than literal things
- **Perpetual Transformation**: Nothing remains static, change is the only constant
- **The Unconscious Made Manifest**: Desires, fears, and forgotten memories walk as creatures

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Impossible Landscape (Sessions 1-6)**
The party arrives in the Dalí Dimension through a catastrophic magical accident. They find themselves in the Desert of Temporal Ambiguity, where the past, present, and future exist simultaneously. They must learn the new rules of this reality: that belief shapes matter, that metaphors are literal, and that their own thoughts can betray them. They encounter the Melting Watchers - faceless entities that observe and judge - and learn of the Dreamer from the Fractured Oracle, a being split across multiple moments in time.

**Act 2: The Architecture of the Subconscious (Sessions 7-14)**
The party journeys through the major regions of the Dalí Dimension, each representing a different aspect of the surrealist philosophy. They navigate the Elephant Palace (grandeur on impossibly fragile foundations), the Infinite Stairwell of Escher-Dalí (where gravity is directional, not universal), and the Gallery of Living Portraits (where painted figures step from their frames with terrible purpose). They discover that the Dreamer is not one entity, but a collective - the Surrealist Council, five artist-mages who merged their consciousnesses to create this realm as an escape from a dying world.

**Act 3: The Lucid Rebellion (Sessions 15-20)**
The players learn that the Surrealist Council has become trapped in their own creation, unable to distinguish dream from reality. The dimension is beginning to collapse as their unified consciousness fractures. The party must journey to the five Dream-Anchors - locations where each Council member's essence is strongest - and either help them achieve lucidity or mercy-kill their consciousness to stabilize the dimension. Each Dream-Anchor presents a surrealist puzzle that embodies that artist's personal symbolism and traumas.

**Act 4: The Wake or the Sleep (Sessions 21-24)**
The final confrontation occurs in the Burning Giraffe Citadel, where the Council's merged consciousness resides as a godlike entity called "The Persistence of Self." The players must make a choice: wake the Council (destroying the Dalí Dimension and everyone native to it, but allowing escape), help the Council achieve stable lucid dreaming (stabilizing the dimension but remaining trapped), or take the Council's place (becoming the new Dreamers and gaining godlike power over surreality). The final sessions explore the consequences of this choice and the nature of reality itself.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Melting**: The party's arrival. Their first "save vs. surreality" as their bodies attempt to melt like Dalí's famous clocks. Introduction to the core mechanic: Lucidity Points.
- **Session 2: The Desert of Temporal Ambiguity**: Meet their past and future selves simultaneously. Learn that time flows in all directions here.
- **Session 3: The Faceless Court**: Encounter with the Melting Watchers. They judge the party's "realness" and find them wanting.
- **Session 4: The Fractured Oracle**: A being who exists across multiple moments in time simultaneously explains the nature of the Dreamer.
- **Session 5-6: The Drawer People**: A town of beings whose torsos are literal chest-of-drawers. Each drawer contains a memory, secret, or tiny universe. A murder mystery where the victim's drawers were stolen.

- **Session 7-8: The Elephant Palace**: Navigate a palace held up by impossibly thin legs. Physics is inverted - the heavier something is, the more fragile its support. Meet the Elephant-Duchess, whose body is both impossibly heavy and lighter than air.
- **Session 9-10: The Infinite Stairwell**: An Escher-inspired dungeon where gravity changes based on perspective. Combat encounters where "up" and "down" are relative to each combatant.
- **Session 11-12: The Gallery of Living Portraits**: Paintings come to life and trap people in their frames. The party must complete surrealist artworks to progress.
- **Session 13-14: The Metamorphosis Gardens**: A botanical garden where plants transform into animals, animals into objects, objects into concepts. They meet the first Council member's essence: The Gardener of Impossibilities.

- **Session 15-16: Dream-Anchor One - The Burning Giraffe**: A giant giraffe on fire that feels no pain walks eternally toward a horizon it never reaches. The party must understand what it symbolizes (inspiration that destroys) to claim its anchor.
- **Session 17-18: Dream-Anchor Two - The Lobster Telephone**: A communication device that only works if you're willing to accept absurdity. The party must have a conversation with their own deaths.
- **Session 19-20: Dream-Anchors Three, Four, and Five**: The Atomic Eve, The Disintegrating Memory, and The Face of War. Each presents increasingly disturbing surrealist challenges.

- **Session 21-22: The Persistence of Self**: Journey to the merged consciousness. Reality becomes completely fluid. Stats become metaphors.
- **Session 23: The Three Choices**: Wake, Stabilize, or Replace. Each party member must vote. Ties result in paradox.
- **Session 24: Consequences**: The aftermath of their choice. If they escaped, they must convince others their experience was real. If they stayed, they must adapt to being gods of absurdity.

### Major NPCs

**The Fractured Oracle**
- **Role**: Guide / Prophet / Warning
- **Appearance**: A humanoid figure split vertically into five distinct time periods - child, youth, adult, elder, and corpse - all speaking simultaneously
- **Personality**: Speaks in riddles that are literally answers from different time periods. Helpful but incomprehensible without effort.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Is actually one of the party members from a possible future, trying to prevent their own fate

**The Elephant-Duchess**
- **Role**: Regional Authority / Obstacle / Potential Ally
- **Appearance**: A sophisticated noble whose body is an elephant balanced on four spider legs of cracked porcelain. Wears Victorian finery.
- **Personality**: Embodies contradiction - simultaneously fragile and unstoppable, graceful and grotesque, kind and cruel
- **Flaw/Secret**: Knows the dimension is collapsing and is desperately trying to ignore it. Will betray anyone to maintain her denial.

**The Gardener of Impossibilities (Council Member #1)**
- **Role**: First Contact with the Surrealist Council
- **Appearance**: A figure made entirely of butterflies surrounding a human skeleton, tending to plants that are also body parts
- **Personality**: Gentle, nurturing, but utterly alien in thought process. Values transformation above stability.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Has forgotten they were ever human. Believes they have always been this way.

**The Melting Watcher Prime**
- **Role**: Antagonist / Judge / Force of Nature
- **Appearance**: A faceless figure in a business suit whose body constantly melts and reforms. Carries a grandfather clock that ticks backward.
- **Personality**: Cold, bureaucratic, obsessed with defining what is "real" and what is "dream." Sees the party as contaminants.
- **Flaw/Secret**: Is actually a defense mechanism created by the Council's subconscious, trying to prevent anyone from waking them.

**The Persistence of Self (Final Entity)**
- **Role**: Final Encounter / God of the Realm / Victim
- **Appearance**: Five humanoid figures merged at the spine into a wheel-like formation, each representing a different Council member. Their combined shadow is a burning giraffe.
- **Personality**: Confused, powerful, terrified, and trapped. Speaks in five voices that contradict each other. Desperately wants to wake but fears death.
- **Flaw/Secret**: If awakened, the five Council members have been fused so long they cannot survive as separate beings.

### Key Locations

**The Desert of Temporal Ambiguity**
A vast desert where all time exists simultaneously. Shadows fall in multiple directions as suns from different eras shine overhead. Ruins are both ancient and newly built. Travelers meet their own fossils.

**The Elephant Palace**
A magnificent palace of gold and crystal balanced on legs of splintered wood and glass. Inside, gravity inverts randomly. The heavier you are, the more you float. Feathers fall like anvils.

**The Infinite Stairwell of Escher-Dalí**
An impossible architecture dungeon where staircases connect in paradoxical ways. Gravity is relative to perspective. Enemies can attack from their "up" while you're on your "down."

**The Gallery of Living Portraits**
A museum where every painting is a portal and a prison. Portraits trap viewers and force them to pose. Landscapes swallow travelers. Abstract art causes existential damage.

**The Metamorphosis Gardens**
Botanical gardens where the concept of "species" is fluid. A rosebush transforms into a flock of butterflies. Butterflies crystallize into hourglasses. Hourglasses sprout roots and bloom.

**The Burning Giraffe Citadel**
The central fortress and final dungeon. A massive burning giraffe serves as the entrance. Inside, reality is completely negotiable. The architecture changes based on observer belief. The Persistence of Self resides at its heart.

**The Drawer Districts**
Towns where citizens have chest-of-drawers for torsos. Each drawer contains a physical manifestation of a memory, secret, or parallel life. Theft is removing someone's drawer. Murder is emptying all of them.

**The Lobster Telephone Exchange**
A communication hub built from giant crustacean-phone hybrids. To use the phones, you must be willing to accept something absurd as true. Lies become reality here.

### Central Conflict
The party is trapped in a dimension where the laws of reality have been replaced by dream logic. To escape, they must either wake the entities maintaining the dimension (killing all native life), stabilize the dream (remaining trapped forever), or become the new dreamers (gaining power but losing humanity). It's a conflict between freedom and responsibility, reality and imagination, self and other.

### Unique Mechanics

**Lucidity Points (LP)**
Every character has a Lucidity score (starts at 10, max 20, min 0). This represents their grip on reality and sense of self.

- **Spending LP**: Players can spend LP to "reject" the surreal reality. 1 LP = auto-succeed on one "reality check" save, or treat one impossible thing as merely difficult (turn a DC 30 into DC 15).
- **Gaining LP**: Granted by the DM when players successfully navigate surrealist logic, embrace the absurd, or solve symbolic puzzles.
- **Losing LP**: Failed reality checks, exposure to extreme surrealism, or using abilities that accept the dream logic.
- **At 0 LP**: Character becomes a native of the Dalí Dimension. They gain immunity to reality checks but lose ability to leave. May need to be "rescued" by party.
- **At 20 LP**: Character becomes hyper-lucid. Can temporarily reshape small aspects of reality (like Dream-Logic Manipulation but stronger).

**Reality Checks**
When confronted with impossible surrealism, players make Wisdom saving throws.
- **Success**: They adapt without losing sense of self
- **Failure**: Lose 1 LP and suffer a surreal consequence (body part melts, memories scramble, they speak in visual metaphors for 1 minute)

**Symbolic Resonance**
Objects and creatures in the Dalí Dimension represent concepts. A sword isn't just a weapon - it might represent "conflict" or "decisiveness" or "severance." Players who understand the symbolism can use it to their advantage.
- Example: A literal "key" might open locks, but understanding it represents "solution" means it can solve any problem symbolically.

**Perspective Physics**
In locations like the Infinite Stairwell, each creature chooses which direction is "down" for them. This affects:
- Movement (you walk on your floor, even if it's someone else's wall)
- Fall damage (you fall toward your "down")
- Combat (attacking someone on a different gravity axis requires mental adjustment)

**Metamorphosis Instability**
Living things in this dimension naturally transform. Once per long rest, the DM can trigger a random metamorphosis:
- Roll on Surrealist Transformation Table (e.g., "your hands become hourglasses for 1 hour," "you speak in colors instead of words," "your shadow gains independent movement")
- High Lucidity can resist, low Lucidity makes it permanent

**Dream-Logic Puzzles**
Traditional D&D logic doesn't work. Examples:
- A locked door that opens when you walk away from it (it's shy)
- A chasm crossed by increasing its size until it loops back around
- A guardian defeated by proving it doesn't exist through paradox

**The Unmoored Mind**
At the start of each session in the Dalí Dimension, each player draws a card from the "Surrealist Condition Deck":
- Positive: "Your tears heal wounds," "You can taste colors," "Your dreams are prophetic"
- Negative: "Your reflection acts independently," "You cast a shadow in the wrong direction," "You remember things that haven't happened yet"
- These persist until the next session or until resolved through roleplay

### Plot Twists and Complications

1. **The Party Created This**: One party member might be a descendant of the Surrealist Council, and their subconscious has been influencing the dimension. They're partially the Dreamer.

2. **The Material Plane Is Also A Dream**: Evidence suggests that the "real world" they came from operates on equally arbitrary rules - just different ones. There may be no escape because there's nowhere to escape to.

3. **Time Simultanaeity**: The party has already completed this adventure, is currently completing it, and hasn't started it yet. All at once. They keep finding their own corpses/future selves/past notes.

4. **The Melting Watchers Are Right**: Maybe the party really are contaminants. Maybe bringing "normal" logic to this dimension is killing it, not saving it.

5. **Becoming What You Fight**: Each time they defeat a surrealist entity, they gain one of its traits permanently. Are they still themselves?

6. **The Council Wants To Stay**: When finally contacted, the Surrealist Council may refuse to wake up. Their real bodies are dying/dead. This is their immortality.

7. **The Real Enemy Is Sanity**: An external force (Modron? Law god?) is trying to "correct" the Dalí Dimension by imposing normal physics. The party must choose between embracing chaos and enforcing order.

8. **Nested Dreams**: The Dalí Dimension is itself inside another surreal dimension, which is inside another. It's dreams all the way down.

9. **The Face In The Party**: One PC is a split personality of one of the Council members, implanted in the party before they arrived. They've been sabotaging/helping all along.

10. **The Price of Lucidity**: Achieving 20 Lucidity doesn't mean escape - it means realizing you were always from the Dalí Dimension and the "normal world" memories are the dream.

### Victory Conditions

**Escape Victory**: Wake the Surrealist Council, collapse the dimension, escape to the Material Plane. Native NPCs die. Moral weight. Survivors carry surreal contamination - minor permanent surrealist traits.

**Stabilization Victory**: Help the Council achieve lucid dreaming, stabilizing the dimension. Party remains trapped but can create a safe zone with normal physics. Become rulers/protectors of the Dalí Dimension.

**Ascension Victory**: Absorb the Council's power and become the new Dreamers. Gain reality-warping abilities but lose connection to Material Plane. Become NPCs in their own right, new gods of surrealism.

**Hidden Victory**: Discover that the Material Plane is the dream and the Dalí Dimension is reality. Choose to stay "awake" in surrealism. Become prophets who see truth beneath false order.

### Defeat Conditions

**Loss of Self**: All party members reach 0 Lucidity. They become natives, forgetting they were ever trying to escape. The campaign ends with them as NPCs in an eternal surreal dream.

**Reality Collapse**: The dimension becomes unstable beyond repair. Everything dissolves into pure chaos. Total party kill as matter, energy, and consciousness unmake.

**Watcher Judgment**: The Melting Watchers declare the party too "real" and expel them violently through dimensional barriers. They arrive home but fragmented across time and space, each PC in a different century.

**Eternal Loop**: The party succeeds in escaping but immediately finds themselves back at Session 1. They're trapped in a time loop, living this adventure forever. (DM note: Should only happen if clearly telegraphed as possibility)

**The Consumption**: The Persistence of Self, in its confusion, absorbs the party into its merged consciousness. They become Council Member #6-10, trapped forever in the wheel of selves.
