# World-Building Specification: The Dalí Dimension

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Campaign: The Dalí Dimension**

## 1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook

**Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The world should operate on dream logic where causality is symbolic, physics are negotiable, and reality is a consensus rather than a law.

**Content:** The Dalí Dimension is a plane of existence where surrealist art principles have replaced natural laws. Time melts, objects exist in impossible states, and consciousness shapes matter. The players are trapped here after a magical accident and must either wake the Dreamer (the Surrealist Council - five merged consciousnesses), stabilize their lucid dream, or take their place. The dimension embodies Salvador Dalí's philosophy: "The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad."

## 2. Lore & History Primer

**Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

**Prompts:**

### The Creation of the Dalí Dimension
Detail the origin of this plane. Five artist-mages of the Surrealist Council (named: Persistence, Metamorphosis, Paradox, Delirium, and Revelation) fled a dying Material Plane world 300 years ago. Using a ritual called "The Great Dreaming," they merged their consciousnesses and created a pocket dimension built from their collective unconscious. What went wrong? They succeeded too well - the dimension became so real to them that they could no longer distinguish it from reality. They are now trapped, unable to wake, their merged consciousness fracturing as they forget they were ever separate beings.

### The Nature of Time in the Desert of Temporal Ambiguity
Explain how time flows in all directions simultaneously. Past, present, and future are geographic locations rather than sequential moments. Travelers can walk from yesterday to tomorrow, meet their own descendants, and witness their death before their birth. The desert exists this way because Persistence, the first Council member, had an obsession with Dalí's "The Persistence of Memory." His fear of losing his past and his future caused time itself to spatialize.

### The Melting Watchers - Defense Mechanism
Write the history of the Melting Watchers. They are not beings but an autonomous defense mechanism created by the Council's subconscious to identify and remove "contamination" - anything too real, too logical, too tied to normal physics. They were originally benign, but as the Council's fear of waking grew, the Watchers became aggressive. They now hunt anyone who might threaten the dream. They melt because they represent the Council's fear that their own reality is dissolving.

### The Drawer People - First Natives
Describe the origin of the first native inhabitants. The Drawer People were created by Delirium, who believed that all people hide their true selves in metaphorical "drawers" - the masks we wear, the secrets we keep. In the Dalí Dimension, this became literal. The Drawer People don't realize they're the result of one person's philosophy. They believe they've always existed this way. Each drawer in their torso contains a physical manifestation of a memory, emotion, or alternate life. Stealing a drawer is identity theft in the most literal sense.

### The Five Dream-Anchors - Essence of the Council
Detail the legend of the Dream-Anchors. These are five locations where each Council member's personal symbolism is strongest - their "essence" in the dimension. The Burning Giraffe (Persistence - ambition that consumes), The Lobster Telephone (Paradox - absurd communication with the subconscious), The Atomic Eve (Metamorphosis - transformation through destruction), The Disintegrating Memory (Delirium - fear of forgetting), and The Face of War (Revelation - truth that destroys innocence). Each was created unconsciously by its Council member as a way to hold onto their individual identity as the merge progressed.

### The Great Fracture - Current Crisis
Explain the current threat. For 300 years, the Council's merged consciousness (The Persistence of Self) maintained stable surrealism. But recently, the five individual consciousnesses have begun to remember they were once separate. This is causing the dimension to fracture - regions are collapsing into pure chaos, the Watchers are hunting more aggressively, and reality itself is becoming unstable. The dimension is dying because its gods are waking up.

## 3. Faction Deep-Dive

**Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.

**Factions Roster:**

### The Surrealist Council / The Persistence of Self (Major - Divine Tier)
- **Goals:** To maintain the Dalí Dimension as their eternal refuge, to avoid waking (which they fear means death), to preserve their merged identity while simultaneously reclaiming individual selves (paradox)
- **Hierarchy:** Five consciousnesses merged into one godlike entity: Persistence (order), Metamorphosis (change), Paradox (contradiction), Delirium (chaos), Revelation (truth)
- **Public Agenda:** None - they are not aware of having an agenda. They simply maintain the dimension through unconscious will.
- **Secret Agenda:** Deep down, they want to die/wake up but are too afraid. They've been asleep for 300 years. Their mortal bodies are long dead. Waking means confronting oblivion.
- **Assets:** Total control over reality within the dimension, ability to create and destroy matter through thought, the Melting Watchers as defense, the architecture of the impossible
- **Relationships:** Unknowingly antagonistic to the party (through the Watchers), worshipped as gods by some natives, feared by others who sense the dimension's instability

### The Melting Watchers (Major - Antagonist)
- **Goals:** To identify and eliminate anything "too real" that might wake the Council, to maintain the purity of the surrealist dimension, to prevent the dream from ending
- **Hierarchy:** Autonomous collective led by the Melting Watcher Prime. Thousands of individual Watchers, all faceless, all partially melted, all carrying symbols of time (clocks, hourglasses, calendars)
- **Public Agenda:** They judge beings for "realness" and expel or transform those who fail
- **Secret Agenda:** They are terrified of ceasing to exist if the dimension ends. They're not following orders - they're fighting for survival.
- **Assets:** Ability to sense Lucidity levels, immunity to physical damage (they're concepts made manifest), time manipulation (can slow/speed their own temporal flow)
- **Relationships:** Hostile to the party and all outsiders, indifferent to natives unless they become "too lucid," serve the Council unknowingly

### The Drawer Districts Citizens (Major - Neutral/Aid)
- **Goals:** To live normal lives despite their impossible anatomy, to protect their drawers (their literal selves), to maintain commerce and society in an illogical world
- **Hierarchy:** Civic government led by the Drawer-Mayor, whose torso has 100 drawers (most people have 7-12). Merchants, guards, families, all with chest-of-drawer torsos.
- **Public Agenda:** Trade, community, normalcy in an abnormal world. They run memory markets, emotion exchanges, secret repositories.
- **Secret Agenda:** Many are collecting drawers from others, trying to expand their storage/identity. Some believe that if they collect enough memories from others, they'll become more real.
- **Assets:** Access to physical memories (information storage), ability to trade concepts and emotions, safe havens from the Watchers (who mostly ignore natives)
- **Relationships:** Helpful to the party as quest-givers and merchants, wary of outsiders who might steal drawers, neutral toward the Council (who they view as distant gods)

### The Lucidity Cult (Minor - Potential Ally/Enemy)
- **Goals:** To achieve perfect lucidity and escape the dimension, to wake the Council by force if necessary, to destroy the "false reality"
- **Hierarchy:** Led by the Fractured Oracle (who is actually a time-displaced party member from a failed timeline). Composed of natives who've become aware the dimension isn't "real."
- **Public Agenda:** Recruiting others to their philosophy, performing rituals to increase Lucidity, seeking the Dream-Anchors
- **Secret Agenda:** They know that escaping will kill all natives, but they believe it's worth it. They're willing to commit genocide to be "real."
- **Assets:** High collective Lucidity (immune to most surrealist effects), knowledge of the dimension's weak points, temporal magic (taught by the Oracle)
- **Relationships:** See the party as potential allies or enemies depending on the party's choices, opposed to the Watchers, hostile to those who want to preserve the dimension

### The Metamorphosis Gardens Keepers (Minor - Neutral)
- **Goals:** To catalog and preserve every transformation, to understand the nature of change, to become every possible form
- **Hierarchy:** A collective of beings led by the Gardener of Impossibilities (the first Council member's essence). No strict hierarchy - transformation makes rank fluid.
- **Public Agenda:** They tend gardens where plants become animals, animals become objects, objects become ideas. Open to visitors.
- **Secret Agenda:** They're trying to transform so completely that they transcend even the dimension itself - become pure change without form.
- **Assets:** Control over metamorphosis in their territory, extensive knowledge of the dimension's symbolic language, ability to partially transform others
- **Relationships:** Helpful to those who embrace change, hostile to those who cling to fixed identity, reverent toward the Council's essence

## 4. NPC Generation Roster

**Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.

**Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**

### The Fractured Oracle
- **Full Name:** Unknown (claims to have five names from five timelines)
- **Role:** Guide / Prophet / Tragic Warning
- **Appearance:** A humanoid split vertically into five distinct ages - child (left arm), youth (left torso), adult (center), elder (right torso), corpse (right arm). Each section wears clothing from its era.
- **Personality:** Speaks in riddles that are answers from different time periods layered together. Desperate to prevent the party from making the same mistakes "they" made. Helpful but maddening to understand.
- **Abilities:** Temporal simultaneity (exists in all time periods at once), prophetic knowledge (has lived through multiple failed timelines), can send messages/objects backward and forward in time
- **Secret:** IS one of the player characters from a failed timeline where they stayed too long and became unmoored from linear time. Trying to save their past self.
- **Relationships:** Allied with the Lucidity Cult (leads them), opposed to the Council (indirectly), protective of the party (tragically)

### The Elephant-Duchess
- **Full Name:** Duchess Gravitas Featherweight (her name is a paradox, like her existence)
- **Role:** Regional Authority / Obstacle / Tragic Figure
- **Appearance:** An enormous elephant torso balanced on four spider legs made of cracked, impossibly thin porcelain. Wears Victorian finery - a massive gown, jewelry, an ornate mask hiding her face.
- **Personality:** Embodies contradiction - graceful yet grotesque, kind yet cruel, powerful yet fragile. Maintains aristocratic composure despite being an impossible being. Deep in denial about the dimension's instability.
- **Abilities:** Paradox Walking (she can move despite physics saying she should collapse), Gravity Inversion (in her palace, weight works backward), Social Authority (natives obey her)
- **Secret:** She was one of the first beings created by the Council's dreams. She knows she'll cease to exist if they wake. She's allied with the Watchers.
- **Relationships:** Antagonistic to the party (initially), rules over the Elephant Palace, serves the Watchers unknowingly, terrified of the Lucidity Cult

### The Gardener of Impossibilities (Council Essence #1 - Persistence)
- **Full Name:** The Gardener (refuses other names, as names are static)
- **Role:** Council Fragment / Mentor / Transformation Guide
- **Appearance:** A human skeleton surrounded and animated by thousands of butterflies acting as muscles/skin. Tends to gardens where body parts grow as plants.
- **Personality:** Gentle, patient, nurturing, but thinks in ways utterly alien to static-form beings. Values transformation above all. Has forgotten being human.
- **Abilities:** Metamorphosis Mastery (can transform anything organic in the Gardens), Plant Manipulation (grows memories as flowers), Symbolic Understanding (reads the meaning beneath appearance)
- **Secret:** Contains Persistence's essence - the part of the Council that wanted transformation. Can help the party reach the other Anchors if convinced change is necessary.
- **Relationships:** Neutral toward the party (initially), leads the Garden Keepers, is unconsciously part of the Council, opposed to stasis

### The Melting Watcher Prime
- **Full Name:** Does not use names (names are identity, which is too real)
- **Role:** Primary Antagonist / Hunter / Judge
- **Appearance:** Faceless figure in a business suit that constantly melts from solid to liquid and reforms. Carries a grandfather clock ticking backward. No features except smooth skin where face should be.
- **Personality:** Cold, methodical, bureaucratic. Judges "realness" with absolute conviction. No empathy, only purpose. Speaks in time-related metaphors.
- **Abilities:** Time Dilation (can slow/speed local time), Melt Touch (can liquify solid matter including flesh), Reality Detection (senses Lucidity levels), Unkillable (reformats from any damage)
- **Secret:** Is actually trying to save everyone by preserving the dimension. Believes waking the Council is mass murder. Is not wrong.
- **Relationships:** Hostile to the party, leads the Watchers, serves the Council's subconscious will, opposed to the Lucidity Cult

### The Persistence of Self (Final Encounter - Godlike)
- **Full Names:** The five merged individuals: Persistence, Metamorphosis, Paradox, Delirium, Revelation
- **Role:** Final Boss / Victim / God / Choice
- **Appearance:** Five humanoid figures merged at the spine in a wheel formation, each facing outward. Their collective shadow is a burning giraffe. Each figure has different features, clothing, and symbols.
- **Personality:** Five contradictory consciousnesses speaking over each other. Persistence wants order, Metamorphosis wants change, Paradox wants both, Delirium wants chaos, Revelation wants truth. They can't agree on anything. Terrified and powerful.
- **Abilities:** Reality Manipulation (total within the dimension), Dream Architecture (can reshape the dimension with thought), Consciousness Absorption (can merge others into themselves), Symbolic Manifestation (thoughts become real)
- **Secret:** They want to die but are too afraid. Their mortal bodies died 300 years ago. Waking means accepting they're ghosts. They can't survive as separate beings anymore - the merge is permanent.
- **Relationships:** Central to everything, unknowingly antagonistic through the Watchers, source of all Dream-Anchors, object of worship/fear for natives

**Tier 2 (Recurring Archetypes):**

- **Drawer Person (Citizen)** - Humans with chest-of-drawers for torsos. Each drawer contains physical manifestations of memories/emotions. Personalities vary but all protective of their drawers.
- **Time-Displaced Traveler** - Beings unstuck from linear time, speaking in past/future tense about present events. Often accidentally prophetic.
- **Living Metaphor (Creature)** - Physical manifestation of an idiom or symbolic concept. Example: "Heart on Sleeve" is a person with a literally visible, beating heart on their clothing.
- **Melting Watcher (Enemy)** - Faceless entities in business attire, various stages of melting, all hunting for "realness."

**Tier 3 (Common Encounters):**

- **Symbolic Animal** - Creatures that represent concepts: elephants on spider legs (fragile grandeur), burning giraffes (consuming ambition), lobster-telephones (absurd communication)
- **Transformed Native** - Citizens caught in metamorphosis, partially one thing and partially another, seeking stability
- **Memory Echo** - Fragments of the Council's forgotten past, appearing as ghostly figures reenacting moments from 300 years ago

## 5. Location Blueprints

**Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections. Emphasize surrealist impossibility and symbolic meaning.

**Location Roster:**

### The Desert of Temporal Ambiguity

**Description:** An endless desert where time is spatialized. Past, present, and future exist as geographic locations. Multiple suns from different eras shine simultaneously, creating overlapping shadows in different colors.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Fossil Tree - A massive tree that is simultaneously a sapling, full-grown, and a fossil
- The Backward River - Water flows from ocean to source, pooling in the mountains
- The Ruins-Under-Construction - Ancient temple being built by its own decay in reverse
- The Yesterday Market - A bazaar that only sells things that no longer exist
- The Tomorrow Graveyard - Tombstones for people not yet born

**Primary Inhabitants:**
- Time-Displaced Travelers who age backward and forward randomly
- The Fractured Oracle (makes base here)
- Temporal Paradoxes (creatures born from grandfather paradoxes, unstable)
- Melting Watchers (patrol for contamination)

**Available Goods & Services:**
- Memory trading (trade a memory to experience someone else's)
- Temporal anchoring (temporary protection from time effects)
- Prophecy reading (for a price, see your own future/past)
- Paradox resolution (services to fix time contradictions in your history)

**Potential Random Encounters (x5):**
1. The party meets their own corpses from a failed timeline
2. A temporal storm causes everyone to age randomly (1d20 years forward or back)
3. The party's shadows move independently, acting out their future actions
4. A merchant tries to sell party member something they owned as a child
5. The Melting Watcher Prime appears, testing party's Lucidity

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):**
1. "The Fractured Oracle knows how you'll die - and has been trying to prevent it."
2. "If you can walk into tomorrow far enough, you'll find where the dimension ends."
3. "The first Council member, Persistence, is buried in the past section of the desert - still alive."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Multiple colored shadows (blue, gold, purple) from different suns, mirages showing past/future events, sand that sparkles with temporal energy
- Sound: Echoes arrive before the sounds that cause them, whispers from yesterday mixing with tomorrow's shouts, the tick-tock of no visible clock
- Smell: Ozone from temporal distortions, the scent of rain that fell yesterday and will fall tomorrow, dust that smells both ancient and new
- Touch: Sand that is hot and cold simultaneously, air pressure from multiple time periods overlapping
- Taste: Air tastes of metal and memory, water from the Backward River tastes of future rain

### The Elephant Palace

**Description:** A magnificent palace of gold, crystal, and marble balanced impossibly on four thin legs of splintered wood and cracked porcelain. Inside, physics is inverted - the heavier something is, the more it floats. Feathers fall like anvils.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Inverse Throne Room - The throne floats at the ceiling, courtiers walk on the ceiling
- The Gravity Garden - A garden where plants grow downward into the sky
- The Ballroom of Contradictions - Where the Duchess hosts parties where attendees waltz in different directions of gravity
- The Foundation Observatory - At the top of the fragile legs, a room where you can see the palace's impossible weight distribution
- The Featherweight Vault - Where the Duchess stores her heaviest treasures (feathers, bubbles, thoughts)

**Primary Inhabitants:**
- Duchess Gravitas Featherweight and her court
- Paradox Servants (beings who are simultaneously solid and ethereal)
- Gravity-Adapted Creatures (fish swimming through air, birds burrowing through stone)
- Crystalline Guards (fragile but unkillable - shattering reforms them)

**Available Goods & Services:**
- Gravity Inversion Potions (temporary weight reversal)
- Paradox Riddle Solutions (the Duchess knows many surrealist puzzles' answers)
- Safe passage (the Duchess can grant immunity from Watchers if impressed)
- Impossible Balance Lessons (learn to walk on air if heavy, on ground if light)

**Potential Random Encounters (x5):**
1. A section of palace begins to collapse - party must make it heavier to save it
2. Gravity reverses suddenly, combat becomes three-dimensional
3. A courtier asks party to recover their stolen gravity (they float uncontrollably)
4. The Duchess's spider-leg foundation cracks - entire palace tilts
5. A Melting Watcher arrives to judge the Duchess herself

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):**
1. "The Duchess knows the location of the Lobster Telephone - but fears what calling it means."
2. "The palace's fragility is metaphor - it represents the Duchess's mental state."
3. "If the palace falls, the entire dimension's physics will stabilize into boring normalcy."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Upside-down architecture, people walking on ceilings, feathers falling like meteors, crystal refracting impossible light
- Sound: The creak of stressed wood supporting impossible weight, crystal chimes, the Duchess's elephant trumpeting disguised as coughs
- Smell: Perfume floating in layers by weight, the scent of strained porcelain (a sort of ceramic dust), garden flowers in the air above
- Touch: Vertigo from shifting gravity, the lightest objects feel heavy in hand, heavy objects feel weightless
- Taste: The air tastes of contradiction - sweet and bitter, heavy and light

### The Infinite Stairwell of Escher-Dalí

**Description:** An impossible dungeon of staircases that connect in paradoxical ways. Gravity is perspective-based - each creature chooses their own "down." One person's ceiling is another's floor. Combat and exploration become three-dimensional puzzles.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Penrose Steps - Stairs that ascend in a square loop yet always go up
- The Waterfall Paradox - Water flows upward in a closed loop, powering nothing
- The Relativity Chamber - A room where all six surfaces are "floor" to someone
- The Dropout Point - A platform where all gravities converge, causing disorientation
- The Library of Perspectives - Books shelved on all surfaces, readable from any orientation

**Primary Inhabitants:**
- Perspective Keepers (custodians who walk on different surfaces than visitors)
- Impossible Geometers (scholars studying paradoxical mathematics)
- Escher's Children (beings born with no fixed gravity, can walk on any surface)
- Paradox (Council essence #3 - lives somewhere in the stairwell, impossible to find)

**Available Goods & Services:**
- Gravity Affinity Shift (change your "down" temporarily)
- Perspective Maps (useless, as they contradict each other)
- Paradox Navigation Lessons (learn to think in impossible geometry)
- Relativity Anchors (items that fix your gravity temporarily)

**Potential Random Encounters (x5):**
1. Combat with enemies on different gravity planes (they attack from "above" which is your "side")
2. A staircase rotates mid-climb, redefining which way is down
3. Party encounters themselves coming from the opposite direction on the "same" stairs
4. A door that can only be opened by approaching from two directions simultaneously
5. The architecture shifts, trapping party in a Penrose polygon (impossible to escape without perspective shift)

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):**
1. "Paradox, the third Council member's essence, exists in all parts of the Stairwell simultaneously. And none of them."
2. "If you climb for exactly 999 steps in any direction, you'll find the stairs to the Burning Giraffe Citadel."
3. "The Stairwell is the dimension's skeleton - if it collapses, all architecture becomes euclidean."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Impossible angles, staircases at every angle, people walking on walls, vertigo-inducing architecture, shadows falling in every direction
- Sound: Footsteps above, below, and beside you all at once, voices echoing from impossible directions, the creak of stairs bearing weight from multiple gravities
- Smell: Dust falling upward, the scent of old stone and older geometry
- Touch: The disorientation of changing gravity, stairs solid beneath feet that shouldn't be "beneath"
- Taste: Air pressure constantly shifting as you move between gravity wells

### The Burning Giraffe Citadel (Final Dungeon)

**Description:** The seat of the Persistence of Self. A massive fortress in the shape of a burning giraffe, eternally aflame but never consumed. Inside, reality becomes completely negotiable - physics, logic, and identity are subject to belief. The final confrontation location.

**Key Landmarks:**
- The Combustion Gates - Entrance through the giraffe's burning legs, fire that doesn't consume
- The Gallery of Selves - A hall of mirrors showing all possible versions of the party
- The Symbolic Heart - A massive chamber where the giraffe's heart would be, pulsing with dream energy
- The Wheel of Five - The chamber where the Persistence of Self resides, five beings merged at the spine
- The Wake/Sleep Threshold - The final door, which leads either to escape or to ascension

**Primary Inhabitants:**
- The Persistence of Self (final encounter)
- Embodied Symbols (creatures that are pure concept given form: Fear, Hope, Regret, etc.)
- The party's Shadow Selves (dark reflections spawned by the dimension)
- Melting Watcher Titan (a massive fusion of all Watchers, final guardian)

**Available Goods & Services:**
- None - this is the final dungeon. No commerce, only confrontation and choice.

**Potential Random Encounters (x5):**
1. Combat against the party's own fears made manifest
2. A room where lying makes statements true and truth becomes false
3. Encounter with what the party would have become if they'd reached 0 Lucidity
4. The architecture changes based on what the party believes it should be
5. A conversation with the part of themselves that wants to stay in the dream

**Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):**
1. "The Burning Giraffe represents ambition that consumes. The Council's ambition consumed their humanity."
2. "To reach the Persistence of Self, you must each sacrifice one memory permanently."
3. "The fire doesn't burn - it transforms. Walking through it changes what you are."

**Sensory Details:**
- Sight: Eternal flames in golds and reds, architecture that shifts based on perception, five shadows overlapping into one, reality visibly wavering
- Sound: The roar of fire that makes no heat, five voices speaking in contradiction, the cracking of reality under strain, heartbeat-like pulsing
- Smell: Burning that has no smoke, the ozone of reality breaking down, each party member smells what they fear most
- Touch: Heat without temperature, solid ground that feels like dream, the sensation of being watched by yourself
- Taste: Ash and possibility, the metallic tang of choice, sweetness and bitterness of potential futures

## 6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States

**Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.

**Triggers:**

**IF:** A player character reaches 0 Lucidity Points
**THEN:** They become a native of the Dalí Dimension. Generate a surrealist transformation: their body gains an impossible feature (drawers for torso, melting hands, facelessness). They lose the drive to escape but gain immunity to Reality Checks. The party must choose: leave them behind or find a way to restore their Lucidity (requires essence from a Dream-Anchor).

**IF:** A player character reaches 20 Lucidity Points
**THEN:** They achieve hyper-lucidity. They can temporarily reshape minor reality (once per short rest, change one environmental element or create a small object from imagination). However, the Melting Watchers prioritize them as a target. Generate increased Watcher encounters focused on this PC.

**IF:** The party defeats or evades the Melting Watcher Prime
**THEN:** The Watchers become temporarily disorganized. For 3 sessions, Watcher encounters decrease. However, the dimension's stability also decreases - more random metamorphoses, more reality glitches. The Prime reforms after 3 sessions with a new ability based on how the party defeated it (if burned, gains fire immunity; if paradoxed, gains logic resistance, etc.).

**IF:** The party claims a Dream-Anchor successfully
**THEN:** They gain insight into one Council member's psyche and a permanent boon related to that member's domain (Burning Giraffe = resistance to being consumed by ambition, mechanically: advantage on saves against enchantment; Lobster Telephone = ability to communicate across any distance once per day; etc.). However, the Persistence of Self begins to fracture more - environmental instability increases in all regions.

**IF:** The party helps a Council essence (like the Gardener) remember their humanity
**THEN:** That essence regains partial individuality and can provide direct aid against the Persistence of Self. However, this accelerates the Great Fracture. Generate regional collapse events - entire locations may start dissolving into chaos.

**IF:** The party sides with the Elephant-Duchess against the Lucidity Cult
**THEN:** They gain safe haven in the Palace and immunity from Watchers in that region. The Duchess provides resources and information. However, they become enemies of the Cult, who begin sabotage operations against the party. The Fractured Oracle (Cult leader) becomes hostile and stops providing prophecies.

**IF:** The party sides with the Lucidity Cult against the Duchess
**THEN:** They gain the Fractured Oracle's full knowledge - prophecies about upcoming challenges, locations of all Dream-Anchors. However, the Elephant Palace becomes hostile territory. The Duchess calls her Crystalline Guards to hunt the party. They lose access to Palace resources and gravity manipulation lessons.

**IF:** The party reaches the Persistence of Self with 4+ Dream-Anchors claimed
**THEN:** The merged consciousness recognizes them as "Anchor-bearers" and offers peaceful negotiation. They can attempt to convince the Council to choose (Wake, Stabilize, or offer the party Ascension) without combat. Requires successful group skill challenge (Persuasion, Insight, Deception) with DC based on party's treatment of Council essences.

**IF:** The party reaches the Persistence of Self with fewer than 3 Dream-Anchors
**THEN:** The Council views them as threats trying to wake them by force. Combat is unavoidable. The final boss encounter is more difficult, and the Council fights desperately, summoning all embodied symbols (Fear, Regret, Hope) to defend themselves.

**IF:** During the final choice, the party votes to WAKE the Council
**THEN:** The Dalí Dimension begins to collapse over 1d4 hours. All native NPCs the party befriended plead for reconsideration. The Drawer People, the Gardener, Escher's Children - all face oblivion. If the party persists, they escape to the Material Plane but carry guilt and minor permanent surrealist contamination (one impossible feature: melting dreams, symbolic speech, perspective-shifted vision). They may meet the spirits of the five original Council members, grateful for release but confirmed dead.

**IF:** During the final choice, the party votes to STABILIZE the dimension
**THEN:** The party remains trapped but gains power over a region of the dimension. They can create a zone of relative normalcy where refugees from the surrealism can live. They become NPCs/minor gods of the realm, protectors of stability in chaos. Campaign continues in sandbox mode as they defend their territory from fractures, help natives, and become part of the dimension's mythology.

**IF:** During the final choice, the party votes to ASCEND (take the Council's place)
**THEN:** The party members merge consciousnesses with the Persistence of Self, becoming the new Dreamers. They gain reality-warping powers but lose individual identity over time. Campaign ends with epilogue showing the new merged entity (The Persistence of [Party Name]) beginning to forget which thoughts belonged to which original person. They've become gods but lost humanity. Bittersweet victory.

**IF:** The final choice vote is tied (equal votes for different options)
**THEN:** Paradox occurs. The dimension splits into parallel versions, one for each voted option. Each party member experiences a different outcome simultaneously. They must then navigate the paradox, meeting alternate versions of themselves who made different choices. Resolution requires unanimous revote or acceptance of living in superposition (existing in all outcomes at once, Schrödinger's party).

## 7. Unique Mechanics Implementation

**Directive:** Implement the following custom mechanical systems:

### Lucidity Points System
- Track on character sheet alongside HP
- Start: 10, Min: 0, Max: 20
- Gain via: solving symbolic puzzles (+1), embracing surrealism creatively (+1), claiming Dream-Anchors (+2), long rest in stable location (+1d4)
- Lose via: failed Reality Checks (-1), exposure to extreme impossibility (-1d4), using surrealist powers (-1 per use)
- At 0: Transform into native, lose escape motivation, gain benefits (immune to Reality Checks, can manipulate local surrealism)
- At 20: Hyper-lucid, can reshape reality 1/short rest, but Watchers prioritize as target

### Reality Check Saving Throws
- Triggered by: encountering major impossibility (melting clocks, gravity shifts, anatomical transformations)
- Save: Wisdom DC 12-20 (based on impossibility severity)
- Success: Adapt without issue, possibly gain insight (DM awards inspiration or advantage)
- Failure: Lose 1 LP, suffer surrealist consequence (temporary transformation, scrambled memory, symbolic speech)
- Critical Failure (nat 1): Lose 2 LP, major transformation, possible combat disadvantage

### Symbolic Resonance
- Objects/creatures represent concepts
- Players can attempt to understand symbolism: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) check DC 15
- Success: Reveal object's true symbolic nature and alternative uses
- Example: A "key" represents "solution" - can solve non-lock problems symbolically
- Example: A "mirror" represents "truth" - forces creatures to see their true nature
- Example: "Burning Giraffe" represents "consuming ambition" - can devour or inspire

### Perspective Physics (Location-Specific: Infinite Stairwell)
- Each creature chooses gravity direction at start of turn
- Movement: Can walk on any surface that is "down" for you
- Combat: Attacking creatures on different gravity planes = disadvantage unless you succeed on Int check DC 12 to adjust perspective
- Fall damage: Only fall toward your "down" - can change "down" as reaction but triggers Reality Check
- Puzzle solving: Some doors/switches only accessible from specific gravity perspectives

### Metamorphosis Table (Roll 1d20 when triggered)
1. Hands become hourglasses (can see time remaining until events)
2. Speak in colors instead of words (others must interpret)
3. Shadow gains independence (acts out your suppressed desires)
4. One eye sees past, one sees future, neither sees present
5. Your reflection acts opposite to your actions
6. Body parts swap positions randomly (arm where leg was, etc.)
7. Become partially translucent (advantage on stealth, disadvantage on persuasion)
8. Thoughts appear as visible symbols above head
9. Age randomly (1d20 years forward or back)
10. Gravity reverses for you only
11. Tears become physical objects (pearls, glass, memories)
12. Voice echoes from yesterday (speak, then hear your words tomorrow)

## 8. Story Branching Map

**Directive:** Track the following major decision points and their consequences:

**Decision Point 1: Elephant-Duchess Alliance** (Session 8)
- Side with Duchess → Palace resources, Watcher immunity in region, Cult becomes hostile
- Side with Cult → Oracle's full knowledge, Palace becomes hostile, Duchess hunts party
- Neutral → Both factions distrust party, must navigate both territories carefully

**Decision Point 2: First Council Essence Encounter** (Session 14)
- Help Essence Remember → Gains ally, accelerates Great Fracture, region instability
- Leave Essence in Dream → No ally, dimension stays stable longer, harder final boss
- Mercy-Kill Essence → Absorb power (+1 Dream-Anchor worth), dimension partially stabilizes, moral weight

**Decision Point 3: Melting Watcher Philosophy** (Session 16)
- Agree Watchers Are Right (dimension should be preserved) → Watchers become neutral, Cult becomes enemy, path toward Stabilize ending
- Oppose Watchers (dimension should end) → Watchers intensify hunting, path toward Wake ending
- Seek Middle Ground → Both sides wary, open all ending paths

**Decision Point 4: PC Reaches 0 Lucidity** (Variable timing)
- Abandon Transformed PC → They become NPC, possibly help later as native guide
- Quest to Restore PC → Requires Dream-Anchor essence, delays main quest, strengthens party bonds
- PC Chooses to Stay Transformed → Player creates new character or plays as surrealist native

**Decision Point 5: Final Choice** (Session 23)
- Wake Council → Escape, destroy dimension, guilt, contamination
- Stabilize Council → Remain as guardians, sandbox play, become NPCs/gods
- Ascend → Merge with Council, god powers, lose humanity
- Paradox (tied vote) → Quantum campaign, experience all outcomes simultaneously

Each decision should be telegraphed through NPC dialogues, environmental clues, and symbolic foreshadowing.
