# The Vortex Throne
**Every Tornado Is a Portal. One Leads to the Crown.**

## Campaign Overview

Tornadoes aren't just wind—they're doorways. Each funnel cloud opens briefly to the Elemental Chaos Plane, the primordial realm where air, earth, fire, and water exist in pure, unformed potential. For centuries, this was theoretical knowledge for mages. Then someone discovered the Vortex Throne—a seat of power deep in the Chaos Plane that grants absolute dominion over all atmospheric phenomena. Whoever sits on the throne becomes the Storm Emperor, able to command every wind, summon any weather, and reshape the sky itself.

The party begins during the Tournament of Funnels—a deadly competition where mages, warriors, and desperate souls chase tornadoes, ride them through the barriers between worlds, and fight through the Chaos Plane seeking the throne. The current Storm Emperor is dying, and tradition demands a new ruler be crowned through trial. But the Chaos Plane is lethal, constantly shifting, filled with elemental horrors, and the throne itself is said to consume those unworthy of its power.

As they navigate tornado-hopping, elemental survival, and combat against rival competitors, they'll discover the throne's dark truth: It's not a source of power but a prison. The Storm Emperor doesn't rule the weather—they sacrifice themselves to contain the Primal Tempest, an apocalyptic weather entity that would destroy all reality if unleashed. The tournament isn't about claiming power. It's about finding the next volunteer to be imprisoned forever, alone, holding back the end of the world.

## Core Themes

- **Power's Hidden Cost**: Ultimate authority is ultimate sacrifice
- **Portal Navigation**: Tornado as transportation and danger
- **Elemental Chaos**: Primordial forces beyond mortal control
- **Competition vs. Cooperation**: Tournament forcing temporary alliances
- **Willing Martyrdom**: Someone must sit the throne
- **The Burden of Crowns**: Leadership as imprisonment

## Plot Twists

- Throne isn't power source—it's prison
- Emperor doesn't rule weather—holds back apocalypse
- Taking throne means eternal imprisonment
- Tournament deliberately hides truth until finalists arrive
- Primal Tempest is fragmented consciousness of all weather
- Previous Emperors' ghosts haunt throne room
- One competitor is secretly current Emperor's child, manipulated into competing
- The throne can be shared but that halves each person's remaining lifespan
- Chaos Plane is dying, throne's power weakening
- Alternative solution exists but requires destroying throne (releasing Tempest controlled)

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

Victory: Someone worthy takes throne knowingly, or find way to share burden, or revolutionary solution containing Tempest differently

Defeat: Unworthy person takes throne (goes mad, releases Tempest), or no one takes throne (Tempest escapes), or protagonist takes throne (become NPC, imprisoned forever)

## Campaign Notes

Explores sacrifice, hidden costs of power, and choosing to bear burdens for greater good. Tournament structure provides clear progression but moral complexity deepens each session. Tornado travel makes for unique setpieces. Chaos Plane offers dangerous playground for elemental encounters.

Best with players who enjoy:
- Competition with heart (rivalry but respect)
- Environmental hazards and navigation challenges
- Moral choice over power acquisition
- Possibility of heroic sacrifice endings
- Discovery that power isn't what it seems

The throne is ultimate bait-and-switch: Promises godhood, delivers imprisonment. Someone must take it, or world ends. Will party compete for false prize, sacrifice for true purpose, or find third way? The Primal Tempest isn't evil—it's primordial chaos that reality can't handle. The Emperor isn't tyrant—they're martyr keeping apocalypse at bay.

End with epilogue showing new Emperor's isolation, or revolutionary solution's consequences, or party's successful escape leaving burden to willing NPC. No matter what: Someone pays the price. The only choice is who, and whether they know the cost when they choose.
