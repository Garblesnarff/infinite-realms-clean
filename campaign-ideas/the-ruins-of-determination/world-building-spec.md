### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Ruins of Determination**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A party falls underground where monsters were sealed after a war. Every encounter offers a choice: kill or show mercy. Their choices create three radically different campaigns—Pacifist (befriend everyone and free monsters), Neutral (survive with mixed morality), or Genocide (systematically murder everyone and face consequences that transcend the campaign). The game remembers, even after resetting.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Monster-Human War and why monsters were sealed underground with a magic barrier.
    *   Write about the Dreemurr family—King Asgore, Queen Toriel, and their children Asriel and Chara.
    *   Describe the tragedy of Chara (first fallen human) and Asriel's death at human hands.
    *   Explain Determination—the power to persist and reshape reality, found in human souls.
    *   Detail Flowey's origin as Asriel revived without a soul through Determination experiments.

    *   **The Monster Kingdom** (Major): All monsters underground, led by King Asgore, want freedom desperately.
