# The Ruins of Determination

*A Compassion vs Violence / Meta-Narrative campaign — Short-Medium Campaign (10-15 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Ruins of Determination
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Meta-Narrative / Moral Choice / Underground Adventure / Bullet-Hell Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Short-Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **10-15** (varies dramatically by route)
**Tone (keywords):** determination, mercy vs genocide, breaking the fourth wall, monsters underground, time loops, consequences, love
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party falls into an underground realm where monsters were sealed centuries ago after losing a war with humans. Every encounter offers a choice: fight and kill, or show mercy and spare. Their choices create three radically different campaigns—Pacifist Route where they befriend everyone and free the monsters, Neutral Route where they survive but change little, or Genocide Route where they systematically murder every monster and face consequences that transcend the campaign itself. The game remembers even after you reset.

## Story Arc (Varies by Route)

Three completely different story arcs based on player choices.

### **PACIFIST ROUTE (10-12 sessions):**
*   **Act I — The Ruins of Kindness (Sessions 1-4):** The party falls underground and meets Toriel, a motherly figure who protects them. They learn to spare monsters through ACT commands—complimenting, joking, showing mercy. They explore the ruins, befriend a skeleton comedian and his brother, navigate puzzles, and show kindness to everyone. They discover a human child's soul remains underground, guiding them.
*   **Act II — Friendships Forged (Sessions 5-8):** They befriend Undyne (warrior), Alphys (scientist), and Mettaton (robot star). Each wants to capture their soul to free monsterkind, but through understanding and compassion, they become allies. They learn the truth: long ago, monsters and humans warred; monsters lost and were sealed underground with a barrier requiring seven human souls to break.
*   **Act III — The Barrier Breaks (Sessions 9-12):** The king offers them a choice: sacrifice themselves to free monsters, or live while monsters remain trapped. Through determination and friendship, they forge a third path. They face Flowey, a soulless creature who manipulates timelines, and then confront Asriel, a lost child who became godlike through Determination. By refusing to kill, showing mercy even to those who deserve none, they save everyone. The barrier breaks; monsters are freed; the party remains friends forever.

### **NEUTRAL ROUTE (10 sessions):**
*   Acts I-II similar to Pacifist, but they kill some monsters
*   They face Asgore and must choose to kill or spare him
*   Flowey reveals he's been manipulating timelines, becoming an eldritch god
*   They defeat him, escape, but the ending varies based on who they spared
*   They can't achieve the true ending without perfect mercy

### **GENOCIDE ROUTE (8-10 sessions - MUCH HARDER):**
*   The party actively hunts down every monster in each area
*   NPCs flee or go silent; the world becomes empty
*   Sans, the comic skeleton, judges them: "You're gonna have a bad time"
*   They face Undyne the Undying and Sans—impossibly difficult battles
*   They destroy the world itself; a demon offers to restore it for a price
*   Even if they reset, the game remembers what they did
*   Future playthroughs are tainted by their genocide

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of mercy versus vengeance, consequences of violence, breaking cycles of hatred, determination as double-edged sword, and whether love can overcome nihilism. It asks: Is it always right to show mercy? Do your choices matter if you can reset? Can someone without a soul be saved? The central conflict pits the party's potential for compassion against centuries of war, their own violent instincts, and a soulless being who controls timelines.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **ACT System (Non-Violent Resolution)**
*   Every enemy can be spared through ACT commands
*   Check reveals enemy stats and hints for mercy
*   Specific ACT options per enemy (Compliment, Flex, Joke, etc.)
*   Sparing all enemies is key to Pacifist Route
*   Killing even one enemy locks out True Pacifist

### 2. **Bullet-Hell Combat**
*   Turn-based with action phases
*   During enemy attacks, control a heart dodging patterns
*   Each enemy has unique bullet patterns (bones, spears, bombs)
*   Boss battles have elaborate, rhythmic patterns
*   Can survive by dodging without attacking

### 3. **SAVE Points and Determination**
*   Golden stars allow SAVing—but enemies know about this
*   Determination is the power to persist, reshape fate, refuse death
*   Flowey has this power too—he's SAVED and LOADED countless times
*   The game remembers actions across SAVEs
*   Resetting has consequences noticed by NPCs

### 4. **Route System (Three Campaigns)**
*   **Pacifist:** Spare everyone, befriend all, achieve True Pacifist ending
*   **Neutral:** Mix of mercy and violence, multiple endings based on choices
*   **Genocide:** Kill every monster in every area, face ultimate consequences
*   Switching routes mid-campaign changes NPC reactions
*   Game tracks your soul across "playthroughs"

### 5. **Meta-Narrative Elements**
*   Characters break the fourth wall—Sans knows about resets
*   Flowey addresses the player directly, not the character
*   Game files can be corrupted or changed by Genocide
*   The UI itself becomes part of combat and story
*   Choices in previous sessions affect current campaign

### 6. **Determination Mechanics**
*   Refusing to die in critical moments
*   Power to reshape reality through willpower
*   Can be used for good (saving everyone) or evil (genocide)
*   Other beings with Determination can challenge you
*   Accumulating too much Determination has consequences

### 7. **LV and EXP**
*   LOVE (Level of Violence) increases when you kill
*   EXecution Points gained from killing
*   Higher LV makes you stronger but changes the story
*   Pacifist Route stays at LV 1 but gains emotional strength
*   Genocide Route maximizes LV but empties the world

### 8. **Friendship Mechanics**
*   Befriending NPCs unlocks areas, items, and the True Ending
*   Dating Papyrus and Undyne provides character depth
*   Hanging out with Alphys reveals her secrets
*   Final boss changes based on friendships made
*   Love is more powerful than violence
