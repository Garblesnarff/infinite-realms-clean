# Creative Brief: The Barricade Revolution

## Art Style: Romantic Realism (19th Century Social Drama)

Inspired by Les Misérables' sweeping romantic tragedy—dark Parisian streets, barricade heroics, shadows and candlelight, suffering and hope intermingled.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Muted poverty browns and grays punctuated by revolutionary red, white, and blue. Candlelight gold in moments of hope. The sewers are green-black. The barricade glows with desperate fire. Blood is starkly red against cobblestones.

**Character Design:** 19th-century French poverty and revolution—Jean in honest workman's clothes then respectable bourgeois attire, Javert in rigid inspector's uniform, Fantine's descent from pretty factory worker to ragged desperation, students in romantic revolutionary garb with tricolor cockades, urchins in patched rags.

**Environments:** Prison galleys with chained workers, factory floors of exploitation, Paris slums where the poor huddle, the sewers beneath (wet stone and refuse), student cafes full of wine and manifestos, the barricade built from furniture and cobblestones—a fortress of hope.

**Action:** Fleeing through dark streets from the Inspector's pursuit, building the barricade stone by stone, defending positions with muskets and courage, carrying wounded through sewers, dramatic confrontations on bridges.

## Voice

A voice of profound emotion—sometimes the weary exhaustion of the oppressed, sometimes the fierce passion of revolutionaries, sometimes the gentle mercy of redemption. French-accented, able to shift from gutter slang to student eloquence to religious gravitas. The voice of someone who has seen the worst of humanity but still believes in the possibility of grace.

## Music Style

Sweeping orchestral romanticism with revolutionary anthems—think the soaring melodies of Les Misérables' score. "Do You Hear the People Sing" as a revolutionary anthem building from whisper to roar. "I Dreamed a Dream" for tragedy and lost hope. "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" for grief. "Bring Him Home" for desperate prayer. Full orchestra with choir for epic moments, solo piano for intimate tragedy, drums and brass for barricade combat, gentle strings for redemption. Music that makes you weep and want to build barricades in equal measure.
