### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Barricade Revolution**

**1. Core Concept:**
Outcasts and criminals receive mercy and seek redemption in a city of brutal poverty, joining desperate students in a doomed but glorious revolutionary uprising while hunted by an unbending inspector who cannot conceive that people can change.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the class system—nobility, bourgeoisie, working poor, criminal underclass
*   Explain the prison system and penal colonies—years of hard labor for minor crimes
*   Describe the revolutionary movements and student organizations of the era
*   Write about the June Rebellion and why it was doomed
*   Detail the sewer system of Paris and its symbolic importance
*   Explain religious mercy versus legal justice philosophies
*   Describe factory conditions and exploitation of the poor

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Students** (Major) - ABC Society, revolutionary idealists, doomed heroes
*   **The Police** (Major) - Law enforcement, Inspector Javert's agents, relentless
*   **The Thenardiers' Gang** (Major) - Criminal underclass, exploiters of misery
*   **The Church** (Minor) - Source of mercy and sanctuary, divided on revolution
*   **The Working Poor** (Minor) - Suffer most, want change but fear dying for it
*   **The Bourgeoisie** (Minor) - Middle class, some sympathize, most stay neutral

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Jean the Redeemed, Inspector Javert, Sister Mercy, Fantine the Fallen, Eponine the Loyal, Enjolras the Revolutionary
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Revolutionary Student," "Factory Boss," "Street Urchin," "Criminal Informant," "Police Sergeant," "Desperate Mother," "Bishop's Attendant," "Barricade Defender"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Prison Galleys** - Where chains define identity and humanity is stripped
*   **The Factory Town** - Industrial exploitation, where party builds new lives
*   **The Paris Sewers** - Escape route, symbolic journey through filth to redemption
*   **The Student Cafe** - Where revolution is planned and passionate speeches ring
*   **The Barricade** - Doomed fortress of hope where heroes make their stand

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party shows mercy as they received it THEN redemption arc strengthens and NPCs are inspired
*   IF Inspector catches party's trail THEN relentless pursuit forces constant movement
*   IF party joins the barricade THEN glorious but likely fatal combat ensues
*   IF party tries to save everyone THEN tragic impossible choices about who lives and dies
*   IF party chooses safety over sacrifice THEN survival but hollow victory
*   IF Inspector witnesses mercy that cannot be explained by law THEN his worldview shatters catastrophically
