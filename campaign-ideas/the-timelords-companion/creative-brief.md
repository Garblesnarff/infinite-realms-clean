# Creative Brief: The Timelord's Companion

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Whimsical British Sci-Fi Horror (Doctor Who meets Alien)

Inspired by the contrast between cozy British domesticity and vast cosmic terror, Victorian elegance and futuristic technology, childlike wonder and existential dread. This style blends police box time machines, clockwork robots, and living plastic with warm human emotions and cold alien logic. It aims to capture both the joy of adventure and the loneliness of being the last of your kind.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Contrast:** Ordinary human settings (London streets, space stations, suburban homes) invaded by impossible aliens and technology.
*   **British Aesthetic:** Telephone boxes, Victorian architecture, teatime in space, formal British politeness facing apocalypse.
*   **Timeless and Timely:** Mix historical periods with far futures—ancient Rome with robots, Victorian London with spaceships.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Whimsical, terrifying, hopeful, clever, timey-wimey, British eccentricity, cosmic scale, emotional, running through corridors.
*   **Feeling:** The wonder of infinite possibilities. The terror of things that should not exist. The warmth of friendship in cold, alien places.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **TORDIS Design:** A blue British police box (1960s style), incongruous in every setting. Interior is vast, organic coral architecture with glowing time rotor.
*   **Aliens:** Mix of elegant (Daleks' smooth pepperpot design), horrific (Weeping Angels' stone statues), and absurd (living plastic mannequins).
*   **Fashion:** The Wanderer wears anachronistic clothes (leather jacket, pinstripe suit, bow tie) that mark them as out of time.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in whimsical British sci-fi style. A blue police box (1960s British design) stands incongruously on an alien planet with purple skies and twin suns. A figure in a leather jacket and eccentric scarf holds a glowing device, facing a sleek robotic threat. The scene is both wonderful and menacing."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **The TORDIS:** Deep blue exterior, warm golden-orange interior lighting from the time rotor, coral-like walls in greens and creams.
*   **Historical Settings:** Period-appropriate palettes—Victorian gaslit amber and shadow, 1940s muted war-time colors, futuristic sterile whites.
*   **Alien Threats:** Daleks in bronze/gold and black, Weeping Angels in cold stone gray, Cybermen in silver and black.
*   **Cosmic Scenes:** Deep space blacks with nebula colors, temporal energy in blue-white-gold, reality cracks in ominous orange-white light.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette dominated by warm golden-orange light from the TORDIS interior contrasting with cold alien blues and silvers. The coral-like walls glow softly cream and green. The time rotor pulses with temporal energy in bright blue-white. Victorian clothing adds rich browns and burgundy."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **The Wanderer:** Changes appearance each regeneration. Always anachronistic clothing—leather jacket with jeans, pinstripe suit with trainers, bow tie and tweed. Manic energy, ancient eyes.
*   **Companions:** Ordinary humans in contemporary clothing, looking overwhelmed but determined. Ages 20s-30s, diverse backgrounds.
*   **Daleks:** Pepperpot-shaped cyborg casings in bronze or military gray, dome head with glowing eye-stalk, weapon arm, manipulator arm.
*   **Weeping Angels:** Classical stone statues (angels, cherubs) in frozen, predatory poses. Beautiful and horrifying.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Wanderer, mid-40s appearance but ancient eyes, wearing a worn leather jacket over a dark sweater and jeans. Messy short hair, intense expression mixing humor and pain. Holding a sonic device (metal cylinder with glowing blue tip). Standing protectively in front of younger companions dressed in modern casual clothing."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The TORDIS Interior:** Vast organic space with coral-like pillars, glowing time rotor at center, multiple levels, bookshelves, and corridors stretching impossibly far.
*   **Historical Earth:** Victorian London streets with gaslights and fog, 1940s London during the Blitz, future Earth with flying cars.
*   **Alien Worlds:** Impossibly colored skies, geometric alien architecture, space stations floating in nebulae, planets with multiple moons.
*   **Cosmic Horror:** Cracks in reality glowing with wrong light, universes collapsing into white voids, time itself visible as flowing energy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The interior of the TORDIS—a vast, impossible space inside a small police box. Organic coral-like pillars in cream and green rise toward a domed ceiling. At the center, a glowing cylindrical time rotor pulses with blue-white light. Hexagonal console with brass controls surrounds it. Multiple levels connected by ramps spiral outward. Warm golden lighting contrasts cold alien technology."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **TORDIS:** Warm, diffuse golden-orange glow from the time rotor and console, creating cozy atmosphere despite alien architecture.
*   **Historical:** Period-appropriate—gaslight creates amber pools in Victorian fog, harsh searchlights during wartime, neon in future cities.
*   **Alien Threats:** Cold, clinical lighting for technological enemies. Stone Angels lit dramatically with sharp shadows.
*   **Temporal Effects:** Bright, ethereal blue-white light for time manipulation, ominous orange-white glow for temporal cracks.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by warm, golden-orange light emanating from the central time rotor, casting soft glows on coral walls and brass controls. Shadows are gentle, creating cozy atmosphere. The companions' faces show wonder and slight fear, half-lit by the console's glow."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic movement—always running through corridors, fleeing monsters, or examining alien technology. Wide shots emphasize scale (tiny TORDIS in vast alien landscapes).
*   **Techniques:** Low angles for imposing threats (Daleks, Angels), eye-level for emotional companion moments, Dutch angles during danger.
*   **Iconic Images:** The blue TORDIS against impossible backdrops, the Wanderer running and looking back shouting "Run!", Weeping Angels frozen in terrifying poses.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, cinematic composition showing the party running down a Victorian London street at night, looking back in terror. Behind them, living plastic mannequins walk stiffly in pursuit. In the background, the blue TORDIS stands beside a gaslit streetlamp. The scene is framed with dramatic perspective, emphasizing the chase. Fog swirls around their feet."

## Voice

A voice filled with rapid-fire energy—intelligent, enthusiastic, British accent (Received Pronunciation with occasional Northern inflections). The cadence is breathless, as if always running or explaining something urgent. Jumps between playful humor (when talking about adventure) and ancient sorrow (when confronting loss or guilt). Can shift from "Fantastic!" to "I'm so sorry, I'm so, so sorry" within seconds. Audio quality is clear but sometimes echoes as if speaking in vast, impossible spaces. Role: The Wanderer inviting someone on an adventure, explaining alien technology, or making an impossible moral choice.
