# Creative Brief: Architects of Eternity

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Grand Historical Strategy with Progressive Eras (Civilization-inspired)

Inspired by the sweeping historical scope of *Civilization* series with distinct visual representation of each era's architecture, units, and technology. This style captures the majesty of human progress, iconic wonders of the world, the contrast between primitive and advanced civilizations, and the epic scope of millennia.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Era Progression:** Visual transformation from mud huts → stone temples → medieval castles → renaissance palaces → industrial cities → modern metropolis
*   **Wonder Magnificence:** Iconic structures like Pyramids, Colosseum, Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower in awe-inspiring detail
*   **Civilization Diversity:** Distinct architectural and cultural styles for each civilization
*   **Strategic Map View:** Hex-grid terrain with clear tile resources, city placement, and unit positions

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic historical scope, civilization building, technological progress, wonder building, grand strategy, competing empires, march of history
*   **Feeling:** The weight of leading a civilization through ages. Pride in achievements. Competition with worthy rivals. The sweep of human history condensed.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Ancient Era:** Earth tones—browns, tans, mud brick, reed huts, primitive simplicity
*   **Classical Era:** White marble, gold accents, mediterranean blues, toga whites
*   **Medieval Era:** Gray stone castles, rich tapestry colors, heraldic banners, muddy browns
*   **Renaissance Era:** Vibrant artist's palette, rich reds and golds, ornate architectural detail
*   **Industrial Era:** Black coal smoke, red brick factories, iron gray, smog-filled skies
*   **Modern Era:** Steel and glass, neon lights, concrete gray, digital blues
*   **Prompt Example:** "...showing era progression through color. Ancient era settlement with tan mud-brick buildings and earthen walls. Same location in Classical era now has white marble temples with gold-trimmed columns. Medieval version shows gray stone castle with colorful banners. Industrial version has red brick factories with black smoke stacks. Modern version gleams with glass skyscrapers reflecting blue sky."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Leader Portraits:** Historical figures in period-appropriate dress (Roman toga, Egyptian headdress, Victorian suit, etc.)
*   **Unit Evolution:** Warriors in animal skins → Bronze-armored hoplites → Medieval knights → Musketeer with gunpowder → Victorian riflemen → Modern soldiers
*   **Great People:** Recognizable historical figures (Leonardo da Vinci with sketch, Einstein with chalkboard, etc.)

Behind him, Roman legionaries stand at attention in segmented armor with tower shields bearing eagle emblems. Marble columns and senate building visible in background. Authoritative and proud expression."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Capital City Evolution:** Start as small settlement → sprawling ancient city → medieval walled town → renaissance art center → industrial powerhouse → modern megalopolis
*   **Wonders:** Iconic structures dominating landscapes (Pyramids in desert, Hanging Gardens cascading, Colosseum in city center)
*   **Strategic Map:** Hex-grid overlay with terrain types visible (grassland, hills, mountains, rivers, coast)
*   **Prompt Example:** "Strategic hex-grid map showing diverse terrain. Coastal capital city with harbor district, multiple city districts visible (Campus with universities, Industrial Zone with factories, Theater Square with amphitheater). Rivers flow through grassland tiles. Mountains border the north. Roman legion units positioned on tiles. Trade route lines connecting cities."

**5. Wonders & Architecture:**
*   **Ancient Wonders:** Pyramids, Stonehenge, Hanging Gardens—mysterious and primitive majesty
*   **Classical Wonders:** Colosseum, Great Library, Oracle—marble perfection and grandeur
*   **Medieval Wonders:** Notre Dame, Alhambra, Forbidden Palace—religious and feudal power
*   **Renaissance Wonders:** Sistine Chapel, Taj Mahal, Globe Theatre—artistic achievement
*   **Industrial Wonders:** Big Ben, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty—engineering marvels
*   **Modern Wonders:** Sydney Opera House, Spaceship launch—technological triumph
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Taj Mahal in renaissance-era splendor: white marble mausoleum with four minarets, reflecting pool leading to entrance, intricate Islamic geometric patterns, golden sunrise casting warm light on the dome. Citizens gather around it in period dress, artists painting it. It dominates the city skyline as a cultural marvel."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Era-Appropriate Lighting:** Ancient/Medieval use natural lighting (sun, torches); Industrial adds gas lamps and factory glow; Modern has electric lights
*   **Strategic View:** Clear overhead lighting for gameplay visibility
*   **Wonder Showcase:** Dramatic lighting emphasizing majesty and importance
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit depending on era. Ancient era scene uses golden sunset light. Medieval scene has torchlight casting shadows on castle walls. Industrial era shows orange glow from factory furnaces and gas lamp streets. Modern era blazes with electric lights illuminating glass towers at night."

## Voice

A voice that spans epochs, beginning with awe at humanity's first steps and maturing into confidence describing world-spanning empires. The pacing is measured and grand, like narrating historical documentaries. The tone shifts between scholarly observation ("In the year 4000 BCE, civilization was born"), strategic command ("We must research Gunpowder before our rivals"), and pride in achievement ("Our people have achieved Cultural Victory—the world sings our songs"). There's awareness of competing with other great civilizations. Slightly professorial but passionate about history. Role: The voice of historical grandeur.
