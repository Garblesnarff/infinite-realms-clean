# The Clockwork Paradox
**Tagline:** *"You've got to go back—back to the future!"*

## Campaign Overview

When a gnomish inventor accidentally creates a temporal displacement device powered by unstable magical energy, the party becomes unstuck in time. After a catastrophic accident sends them bouncing between past, present, and future, they discover they've inadvertently created cascading timeline errors that threaten to erase their own existence. The campaign follows their desperate attempts to "fix" history by revisiting key moments and ensuring certain events happen exactly as they should.

The tone is lighter than traditional time travel campaigns, with humor mixed into the tension. Players will experience fish-out-of-water scenarios as they navigate different time periods, accidentally influence major historical events, and try to avoid their own grandparents (or great-great-grandparents). The campaign emphasizes problem-solving, creative thinking, and the comedy of errors that comes from trying to manipulate causality while avoiding paradoxes.

Each arc focuses on fixing a specific "temporal error" created by their time-hopping, while an overarching plot reveals that someone is deliberately sabotaging their attempts to restore the timeline. The mystery of who's working against them and why drives the campaign toward an explosive finale where past, present, and future collide.
