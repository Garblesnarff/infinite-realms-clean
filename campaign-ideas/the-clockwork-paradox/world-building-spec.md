## Temporal Mechanics

### The Clockwork Device

**Function:**
- Calculates temporal coordinates
- Opens displacement portals
- Requires magical power source
- Increasingly unstable with use
- Limited jumps remain

**Safety Features (Failing):**
- Paradox detection
- Causality mapping
- Timeline integrity monitoring
- All deteriorating
- Emergency shutoff unreliable

**Limitations:**
- Cannot travel forward beyond device creation
- Past travel limited to 500 years
- Precision decreases with distance
- Multiple passengers strain device
- Cannot prevent own invention (bootstrap)

### Temporal Error Types

**Type 1: Prevented Birth**
- Someone who should exist doesn't
- Cascade affects descendants
- Easiest to fix: play matchmaker
- Romantic comedy potential

**Type 2: Altered Outcome**

### Timeline Correction Process

**Step 1: Identify Error**
- Compare present to memories

- Locate divergence point
- Calculate required changes

**Step 2: Travel to Point**
- Set coordinates carefully
- Prepare era-appropriate gear
- Gather intelligence
- Brief party on mission

**Step 3: Execute Correction**
- Navigate time period
- Make specific changes
- Avoid creating new errors
- Confirm success

**Step 4: Return and Verify**
- Jump back to present
- Check if timeline improved
- Note remaining issues
- Plan next correction

### Paradox Rules

**Personal Paradox:**
