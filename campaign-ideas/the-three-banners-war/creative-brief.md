# Creative Brief: The Three Banners War

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy Realism (Elder Scrolls-inspired)

Inspired by The Elder Scrolls' rich, detailed aesthetic—a style that blends gritty medieval realism with high fantasy magic and daedric horror. This style captures the diverse cultures of Tamriel and the nightmarish beauty of Oblivion.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Cultural Authenticity:** Each race and region has distinct architectural and costume styles rooted in real-world inspirations.
*   **Dark Mysticism:** Magic is ancient, mysterious, and often dangerous-looking with daedric elements.
*   **Gritty Realism:** Even fantasy elements have weight, texture, and believable detail.

## Voice

A deep, gravelly voice with a hint of Nordic accent, suggesting a weathered warrior-scholar. The tone is dark and serious, acknowledging the horror of war and daedric invasion, yet carrying a thread of defiant hope. The emotion balances grim determination with respect for the fallen. Audio quality is rich with subtle echo suggesting ancient stone halls. Role: A veteran campaigner recounting tales of the Three Banners War, or a scholar documenting apocalyptic events.
