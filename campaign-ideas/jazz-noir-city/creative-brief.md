# Jazz Noir City - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
Film noir meets jazz age expressionism. Every scene should feel like it's being viewed through cigarette smoke and neon reflections. The world exists in a perpetual state of "3 AM in a city that never quite sleeps." Reality has soft edges, shadows are impossibly long, and light sources create dramatic chiaroscuro effects.

**Primary Visual Influences:**
- 1940s-50s film noir cinematography (The Maltese Falcon, Touch of Evil, The Big Sleep)
- Jazz album covers by Blue Note Records (Reid Miles' iconic designs)
- Art deco architecture and design
- German Expressionist cinema (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari for distorted perspectives)
- Francis Bacon's paintings (for emotional intensity and distortion)
- Blade Runner's neo-noir cityscape

### Environmental Details

**Weather and Atmosphere:**
- Perpetual rain that never quite becomes a storm
- Fog that rolls in and out like a breathing entity
- Streetlights with amber glows creating pools of light in darkness
- Steam rising from grates and sewers
- Neon signs reflected in puddles (blues, pinks, golds)
- Low-hanging clouds that hide the tops of tall buildings

**Architecture:**
- Art deco skyscrapers with geometric patterns and chrome fixtures
- Brick buildings with fire escapes creating shadow patterns
- Narrow alleyways that seem to shift and rearrange
- Underground speakeasies with circular architecture
- Warehouses with high windows creating dramatic light shafts
- Everything has curves—no harsh right angles

**Lighting Philosophy:**
- High contrast: deep blacks and bright highlights with minimal midtones
- Key lighting from single dramatic sources (spotlight, street lamp, neon sign)
- Venetian blind shadows across faces and walls
- Backlight silhouettes for mysterious entrances
- Colored light from neon signs: blues (melancholy), reds (danger), golds (wealth)
- Light should feel tangible, almost viscous, like it's traveling through the smoky air

### Character Design

**General Principles:**
- Everyone looks slightly disheveled—even the wealthy have loosened ties or smudged makeup
- Clothing from 1940s-50s era: fedoras, trench coats, cocktail dresses, suspenders
- Characters' color palettes should reflect their musical alignment:
  - Traditional jazz: muted browns, tans, deep blues
  - Bebop: contrasting colors, irregular patterns
  - Swing: coordinated ensembles, matching sets
  - Cool jazz: whites, silvers, pale blues

## Music and Sound Design

### The City's Ambient Soundscape

**Default City Song (Healthy State):**
- Foundation: Walking bass line (double bass, steady 4/4)
- Layer 2: Brush drums on snare (soft, constant rhythm)
- Layer 3: Distant muted trumpet (playing long tones)
- Layer 4: Piano comping (sparse chords every few beats)

- Drums introduce dissonant crashes
- Trumpet goes sharp/flat, plays wrong notes
- Piano plays tritones and harsh clusters
- Ambient sounds become atonal, threatening
- Static and feedback creep in

**Combat Music Philosophy:**
- Combat starts with solo instrument (establishing theme)
- Each round adds another instrument (building ensemble)
- Boss phases trigger key changes or tempo shifts
- Player actions can be "scored" with musical stings
- Victory/defeat has proper musical resolution/dissonance

### Sergeant Brass
**Voice Reference:** Dragnet's Joe Friday with robotic undertones
**Direction:**
- Flat affect, procedural, by-the-book

- Impossible architecture (Escher stairs, etc.)
- Color bleeding between dimensions
- Sound and visuals mismatched
- Figures from other dimensions visible as ghosts/echoes

This creative brief should ensure a consistent, immersive noir-jazz aesthetic throughout the campaign. Every visual and audio element reinforces the theme: music as reality, improvisation as power, and beauty found in the shadows of a rain-soaked city that never sleeps.
