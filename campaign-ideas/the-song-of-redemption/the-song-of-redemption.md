### Core Premise
Shoya Ishida was a cruel child—a human fighter who tormented Shoko Nishimiya, a deaf girl who transferred to his elementary academy. He mocked her disability, destroyed her hearing aids, and led others in bullying her until she transferred away. Then the social tide turned: Shoya became the outcast, abandoned by friends, carrying guilt that grew into self-loathing. Years later, in high school, suicidal and planning to end his life, he decides to find Shoko one last time to apologize—to give his death meaning. But when he meets her again and sees that she's learned sign language to communicate, that she still tries to smile despite the pain he caused, everything changes. Instead of dying, he decides to live—to truly atone by helping her reconnect with people and find happiness. As he rebuilds his life, reconnects with old classmates, and gradually earns forgiveness, he falls in love with Shoko. But can someone who caused such pain be worthy of happiness? This is a story about disability, forgiveness, suicide prevention, and learning to love yourself again.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Apology (Sessions 1-3)**
- Flashback prologue: Young Shoya bullying Shoko. The aftermath when he became the outcast. Present day: Shoya is suicidal, planning to end it after making amends. He learns sign language basics, finds Shoko, and apologizes. She accepts with confusing grace. He decides to live instead. Returns money to his mother, begins attending school again. Meets old classmate Nagatsuka who befriends him.

**Act 2: Building Bridges (Sessions 4-7)**
- Shoya tries to help Shoko make friends and enjoy youth. They visit various places, Shoya learning more sign language. Other classmates from elementary school reappear: Ueno (still hostile to Shoko), Sahara (wants to reconnect), Kawai (dishonest about her role in bullying). Confronting the past is painful. Shoya's self-loathing battles with his growing feelings for Shoko. She's clearly developing feelings for him, but he feels unworthy.

**Act 3: The Festival and the Fall (Sessions 8-10)**
- The group plans to make a film together for the cultural festival. Old wounds resurface. A major confrontation where everyone's complicity in the bullying is exposed. Kawai's denial, Ueno's continued hostility, Shoya's self-loathing reaching a peak. Then the bridge scene: Shoko, overwhelmed by guilt for "causing" others pain, attempts suicide. Shoya saves her but is badly injured, falling into a coma.

**Act 4: Waking Up (Sessions 11-12)**
- While Shoya is in a coma, everyone must confront their feelings and guilt. Shoko is devastated. When Shoya wakes, his first concern is whether Shoko is safe. The group has changed—they've faced their own complicity and begun genuine healing. The cultural festival happens. At the finale, Shoko confesses her love through sign language. Shoya, finally believing he's allowed happiness, confesses back. The campaign ends with Shoya able to look people in the eyes again (he'd been avoiding eye contact all campaign due to guilt), hearing sounds clearly again (his guilt manifested as muffled hearing), and beginning a genuine relationship with Shoko—both of them healing together.

### Key Locations

- **The Bridge**: Multiple significant scenes occur here—meeting Shoko again, feeding koi, the suicide attempt.
- **The Academy**: Where present-day relationships develop and past trauma resurfaces.
- **Shoko's Home**: Where Shoya learns sign language and bonds with her family.
- **The Sign Language School**: Where lessons happen, symbolic of learning to communicate across barriers.
- **The Cultural Festival**: Where the final confrontations and resolutions occur.

### Central Conflict
Can someone who caused profound pain be forgiven? Can they forgive themselves? Is redemption possible, or is it selfish to seek happiness after hurting others? The struggle between guilt and hope, isolation and connection.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Sign Language System**: Shoko primarily communicates via sign language. Shoya must learn it (tracked as a skill). Miscommunications and gradual understanding are key story elements.
- **X Marks on Faces**: Shoya sees X marks on people's faces—a manifestation of his guilt making him unable to face people. As he builds genuine connections, the Xs disappear. Track this per NPC.
- **Muffled Hearing**: Shoya's guilt manifests as muffled, underwater-sounding audio. Important sounds barely break through. This lifts gradually as he heals.
- **Atonement Actions**: Track genuine acts of atonement vs. self-destructive guilt. True atonement helps others; guilt only hurts himself.
- **The Suicide Mechanics**: Handle with extreme care. Both Shoko and Shoya have suicidal ideation. Key moments involve preventing these tragedies through connection and showing life has value.
- **Confession Through Signs**: The final confession happens in sign language, which Shoya has learned—showing he's learned to communicate in her language, literally and metaphorically.
- **Healing Together**: Neither character "fixes" the other. They heal together, supporting each other through their respective traumas.
