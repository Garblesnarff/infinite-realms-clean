### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Drunken Master: Path of the Eight Drunkards**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**

    *   Detail the legend of the Eight Drunken Immortals and their fighting styles.
    *   Write Beggar So's backstory as a once-renowned master who fell into disgrace.
    *   Describe the relationship between Beggar So and Thunderleg (former master and student).
    *   Explain the philosophy of Zui Quan (Drunken Fist) - using unpredictability to overcome rigid technique.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Factions:**
    *   **Master Wong's School** - Goal: Maintain honor through proper training.
    *   **Thunderleg's School** - Goal: Prove traditional methods' superiority.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Beggar So's Hovel:**
        *   Landmarks: Training yard of broken objects, wine cellar (where final form is learned), improvised equipment.
        *   Encounters: Each of the eight training montages, Beggar So's drunken demonstrations.
    *   **Market Street (Training Ground):**
        *   Landmarks: Vendor stalls, hanging meats, pottery displays, restaurant with chairs and tables.
        *   Encounters: Environmental combat training, chase sequences, public humiliation.
    *   **The Final Arena:**
        *   Landmarks: Traditional fighting platform, but surrounded by props (poles, benches, weapons racks, audience).
        *   Encounters: Rematch with Thunderleg, using environment creatively.

**6. Causality Chains**
*   **IF:** Party masters all eight forms → Gain complete Drunken Style abilities.
*   **IF:** Party quits training early → Must face Thunderleg unprepared, likely losing again.
*   **IF:** Beggar So's past with Thunderleg is revealed → Changes the emotional weight of the final fight.
*   **IF:** Party fights Thunderleg using only traditional methods → They lose; only creativity wins.
*   **IF:** Party redeems Beggar So's honor → He gives up drinking and returns to teaching properly.
