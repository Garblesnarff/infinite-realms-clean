### **World-Building Specification Brief: Scales of Ma'at**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** When Set murders Osiris and scatters his soul across the Duat, the party—chosen by Anubis as agents of divine justice—must journey through the Egyptian underworld's perilous trials to recover the fragments before the cycle of death and resurrection ends forever, discovering that cosmic balance requires both order and chaos in proper measure rather than the dominance of either extreme.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

*   **The Twelve Gates of the Duat** - Sequential challenges through the underworld, each with guardian and test
*   **The Hall of Two Truths** - Chamber where hearts are weighed on Ma'at's scales against her feather

*   **The Red Desert** - Set's domain at the edge of order where chaos begins to dominate
*   **The Primordial Abyss** - Beyond all gates, where Apep dwells and reality dissolves into pre-creation
*   Each location represents different aspects of Egyptian death mythology and cosmic order

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF Osiris's ba fragments aren't recovered THEN the cycle of death and resurrection permanently ends
*   IF the party fails heart-weighing THEN Ammit devours their hearts and they face true death
*   IF Ma'at's scales remain corrupted THEN unjust souls escape punishment and righteous souls are condemned
*   IF Ra's solar barque is destroyed THEN the sun never rises and eternal darkness falls
*   IF Set is destroyed completely THEN pure order stagnates existence without growth or change
*   IF Osiris rules unopposed THEN eternal unchanging peace prevents all transformation
*   IF Apep wins THEN reality returns to primordial chaos before creation
*   IF the party learns all Book of the Dead spells THEN they navigate the Duat safely
*   IF they maintain Ma'at balance THEN both order and chaos serve creation properly
*   IF they ally with Isis THEN powerful magic aids them but attracts Set's full attention
*   IF Horus defeats Set THEN vengeance is served but cosmic balance may be lost
*   IF the party achieves true balance THEN they're offered choice of eternal life or divine service
*   IF mummification rites are disrupted THEN souls cannot properly navigate the afterlife
*   IF divine politics are navigated poorly THEN gods withdraw support or actively oppose the party
*   IF the cosmic balance tips too far THEN reality itself becomes unstable in mortal and divine realms
