## Additional Lore

### The Chrome Sickness Epidemic

Official statistics claim 1 in 10,000 chrome users develop Cyberpsychosis. Real number: 1 in 100. Corporations suppress data to maintain augmentation sales. MaxTac (police cyberpsycho hunters) exists because problem is far worse than admitted.

### The Net in This World

Different from Digital Resistance campaign—less abstract, more visceral. Cyberspace here resembles biological systems with chrome—veins of data, pulse of information, living network. Alt Cunningham exists here as digital ghost, warning of consciousness upload dangers.

### Nomad Culture

Outside Night City, nomad clans reject chrome and corporate control. Live free in Badlands, salvage and trade. Offer alternative path—leave city, stay human, survive without chrome. Some party members may choose this ending.

### MaxTac (Maximum Force Tactical Division)

Elite police unit hunting Cyberpsychos. Twist: MaxTac officers are controlled Cyberpsychos—fight fire with fire. Offer to party late campaign: Join MaxTac, become sanctioned monsters. Some may accept for power.

### The Urban Legend

Rumor of person with 100% chrome replacement who retained full humanity. Called "The Ghost of Night City"—unknown if real or myth. Represents hope that chrome and humanity aren't mutually exclusive. Late campaign reveal: It's Alt Cunningham before she died, proving it's possible.

This world is brutal, beautiful, and ultimately about the price we pay for power. Every augmentation is temptation—mechanical devil offering strength in exchange for soul. The campaign asks: How much of yourself would you sell? And at what point does the deal become permanent?
