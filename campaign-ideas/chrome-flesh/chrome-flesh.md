# Chrome Flesh
**"How much of yourself can you replace before you stop being you?"**

## Campaign Overview

Night City pulses with neon and opportunity—if you're willing to pay the price in flesh. In this world of radical augmentation, humanity has transcended biological limits through cybernetic enhancement. But every upgrade comes with a cost measured not in currency, but in something called Humanity: that indefinable spark separating person from machine.

The party are Edge Runners—cyberpunk mercenaries taking high-risk gigs in the shadows of mega-corporations. What starts as routine wetwork spirals into conspiracy when they discover ChromaTech, the city's largest augmentation manufacturer, is installing hidden programming in their newest line of military-grade cyberware. Users are being turned into sleeper agents without their knowledge, transformed into weapons waiting to be activated.

As the party investigates, they're offered increasingly powerful augmentations to survive escalating threats. Each upgrade makes them stronger, faster, more than human—but also less human. The central tension: do they maintain their humanity and remain weak, or sacrifice their souls for the power to win? And when Chrome Sickness comes—the inevitable madness of over-augmentation—who will they become?

## Core Themes

- **Body Horror**: Transformation of flesh into metal, voluntary and involuntary
- **Loss of Humanity**: What makes you "you" when everything biological is replaced?
- **Addiction**: Augmentation as drug—always chasing the next upgrade
- **Class Divide**: Rich get perfect chrome, poor get budget implants that kill them
- **Identity Crisis**: Are you still the same person? Do you want to be?
- **Transhumanism vs. Humanity**: Is evolution beyond flesh good or abomination?

## Unique Mechanics

### Humanity System

Every character starts with Humanity 100

**Humanity Loss:**
- Minor augmentation (eye, hand): -5 Humanity
- Major augmentation (arm, leg): -10 Humanity
- Serious augmentation (organs, spine): -15 Humanity
- Extreme augmentation (full limbs, skeletal): -20 Humanity
- Full-Body Conversion: -50 Humanity (one-way trip to edge)

**Humanity Effects:**
- 80-100: Normal human responses, empathy intact
- 60-79: Occasional emotional distance, harder to relate
- 40-59: Noticeable personality changes, aggression increases
- 20-39: Severe Chrome Sickness risk, violent tendencies
- 0-19: Cyberpsychosis imminent, lose character to madness

**Regaining Humanity:**
- Therapy sessions: +5 (max once per long rest)
- Meaningful relationships: +2 (genuine emotional connections)
- Removing augmentations: +50% of what was lost (painful, expensive, permanent stat loss)

**Cyberpsychosis Checks:**
- Trigger: Drop below 20 Humanity
- Roll WIS save (DC = 40 - current Humanity)
- Failure: Violent episode, attack nearest person (friend or foe)
- Duration: Until restrained/knocked out or passed new save

### Augmentation System

**Categories:**

1. **Cyberoptics** (Eyes)
   - Thermal vision, zoom, targeting assist
   - Analysis software, scanner integration

2. **Cyberarms** (Arms/Hands)
   - Superhuman strength, retractable weapons
   - Tool integration, hacking ports

3. **Cyberlegs** (Legs/Feet)
   - Enhanced speed, super-jumps
   - Hidden weapons, skate systems

4. **Neuralware** (Brain/Nervous System)
   - Reflexes, interface capability
   - Memory expansion, skill chips

5. **Immunosystem** (Organs)
   - Poison/disease resistance
   - Second heart, toxin filters

6. **Dermal Armor** (Skin)
   - Subdermal plating, reactive weave
   - Natural armor, increased durability

**Augmentation Tiers:**
- **Street Chrome**: Cheap, obvious, unreliable
- **Corporate Grade**: Quality, effective, expensive
- **Military Spec**: Superior, restricted, very expensive
- **Prototype**: Experimental, unstable, priceless

### Chrome Compatibility

Not all augmentations work together:
- Installing conflicting chrome requires surgery
- Mixing brands causes reduced efficiency
- Prototype chrome may reject other implants
- Full-Body Conversion replaces everything, blank slate

### Manchurian Protocol Detection

Party must check chrome for hidden code:
- Requires hacking skills or friendly Netrunner
- Each piece inspected takes time
- Corporate chrome most likely compromised
- Street chrome usually safe but inferior
- Can be removed or countermeasures installed

## Plot Twists & Complications

1. **Doc Mercy's Secret**: She's been installing tracking devices in party's chrome to protect them—but now corp can use those to find them

2. **Viktor's Sacrifice**: Mentor figure goes full chrome to save party, loses humanity completely, becomes enemy

3. **Rogue's Betrayal**: The Fixer was Saburo's lover, still has feelings, trying to bring him back to humanity—but uses party as pawns

4. **One PC is Compromised**: A party member unknowingly has Manchurian Protocol, activates at worst moment

5. **Alt's True Nature**: Rogue AI isn't helping party—she's trying to escape Net into physical world using their bodies

6. **Adam Smasher's Humanity**: The monster reveals he chose chrome not for power but to escape emotional pain—tragic villain

7. **Dr. Kaine's Gambit**: He's building his own Project Godhead to include only willing participants—is he better or same?

8. **Cyberpsychosis is Fake**: Chrome Sickness is actually corporate-induced to control augmentation market—artificial problem, profitable solution

9. **The Animals Were Right**: Bio-modding faction achieves everything chrome does without losing humanity—party chose wrong path

10. **You're Already Digital**: Mid-campaign reveal that party died in Session 1, current existence is uploaded consciousness—everything's been simulation

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Optimal Victory:**
- Destroy Project Godhead with High Humanity (60+)
- Expose ChromaTech, survive with relationships intact
- Find balance between human and augmented
- Night City freed from corporate mind control

**Standard Victory:**
- Stop Project Godhead through any means
- Medium Humanity (40-59), some personality changes
- Relationships strained but surviving
- Night City scarred but functioning

**Pyrrhic Victory:**
- Stop enemy but at terrible cost
- Low Humanity (20-39), barely human
- Relationships destroyed, isolation
- Became monsters fighting monsters

**Defeat:**
- Total Chrome Sickness, party lost to madness
- Project Godhead succeeds, consciousness harvested
- Corporate victory, city under total control
- Party dies or worse—uploaded against will

This campaign explores transhumanism's dark side—the price of power, the value of humanity, and the question of whether evolution beyond flesh is transcendence or destruction. It should feel visceral, uncomfortable, and deeply personal as players literally sacrifice pieces of themselves for strength.
