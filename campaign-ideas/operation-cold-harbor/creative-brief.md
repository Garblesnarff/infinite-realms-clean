# Creative Brief: Operation Cold Harbor

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Desolate Arctic Realism with Body Horror

Inspired by John Carpenter's The Thing and Antarctic expedition photography, this style combines the stark beauty of polar landscapes with grotesque biomechanical horror. The contrast between pristine white ice and horrific organic corruption creates visceral unease.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Isolation Through Environment:** Endless white landscapes, darkness for months, a single outpost against infinity.
*   **Body Horror Grotesquery:** The Thing's transformations blend multiple bodies, animals, and alien biology into nightmare fuel.
*   **Harsh Realism:** The environment and characters are rendered realistically, making the horror more jarring.
*   **Firelight and Darkness:** Fire is safety and weapon. Darkness hides monsters and paranoia.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Paranoia, isolation, body horror, Antarctic, shapeshifter, bleak, cold, fire vs ice, mistrust, grotesque.
*   **Feeling:** Alone at the end of the world with something inhuman that wears human faces. The cold will kill you, but so will your companions—if they're still your companions.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic human figures and Arctic environment. Thing-creatures are horrifically organic—wet, irregular, incorporating multiple body parts into impossible configurations.
*   **Textures:** Ice and snow (pristine, harsh), human skin (weathered by cold), Thing biomass (wet, pulsating, covered in teeth and eyes), fabric and metal of the outpost.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic illustration of an Antarctic research outpost at night. The building is a prefab structure covered in frost and snow, lit from within by harsh fluorescent light. In the foreground, a figure in a parka stands with a flamethrower, their breath visible in the extreme cold."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by cold blues and whites for environment. Warm oranges and yellows only from fire and interior lights. The Thing's biomass is sickly reds, pinks, and yellows of exposed muscle and alien tissue.
*   **Accent Colors:** The orange of flamethrower fire, the red of blood on white snow, the green-yellow of alien ichor.
*   **Emotional Effect:** The cold is oppressive. Fire represents life and safety. Thing-corruption is warm in the worst way—feverish and diseased.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by cold pale blues and harsh whites of Antarctic landscape. The only warmth comes from the orange glow of fire and interior lights. In contrast, the Thing's exposed biomass shows sickly reds, wet pinks, and yellows of muscle and alien tissue."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic humans in Arctic gear—heavy parkas, fur-lined hoods, goggles, practical survival equipment. As sessions progress, characters look more haggard—frostbite, exhaustion, paranoia in their eyes.
*   **The Thing (Human Form):** Perfectly imitates victims, but players can include subtle wrongness—too-perfect smile, eyes that don't blink enough, slight movement delays.
*   **The Thing (Revealed):** Nightmarish biomechanical horror—multiple heads, tentacles lined with teeth, bodies split open revealing alien anatomy, spider legs erupting from torsos, all wet and glistening.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A research team member in Arctic gear, but something is subtly wrong. Their eyes are too steady, their movements slightly delayed as if remote-controlled. Behind them in the shadows, their true form writhes—a mass of human and dog parts fused with alien tentacles and teeth, wet with ichor and blood."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic Arctic: endless flat ice plains, perpetual darkness or twilight, the outpost a tiny island of warmth in infinite cold.
*   **Interior:** Cramped, functional, industrial—metal walls, fluorescent lighting, propane heaters, equipment everywhere.
*   **Details:** Ice crystals forming on everything, breath visible, frost patterns on windows, blood freezing instantly on snow, shadows that might be movement or paranoia.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The interior of an Arctic research station. Metal walls covered in frost, harsh overhead lighting creating stark shadows. Equipment and supplies line the walls. Through a window, complete darkness and swirling snow. Around a table, team members eye each other with open suspicion, each holding weapons or makeshift defenses."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Extreme contrast. Outside: flat, diffuse light during twilight; absolute darkness at night broken only by flashlights. Inside: harsh fluorescent creating deep shadows. Fire creates dancing, chaotic light.
*   **Shadows:** Essential for paranoia. Is that shadow a person, a Thing, or nothing?
*   **Purpose:** Light is safety and revelation. Darkness hides horror. Fire is both weapon and beacon.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the orange glow of a flamethrower cutting through absolute Arctic darkness. The fire reveals a grotesque Thing-creature transforming—human body splitting apart to reveal tentacles and multiple heads. Beyond the firelight, complete darkness. Snow swirls in the wind."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Use wide shots to emphasize isolation—tiny figures against vast white landscapes. Tight shots on faces showing paranoia and fear. Extreme close-ups on Thing-transformation body horror.
*   **Techniques:** Frame characters separated by physical barriers (doorways, windows) emphasizing isolation and mistrust. Show blood tests, weapons, and fire prominently as survival tools.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of an Antarctic outpost at night—a tiny cluster of lights against an infinite plain of white under a starless sky. In the mid-ground, two figures face each other, weapons drawn, clearly mistrusting. In the extreme foreground, icy ground shows drops of blood that could be human or something else."

## Voice

A harsh, weary male voice with a Midwestern American accent, gravelly from cold and strain. The tone is that of someone at the end of their rope—clipped words, long pauses, the sound of someone conserving warmth and energy. Early sessions have some dry humor and camaraderie; later sessions are pure exhaustion and paranoia. The pacing is slow and deliberate, like someone very cold trying to conserve energy. Emotion shifts from professional competence to naked suspicion to grim determination. Audio includes environmental sounds: howling wind, generator hum, crackling fire, the roar of flamethrowers, and silence—long stretches of terrible silence. Role: The last survivor, documenting events, unsure if they're still human or if the Thing got them too and is wearing their skin.
