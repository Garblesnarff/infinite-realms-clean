### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Oath of the Forgotten**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party awakens as young souls reborn in a ruined city, raised by three ancient undead—Blood the skeleton warrior, Mary the ghost priestess, and Gus the mummy sorcerer—who love them as true children despite their cursed forms. As they grow, the party discovers their family is bound by divine punishment for an ancient act of mercy, waiting for "the one who will bring grace." They must uncover the truth, choose whether to accept divine oaths, and decide what it means to bring light to a place shrouded in death.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Age of Heroes, when Blood, Mary, and Gus served the gods as champions of light.
    *   Write the history of the Plague War, when the trio chose to break divine quarantine to save a city, dooming themselves but saving thousands.
    *   Describe the curse of the City of the Dead, where the three were killed and bound as undead guardians until a worthy successor arose.
    *   Explain Gracefeel's dual nature as goddess of both the gentle light of life and the peaceful darkness of death.
    *   Detail the demon lord Stagnate and his philosophy of eternal, meaningless existence—undeath without grace.
    *   Write about the prophecy of "the ones who will bring grace to the graceless," interpreted by the church as future champions.
    *   Describe how the church of Gracefeel became more dogmatic over centuries, losing sight of the goddess's merciful nature.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Undead Family (Blood, Mary, Gus)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Raise the party to be worthy champions, break their curse, and pass on peacefully.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Equals bound by love and shared punishment. Blood handles combat training, Mary handles faith and healing, Gus handles knowledge and magic.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—they're isolated in the ruins, believed to be mindless undead.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They desperately hope the party is "the one" but love them regardless of destiny.
        *   **Assets:** Ancient combat skills, divine knowledge, powerful magic, and infinite patience.
        *   **Relationships:** Bound to the City of the Dead; opposed by Stagnate; watched by Gracefeel.

        *   **Goals:** Guide souls between life and death, oppose demonic corruption, maintain divine law.
        *   **Hierarchy:** High priests and bishops, with clergy, paladins, and clerics serving beneath.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Serve the goddess and help souls find peace.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The leadership has become dogmatic, prioritizing law over mercy—the opposite of Gracefeel's true teachings.
        *   **Assets:** Temples across the land, holy warriors, healing magic, political influence.
        *   **Relationships:** Officially oppose all undead; split between dogmatic (Bishop Ethelbald) and merciful priests.
    *   **Stagnate's Cult** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Spread meaningless undeath, corrupt souls to serve Stagnate, and claim the City of the Dead.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Stagnate at the top, with corrupted priests and necromancers serving him.
        *   **Public Agenda:** (Hidden) Infiltrate society as normal merchants and officials.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Create undeath without grace—eternal suffering and service to their demon lord.
        *   **Assets:** Necromantic magic, corrupted souls, demonic power, and infiltrators in multiple towns.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposed by Gracefeel's church and the party; seeking to corrupt or destroy the undead family.
    *   **The Common Folk** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Live peaceful lives, avoid supernatural threats, maintain traditions.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal hierarchy—mayors, guild leaders, and community elders.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Peace and prosperity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many are terrified of the ruins and the undead, but some remember the old heroes fondly.
        *   **Assets:** Community strength, local knowledge, trade goods.
        *   **Relationships:** Suspicious of undead; respectful of Gracefeel's church; grateful to helpful adventurers.
