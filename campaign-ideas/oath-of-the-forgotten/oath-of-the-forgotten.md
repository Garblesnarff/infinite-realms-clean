The party awakens as young souls reborn in the ruins of a dead city, with no memory of their past lives. They are raised by three ancient undead—Blood the skeleton warrior, Mary the ghost priestess, and Gus the mummy sorcerer—who teach them combat, faith, and magic with genuine parental love despite their cursed forms. As the party grows, they discover their undead family is bound by an ancient tragedy and divine punishment, tasked with waiting for "the one who will bring grace" to these forsaken ruins. The party must uncover the truth of their family's past, choose whether to accept a divine oath, and decide what it means to bring light to a place shrouded in death.

## Difficulty Context

**Medium Difficulty**: This campaign balances emotional storytelling with tactical combat. Challenges come from moral choices, investigation, and increasingly dangerous undead and demonic threats. Players must manage resources carefully while protecting those they care about. Combat encounters scale appropriately but require strategy, and the emotional weight of decisions creates meaningful difficulty beyond mechanics.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8 sessions)

A tale of family, duty, and bringing grace to a forsaken place.

*   **Act I — Childhood in the Ruins (Sessions 1-3):** The party grows up in the City of the Dead, learning from their undead family. Blood teaches them swordsmanship and honor, Mary teaches them faith and healing, and Gus teaches them magic and knowledge. They explore the ruins, fight weak undead threats, and slowly learn that their family is hiding a great sorrow. The act culminates when the party comes of age, and Blood, Mary, and Gus reveal the truth: they are criminals cursed for an ancient betrayal, bound to these ruins until their sentence is fulfilled.
*   **Act II — The Divine Test (Sessions 4-6):** The party ventures beyond the ruins for the first time, entering a world that fears and hates the undead. They must navigate living society while protecting the secret of their upbringing. They encounter servants of the gods—particularly Gracefeel, Goddess of Light and Undeath—who test whether the party is worthy of breaking their family's curse. The party must prove themselves as champions of the oppressed, facing cultists who worship demonic lords and corrupt nobles who exploit the weak.
*   **Act III — Grace and Goodbye (Sessions 7-8):** The party returns to the ruins to face an ancient demon lord who seeks to claim the City of the Dead as a stronghold. They must defend their home and family in an epic battle. The climax involves the party taking divine oaths to become true paladins of Gracefeel, which will finally break their family's curse—but at the cost of their undead family's continued existence. The campaign ends with a bittersweet farewell as Blood, Mary, and Gus finally pass on, proud of the heroes their children have become.

    *   Blood, Mary, and Gus explain they will raise the party in this safe haven, teaching them everything they need to survive.
    *   The party begins training: Blood teaches combat, Mary teaches prayers and healing, Gus teaches arcane knowledge.
    *   First dungeon: exploring a safe wing of the ruins, fighting mindless skeletons and zombies while learning the basics.
    *   Evening scenes of domestic life: Mary's ghostly cooking (which creates actual food through divine magic), Gus's bedtime stories about heroes, Blood's gruff but caring advice.
*   **Escalation:** The party sees their undead family members occasionally stare at them with deep sadness, whispering "Will you be the one?"

### Session 2 — "Lessons of the Dead"
*   **Focus:** Training / Bonding
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Time-skip montage of the party growing and training over several years (advancing to level 3).
    *   Blood teaches advanced combat techniques and the warrior's code of honor.
    *   Mary teaches prayers to Gracefeel, explaining that death is not evil—it's a transition, and the goddess watches over both living and dead.
    *   Gus teaches the history of the world, carefully avoiding certain topics about the ruins.
    *   The party fights progressively stronger undead threats in the ruins, including intelligent wights who recognize Blood and flee in fear.
    *   Bonding scenes: Mary singing lullabies with her ghostly voice, Gus crafting the party their first real weapons, Blood teaching them under the stars.
*   **Escalation:** The party finds a sealed temple deep in the ruins. Blood forbids them from entering, his usual calm breaking into fear.

### Session 3 — "The Truth of the Fallen"
*   **Focus:** Revelation / Choice
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party comes of age (level 4). Blood, Mary, and Gus gather them for a serious conversation.
    *   They reveal the truth: they were once heroes who served the gods but committed a terrible crime. They betrayed their divine oaths to save mortal lives, choosing mercy over law.
    *   As punishment, they were killed and cursed to exist as undead, bound to these ruins until "one blessed by Gracefeel" releases them.
    *   They raised the party hoping they might be worthy of the goddess's blessing, but they love the party as true children regardless.
    *   The sealed temple contains the divine trial that could break the curse—but only if the party chooses to take it.
    *   Emotional choice: does the party attempt the trial now, or wait until they're stronger? Either way, they must prove themselves worthy.
*   **Escalation:** A powerful demon, Stagnate the Eternal, senses the seal weakening and begins to move toward the ruins.

### Session 4 — "Into the Living World"
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Culture Shock
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party ventures beyond the ruins for the first time, entering the nearest human settlement.
    *   Culture shock: they've only known undead family, so living people are strange. Their knowledge comes from old books and Gus's stories.
    *   They must hide that they were raised by undead—the church of Gracefeel is respected, but undead are feared and hated.
    *   The party takes on quests to help the town: clearing bandits, healing sick villagers, solving a murder mystery.
    *   They meet a priest of Gracefeel who senses something special about the party and gives them a cryptic message about "bringing grace to the graceless."
*   **Escalation:** A cult dedicated to the demon lord Stagnate is operating in the town, seeking to create undead servants.

### Session 5 — "The Cult of Eternal Stagnation"
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party investigates the cult, discovering they're kidnapping people to create undead slaves.
    *   Major dungeon: the cult's hideout beneath the town, filled with bound spirits and flesh constructs.
    *   Boss fight: the cult leader, a fallen priest who worships Stagnate, who transforms into a grotesque undead abomination.
    *   The party rescues the captured townspeople and discovers the cult's goal: summon Stagnate to claim the City of the Dead.
    *   After the battle, a divine vision: Gracefeel appears, testing the party's worthiness with riddles and challenges of faith.
*   **Escalation:** Gracefeel reveals that Blood, Mary, and Gus's curse will soon end—either by the party's ascension or by Stagnate's conquest. Time is running out.

### Session 6 — "The Trial of Grace"
*   **Focus:** Divine Test / Character Development
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party undertakes a sacred pilgrimage to three shrines of Gracefeel, each testing a different virtue.
    *   Shrine of Swords (Blood's virtue): Test of courage and honor in combat against celestial champions.
    *   Shrine of Mercy (Mary's virtue): Test of compassion, must save corrupt souls from demonic possession without killing the hosts.
    *   Shrine of Wisdom (Gus's virtue): Test of knowledge and judgment, solving ancient magical riddles with real consequences.
    *   Each trial reveals more about their undead family's past: they chose to save a village from a plague by breaking quarantine, defying the gods' law to prevent greater suffering.
    *   The party learns that their family's "crime" was choosing compassion over dogma—the very thing Gracefeel secretly honors.
*   **Escalation:** Completing the trials marks the party as Gracefeel's chosen, but it also signals to Stagnate that his time to strike is now.

### Session 7 — "The Demon Comes"
*   **Focus:** Defense / Family
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party returns to the ruins to find Stagnate's forces besieging their home.

    *   Touching moments between battles: Blood teaching one last sword technique, Mary's final prayer, Gus's last story about heroes who sacrifice for love.
    *   The family reveals their full power, no longer holding back, showing the legendary heroes they once were.
    *   The sealed temple opens, revealing the source of the city's death: an ancient battleground where the family made their final stand.
*   **Escalation:** Stagnate himself arrives, a demon lord of immense power, seeking to corrupt the ruins and the party.

### Session 8 — "Grace and Goodbye"
*   **Focus:** Final Battle / Resolution
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Epic final battle against Stagnate in the heart of the ruins.
    *   The party must use everything they've learned from their family: Blood's courage, Mary's faith, Gus's wisdom.
    *   Mid-battle, the party has the choice to take their divine oaths to become true paladins of Gracefeel, gaining immense power.
    *   If they do, divine grace floods the ruins, banishing Stagnate and breaking the curse.
    *   Blood, Mary, and Gus begin to fade as the curse lifts, finally able to pass on to their eternal rest.
    *   Final scenes: tearful goodbyes, each family member giving the party a final gift and blessing.
    *   Blood: "You've become finer warriors than I ever was. Protect those who cannot protect themselves."
    *   Mary: "Remember, death is not the end. We will meet again in grace."
    *   Gus: "You have become the story I always wanted to tell. Live well."
    *   The three fade into light, their curse broken, leaving the party as the new guardians of the city.
*   **Resolution:** The City of the Dead becomes the City of Grace, a sanctuary where the party helps lost souls find peace. They are true paladins now, carrying their family's love forward.

4.  **Gracefeel, Goddess of Light and Undeath** — *The Twilight Divinity*
    *   **Role:** A goddess who represents the transition between life and death, neither fully light nor dark.

## Key Locations

1.  **The City of the Dead:**
    *   Ancient ruins where the party grows up. Once a beautiful city, now broken and haunted. The central temple is sealed with divine magic. Inhabited only by mindless undead, the party's family, and eventually the party themselves. A place of melancholy beauty—crumbling statues, overgrown gardens, eternal twilight.

2.  **The Sealed Temple of Gracefeel:**
    *   The heart of the ruins, where Blood, Mary, and Gus made their final stand. Contains the divine trial that can break their curse. Filled with memories of the past, celestial guardians, and the truth of what happened.

3.  **The Town of Whitesail:**
    *   The first living settlement the party encounters. A prosperous trade town with a temple to Gracefeel. Initially welcoming, it hides the demon cult in its shadows. Represents normal society that the party must learn to navigate.

4.  **The Three Shrines of Grace:**
    *   Sacred sites scattered across the land: the Shrine of Swords (mountaintop fortress), Shrine of Mercy (hidden grove), and Shrine of Wisdom (underwater temple). Each tests a different virtue and reveals truths about the past.

5.  **The Demon Gate:**
    *   A weakened seal near the City of the Dead where Stagnate's forces emerge. A place of corruption where reality itself begins to rot. The party must prevent it from fully opening.

6.  **The Cathedral of Eternal Light:**
    *   The main temple of Gracefeel's church, where Bishop Ethelbald presides. A place of beauty and rigid law, representing organized religion's strengths and flaws.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of family, duty, and what it means to bring grace to a dark world. The central conflict is not just defeating a demon lord, but understanding that those we love may leave us, and that's okay—their love and lessons remain. The party must choose between preserving their family's existence (keeping them as undead) or granting them peace (letting them pass on). It's about growing up, accepting responsibility, and honoring those who raised us by living well.

The campaign challenges players with the question: what do we owe those who loved us, and how do we say goodbye?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Family Bonds**
*   The party's connection to Blood, Mary, and Gus provides unique benefits that reflect their teachings.
*   **Mechanics:** Each party member chooses one "family mentor" at the start. This grants them access to special abilities:
    *   **Blood's Teachings:** Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 HP, you can instead drop to 1 HP and gain temporary HP equal to your level. Blood's voice encourages you: "Stand up. You're stronger than this."
    *   **Mary's Teachings:** You can spend one use of your healing ability to grant a dead creature a final moment of peace—they can speak one last message to their loved ones before passing on.
    *   **Gus's Teachings:** Once per long rest, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Arcana check, you can reroll it with advantage as you remember one of Gus's lessons.
*   These abilities fade after the family passes on, but are replaced by permanent stat bonuses (+2 to related ability score) as the party internalizes their lessons.

### 2. **Grace Points**
*   The party earns Grace Points by showing compassion, mercy, and wisdom in difficult situations.
*   **Mechanics:** The DM awards 1 Grace Point when the party:
    *   Shows mercy to an enemy who deserves punishment
    *   Protects the innocent at personal cost
    *   Solves a problem through compassion rather than violence
    *   Honors the dead properly
*   Grace Points can be spent to:
    *   Automatically succeed on a death saving throw (1 point)
    *   Turn a critical hit against you into a normal hit (2 points)
    *   Purify a possessed or corrupted creature without killing them (3 points)
    *   Call upon Gracefeel's direct intervention in a moment of desperate need (5 points)
*   Maximum Grace Points: 10. They carry over between sessions.

### 3. **The Divine Oath**
*   At the climax, party members can choose to become true paladins by swearing an oath to Gracefeel.
*   **Mechanics:** When a character takes the oath, they:
    *   Gain the benefits of a Paladin's Oath (DM chooses most appropriate: Devotion, Redemption, or custom Oath of Grace)
    *   Immediately gain one level in Paladin (even if multiclassing)
    *   Their weapons become permanently blessed, dealing radiant damage to fiends and undead
    *   They can cast Gentle Repose at will
*   The cost: taking the oath triggers the curse's end, meaning their family will pass on. This is a powerful moment of character growth and sacrifice.

### 4. **Undead Nature Insight**
*   Having been raised by undead, the party has unique understanding of the unliving.
*   **Mechanics:** Party members have advantage on:
    *   Insight checks against undead creatures
    *   Persuasion checks to communicate with intelligent undead
    *   Investigation checks to understand undead motives and weaknesses
*   Additionally, mindless undead do not automatically attack the party unless provoked or commanded to do so—they recognize something familiar in the party's presence.
*   This makes the party uniquely suited to redeeming corrupted souls and understanding that not all undead are evil.
