# The Maid of Orleans
*When God chooses a shepherd girl to save a kingdom, will you answer the call?*

## Campaign Overview

In the darkest hour of the Hundred Years' War, when France is divided, occupied, and leaderless, a seventeen-year-old illiterate peasant girl from Lorraine hears voices. Saints Catherine, Margaret, and Michael speak to her, commanding her to lift the siege of Orleans, crown the Dauphin at Reims, and drive the English from France. Against all reason, against all probability, she will succeed—until betrayal, capture, and the fires of the Inquisition claim her.

The party are Companions of the Maid—soldiers, believers, skeptics, and protectors drawn to Jeanne d'Arc's impossible mission. Some believe she's truly divinely inspired, others think she's mad but useful, still others suspect darker forces at work. Together, they'll fight alongside France's greatest heroine through miraculous victories and crushing defeats, political intrigue and battlefield glory, divine visions and very human failings.

This campaign explores faith versus doubt, destiny versus free will, and the price of martyrdom. Can the party save Jeanne from her historical fate? Should they? And if she dies, what happens to France, to faith, and to the legacy of the Maid who heard God's voice?

## Core Themes

- **Divine Calling vs. Human Doubt**: Are the voices real, or is Jeanne deluded? Does it matter?
- **Peasant Power**: An illiterate girl commanding hardened soldiers—impossible yet true
- **Gender and Authority**: Woman in armor leading men in deeply patriarchal society
- **Faith as Weapon**: Belief can inspire miracles—or lead to flames
- **Martyrdom and Legacy**: Sometimes dying young creates immortality
- **Political Manipulation**: Everyone uses Jeanne—Church, King, English, Burgundians

## Campaign Notes

This campaign explores faith, gender, power, and martyrdom through one of history's most fascinating figures. Jeanne is simultaneously empowered and victimized by her voices, her gender, and her class. The party must navigate genuine belief, political cynicism, and moral complexity.

Key tension: Should the party save Jeanne from historical fate? Her death created her legend. Living might mean obscurity. Is glorious martyrdom better than quiet survival? Let players struggle with this.

The voices are deliberately ambiguous. DM can make them genuinely divine, psychological manifestations, demonic deception, or something else. What matters is how Jeanne and party respond to them.

Gender dynamics: Jeanne in armor commanding men was shocking in 1429. Campaign should respectfully explore medieval attitudes while celebrating her breaking barriers. She's not modern feminist (anachronistic) but genuinely revolutionary figure in historical context.

Religious sensitivity: Campaign deals with Catholic theology, saints, heresy. Handle respectfully. Not all clergy are villains; not all are heroes. Medieval theology was complex, not just "corrupt Church."

The trial scenes can be played as intense roleplay—Jeanne's actual responses to questions are historically documented and brilliant. Use them.

Recommended level: Start at 3rd level (experienced but not heroes yet), reach 12-15th by campaign end. Divine magic should feature prominently—clerics, paladins fit perfectly. Canonically, Jeanne never killed anyone herself (carried banner, not sword in battle)—interesting character choice.

Length: 45+ sessions for full life and aftermath, or 38 for execution ending, or fewer for tighter focused campaign on single arc (just Orleans, just Trial, etc.).

Historical consultants: Refer to trial transcripts (available in English), Mark Twain's *Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc* (fictionalized but deeply researched), Marina Warner's *Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism*.
