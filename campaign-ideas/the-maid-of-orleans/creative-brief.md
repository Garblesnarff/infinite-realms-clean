# The Maid of Orleans - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

### Overall Aesthetic
**Medieval Illumination Meets Historical Realism**
- Grounded 15th century France with touches of the divine
- Inspired by: Medieval illuminated manuscripts, Pre-Raphaelite paintings of Joan, historical tapestries, films like *The Passion of Joan of Arc* (Dreyer, 1928)
- Contrast between muddy brutal reality of medieval warfare and golden divine visions
- As campaign progresses, visuals shift from hopeful pastorals to dark imprisonment

### Character Design

**Jeanne d'Arc**
- Age 17-19, short dark hair (cut like bowl-cut page boy)
- Simple peasant features, not classically beautiful but radiant with conviction
- Early: Peasant dress (simple wool, earth tones)
- Mid: White armor (historically accurate plate), red and blue surcoat
- Late: Prison garb, then white shift for execution
- Never sexualized—armor is functional, not form-fitting fantasy
- Expressive face—everything shows (doubt, faith, pain, joy, terror)
- Iconic elements: White banner with "Jesus-Maria", sword from Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois

**The Companions (Player Characters)**
- Mix of social classes: Nobles, soldiers, peasants who join her cause
- Weathered by Hundred Years' War—scarred, tired, desperate
- Equipment evolution: Starts ragged → French royal livery → battle-worn glory
- Cultural markers: French fleur-de-lis vs. English leopards
- Diverse roles: Knights, archers, priests, physicians

**French Forces**
- Demoralized at start: Patched armor, poor equipment, defeated posture
- Transformation: Jeanne's presence visibly improves morale, equipment, bearing
- Soldiers initially mock, then revere her
- Visual progression: Broken army → confident force

**English Forces**
- Well-equipped, professional, disciplined
- Confident at start, increasingly fearful of "the witch"
- Red cross of St. George on white background
- Not villains—just soldiers for their king
- Terror of Jeanne visible in body language

**Clergy**
- Bishops in elaborate vestments, mitres
- Dominican inquisitors in black and white habits
- Contrast: Humble village priests vs. political prelates
- Pierre Cauchon: Gaunt, severe, convinced of righteousness

### Environment Design

**Domrémy (Pastoral France)**
- Rolling green hills, gentle streams
- Half-timbered peasant cottages
- Village church: Small, simple, sacred

**War-Torn Countryside**
- Burned villages, refugees fleeing
- Muddy roads, autumn rains
- Hundred Years' War devastation visible everywhere

**Chinon Castle**

## Music and Sound Design

### Musical Themes

**Jeanne's Theme (The Voice of God)**
- Instrument: Solo female voice (no words, vocalise), joined by choir
- Character: Pure, ascending, hopeful, transcendent
- Evolution: Starts simple (peasant girl), grows complex (mission), becomes ethereal (martyrdom)
- Leitmotif: Three-note ascending phrase (representing Trinity, three saints)
- Variations:
  - Innocent (flute and voice)
  - Martial (voice with drums and brass)
  - Sorrowful (voice alone, minor key)
  - Triumphant (full choir and orchestra)
  - Transcendent (voice fading into divine silence)

**The Divine Voices Theme**
- Instrument: Ethereal choir (children's voices?), glass harmonica, Ondes Martenot (or similar eerie beauty)
- Character: Otherworldly, neither entirely comforting nor frightening
- Ambiguous: Could be holy or uncanny
- No clear melody—voices speak/sing words
- Effect: Uncertain whether divine or madness

**French Hope/Despair Theme**
- Instrument: Medieval instruments (lute, vielle, shawm), male chorus
- Character: Starts mournful (defeated France), becomes triumphant (victories)
- Folk melody base—music of the people
- Variations reflect national morale
- Returns to mournful after Jeanne's death, slowly rises again (her legacy)

**English Power Theme**
- Instrument: Military drums, brass, martial organ
- Character: Powerful, disciplined, increasingly anxious
- Not evil—professional, orderly
- Disruption when facing Jeanne (wrong notes, hesitation)
- Represents order challenged by divine chaos

**The Trial Theme**
- Instrument: Church organ (dark registration), male choir (Latin chant)
- Character: Oppressive, labyrinthine, theological weight
- Represents Church's power to define truth
- Counterpoint: Jeanne's simple theme vs. complex theological argument
- Resolution: Either crushed by organ or transcending it

**Battle Music**
- Heavy percussion (war drums), brass fanfares
- French victories: Chaotic but triumphant, inspired
- English defeats: Organized retreat turning to rout
- Jeanne's presence: Her theme over battle chaos
- Specific battles have unique signatures:
  - Orléans: Building from desperate to victorious
  - Patay: Swift, decisive, shocking reversal
  - Paris: Martial to mournful (defeat)

### Sound Design

**Divine Manifestations**
- Saint's voices: Layered female voices, slightly unnatural resonance
- Appear with sound cues: Bells (Catherine), whisper-wind (Margaret), trumpet (Michael)
- Ambiguous: Could be real or psychosis (mixing real sounds with supernatural)
- Party members may or may not hear them (DM's choice)

**Medieval Combat**
- Armor clinking, creaking
- Swords on armor (ringing impacts)
- Crossbow bolts: Thunk into wood, whistle in flight
- Cannons: Primitive, loud, unreliable
- Jeanne never uses weapon—no personal kill sounds
- Her banner snapping in wind—rallying sound

**Siege Warfare**
- Battering rams: Rhythmic pounding
- Scaling ladders: Wood scraping stone
- Boiling oil: Screams, sizzling
- Arrows: Hundreds in volley, rain of death
- Jeanne wounded: Gasp, but continues—no extended pain sounds (she's stoic)

**Church and Trial**
- Cathedral acoustics: Vast, reverberant
- Latin chant echoing
- Trial chamber: Close, oppressive, every word audible
- Theological debate: Voices overlapping, trap questions
- Jeanne's responses: Clear, simple, cutting through complexity

**Execution**
- Crowd murmur (some hostile, some sympathetic)
- Wood crackling, flames roaring
- Jeanne's voice: Calling "Jesus!" (historically documented)
- Silence after—profound absence
- Wind carrying ashes

**Environmental Ambience**
- Domrémy: Birds, stream, sheep, church bells
- Battlefield: Distant combat, wounded moaning, camp sounds
- Court: Whispered intrigue, footsteps on stone
- Prison: Dripping water, chains, guards' boots
- Execution day: Rain (often reported), crowd, solemn drums

### Adaptive Music System

**Faith Meter**
- Player/party faith level affects music
- High faith: Divine themes prominent, clear, beautiful
- Low faith: Divine themes distorted, uncertain, possibly sinister
- Jeanne's presence always brings her theme regardless

**Battle Morale**
- French morale determines victory music timing
- Jeanne's participation boosts musical intensity
- Defeats mute triumphant themes

**Historical Inevitability**
- As approach execution date, music becomes more elegiac
- Even victories tinged with sorrow (foreshadowing)
- Unless party changes history—then music opens up, uncertain but hopeful
