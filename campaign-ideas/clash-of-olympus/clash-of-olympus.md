## Central Conflict

Divine hubris versus mortal heroism. The Olympian gods defeated the Titans through courage and unity, but millennia of power has corrupted them—they're petty, cruel, and manipulative. The Titans represent the old order, brutal but honest. The party, as demigods, exists between these extremes. They must decide if the world is better served by preserving the flawed Olympian order, allowing the Titans to reclaim power, or creating something new where heroes and mortals have agency rather than being pawns of divine whims.
