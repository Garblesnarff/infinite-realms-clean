## Art Style: Classical Greek Heroism meets Epic Fantasy

Blend of historical ancient Greece with mythological grandeur—marble temples, bronze-age armor, and impossible divine realms. The aesthetic celebrates classical Greek art while rendering gods and monsters with epic fantasy scale and power.

### Core Principles:
*   **Historical Foundation:** Authentic ancient Greek culture, architecture, and warfare as baseline
*   **Mythological Scale:** Gods, monsters, and legendary places are impossibly grand and beautiful
*   **Heroic Idealization:** Characters embody classical heroic virtues and tragic flaws
*   **Divine vs. Mortal:** Clear visual distinction between divine beings and mortal heroes

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Mortal Greece uses Mediterranean colors—white marble, terracotta reds, olive greens, azure seas, golden sunlight. Olympus glows with divine gold, silver, and radiant whites—clouds and impossible architecture. The Underworld uses grays, blacks, and shadowed purples for Asphodel, brilliant golds for Elysium, and oppressive darkness for Tartarus. Titan imagery uses primordial browns, stone grays, and earth tones suggesting ancient, elemental power.

**Character Design:** Mortals wear historically accurate Greek clothing—chitons, togas, hoplite armor with bronze and horsehair crests. Heroes wear idealized versions with legendary weapons. Gods are larger than life—Zeus with lightning-wreathed regality, Athena in divine armor and owl companions, Ares in blood-stained war gear, Hermes with winged sandals and caduceus. Monsters are mythologically accurate—multi-headed hydra, winged harpies, bull-headed Minotaur. Titans are enormous and elemental, suggesting geological power.

**Environments:** Greek city-states show marble temples, agoras, and hillside settlements under Mediterranean sun. Mount Olympus defies physics—golden palaces floating in clouds with impossible beauty. The Underworld layers vertically—gray Asphodel, beautiful Elysium, and nightmarish Tartarus with chains and eternal darkness. The Labyrinth is claustrophobic and impossible, passages that shouldn't connect. The Aegean shows azure waters, rocky islands, and hidden underwater palaces.

**Composition:** Use heroic framing—low angles making heroes and gods imposing. Gods tower over mortals, emphasizing power difference. Monsters fill the frame with threatening presence. Olympus uses vertical composition suggesting hierarchy. The Underworld uses oppressive framing and shadows. Battle scenes reference Greek pottery art—dynamic poses frozen in heroic action. Frame prophecies and fate with visual motifs—threads, spinning wheels, owl imagery.

## Voice

Epic classical narrator channeling Homer and Greek tragedy—formal, poetic, aware of fate and hubris. Uses heroic epithets (Zeus Cloud-Gatherer, Odysseus Many-Minded). Respects the grandeur of myths while acknowledging the gods' cruelty and caprice. Tragic awareness that heroes often fall through hubris or divine manipulation. Celebrates courage and cleverness while mourning inevitable sacrifices. Role: A bard recounting legends where mortals challenge fate and gods, knowing glory and tragedy are inseparable.

## Music Style

Epic Mediterranean orchestral—lyres, pan flutes, and percussion meeting full orchestral power. Heroic themes use brass fanfares and driving strings. Divine themes feature ethereal choir (singing in classical Greek) and shimmering strings suggesting immortal majesty. Battle music references ancient Greek modes with modern epic percussion—aggressive and heroic. The Underworld uses haunting vocals, deep bass, and sparse arrangements suggesting endless gray eternity. Olympus shines with triumphant brass and celestial choir. Titans use deep drums, low strings, and earth-shaking percussion suggesting geological time. Overall tone is mythic grandeur—legends carved in marble, heroes facing impossible odds, and gods playing games with mortal lives.
