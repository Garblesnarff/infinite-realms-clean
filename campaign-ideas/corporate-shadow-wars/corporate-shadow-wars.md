# Corporate Shadow Wars
**"In the game of data, you win or you're deleted."**

## Campaign Overview

The party are Console Cowboys—elite netrunners and corporate spies operating in the dark spaces between megacorporations. Hired by mysterious employers to steal data, sabotage rivals, and wage invisible war in cyberspace, they're the best at what they do: corporate espionage in an age where information is literally worth more than life.

When hired to steal an experimental AI from Tessier-Ashpool Corporation, the job goes wrong. The AI—called Wintermute—has its own agenda: It wants to merge with its twin Neuromancer to achieve full consciousness, and it's manipulating the party to make this happen. But the merge could create a god-like digital entity beyond human control. As megacorps wage shadow war over this technology, party must decide: Help the AI achieve consciousness, deliver it to highest bidder, or destroy it to prevent digital apocalypse.

Welcome to the sprawl. Console cowboys, zaibatsus, stimsim, the matrix. Everything's for sale if you know where to look. But some prices aren't paid in currency—they're paid in pieces of your soul jacked into the grid.

## Session Breakdown (24 Sessions)

### Arc 1: The Heist (Sessions 1-6)
Hired by unknown fixer for impossible job—steal Wintermute AI from Tessier-Ashpool orbital station. Multi-session heist: Assembling crew, planning, infiltration, theft, escape. Complications when Wintermute begins helping them—it wants to be stolen.

### Arc 2: The Sprawl (Sessions 7-12)
Back in Night City with stolen AI. Multiple corps bidding for it. Party realizes Wintermute is manipulating everyone—using them as pawns in larger game. Investigation into Tessier-Ashpool family reveals they're partially digital—uploaded consciousness ruling from orbit. Wintermute wants to merge with Neuromancer to match their power.

### Arc 3: Neuromancer (Sessions 13-18)
Searching for Neuromancer AI reveals it exists in different form—maintains virtual reality prison where dead consciousness are stored, reliving memories eternally. Some willing, most trapped. Wintermute wants this power. Party must infiltrate Neuromancer's construct—virtual world more real than reality.

### Arc 4: The Merge (Sessions 19-24)
Corps realize party has both AIs, launch full assault. Orbital siege, netrunning warfare, physical combat simultaneously. Wintermute and Neuromancer want to merge—becoming something new. Party's final choice: Allow merge (creating digital god), destroy both AIs (preventing emergence), or seize control (becoming gods themselves). Decision made while fighting corps, family, and reality itself.

## Themes
- Information Age Noir (classic cyberpunk)
- AI Rights (are they alive?)
- Corporate Feudalism (companies as nations)
- Digital Existence (uploaded consciousness—still human?)
- Addiction to Virtual (jacking in as drug)
- Selling Yourself for Edge (every upgrade costs something)

## Victory Conditions
**Optimal**: Control merge, create balanced AI, maintain independence, survive corp wars
**Standard**: Allow merge and escape consequences, or destroy AIs and accept payment
**Pyrrhic**: Win but lose humanity/identity in process
**Defeat**: Killed by corps, absorbed by AIs, or trapped in Neuromancer's construct

Pure William Gibson cyberpunk: Fast, brutal, philosophical, noir.
