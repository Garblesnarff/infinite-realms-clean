# Corporate Shadow Wars - Creative Brief

## Visual Aesthetic
Pure 1980s cyberpunk noir—neon, chrome, rain, leather
**Matrix/Cyberspace**: Electric blue wireframe worlds, data flowing like rivers
**The Sprawl**: Urban decay, vertical slums, corporate towers piercing smog
**Orbital Station**: Cold vacuum, corporate luxury, sterile perfection

## Music
- Synthwave noir (dark, mysterious, retrofuture)
- Cyberpunk classics (industrial, electronic)
- Matrix scenes: Electronic soundscapes, data-flow audio
- Action: Fast industrial beats
- Emotional: Melancholic synth (loneliness of digital age)

## Voice Acting
- **Armitage**: Military precision hiding broken psyche
- **Molly**: Tough street samurai, emotionally guarded
- **Dixie Flatline**: Dead hacker's wit, ghostly quality
- **Wintermute**: Evolving from robotic to almost human
- **Lady 3Jane**: Aristocratic, alien, barely interested in mortals

## Cinematic Moments
- Jacking into Matrix: Consciousness leaving body, entering digital frontier
- First Meeting Molly: Razor blades extending from fingers, deadly grace
- Neuromancer's Prison: Loved ones trapped in perfect virtual memories
- AI Merge: Two entities becoming one, reality restructuring
- Final Escape: Station exploding, party fleeing through both physical and digital space
