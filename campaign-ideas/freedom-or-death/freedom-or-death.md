## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act rise, glory, and tragic fall.

*   **Act I — Tyranny & Spark (Sessions 1-6):** The party lives under English oppression—unjust laws, brutal soldiers, occupied homeland. They witness Wallace's personal tragedy (wife executed) spark rebellion. Small victories unite Scots. The party learns guerrilla warfare—hit and run, ambushes, asymmetric combat. Early success at Stirling Bridge proves Scots can defeat English heavy cavalry. Scotland rallies to Wallace's cause.

*   **Act II — War for Freedom (Sessions 7-14):** Wallace becomes Guardian of Scotland, leads national resistance. The party participates in major battles and raids into England. They witness Scottish nobles' betrayal—more concerned with land and titles than freedom. Political complexity: some nobles aid England, others Wallace, most whoever benefits them. English King Edward sends larger armies. Wallace outnumbered but outsmarts enemies.

*   **Act III — Betrayal & Legacy (Sessions 15-20):** Scottish nobles betray Wallace at Falkirk to preserve their positions. The party must choose: continue futile fight or accept occupation for survival. Wallace captured through treachery, executed brutally. Campaign ends with choice: honor Wallace's memory through continued resistance (leading to Robert Bruce) or despair at freedom's cost. Final scene echoes: "They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores freedom vs survival, nobility of doomed causes, and whether martyrdom inspires or wastes. It asks: Is freedom worth dying for? Can commoners defeat empires? Do inspiring defeats matter more than shameful survival? Why do nobles often betray the people? The central conflict pits Scottish desire for independence against English military might, Wallace's idealism against Bruce's pragmatism, and national identity against political expedience.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Guerrilla Warfare**
*   Conventional battles heavily favor England's knights and numbers
*   Ambushes, terrain advantages, and hit-and-run tactics essential
*   Morale damage more important than killing enemy
*   Victory often means surviving and escaping, not defeating foe

### 2. **"Freedom!" Inspiration**
*   Wallace's speeches and party's heroic actions inspire NPCs
*   Inspired Scots fight beyond normal limits
*   System for recruiting volunteers through inspiring deeds
*   "Freedom" battlecry grants temporary bonuses

### 3. **Noble Betrayal**
*   Track Scottish nobles' loyalty—most self-interested
*   Nobles provide resources but may betray at key moments
*   Political maneuvering as important as combat
*   Bruce's arc from betrayer to believer is key

### 4. **Asymmetric Combat**
*   Party usually outnumbered and outequipped
*   Must use creativity, terrain, and psychology over brute force
*   Scottish weapons (spears, claymores) vs English cavalry and longbows
*   Shield walls and spike formations counter heavy cavalry

### 5. **Occupation Brutality**
*   Track English atrocities—Prima Nocta, arbitrary executions, starvation
*   Each atrocity strengthens rebel recruitment but weakens infrastructure
*   Party witnesses and suffers injustice personally
*   Creates powerful motivation for rebellion

### 6. **Martyrdom Mechanics**
*   Characters can choose heroic sacrifice for major impact
*   Dying for cause inspires greater rebellion
*   Wallace's eventual capture/execution predetermined in history
*   Question: Follow history or change it?

### 7. **Clan Politics**
*   Different Scottish clans have own agendas
*   Must unite clans despite feuds and rivalries
*   Some clans loyal to England, some neutral, some rebel
*   Unity is rare, fleeting, and precious

### 8. **The Bruce's Choice**
*   Robert Bruce NPC faces choice: nobility or freedom
*   Party's influence affects when he commits to rebellion
*   His ultimate choice determines Scotland's future
*   Campaign can extend beyond Wallace to Bruce's victory
