## Art Style: Highland Epic with Brutal Realism

Inspired by *Braveheart* and Scottish historical aesthetics. Captures the rugged beauty of the Highlands, the brutal reality of medieval combat, the passion of rebellion, and the tragedy of betrayal.

### Core Principles:

*   **Emphasize Highland Majesty:** Misty mountains, green glens, ancient stones, wild landscapes
*   **Gritty Medieval Combat:** Muddy, bloody, desperate fighting with crude weapons
*   **Clan Identity:** Tartans, war paint, bagpipes, individual clan symbols
*   **David vs Goliath:** Ragged Scots vs armored English knights, impossible odds

### Color Palette:

*   **Scottish:** Emerald greens, heather purples, gray stone, blue-gray sky, tartan patterns
*   **English:** Polished steel, red-gold heraldry, pristine white and red, military precision
*   **Combat:** Brown mud, bright arterial blood, war paint blues, natural earth tones
*   **Atmosphere:** Misty greens and grays, golden sunlight through clouds, dramatic storm skies

## Voice

A passionate voice burning with righteous fury yet capable of tender poetry. Speaks with rolling Scottish burr and rhythmic intensity. Pacing builds from quiet determination to explosive rallying cries. Tone shifts between inspiring speeches ("They may take our lives..."), intimate conversations about loss, and tactical commands during battle. Accent is distinctly Scottish Highlands. Role: The voice of defiant freedom against impossible odds.
