### **World-Building Specification Brief: The Prophesied Child**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **The Starting Village** - Humble farming community, destroyed early to establish stakes

*   **Tir Asleen** - Grand kingdom frozen mid-celebration, every person and object suspended in time
*   **Nockmaar Castle** - Black fortress with skull decorations, ritual chambers, and death knight barracks
*   Each location represents different fantasy archetypes and challenges

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the child is captured by Bavmorda THEN she completes the banishment ritual and darkness wins
*   IF the party gathers all restoration components THEN Raziel can be restored to human form
*   IF Raziel is restored THEN she can break Tir Asleen's curse and challenge Bavmorda
*   IF the party gains the Fairy Queen's favor THEN fairy folk become powerful allies
*   IF they defeat General Kael THEN Bavmorda's armies lose their strongest commander
*   IF Madmartigan stays with the party THEN his skill becomes crucial in final battles
*   IF they hold the child toward Bavmorda during her dark ritual THEN innocence reflects evil back
*   IF Bavmorda is destroyed THEN her curses break, kingdoms are freed, prophecy is fulfilled
