In modern-day Chicago, the party consists of supernatural investigators—wizards, changelings, knights, and other practitioners—who work the streets where magic and mundane collide. Bound by the Laws of Magic enforced by the White Council, they must navigate the treacherous politics of vampire courts, fae nobility, and demonic forces while solving cases that threaten the masquerade separating magic from mortal awareness. As war erupts between the vampire courts and the White Council, they'll face impossible choices between following the Laws and saving innocents, all while powerful forces seek to claim mantles of godlike power. In Chicago's shadows, they'll learn that magic always has a price, and sometimes the cost is paid in souls.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20-25 sessions)

A four-act arc of escalating supernatural threats and political intrigue culminating in a war for the fate of reality.

*   **Act I — Welcome to the Night Side (Sessions 1-6):** The party establishes themselves as supernatural investigators in Chicago, taking cases that reveal the hidden magical world. They encounter the vampire courts (White, Red, and Black), faerie nobility from Summer and Winter, and the mysterious Archive. They're recruited by the White Council's Warden of Chicago to help maintain the balance and prevent violations of the Laws of Magic. Their investigations reveal a conspiracy involving mortals being used as pawns in a larger game.
*   **Act II — The War Begins (Sessions 7-13):** A party member accidentally violates the First Law, killing with magic in self-defense, drawing the attention of the Wardens. The Red Court declares war on the White Council after a diplomatic incident, forcing wizards worldwide to take sides. The party must survive increasingly deadly supernatural attacks while investigating who orchestrated the war. They discover Outsiders—entities from beyond reality—are influencing events. The Winter Court's Mab offers them power as her Knights, at terrible cost.
*   **Act III — Queens and Pawns (Sessions 14-19):** The party navigates the politics of both mortal and supernatural Chicago as the war intensifies. They're drawn into schemes involving the Summer and Winter Courts, each seeking advantage. A party member may take up a Mantle of power (Knight, Emissary, or similar), gaining immense strength but losing freedom. They face the Denarians—fallen angels bound in coins—who offer temptation and terrible power. The true enemy reveals themselves: a conspiracy to break the Outer Gates and let reality-devouring entities through.
*   **Act IV — Changes and Consequences (Sessions 20-25):** The Red Court launches an attack using bloodline curses that could kill thousands. The party must assault the heart of enemy territory, facing vampire lords and their gods. They discover the Red King's true plan and must make impossible choices—break the Laws to save innocents, accept dark power to gain strength, or sacrifice pieces of themselves. The final confrontation determines the fate of an entire supernatural nation and reshapes the balance of power in the Nevernever. Some prices, once paid, can never be reclaimed.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of power and its cost, free will versus obligation, the necessity of rules in the face of evil, and whether ends justify means. It asks: Is it right to break moral laws to save innocents? Can you accept power from dark sources without being corrupted? What does it mean to be a monster? The central conflict pits the party's desire to protect people against supernatural forces that view mortals as pawns, while dark powers offer strength at the cost of their souls and freedom.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Laws of Magic**
*   Seven absolute laws wizards cannot break without execution: No killing with magic, no mind control, no necromancy, no time travel, etc.
*   Breaking a Law corrupts the caster, making them more likely to break others
*   The Wardens enforce Laws with lethal prejudice
*   Some circumstances make breaking Laws unavoidable—choose between death or corruption

### 2. **The Sight**
*   Wizards can open their Third Eye to see the true nature of things
*   The Sight shows souls, intentions, and supernatural truth
*   What you See is never forgotten—trauma, beauty, and horror are permanent
*   Use sparingly; some things cannot be unseen

### 3. **Mantles of Power**
*   Characters can take on supernatural Mantles—Winter Knight, Summer Knight, Archive, etc.
*   Mantles grant immense power but change the character's nature
*   Must fulfill the Mantle's purpose or face consequences
*   Some Mantles override free will; you become the office

### 4. **Faerie Bargains**
*   Fae cannot lie but excel at deception through exact wording
*   All deals must be kept; breaking fae bargains has terrible consequences
*   Debts accumulate; someone will always collect eventually
*   Never give fae your Name—they gain power over you

### 5. **Threshold Magic**
*   Homes where people live and feel safe have Thresholds—magical barriers
*   Supernatural beings (vampires, fae, demons) cannot enter without invitation
*   Entering weakens their power significantly
*   Violating hospitality destroys Thresholds

### 6. **Denarian Coins**
*   30 silver coins, each containing a fallen angel
*   Touching a coin begins a partnership with the demon inside
*   Grants incredible power but the demon whispers temptation
*   Only faith can cast out a Denarian; keeping the coin means eventual possession

### 7. **Soulgaze**
*   When a wizard and human make eye contact, they see each other's souls
*   Happens only once per person; reveals true nature
*   Cannot be prevented or blocked
*   Shows deepest truth—heroes may have darkness, monsters may have humanity

### 8. **Magic Disrupts Technology**
*   Active spells short out electronics—computers, cars, phones
*   Stronger wizards passively disrupt tech just by proximity
*   Magic and modern technology are incompatible
*   Must choose between magical power and technological convenience
