# Jazz Noir City [CAMPAIGN: Urban Fantasy (Noir/Mystery)]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In the rain-slicked, perpetually twilight metropolis of "Nocturne City," a hardboiled detective, a shadowy figure with a hidden magical past, or a desperate femme fatale navigates a world of corrupt politicians, ruthless mobsters, and ancient magical secrets. The city pulses with the melancholic, haunting rhythm of jazz, a soundtrack to the lies, betrayals, and desperate struggles for power. Magic is subtle, often tied to emotions, music, or forgotten urban legends, and it seeps into the cracks of everyday life. The players are drawn into a web of intrigue, forced to confront their own moral ambiguities as they search for truth in a city that thrives on deception.

## Setting [SETTING: 1940s Magical Noir]
Nocturne City is a sprawling, 1940s-esque metropolis, perpetually shrouded in twilight and rain. Art deco skyscrapers loom over grimy alleyways, and every shadow hides a secret. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, cheap perfume, and the distant wail of a saxophone. Magic isn't flashy; it's a subtle undercurrent, often manifesting as luck, intuition, or the strange coincidences that shape destinies. It's a world of fedoras, trench coats, smoky backrooms, and hidden speakeasies, where the mundane and the mystical are inextricably intertwined.
