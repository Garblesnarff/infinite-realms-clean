# Creative Brief: City of Angels, City of Sin: Rollo Tomasi

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Golden Age Noir (LA Confidential meets Chinatown)

Inspired by the glamorous corruption of *LA Confidential* and the systemic rot of *Chinatown*. This style aims to capture the contrast between glittering surfaces and dark truths, the moral complexity of compromised justice, and the tragedy of corruption that can't be fully defeated.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Glamorous Decay:** Focus on the contrast between beautiful facades and ugly truths.
*   **Moral Complexity:** Show characters caught between principles and pragmatism.
*   **Noir Atmosphere:** Use classic noir visual language to convey corruption and doomed idealism.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, corrupt, morally complex, glamorous, dark, tragic, inevitable.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of beautiful corruption—the city looks golden but bleeds from within. The atmosphere should evoke both the allure of glamour and the weight of systemic rot. The world feels like a beautiful lie that's being slowly exposed.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, elegant lines for glamorous settings contrasted with harsh, dramatic lines for crime scenes and corrupt dealings.
*   **Forms:** Art deco architecture, elegant entertainment venues, brutal crime scenes, guards in uniforms that represent both authority and corruption.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed noir illustration in the style of LA Confidential, showing the contrast between a glamorous entertainment district with art deco lighting and the dark alley behind where corrupt dealings occur."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich golds and warm ambers for the glamorous city contrasted with noir blacks and shadows, blood reds for violence, desaturated tones for corruption revealed.
*   **Luminosity:** Golden hour lighting for the city's image; harsh shadows for truth; the interplay between warm facade and cold reality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette of rich golds and warm ambers representing the city's glamorous facade, contrasted with noir blacks and deep shadows, accented by blood red and the cold blues of harsh truth."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Period noir aesthetics—guards in sharp uniforms, glamorous entertainers, corrupt officials in expensive suits, criminals in both high and low society.
*   **Corruption Elements:** Visual signs of moral compromise—too-expensive watches on underpaid guards, blood on clean hands, glamour hiding desperation.
*   **Expression:** Faces show moral conflict, world-weary cynicism, desperate idealism, the weight of maintaining lies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Three guards representing different approaches: one brutal enforcer with bloodied knuckles and haunted eyes, one by-the-book detective with files and idealism showing wear, one celebrity guard in perfectly pressed uniform hiding compromise beneath glamour."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Golden age city architecture with art deco elegance hiding corruption. Entertainment district glamour contrasted with crime scene brutality. Police headquarters where justice and corruption coexist.
*   **Atmosphere:** Beautiful but oppressive—glamour that feels hollow, prosperity that hides rot, order maintained through violence.
*   **Details:** Visual world-building: crime scene evidence, glamorous establishments hiding vice, blackmail photographs, bureaucratic corruption, the gap between public image and private truth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The glamorous Fleur-de-Lis club interior with art deco elegance, beautiful people in expensive clothes, soft lighting and champagne—but subtle visual clues reveal the blackmail, corruption, and control beneath the glamour: hidden cameras, nervous glances, power dynamics."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Classic noir lighting with venetian blinds casting patterns, golden hour light for the city's image, harsh interrogation lighting for truth-seeking, shadows hiding corruption.
*   **Shadows:** Deep and morally symbolic—good people cast shadows, corrupt people hide in them, truth emerges from darkness.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates the noir duality of image versus reality, public versus private, justice versus corruption.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by venetian blinds creating patterns of light and shadow across an interrogation room, with golden evening light from the window showing the glamorous city outside while harsh overhead light exposes brutal truth inside."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Classic noir compositions with characters framed by architecture, mirrors showing duality, contrasts between foreground corruption and background glamour.
*   **Techniques:** Reflections showing hidden selves, vertical dividing lines separating image from truth, overhead shots revealing the full scope of corruption.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A split composition showing the same scene twice: above, the glamorous city at golden hour with beauty and prosperity; below, the same locations in harsh truth revealing crime scenes, corruption, and moral compromise—same places, different realities."

## Voice

A voice that captures the weary cynicism of noir detectives mixed with the tragedy of corrupted idealism. The narrator speaks with the measured cadence of someone recounting how everything went wrong—smooth during descriptions of glamour, hardened during violence, emotionally resonant during moral reckonings. The pacing is deliberate, building through investigation to revelations that recontextualize everything. The emotion is tragic awareness—the voice of someone who learned that some fights can't be won but still needed to fight them. Audio quality features period city ambience—jazz music from clubs, police radios, camera flashbulbs, the shuffle of evidence, rain on pavement, the sounds of a beautiful city with ugly secrets. Role: The voice of a detective telling the story of when they learned what "Rollo Tomasi" really means.
