**City of Angels, City of Sin: Rollo Tomasi**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are city guards in the glamorous metropolis of Lumina during its golden age, where magic and crime intertwine beneath a façade of prosperity. What begins as a seemingly random massacre at a coffee house evolves into a web of police corruption, organized crime, and dark secrets involving the city's most powerful figures. Each player has their own approach to justice—brutal violence, by-the-book procedure, or celebrity heroism—creating internal conflict as they uncover that the system they serve is fundamentally corrupt. The investigation forces them to confront who they really are, what justice means when the system is broken, and whether they can find personal redemption in a city where everything is suspect.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the golden age of Lumina and how prosperity was built on corruption that was systematically hidden.
    *   Write about the original crime that the Night Owl massacre was meant to cover up—a historical atrocity involving powerful families.
    *   Describe the Fleur-de-Lis organization and how it gained control over vice, blackmail, and influence.
    *   Explain the guard force's evolution from legitimate law enforcement to partially corrupt protectors of the status quo.
    *   Detail the entertainment district and how glamour became a tool for controlling the powerful through their secrets.
    *   Write about what "Rollo Tomasi" means—a code for justice the system can't provide, named after an unsolved victim.
