## Art Style: Urban Bohemian Realism (90s New York)

Inspired by Rent's gritty East Village aesthetic—struggling artists, warehouse lofts, graffiti art, chosen family in the face of plague and gentrification.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Urban rainbow against gray concrete—graffiti colors splash across drab buildings, neon lights of clubs, warm candlelight in cold lofts, the community is colorful while gentrification is sterile white and glass. Winter blues and whites dominate, punctuated by character's vibrant individual colors.

**Character Design:** 90s bohemian fashion—Mark in striped scarf and glasses with his camera, Roger in leather jacket with guitar, Mimi in bold club wear, Angel in fabulous drag, Collins in academic blazer and African prints, Benny in increasingly expensive suits. Everyone has signature style expressing their identity. Poverty shows in layers of vintage clothes and patched jackets.

**Environments:** The loft with its industrial metal staircase and no heat, candlelit with artist's chaos. Life Cafe with mismatched furniture and community posters. Streets with graffiti and homeless encampments. The Cat Scratch Club's neon and shadows. Everything is real, gritty, authentic—not prettified.

**Action:** Protest marches, performance art in the streets, drag shows, filming documentary footage, community supporting each other through illness, dancing in clubs, creating art from nothing, fighting eviction, surviving winter without heat.

## Voice

A voice of urgent passion and vulnerability—young, artistic, defiant in the face of death and poverty. New York accents, multicultural, able to shift from passionate speeches to intimate confessions to rock vocals. Can be Mark's documentary narration, Collins' philosophical musings, Mimi's fierce declarations, Angel's joyful celebrations. The voice of people society has written off, insisting they matter, they're alive, they have something to say.

## Music Style

Rock opera meets gospel meets punk—think Rent's eclectic score. "Seasons of Love" as gospel anthem measuring life in moments. "La Vie Boheme" as rock celebration of counterculture. "Without You" and "I'll Cover You" as power ballads of love. "Out Tonight" as club anthem. Mix of electric guitars, gospel choir, and intimate acoustic moments. Songs that feel ripped from real life, urgent and raw. Music that insists on joy even in tragedy.
