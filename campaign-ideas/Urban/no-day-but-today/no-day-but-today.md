## Central Conflict

Art versus commerce, idealism versus survival, living authentically versus playing it safe. The party must decide whether to accept Benny's money and compromise their principles or stay poor and pure but risk dying in poverty. Relationships are complicated—loving someone means risking losing them to illness. The question: how do you measure a year? In rent checks or in moments of connection?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Measure Your Life**
*   Track meaningful moments—creative achievements, acts of love, standing up for principles, helping community. These matter more than gold or levels.

### 2. **The Wasting Sickness**
*   Some characters have terminal illness. Manage symptoms, find treatments, accept mortality. Creates urgency for everything.

### 3. **Bohemian Survival**
*   Resource management—heat, food, medicine, art supplies. Creative solutions matter more than money.

### 4. **Performance and Art**
*   Regular opportunities to create—songs, films, performances, protests. Art can change hearts, solve problems, build community.

### 5. **Found Family Bonds**
*   Strong bonds with NPCs provide mechanical benefits but create vulnerability. When they die, it hurts mechanically and emotionally.

### 6. **Seasons of Love**
*   Campaign structured around one year—winter eviction, spring falling in love, summer complications, autumn loss, winter again measuring what changed.
