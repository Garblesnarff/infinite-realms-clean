## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 16-20 sessions)

A three-act noir mystery escalating from murder to international conspiracy.

*   **Act I — The Simple Case (Sessions 1-6):** The party, working as inquisitives in Sharn's middle districts, is hired to solve a murder in the industrial Cogs district. The victim: a warforged with illegal dragonmark-mimicking modifications. Investigation reveals a black market trading in stolen dragonmark research, warforged "upgrades," and artifacts from the Last War. They navigate Sharn's vertical society—gleaming upper towers where nobility lives, cramped middle districts, and the Cogs' industrial hell where warforged labor. Multiple factions want them to stop investigating.
*   **Act II — House of Cards (Sessions 7-13):** The conspiracy deepens: someone is stealing dragonmark research from all twelve houses, preparing to mass-produce artificial marks that would shatter the houses' monopolies. The party traces connections to House Cannith's schism over creating warforged, the Lord of Blades' warforged nation in the Mournland, and foreign agents seeking to destabilize Khorvaire. They must infiltrate dragonmarked house enclaves, survive assassination attempts, and decide which factions to trust. The stakes: another war.
*   **Act III — Shadows Over Sharn (Sessions 14-20):** The party discovers the truth: a former Cannith artificer plans to use stolen dragonmark research to create an army of marked warforged, breaking the Treaty and restarting the war for profit. The conspiracy involves corrupt house members, the Lord of Blades, and remnants of Cyre (the nation destroyed in the Last War). The party must stop the artificer's plot, prevent war, and choose Sharn's future. Will dragonmarked houses maintain their monopoly? Will warforged gain true citizenship? Their investigation became revolution.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of technological progress versus ethics, personhood and rights for artificial beings, post-war trauma and profiteering, and whether stability justifies inequality. It asks: Are warforged truly alive? Do dragonmarked houses' monopolies protect or exploit? Can lasting peace exist when war is profitable? The central conflict pits the party's investigation against forces that profit from conflict and control.
