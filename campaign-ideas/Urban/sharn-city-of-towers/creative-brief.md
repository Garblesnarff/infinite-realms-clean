# Creative Brief: Sharn: City of Towers

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Magitech Noir with Art Deco Elements (Eberron-inspired)

Inspired by the fusion of magic and industry in *Eberron*, film noir aesthetics, and art deco architecture. This style captures the vertical grandeur of Sharn, the gritty underbelly of warforged labor, and the sophisticated intrigue of dragonmarked houses.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Vertical Scale:** Towers stretching impossibly high, bridges between them, distinct class levels
*   **Magic as Technology:** Lightning rail trains, elemental-bound machines, everyday magic
*   **Noir Atmosphere:** Rain-slicked streets, neon-like everbright lanterns, shadows and mystery
*   **Warforged Presence:** Living constructs as second-class citizens, unique designs

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Magitech noir, urban fantasy, vertical city, mystery, post-war tension, artificial life, house intrigue
*   **Feeling:** The excitement of magical technology mixed with noir cynicism. Beauty and squalor separated by vertical distance. Wonder at constructs asking "am I alive?"

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Upper Towers:** Gold, silver, white marble, crystalline blues, pristine and wealthy
*   **Middle Districts:** Brass, copper, warm amber light, functional but not luxurious
*   **The Cogs:** Iron, rust, forge-orange, soot black, industrial hell
*   **Magical Elements:** Crackling blue-white lightning, purple-pink everbright lanterns, elemental colors
*   **Noir Touch:** Rain adds reflections, shadows deep and meaningful
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette split by vertical class. Upper levels show white marble, gold trim, and crystalline blue sky. Middle levels have brass and copper tones with warm amber everbright lanterns. Lower Cogs show rust, soot-black iron, and forge-orange glow. Blue-white lightning crackles along conductor rods. Rain creates reflections on all surfaces."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Inquisitives:** Noir detective aesthetic—long coats, practical clothes, tools of the trade
*   **Dragonmarked Nobles:** Elegant clothing with art deco patterns, visible dragonmarks glowing faintly on skin
*   **Warforged:** Wood, metal, and stone composite bodies, each unique, root-like wood grain, crystal eyes, no two alike
*   **House Agents:** Professional attire with house colors and symbols, mix of elegance and function
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warforged inquisitive named Iron. Body is composite of darkwood plates over metal frame with stone reinforcement at joints. Face has carved features suggesting human but clearly constructed. Glowing crystal eyes. Wears a long coat designed for their frame. Stands in rain-slicked alley with everbright lanterns casting purple-pink light. Noir atmosphere."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Upper Sharn:** Soaring towers with sky gardens, floating restaurants, crystalline bridges, airship docks
*   **Middle Dura:** Practical architecture, crowded but organized, bridges connecting towers, mixed lighting
*   **The Cogs:** Industrial nightmare—massive forges, steam vents, warforged laborers, darkness broken by forge light
*   **House Enclaves:** Fortified tower districts with distinct architectural style for each house
*   **Prompt Example:** "The vertical city of Sharn at night. Foreground shows the dark Cogs with forge fires and steam. Middle layers have warm amber lights and bridges. Upper towers gleam with white light and floating gardens. Lightning rail train arcs between towers on glowing track. Airships dock at upper levels. Rain falls through all levels, catching light."

**5. Magitech and Magic:**
*   **Lightning Rail:** Train running on elemental-powered tracks, blue-white lightning crackling
*   **Airships:** Wooden vessels with glowing elemental rings keeping them aloft
*   **Everbright Lanterns:** Magical street lights in various colors, particularly purple-pink
*   **Dragonmarks:** Glowing tattoo-like symbols on skin in distinct patterns per house
*   **Warforged Creation:** Magical assembly, bound elementals, fusion of materials
*   **Prompt Example:** "A House Cannith workshop. Artificers work on warforged construction—magical circles glow as they bind wood, metal, and stone. Dragonmarks on artificers' necks pulse with power. Tools are both mechanical and magical. In background, lightning rail passes by window, its crackling trail visible. Art deco design elements throughout."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Noir Lighting:** Strong contrasts, rain-slicked reflections, meaningful shadows
*   **Vertical Light Gradient:** Bright above, dim middle, dark below
*   **Magical Light Sources:** Everbright lanterns, lightning, elemental glow, dragonmark pulse
*   **Industrial Lighting:** Forge fires, molten metal, steam backlit
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit with noir style. An everbright lantern casts purple-pink light that reflects off rain-wet cobblestones. Strong shadows hide alleys. Background forge glow provides orange backlight. A warforged's crystal eyes glow softly. Lightning rail tracks above crackle with blue-white energy. Deep blacks contrast with focused light."

## Voice

A hardboiled detective's voice with measured delivery and world-weary wisdom. The pacing is steady with dramatic pauses at revelations. The tone shifts between cynical observation and wonder at magitech marvels. Occasional noir narration: "It was raining. It's always raining in Sharn." Underlying theme of questioning what makes something alive. The voice carries post-war exhaustion but investigative determination. Role: The voice of noir mystery in a magical world.
