## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of redemption, racing, and taking down corruption.

*   **Act I — Climbing from Nothing (Sessions 1-7):** Starting with a basic vehicle, the party builds reputation by winning races and evading police. They challenge Blacklist racers #15 through #10, learning each racer's story and why they're wanted. They discover the Cross—a police sergeant obsessed with ending street racing who respects their skill but opposes their choices. They learn Razor made a deal with Cross's corrupt captain.
*   **Act II — The Heat Rises (Sessions 8-14):** Now driving powerful vehicles with high wanted levels, the party faces elite Blacklist racers #9 through #4. Police tactics escalate to helicopters, roadblocks, and federal units. They uncover that Razor and Captain Daniels have been artificially maintaining the Blacklist to profit from betting rings and corruption. Cross becomes a reluctant ally who wants to take down Daniels.
*   **Act III — Most Wanted (Sessions 15-20):** The party challenges the top 3 Blacklist racers while navigating all-out police warfare. They must defeat Razor, reclaim their legendary vehicle, and choose: escape Rockport with clean records by helping Cross expose Daniels, or embrace infamy as the new #1 Most Wanted.

The central conflict pits the party's desire for redemption and revenge against increasingly aggressive police and corrupt officials.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Heat Level System**
*   Wanted level increases with racing activity and police encounters
*   Higher heat attracts more aggressive police tactics: regular patrols → SUVs → helicopters → federal units
*   Can reduce heat by laying low or completing cooldown challenges
*   High heat required to challenge higher Blacklist members
*   Balancing heat management vs. reputation building is strategic choice

### 2. **Pursuit Evasion**
*   Police chases are full encounters requiring tactical thinking
*   Evasion tactics: breaking line of sight, pursuit breakers, hiding spots, outrunning
*   Pursuit breakers: gas stations explode, scaffolding collapses, water towers burst
*   Vehicle damage accumulates during pursuits—must balance aggression with survival
*   Successfully escaping high-heat pursuits grants major reputation

### 3. **Blacklist Challenge System**
*   Each Blacklist racer requires reputation threshold to challenge
*   Three-race format: specialty race, circuit race, pursuit race
*   Defeating them grants their vehicle as prize (pink slips)
*   Each racer has signature vehicle and racing style to overcome
*   Moving up Blacklist unlocks new districts and race types

### 4. **Vehicle Customization & Performance**
*   Extensive modification system: engine, transmission, suspension, tires, body
*   Visual customization: paint, vinyls, body kits, spoilers
*   Performance vs. heat generation—flashy cars attract more police
*   Tuning for specific race types or all-around performance
*   Legendary vehicles have unique abilities or histories

### 5. **Reputation Economy**
*   Primary progression currency earned through races, milestones, and police escapes
*   Reputation unlocks challenges, parts, and Blacklist confrontations
*   Can farm reputation through repeatable events or risk big scores
*   High-risk high-reward events vs. safe reputation grinding
*   Reputation also determines final standing in street racing hierarchy

### 6. **Territory Control**
*   Each Blacklist member controls specific districts of Rockport
*   Defeating them unlocks their territory for races and safe houses
*   Territory-specific race types and challenges
*   Some territories are safer from police than others
*   Strategic choice of which territories to contest when

### 7. **Police AI Tactics**
*   Police learn and adapt—repeated tactics become less effective
*   Different units have different capabilities: corvettes for speed, SUVs for ramming, helicopters for tracking
*   Can predict spawn points and pursuit tactics with experience
*   Corrupt cops during late game don't follow standard rules—more aggressive
*   Cross himself is boss-tier pursuit opponent

### 8. **Evidence Collection**
*   Throughout campaign, party can collect evidence of Daniels' corruption
*   Evidence influences ending options and Cross's willingness to help
*   Optional investigation adds layers to what could be pure racing
*   Determines whether amnesty ending is possible
*   Creates parallel progression: racing reputation and corruption investigation
