# Creative Brief: Most Wanted Blacklist

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Urban Street Racing (Need for Speed-inspired)

Inspired by the gritty, stylized aesthetics of *Need for Speed: Most Wanted* with emphasis on customized street cars, intense police pursuits, urban nightlife, and underground culture. This style captures the rebellion of illegal racing, the tension of police chases, and the culture of automotive modification.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Customized Vehicles:** Heavily modified street cars with unique paint jobs, body kits, performance parts
*   **Police Presence:** Constant threat visible—cop cars, helicopters, roadblocks creating tension
*   **Night Racing Culture:** Most action occurs at night, dramatic lighting, underground aesthetic

The pursued vehicle's headlights cut through darkness. Orange streetlights provide ambient illumination. Sparks from scraping metal add bright accent highlights."

## Voice

A street-smart, slightly defiant voice with underlying determination, like someone fighting to reclaim what was stolen. The pacing is intense during races and chases, contemplative during garage and story moments. The tone shifts between rebellious confidence ("They'll never catch us"), respect for worthy opponents and honorable cops, and focused determination during Blacklist challenges. There's an underlying theme of redemption through skill. Adrenaline-fueled during pursuits. Role: The voice of underground redemption.

## Music & Sound Direction

*   **Musical Style:** Hip-hop, rock, and electronic with aggressive energy. Licensed soundtrack feel. Each Blacklist racer has musical theme reflecting their personality.
*   **Sound Effects:** Turbo spool, exhaust notes, tire squeals, police sirens, helicopter rotors, radio chatter, roadblock spike strips deploying, pursuit breaker destruction.
*   **Dynamic Music:** Intensifies when police join chase, specific stings when heat level increases, triumphant when escaping, tense during Blacklist races.
*   **Ambient Sounds:** City traffic, police radio chatter, helicopter overhead, street racing crowd cheering at starting line, minimal during stealth moments.
