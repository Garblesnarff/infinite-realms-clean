They operate from the New York Institute, wielding seraph blades and drawing angelic runes for power, while navigating complex politics with Downworlders (vampires, werewolves, warlocks, faeries). When the Mortal Cup—artifact to create new Shadowhunters—is stolen, the party must recover it while uncovering a conspiracy by Valentine Morgenstern to purge all Downworlders and remake the Nephilim into a master race. The campaign explores prejudice, destiny versus choice, forbidden love across species, and family legacy.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Angelic Runes**
*   Shadowhunters draw runes (using stele) on their skin for temporary powers.
*   **Rune Types:** Strength, speed, healing, invisibility, silence, tracking, etc.
*   **Mechanics:** Runes grant bonuses but fade after time. Overuse causes pain.

### 2. **Seraph Blades**
*   Angelic weapons that activate when named after an angel (e.g., "Raziel").
*   **Mechanics:** Deal extra damage to demons, glow with holy light.

### 3. **The Sight**
*   Shadowhunters can see through glamours (magical disguises).
*   **Mechanics:** Demons, Downworlders, and magic are visible despite mundane illusions.

### 4. **Downworlder Politics**
*   The Accords govern peace between Shadowhunters and Downworlders (vampires, werewolves, warlocks, fae).
*   **Mechanics:** Players navigate alliances, prejudices, and political factions.

### 5. **Parabatai Bond**
*   Two Shadowhunters can bond as parabatai (warrior partners with enhanced abilities when together).
*   **Mechanics:** Shared runes grant bonuses. Romantic relationships between parabatai are forbidden (creates complications).
