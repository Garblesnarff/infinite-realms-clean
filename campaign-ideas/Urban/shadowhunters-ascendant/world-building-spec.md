### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**Shadowhunters Ascendant**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
Players are Shadowhunters (human-angel hybrids) hunting demons in modern New York. They navigate politics with Downworlders (vampires, werewolves, warlocks, fae) while recovering the stolen Mortal Cup and stopping Valentine's plot to purge non-humans. The campaign explores prejudice, forbidden romance, and destiny.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   Shadowhunters are Nephilim—created when Angel Raziel gave humans his blood, granting demon-hunting abilities.
*   The Mortal Instruments (Cup, Sword, Mirror) are angelic artifacts with immense power.
*   The Clave governs Shadowhunters; the Accords maintain peace with Downworlders.
*   Valentine led a failed uprising to purge Downworlders, was thought dead, but survived and stole the Mortal Cup.
*   Demons come from other dimensions, attracted to negative emotions, killed by angelic weapons.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **The Clave (Shadowhunter Government):** Authoritarian, often prejudiced against Downworlders, maintains order through the Law.
*   **Valentine's Circle (Antagonist):** Extremist Shadowhunters seeking Downworlder genocide and Nephilim supremacy.
*   **Downworlders:** Vampires (immortal, blood-drinking), werewolves (cursed shapeshifters), warlocks (immortal demon-blooded mages), faeries (beautiful, cruel, bound by bargains).

**6. Causality Chains**

*   **IF** party allies with Downworlders → **THEN** the Clave becomes suspicious of their loyalty.
*   **IF** Jace learns Valentine is his father → **THEN** identity crisis and questioning of loyalties.
*   **IF** party discovers Clary can create new runes → **THEN** she becomes target for both Valentine and the Clave.
*   **IF** parabatai bond is formed → **THEN** bonded pair gains power but forbidden romance creates tragic complications.
*   **IF** Valentine activates the Mortal Instruments → **THEN** apocalyptic summoning or demon army threatens reality.
