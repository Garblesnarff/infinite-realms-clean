# Creative Brief: The Coffee and Tragedy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Urban Horror Sanctuary (Cozy Café meets Body Horror)

Inspired by seinen manga aesthetics, urban Tokyo atmosphere, and body horror. This style blends warm coffee shop interiors with grotesque kagune manifestations, normal city life with hidden predators, and peaceful coexistence with brutal survival. Colors are contrasting—warm browns and café whites against blood reds and kakugan black-red. Character designs show duality—normal students hiding monstrous nature. Everything feels like tragedy waiting to happen—peaceful moments shadowed by inevitable violence.

### Core Principles:

*   **Duality:** Human appearance masking ghoul nature, peaceful surface hiding violence beneath.
*   **Coffee Shop Warmth:** Anteiku as sanctuary, family, and doomed safe haven.
*   **Transformation Trauma:** Identity crisis visualized through kakugan eyes and kagune manifestation.

## Voice

A quiet, traumatized voice—male, young adult, Japanese-inflected, shifting between human uncertainty and ghoul acceptance. The delivery is introspective and philosophical, questioning identity and morality. Emotion is controlled panic and existential dread—asking "what am I?" while fearing the answer. References hunger, humanity, and wrongness of the world. Audio has café ambience (coffee brewing, quiet chatter) contrasting with battle sounds. Role: A half-ghoul internally monologuing about identity, or accepting monstrous transformation.
