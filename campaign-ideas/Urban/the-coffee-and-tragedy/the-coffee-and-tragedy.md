# The Coffee and Tragedy

*A Half-Ghoul Survival / Urban Horror campaign — Medium Campaign (12–15 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Coffee and Tragedy
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Horror / Identity Crisis / CCG Investigation / Tragic Humanity
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **12–14**
**Tone (keywords):** "I'm not the protagonist of a novel", coffee shop sanctuary, half-ghoul identity crisis, CCG investigators hunting, Anteiku family, centipede torture, "the world is wrong", tragedy born from misunderstanding
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
One party member becomes a half-ghoul after an accident—human mind, ghoul hunger, unable to eat normal food without vomiting. They must hide their nature while working at Anteiku coffee shop, a sanctuary for peaceful ghouls trying to coexist with humans. But the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul) hunts them, seeing all ghouls as monsters to exterminate. It's a story about identity, humanity, and whether understanding can bridge the gap between predator and prey.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Ghouls have regenerating kagune weapons; CCG investigators wield quinque (ghoul-based weapons). Combat is brutal.
*   **Investigation:** Hiding ghoul identity requires constant deception. Discovery means death.
*   **Consequences:** Killing humans or ghouls has heavy moral weight. Hunger mechanics threaten control.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A tragic descent from innocence to monster to something between.

*   **Act I — Awakening (Sessions 1–3):** One character becomes half-ghoul, learns to survive, finds Anteiku sanctuary. The world seems salvageable.
*   **Act II — The Doves (Sessions 4–8):** CCG investigators (Doves) hunt ghouls systematically. The party witnesses both ghoul atrocities and CCG brutality. Moral lines blur.
*   **Act III — Aogiri Tree (Sessions 9–12):** Radical ghoul organization kidnaps and tortures the half-ghoul. They're broken, rebuilt, and forced to accept their monstrous nature.
*   **Act IV — Tragedy (Sessions 13–15):** CCG raids Anteiku, destroying the sanctuary. The half-ghoul transforms into "Centipede" through trauma. Final battle leaves only survivors, no winners.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — "Tragedy"
*   One character is attacked by a ghoul named Rize, critically injured.

### Session 2 — "Incubation"
*   Starving and desperate, they nearly attack a human before another ghoul intervenes.
*   They're brought to Anteiku coffee shop—sanctuary for peaceful ghouls.

**Escalation:** Being a ghoul means killing. There's no way around it.

### Session 5 — "Scars"
*   The party meets Touka, a teenage ghoul attending high school while hiding her nature.
*   She teaches: "We're not protagonists. We're just trying to survive in a world that hates us."
**Escalation:** Ghouls are born this way. They didn't choose to need human flesh.

### Session 6 — "Cloudburst"
*   A ghoul child's mother is killed by CCG. Anteiku takes her in.
*   The half-ghoul questions: "Is this really how it has to be?"
**Escalation:** Innocent ghouls exist. CCG doesn't differentiate.

### Session 7 — "Captivity"

**Escalation:** Both factions dehumanize the other. Understanding is impossible.

### Session 8 — "Circular"

**Escalation:** Peaceful coexistence is rejected by extremists on both sides.

### Session 10 — "Centipede"
*   The half-ghoul is tortured by Yamori, a sadistic ghoul.
*   He forces them to count backwards from 1000 by 7s while mutilating them.
**Escalation:** "992, 985, 978..." Sanity breaks. They must embrace monstrosity to survive.

### Session 11 — "White"
*   The half-ghoul's hair turns white from trauma. They accept their ghoul nature.
*   "I'm not wrong. The world is wrong." They become Centipede—brutal and efficient.
**Escalation:** Trauma transforms identity. They're no longer trying to stay human.

### Session 12 — "Vanishing"
*   Anteiku prepares for CCG raid. The sanctuary will be destroyed.
*   Manager Yoshimura reveals he's the legendary ghoul the CCG has hunted for decades.
**Escalation:** Even peaceful ghouls have violent pasts. No one is innocent.

### Session 13 — "Deluge"
*   CCG raids Anteiku with overwhelming force. Arima—the strongest investigator—arrives.
*   The party fights desperately to protect the sanctuary.
**Escalation:** Apocalyptic urban combat. Friends die. The coffee shop burns.

### Session 14 — "Poker"
*   The half-ghoul faces Arima, who is impossibly strong.
*   They're defeated, seemingly killed, but survival comes at tremendous cost.
**Escalation:** Even embracing power isn't enough. Some enemies are unbeatable.

### Session 15 — "Ken"
*   Aftermath. Anteiku is destroyed. Some ghouls escaped; others died.
*   The half-ghoul, now Centipede, vows to create a world where ghouls and humans can coexist.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **identity and coexistence in a world of predator and prey**. Can someone be both human and ghoul? Can understanding bridge the gap when survival requires one side to eat the other? The campaign explores dehumanization, the cycle of violence, and whether tragedy can be broken. Neither side is evil—both are trapped by biology and fear.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Hunger Mechanics**
*   The half-ghoul must feed on human flesh regularly or suffer penalties and risk frenzy.

### 2. **Kakugan Activation**
*   When using ghoul powers, one eye turns red-black. Must hide this in public.

### 3. **Kagune Combat**
*   Biological weapons with different types—ukaku (wings), koukaku (armor), rinkaku (tentacles), bikaku (tail).

### 4. **Sanity/Humanity Track**
*   Balancing human morality with ghoul nature. Too far either way causes problems.

### 5. **CCG Investigation**
*   CCG tracks ghouls by kagune patterns. Repeated use in one area increases heat.
