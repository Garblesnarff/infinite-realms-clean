**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Police Procedural / British Occult
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **10-12**
**Tone (keywords):** British wit, architectural magic, river gods, bureaucratic occult, London history, police investigation
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party consists of London Metropolitan Police officers recruited into The Folly—Britain's last official wizarding institution, housed in a Russell Square townhouse. Apprenticed to Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, they learn magic through Newtonian principles while investigating supernatural crimes: ghost murders, river spirit politics, and rogue practitioners. As they uncover a conspiracy involving the Faceless Man who weaponizes ghosts and demons, they must navigate the complex politics of London's rivers (Father Thames and Mother Thames's warring families), genius loci of neighborhoods, and ancient entities that predate human civilization. In London's hidden world, architecture has memory, rivers have personalities, and magic follows scientific laws.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of investigation, revelation, and confrontation with an ancient enemy.

*   **Act I — Apprenticeship (Sessions 1-6):** The party witnesses a supernatural crime and is recruited into The Folly by Nightingale. They learn the basics of magic—forma (mental discipline), impello (kinetic force), and lux (light)—while investigating ghost-related murders. They're introduced to London's hidden community: the Rivers (anthropomorphic personifications), Quiet People (wood spirits), and various fae. Their investigations reveal someone is creating weaponized ghosts and summoning demons into London, leaving behind a "jazz vampire" signature.
*   **Act II — River Warfare (Sessions 7-12):** The party becomes embroiled in the conflict between Father Thames (conservative god of the upper Thames) and Mother Thames (younger goddess of the lower Thames and her many sons and daughters). A series of murders targets river spirits, threatening to destabilize London's supernatural geography. They discover the Faceless Man is exploiting these tensions. Meanwhile, they must pass their magical "O-levels" and begin specialized training. They learn London's architecture holds magical imprints—buildings remember their history.
*   **Act III — The Faceless Man (Sessions 13-20):** The party discovers the Faceless Man's true identity—a practitioner trained before WWII who survived and seeks to reshape British magic. His plans involve binding Greater London's genius loci, controlling the rivers, and creating a magical catastrophe that would give him godlike power over the city. The final confrontation takes place across multiple London locations, requiring the party to ally with rivers, ghosts, and even ancient Roman entities. They must stop him before he completes a ritual that would kill millions and remake London in his image.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of tradition versus modernity, science and magic as complementary not opposed, the weight of history and memory, and duty to community. It asks: Can magic be integrated into modern society? What responsibility comes with power? How do you honor the past while building the future? The central conflict pits the party's desire to modernize magical law enforcement against villains who seek to exploit or destroy the supernatural community, while navigating complex politics among immortal beings.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Newtonian Magic**
*   Magic follows scientific principles—it can be studied, measured, taught
*   Basic forms: Forma (mental discipline), Impello (kinetic force), Lux (light), Ignus (fire), Aqua (water)
*   Advanced practitioners can create complex forma for specialized effects
*   Magic disrupts technology—active casting causes electronics to fail

### 2. **Architectural Memory**
*   Buildings and places remember their history
*   Practitioners can "read" architecture to learn past events
*   Certain styles (modernist, brutalist) can trap and redirect magical energy
*   Genius loci (place spirits) emerge from significant locations

### 3. **River Politics**
*   Rivers are anthropomorphic personifications with territories
*   Father Thames (traditional, conservative) vs. Mother Thames (modern, numerous children)
*   River gods can grant blessings and demand respect
*   Polluting or disrespecting a river has supernatural consequences

### 4. **Vestigia**
*   Magical traces left behind by supernatural events
*   Experienced practitioners can sense and analyze vestigia
*   Each practitioner has a unique "signature" in their magic
*   Crime scenes retain magical evidence that can be investigated

### 5. **The Sight**
*   Practitioners can perceive supernatural entities and magic
*   Seeing the true nature of powerful beings is dangerous
*   Some creatures are invisible to normal perception
*   Must learn to filter supernatural stimuli in magical areas

### 6. **Magical O-Levels and A-Levels**
*   Formal examination system for apprentice progress
*   O-levels cover basic forms and theory
*   A-levels test advanced techniques and combat magic
*   Failure means remedial training; success grants authority

### 7. **Little Crocodiles**
*   Apprentices and practitioners form a community
*   Share information, resources, and backup
*   Informal but crucial support network
*   Breaking community trust has serious social consequences

### 8. **Formae Bonds**
*   Some advanced magic requires linked casting
*   Practitioners can share magical "bandwidth"
*   Creating permanent magical connections with allies
*   Risk: damage to one affects all linked casters
