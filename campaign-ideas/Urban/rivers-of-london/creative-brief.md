# Creative Brief: Rivers of London

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Contemporary British Urban Fantasy (Rivers of London-inspired)

Inspired by the architectural and historical richness of *Rivers of London* with British police procedural aesthetics meeting classical magical traditions. This style captures modern London's layers of history, the personification of rivers and places, and magic treated as a science rather than mysticism.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize London's Architecture:** Georgian townhouses, Victorian railways, modernist towers, ancient Roman walls layered together
*   **Magic as Science:** Clean, geometric magical effects rather than mystical swirls—force, light, and elemental manifestations
*   **Police Procedural Realism:** High-visibility vests, police tape, notebooks, modern British coppers doing impossible jobs
*   **River Spirits and Genius Loci:** Anthropomorphic personifications of waterways, neighborhoods manifest as people

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** British wit, architectural magic, police procedural, London history, river gods, modernist brutalism, Georgian elegance
*   **Feeling:** The juxtaposition of mundane police work with impossible magic. Ancient powers in modern settings. History living alongside the present.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **London Streets:** Gray stone, red brick, black cabs, red buses, police blue
*   **Magic Effects:** Clean, bright colors—white light, blue force fields, orange fire, no mystic swirls
*   **Rivers:** Blues and greens for water spirits, naturalistic but slightly idealized
*   **Prompt Example:** "...London street with Georgian townhouses in gray stone and red brick. A police officer in modern uniform with high-visibility vest gestures, blue-white light emanating geometrically from their hand. Red double-decker bus in background. Overcast British sky."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Practitioners:** Modern police uniforms with notebooks and radios, professional appearance
*   **Nightingale:** Elegant 1940s suits, impeccably dressed, ageless appearance
*   **River Gods:** Beautiful people in flowing clothes matching their rivers' character, subtle supernatural elements
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Black British police constable in modern Metropolitan Police uniform with high-vis vest. Holding a police notebook in one hand while blue geometric light forms a shield in the other. Professional, competent expression. London street behind them."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Folly:** Georgian townhouse, mix of modern amenities and antique decor, extensive library
*   **London Landmarks:** Recognize locations—Covent Garden, Baker Street, Thames bridges, modernist towers
*   **Underground:** Victorian tunnels, tiled stations, hidden chambers, Roman ruins
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a Georgian townhouse library. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes. Modern desk with computer. Victorian architectural details. Large windows overlooking Russell Square. Elegant but lived-in."

**5. Magic and Architecture:**
*   **Geometric Magic:** Force effects as clean lines and planes, not mystical energy
*   **Architectural Power:** Buildings glowing with trapped magical energy, especially modernist concrete
*   **River Manifestations:** Water spirits appearing as beautiful people, subtle connection to their waterways
*   **Prompt Example:** "A modernist concrete building with geometric brutalist architecture. Faint blue-white light traces the building's lines and corners, showing trapped magical energy. The structure itself seems slightly more alive than it should be. Overcast London sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **British Weather:** Overcast skies, diffused light, rain creating reflections
*   **Magic Light:** Clean, scientific—not mystical glow but precise illumination
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by overcast London daylight, creating soft shadows. When magic activates, clean white light emanates geometrically, like architectural lighting fixtures. Rain on pavement creates reflections. Realistic British weather."

## Voice

A dry, witty British voice with police procedural precision meeting architectural and historical fascination. The pacing is measured and observational with occasional bursts of action. The tone shifts between coppers' gallows humor, genuine wonder at magic, and methodical investigation. There's an underlying appreciation for London's layers of history. Slightly nerdy about architecture and jazz. Role: The voice of a modern British copper learning impossible things.
