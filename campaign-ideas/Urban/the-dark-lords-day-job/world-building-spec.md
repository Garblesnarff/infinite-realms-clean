They emerge in modern-day New York City, stripped of most of their powers and trapped in mortal forms. To survive in this baffling world of rent, jobs, and smartphones, the once-feared Dark Lord must take a job at McRonald's fast food restaurant while plotting his return to power. But as they adapt to mundane life—dealing with difficult customers, paying bills, and navigating human relationships—the party begins to question whether conquest is truly their destiny, or if they've found something more valuable in this strange new world.
