## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Great Resignation
In the beginning of the realm of Ente Isla, there was the Architect, a primordial deity of immense power and cosmic boredom. After setting the laws of physics and magic, it grew weary of the predictable cycle of creation and destruction. In an event known as the "Great Resignation," the Architect simply clocked out, leaving behind a power vacuum and a single, cryptic out-of-office message: "Figure it out yourselves." This act shattered the divine order, creating two opposing forces: **The Law of Narrative**, a metaphysical force compelling beings into heroic and villainous roles to give the world meaning, and **The Entropy of the Void**, a force seeking to erase the now-unsupervised creation. The Demon Lord Maou was not born of evil, but was an ambitious being pushed by the Law of Narrative into the "villain" role. The Hero Emilia was the world's antibody, a mortal empowered by the same Law to fill the "hero" role. Their war was, in essence, the world's desperate attempt to write its own story. The portal that sent them to Earth was not a targeted banishment, but a cosmic "wrong number," a glitch in the fabric of a reality that had lost its divine IT support.

### Timeline of Ente Isla & Earth
1.  **-5000 Y (The Great Resignation):** The Architect vanishes. Magic becomes chaotic.
2.  **-4000 Y (The Narrative Schism):** The Law of Narrative and the Entropy of the Void emerge as opposing forces. The first "Heroes" and "Villains" are created by cosmic circumstance.
3.  **-1000 Y (The Rise of the Demon Clan):** Maou's ancestors unite disparate "monster" races under a single banner, seeking stability in a world of forced conflict.
4.  **-50 Y (Maou's Ascension):** Maou Satan, a charismatic and brilliant strategist, becomes the new Demon Lord. He seeks not to destroy, but to conquer and rule the world to end the pointless cycle of war.
5.  **-10 Y (The Grand Campaign):** Maou launches his final war, conquering three of the four continents of Ente Isla.
6.  **-1 Y (The Hero's Rise):** Emilia Justina, a simple farm girl, is chosen by the Law of Narrative. She is granted the holy sword "Better Half" and begins her quest.
7.  **Day 0 (The Fall):** Emilia and her companions push Maou back to his citadel. In a final, desperate gambit, Maou opens a portal to another realm to escape and regroup. The portal malfunctions, pulling him and his general Alciel to Earth.
8.  **Day 1 (The Discovery):** Maou and Alciel discover they are in modern-day Tokyo (or NYC, for campaign flavor), their magic reserves critically low.
9.  **Day 30 (The Application):** After a month of near-starvation and confusion, Maou lands a job at "MgRonald's."
10. **Present Day:** Maou has been promoted to Shift Manager. He has a budget, a tiny apartment, and a new nemesis: the lunch rush. The Hero Emilia arrives, equally powerless and confused.

### The Metaphysical Conflict
The core conflict is **Narrative vs. Mundanity**. On Ente Isla, beings are forced into epic roles. On Earth, the Law of Narrative is weak, replaced by the "Law of the Grind"—the need to work, pay rent, and find meaning in small, everyday moments. The party's struggle is to reconcile their epic past with their mundane present. Is true power conquering a world, or is it making it to the end of a double shift with your sanity intact? The Entropy of the Void, meanwhile, sees Earth's relative lack of magic as a "weak point" in the multiverse, a back door to unraveling all of creation.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### 1. The Daily Grind
*   **Stability Score (0-10):** Represents your mundane life's stability. Starts at 5.
*   **End of Session:** Roll 1d20 + your primary job skill (e.g., Performance for Maou).
    *   *20+:* Promotion! +2 Stability, bonus gold.
    *   *15-19:* Good work. +1 Stability.
    *   *10-14:* You're fine. No change.
    *   *5-9:* Reprimand. -1 Stability.
    *   *1-4:* You're fired! -2 Stability, lose job.
*   **Benefits:** High stability can be spent for favors (e.g., a coworker covers your shift so you can fight a demon). Low stability causes random negative events (e.g., your landlord evicts you).

### 2. Power Deprivation & Mana
*   **Mana Pool:** Characters have a small pool of Mana Points (equal to their level). Casting a spell of 1st-3rd level costs 1 point, 4th-6th costs 3, 7th+ costs 5.
*   **Recovery:** Regain 1d4 Mana per long rest. Can also consume "magical" items (like extremely spicy food or artisanal coffee) for small boosts.
*   **Mundane Solutions:** GMs should reward players for using clever, non-magical solutions to problems (e.g., using a fire extinguisher instead of *Cone of Cold*).

### 3. The Veil & Public Suspicion
*   **Suspicion Meter (0-100):** A group meter for the party.
*   **Gaining Suspicion:** Using obvious magic in front of mortals, leaving supernatural evidence, being reported to the police.
*   **Thresholds:**
    *   *25:* A conspiracy theorist ("Mad" Eddie) starts following you.
    *   *50:* A mundane authority (Det. Kurosawa) starts an official investigation.
    *   *75:* The Magister's Conclave intervenes directly and forcefully.
    *   *100:* The Veil breaks in your neighborhood. Mass panic. Game-changing consequences.
