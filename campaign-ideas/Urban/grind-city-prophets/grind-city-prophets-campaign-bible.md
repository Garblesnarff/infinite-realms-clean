# Grind City Prophets [CAMPAIGN: Urban Fantasy]

## Core Concept [CONCEPT: High]
In the sprawling, magically charged metropolis known as "Grind City," magic is real but hidden, seeping into the cracks of everyday life. Neon lights illuminate ancient runes, and forgotten gods whisper from subway tunnels. A group of street-level mages, diviners, and occultists, known as "Prophets," use their abilities to navigate the urban underworld, solve supernatural mysteries, and protect their turf from rival magical factions, mundane authorities, and the insidious influence of the city itself. They are the eyes and ears of the magical streets, fighting for survival and a semblance of order in a world where the mundane and the mystical constantly collide.

## Setting [SETTING: Gritty Urban Magic]
Grind City is a sprawling, perpetually active metropolis, a concrete jungle where skyscrapers pierce a sky often hazy with pollution and residual magic. The architecture is a mix of crumbling historical buildings and gleaming modern towers. Magic isn't flashy; it's subtle, pervasive, and often dangerous. It manifests in graffiti that shifts, shadows that whisper, and the strange coincidences that guide the Prophets. The aesthetic is gritty urban realism blended with subtle, pervasive magic, where every alleyway holds a secret and every street corner is a potential magical hotspot.

### Locations [LOCATION: Specific]
*   **The Neon Labyrinth (Downtown):** [LOCATION: Commercial District] The bustling, neon-drenched commercial heart of Grind City. It's a place of constant movement, flashing advertisements, and hidden magical ley lines that pulse beneath the asphalt.
*   **The Whispering Walls (Old Town):** [LOCATION: Historic District] The oldest part of the city, with crumbling brick buildings, narrow cobblestone streets, and forgotten catacombs. Ancient magic is strongest here, and the very walls seem to whisper secrets.
*   **The Datasphere Nexus (Corporate Towers):** [LOCATION: Corporate Hub] The gleaming, sterile corporate towers that house the city's financial and technological power. Here, digital magic and corporate espionage intertwine, and data streams are infused with subtle enchantments.
*   **The Shadow Market (Undercity):** [LOCATION: Black Market] A clandestine, shifting market that appears in different locations within the city's forgotten subway tunnels, abandoned warehouses, or deep sewers. It's where magical artifacts, forbidden knowledge, and illicit services are traded.
*   **The Prophet's Sanctuary (Hidden Base):** [LOCATION: Secret Base] A hidden, magically warded safe house for the Prophets, often disguised as a mundane storefront (e.g., a dusty bookstore, a late-night diner). It's a place for planning, research, and healing.

## Factions [FACTION: Magical]
*   **The Grind City Prophets:** [FACTION: Vigilante/Occultists] A loose collective of street-level mages and diviners who use their abilities to protect their neighborhoods, solve supernatural crimes, and maintain a fragile balance in the magical underworld.
