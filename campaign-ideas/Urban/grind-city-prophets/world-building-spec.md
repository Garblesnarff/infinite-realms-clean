# Grind City Prophets - World-Building Specification

## New Babylon

**Setting**: Near-future city-state where collective memory shapes reality. What the majority believes/remembers becomes true through quantum consciousness effect.

**The Consensus**: Reality is maintained by shared belief, managed by Consensus Bureau through propaganda, education, media control, and when necessary, memory editing.

**History**: Founded 50 years ago after catastrophic "Truth Wars" where conflicting narratives literally tore reality apart. Bureau created to prevent recurrence through controlled consensus.

## The Consensus Bureau

**Structure**: Twelve Ministries, each managing aspect of shared reality

**Technology**: Memory editors (erase/implant), broadcast systems (constant propaganda), surveillance network, reality stabilizers

**Methodology**:
1. Monitor for "dangerous truths"
2. Edit memories of witnesses
3. Replace with Bureau-approved narrative
4. Broadcast reinforcement
5. Erase anyone who resists

**Philosophy**: "Controlled truth prevents chaos." Genuinely believe they're protecting society.

**Secret**: The founding Truth Wars were mostly Bureau propaganda—created the problem they claim to solve.

## The Prophets

**Origin**: Street artists who discovered graffiti + skating combos could create "truth anchors" immune to Bureau editing

**Structure**: Decentralized crews, Beat coordinates but doesn't command

**Methodology**:
- Investigate hidden truths
- Create graffiti art encoding those truths
- Use skating combos to charge art with reality-anchoring power
- Tag Ministry buildings to establish permanent truth zones

**Philosophy**: "What we remember freely defines who we are."

**Equipment**: Customized aggressive inline skates (magical mods), spray paint (enchanted formulas), music (Vinyl's disruption frequencies)

## Reality Magic

**Graffiti Art**: Acts as physical anchor for memories/truths. Bureau can't edit areas around completed Prophet art.

**Combo Charging**: Kinetic energy from skating tricks charges art with metaphysical weight. Higher combo = stronger anchor.

**Color Magic**: Each spray color affects specific memory/reality aspects

**Memory Restoration**: People in range of truth anchor spontaneously remember edited events

**Consensus Shift**: Enough truth anchors in area can permanently override Bureau control

## The Silence Squad

**Nature**: Bureau enforcers who erase "reality threats"

**Abilities**:
- Delete people from existence (memory + physical)
- Suppress truth anchors temporarily
- Track Prophet activity
- Silent movement (creepy)

**Members**: Some are true believers, some are blackmailed, some are former Prophets who broke

**Weakness**: Can't operate in completed truth anchor zones

## The Grand Broadcast

**Purpose**: Activate all twelve truth anchors simultaneously, broadcasting un-edited history city-wide

**Effect**: Mass awakening—everyone remembers everything Bureau hid

**Consequence**: Chaos initially (competing truths, trauma revival), but potential for genuine consensus without control

**Requirement**: All twelve Ministries tagged + access to Central Broadcast Tower

## Aggressive Inline Culture

**Style Elements**:
- Grinding (rails, ledges, anything)
- Aerials (spins, grabs off ramps)
- Manuals (balancing for distance)
- Wallrides (vertical surfaces)
- Combos (chaining tricks)

**Prophet Additions**:
- Graffiti while skating
- Musical synchronization
- Reality-defying tricks (impossible physics)
- Crew coordination moves

**Code**:
- Style matters as much as substance
- Share routes and spots
- Protect the crew
- Tag with meaning, not ego
- Resist erasure

## Cultural Details

**Music Integration**:
- Every operation has soundtrack curated by Vinyl
- Different genres for different moods/Ministries
- Music contains coded information
- Rhythm helps coordination
- Beats disrupt Bureau broadcasts

**Art Philosophy**:
- Graffiti isn't vandalism—it's truth-telling
- Every piece tells story
- Color choices meaningful
- Placement strategic
- Beauty attracts attention to message

**Memory as Currency**:
- Trading recalled events
- Protecting precious memories
- Sharing forbidden history
- Remembering the erased

## The Twelve Ministries

Each has unique architecture, security, and thematic graffiti needed:

1. **Truth**: Lies about lies, needs exposure art
2. **Peace**: Military secrets, needs anti-war imagery
3. **Prosperity**: Hidden poverty, needs wealth contrast
4. **Safety**: Surveillance overreach, needs privacy art
5. **Health**: Covered-up epidemics, needs medical truth
6. **Justice**: Wrongful convictions, needs innocence proven
7. **Culture**: Censored art, needs forbidden pieces
8. **Memory**: Deleted history, needs timeline restoration
9. **Unity**: Forced conformity, needs diversity celebration
10. **Freedom**: Illusion of choice, needs true options shown
11. **Reality**: Consensus manipulation, needs objective truth
12. **Consensus**: The whole lie, needs complete revelation

## Mysteries

1. What really happened in the Truth Wars?
2. Who founded the Bureau and why?
3. Can Director Gray's memories be restored?
4. Are there other Prophet cells worldwide?
5. What is New Babylon's true history?
6. Can edited reality edits become truly independent (like Beat)?
7. What happens if ALL memories are restored unfiltered?
8. Is controlled consensus ever justified?
9. Who was Ghost before erasure?
10. What happens after the Grand Broadcast?

These provide campaign depth and post-victory complexity.
