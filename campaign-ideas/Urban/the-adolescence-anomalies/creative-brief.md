# Creative Brief: The Adolescence Anomalies

## Art Style: Modern Supernatural Romance (Bunny Girl Senpai-inspired)

Captures the surreal nature of supernatural manifestations mixed with grounded, realistic character interactions. Modern settings with ethereal, dreamlike supernatural elements.

### Core Principles:

*   **Grounded Reality with Surreal Elements:** Modern, realistic environments with supernatural occurrences that feel dreamlike but logical.
*   **Perception and Absence:** Visual techniques showing invisibility, fading, dual existence.
*   **Coastal Beauty:** The beach and ocean as recurring symbolic elements.

### Detailed Style Guide:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:** Thoughtful, romantic, surreal, emotionally intelligent, melancholic yet hopeful.

**2. Color Palette:** Muted, realistic colors for normal scenes. Ethereal blue-purple glows for syndrome manifestations. Sunset oranges and ocean blues for the beach.

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Mai:** Elegant, mature appearance, often in school uniform or casual clothes. When in bunny costume (first arc), it's provocative but she carries it with dignity.
*   **Sakuta:** Messy dark hair, casual school uniform, tired but sharp eyes.

**4. Backgrounds:** Modern academy, library (quiet and full of books), coastal scenery (beach, ocean, sunset), urban environments.

**5. Lighting:** Natural modern lighting. Supernatural elements glow with ethereal light. Sunset scenes are particularly important for emotional beats.

## Voice

**Narrator Voice:** Thoughtful, modern, and emotionally intelligent. The voice of someone recounting a surreal but genuine love story with philosophical undertones. Calm and measured, with warmth during tender moments. Studio-quality with subtle ambient sounds of ocean waves.
