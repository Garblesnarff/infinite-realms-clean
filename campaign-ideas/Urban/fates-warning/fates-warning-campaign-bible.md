# 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY

### [TAG: LORE_CORE]

**The Origin: The Fractured Probability Engine**
Reality is not a solid construct; it is a consensual hallucination held together by the "Weave of Probability." Magic is not a gift from gods, but a systemic exploit—a glitch in the universal code that allows sentient minds to tug at probability threads. The "Light" seeks to calcify these threads into a rigid, safe, totalitarian timeline (The One True Path), while the "Dark" seeks to unravel them to create personal pocket universes of unchecked desire. Diviners are the debugging tools that gained sentience, cursed to see the source code of the universe and realize that both the compilation and the crash lead to the same void.

**Timeline of the Hidden City**
1.  **1666 - The Great Purge (The Fire):** Officially a baker's accident. In reality, the Light Council burned London to containment-breach a viral probability cascade that threatened to turn the Thames into glass.
2.  **1702 - The founding of the White Ledger:** The Council formalizes the "Magistratum," creating a bureaucracy so dense it generates its own anti-magic field.
3.  **1888 - The Ripper Ascendancy:** A Dark Mage attempts a ritual to transcend time. The Council fails to stop him; an independent cleaner (Arachne) intervenes, but the trauma scars the London ley lines forever.
4.  **1915 - The Zeppelin Silence:** A German magical strike group freezes time over Chelsea for 14 hours. The Council erases the memory from the mundane populace, creating the "Missing Tuesday" phenomenon.
5.  **1952 - The Smog of Souls:** The Great Smog was actually a necromantic ventilation failure from the Underground.
6.  **1982 - The Digital shift:** Magic begins infecting early computing. The first "Technomancer" is born and immediately vaporized by Richard Drakh to keep the monopoly on power.
7.  **1999 - The Millennial Glitch (Weird):** For 10 seconds on New Year's Eve, gravity inverted in Soho. 400 people fell into the sky. The Council replaced them with golems made of memory and rainwater.
8.  **2012 - The Olympic Offering (Weird):** The stadium was built as a massive containment circle for a sleeping earth-elemental beneath Stratford.
9.  **2020 - The Silence of the Wards:** A global dampening field mysteriously triggered, weakening all Light magic for a year. Dark mages expanded aggressively.
10. **Present Day - The Fraying:** Probability threads are snapping. Déjà vu is becoming a public health crisis.

**The "Why": The Probability Entropy**
Every act of magic steals probability from the future to power the present. The universe is running out of "luck." The conflict isn't just Good vs. Evil; it is Stasis (Light) vs. Acceleration (Dark) in a dying engine.
