# Creative Brief: Fate's Warning

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: London Magical Realism with Probability Visualization (Alex Verus-inspired)

Inspired by the morally complex magic of *Alex Verus* where London hides mage politics, divination shows future paths, and Light versus Dark is not clear-cut. This style captures probability paths, magical London, and the weight of impossible choices.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Probability Paths:** Visual representation of futures branching, choices visible
*   **London Setting:** Modern British capital hiding magical community
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Neither Light nor Dark is clearly good, both have corruption
*   **Divination as Combat:** Seeing attacks before they happen, navigating probability

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Diviner mage, London politics, probability paths, moral compromise, no good choices, dark past
*   **Feeling:** Seeing disasters approach with no way to prevent them. Choosing least-bad options. Light and Dark both corrupt.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Probability Paths:** Translucent possible futures in blues, whites, ghostly overlays
*   **London:** Modern British grays, brick, urban environment
*   **Magic:** Subtle—magic is internal and mental, not flashy
*   **Prompt Example:** "...London street with modern architecture. A diviner stands at intersection, ghostly probability paths visible around them showing possible futures. Blue-white translucent figures show what might happen. Choosing between bad options. Urban magical realism."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Diviner:** Ordinary appearance, casual clothes, alert eyes constantly assessing
*   **Light Mages:** Professional, authoritative, hiding corruption beneath respectability
*   **Dark Mages:** Power-focused, not necessarily evil-looking, pragmatic
*   **Prompt Example:** "A male diviner in practical jacket and jeans, Camden aesthetic. Alert eyes that see too much. Around him, ghostly probability paths show possible futures. A Light Council mage in professional attire approaches—respectable but hiding corruption. London street."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Arcana Emporium:** Small magic shop in Camden, books and artifacts
*   **Council Chambers:** Formal British government aesthetic, hiding political maneuvering
*   **Elsewhere:** Pocket dimensions, each unique to creator's personality
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of magic shop in Camden, London. Shelves with magical items and books. Comfortable but modest. Through window, London street visible. Workspace for independent mage avoiding politics. Lived-in, practical space."

**5. Magic and Combat:**
*   **Divination in Combat:** Seeing attacks seconds before they happen, ghostly preview of movements
*   **Elemental Magic:** Other mages with flashier powers—fire, force, life
*   **Probability Manipulation:** Paths shifting, chances altering
*   **Prompt Example:** "Combat scene—diviner sees ghostly versions of opponent's attacks seconds ahead, dodging before they happen. Blue probability paths show possible futures. Fire mage attacks, but diviner already moving. London alley. Tactical precognitive combat."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **London Weather:** Overcast, realistic British lighting
*   **Probability Glow:** Futures show as subtle glow or ghostly overlay
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by overcast London daylight. Around the diviner, ghostly probability paths glow faintly in blue-white. Multiple futures visible simultaneously. Realistic lighting with subtle magical overlay. Urban magical realism aesthetic."

## Voice

A weary, analytical voice that has seen too many bad futures. The pacing is tactical and methodical. The tone shifts between noir investigation, tactical combat analysis, and exhausted acceptance of moral compromise. There's an underlying theme of impossible choices. British dry wit masking pain. Role: The voice of someone who sees disasters coming and can only choose which to face.
