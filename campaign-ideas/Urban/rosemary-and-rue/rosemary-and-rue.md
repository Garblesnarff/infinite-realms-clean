**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In the San Francisco Bay Area, the party includes a changeling knight—half-fae, half-human private investigator navigating the treacherous politics of hidden Faerie courts. Cursed by a dying friend to solve her murder or die, they're drawn into conspiracies involving the Daoine Sidhe (high fae nobility), Cait Sidhe (cat fae), Kitsune tricksters, and ancient bloodlines. As they uncover plots to overthrow the kingdom's balance, they must use blood magic to glimpse past events, navigate fae laws where lying is impossible but deception thrives, and survive assassination attempts from those who view changelings as beneath notice. In this world, blood reveals truth, fae bargains are binding, and being caught between two worlds means belonging to neither.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of murder mysteries, faerie politics, and blood inheritance.

*   **Act I — The Curse (Sessions 1-6):** The party's changeling investigator receives a death curse from Evening Winterrose, a Daoine Sidhe countess: solve her murder in three days or die. This forces them back into Faerie after years avoiding it. They navigate Bay Area fae politics: Queen of Mists rules tyrannically, the false queen's court oppresses changelings, and ancient bloodlines hold power. They learn about hope chests containing fae treasures, blood magic that shows past events, and the dangers of fae nobles who view changelings as disposable. Investigation reveals the murder connects to artifacts of power and succession plots.
*   **Act II — Court Politics (Sessions 7-13):** The party uncovers deeper conspiracies—someone seeks the throne of the Mists. They're drawn into conflicts between fae races: Daoine Sidhe nobility, Cait Sidhe cat-shifters, Selkies with their stolen skins, Kitsune fox spirits, and bridge trolls. They discover their changeling heritage connects to powerful bloodlines thought extinct. The false queen's tyranny intensifies, forcing them to choose between survival and rebellion. They use blood magic increasingly, tasting blood to see memories, but it comes with prices. Assassinations and political maneuverings accelerate.
*   **Act III — True Queen Rising (Sessions 14-20):** The false queen is revealed—an impostor has ruled the Mists for a century. The party must gather evidence, allies, and power to challenge her while preventing fae civil war. They discover their blood connects to Firstborn—original children of Oberon and Titania—granting unexpected power. Final confrontations involve exposing the false queen before all courts, surviving her attempts to silence them, and potentially claiming titles and positions themselves. Some endings involve becoming nobility, others remaining free investigators, others discovering they're heirs to ancient powers. The balance between mortal and fae worlds reshapes.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of identity between two worlds, truth versus deception in fae culture, blood heritage versus chosen family, and the cost of power. It asks: What defines you—blood or choice? Can you trust those who cannot lie but excel at deception? Is nobility worth the cost? The central conflict pits the party against fae nobles who view them as lesser beings, while they discover their blood makes them more powerful than anyone believed.
