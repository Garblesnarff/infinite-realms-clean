This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Bay Area Faerie Noir (October Daye-inspired)

Inspired by the fae politics and blood magic of *October Daye* where San Francisco Bay Area hides faerie courts, changelings navigate impossible politics, and blood reveals truth. This style captures urban fantasy mixed with classical fae aesthetics and noir investigation.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Fae Beauty and Danger:** Impossibly beautiful but alien, elegant but deadly
*   **Bay Area Setting:** San Francisco, Oakland, recognizable locations hiding fae magic
*   **Blood Magic:** Using blood to see truth, investigation through supernatural means
*   **Political Intrigue:** Court politics, noble houses, social hierarchy visible in dress and bearing

## Voice

A weary, determined voice of someone belonging to neither world. The pacing is investigative with bursts of action. The tone shifts between noir detective narration, wonder at fae beauty, and exhaustion from endless politics. There's an underlying theme of finding family by choice. Sarcastic but caring. Role: The voice of a changeling caught between worlds.
