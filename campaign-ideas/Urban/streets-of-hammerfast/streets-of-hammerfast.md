**Title:** Streets of Hammerfast
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Crime Drama / Investigation / Institutional Decay
**Estimated Length:** Very Long Campaign — 25–35 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **10–12**
**Tone (keywords):** institutional failure, moral complexity, systemic corruption, street-level grit, interconnected systems
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the decaying port city of Hammerfast, the drug trade has hollowed out entire neighborhoods while institutions meant to protect the people—the City Watch, the docks, the schools, the temples—fail or actively contribute to the decline. The players can be members of a special Watch unit investigating the drug trade, street-level dealers trying to survive, dockworkers fighting corruption, or journalists exposing the truth. Across multiple seasons, they'll see how every level of society is connected, how good intentions fail against systemic rot, and how the game stays the same even when the players change.

## Story Arc (Very Long Campaign — 25–35 sessions)

A multi-season epic examining institutional failure from every angle.

*   **Season 1 — The Streets (Sessions 1–7):** A special Major Crimes unit is assembled to bring down a major drug organization led by the mysterious "Avon" Barksdale. Players conduct surveillance, build cases, and learn that the drug trade is more complex than simple good versus evil. Street dealers are trapped by circumstance, violence is survival, and the law has too many holes.
*   **Season 2 — The Docks (Sessions 8–14):** The investigation expands to the waterfront, where smuggling operations bring drugs and contraband into the city. Players encounter dockworkers struggling against automation and corruption, discover human trafficking, and see how economic decay drives crime. The institutions that could help are compromised.
*   **Season 3 — The Politics (Sessions 15–21):** A reformist politician promises to clean up Hammerfast, but players learn that politics requires compromise, funding requires corruption, and real change threatens powerful interests. Police reform, education funding, and drug legalization become complex moral questions with no perfect answers.
*   **Season 4 — The Schools (Sessions 22–28):** Players see how institutional failure affects children. Underfunded schools, kids pushed into the drug trade, teachers who care but can't help. The cycle continues as a new generation is failed by the same broken systems.
*   **Season 5 — The Media (Sessions 29–35):** A final examination of who tells the story. Journalists investigate corruption but face pressure from publishers. The truth is complicated, but headlines demand simplicity. In the end, the players must decide: do they work within broken systems or burn them down?

    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was exiled to a do-nothing unit for years for pursuing cases his superiors didn't want solved. He knows the system punishes real police work.

2.  **Jimmy McNulty** — *The Insubordinate Detective*
    *   **Role:** A brilliant but self-destructive investigator who can't stop chasing cases even when ordered to.
    *   **Personality:** Charming, arrogant, drinks too much, ruins his personal life for the job. Can't let things go.

    *   **Role:** Leader of a major drug organization. A traditionalist who values loyalty and the street code.
    *   **Personality:** Charismatic, loyal to his people, violent when necessary, but lives by a code. More soldier than businessman.

    *   **Personality:** Intelligent, educated, takes economics classes, sees the drug trade as a business to be optimized.

    *   **Role:** A stick-up man who robs drug dealers. Lives by a code: never harm civilians, always keep his word.
    *   **Personality:** Fearless, principled in his own way, openly gay in a hostile environment, whistles when he walks.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores how systems fail people and how good intentions are crushed by institutional inertia and corruption. The central question: "Can individuals make a difference when the systems they work within are fundamentally broken?" Players must navigate impossible moral choices—work within corrupt systems and compromise, or fight them and be destroyed. There are no clean victories, only varying degrees of failure and small moments of human connection and dignity.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Case Build** (Investigation System)
*   Building legal cases requires evidence, testimony, and paperwork. Players must gather all three.
*   Cases can be thrown out on technicalities, witnesses can recant, evidence can be ruled inadmissible.
*   Simply knowing someone is guilty is not enough—proving it legally is harder.

### 2. **Institutional Pressure**
*   Players face pressure from superiors who care about statistics (arrest numbers) over substance (real cases).
*   Going against orders grants effectiveness but costs political capital.
*   Running out of political capital can mean reassignment, demotion, or forced retirement.

### 3. **The Game Remains the Same**
*   When players take down one criminal, another rises to fill the void.
*   The drug trade is a hydra—cutting off one head spawns two more.
*   Success is measured not in winning, but in small victories and protecting individuals.

### 4. **Perspective Shifts** (Optional)
*   Different seasons allow players to take on different roles: detectives, criminals, dockworkers, teachers, journalists.
*   This shows how the same problems look from every angle.
*   Previous player characters may become NPCs in later seasons, showing their long-term fates.

### 5. **No Perfect Answers**
*   Moral choices are complex: arrest a dealer and send them to prison (destroying their family), or let them go (allowing the drug trade to continue).
*   Reform requires funding; funding requires corruption. Purity means failure.
*   The campaign rewards grappling with complexity, not seeking simple solutions.
