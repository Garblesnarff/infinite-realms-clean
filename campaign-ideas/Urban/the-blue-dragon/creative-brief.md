# The Blue Dragon - Creative Brief

## Visual Tone
Southwestern desert aesthetic meets fantasy alchemy. Wide vistas, harsh sunlight, meth lab aesthetic translated to magical laboratories. Color transformation: Warm earth tones becoming sickly chemical greens and blues.

**Colors**: Desert tan, sky blue, chemical green, blood red, methamphetamine blue

## Music
Modern tense strings, percussion. Silence in key moments. "Crystal Blue Persuasion" equivalent. Musical cues for transformation and consequences.

## Voice Direction
**Walter**: Measured teacher becoming menacing criminal. "Say my name."
**Jesse**: Young, damaged, increasingly broken. "Yeah, science!"
**Gus**: Controlled, professional, terrifying when mask slips
**Saul**: Fast-talking, comedic relief, underlying desperation

## Cinematic Moments
- First kill (self-defense)
- "I am the one who knocks" speech
- Face-off with Gus
- Hank's realization
- Final resolution in snow/desert
