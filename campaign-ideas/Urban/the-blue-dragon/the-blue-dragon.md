# The Blue Dragon
## *"I am the one who knocks"*

### Campaign Overview

A brilliant alchemist diagnosed with terminal illness begins manufacturing illegal magical narcotics to secure his family's financial future. The party can be: (1) The alchemist and his associates descending into the criminal underworld, or (2) Law enforcement pursuing the mysterious "Blue Dragon" whose products are flooding the market. Either perspective tells a tragic story of moral decay, consequences, and transformation.

If playing as criminals: Watch good people make terrible choices and become monsters while convincing themselves it's justified. If playing as law enforcement: Hunt someone who's always three steps ahead while dealing with bureaucracy and moral grey areas. Either way, witness how pride, desperation, and talent combine to create tragedy.

This is a descent arc. Characters will change. Lines will be crossed. And at the end, everyone will ask: Was it worth it?

### Core Themes
- **Transformation**: From protagonist to antagonist
- **Pride and Ego**: Talent becoming toxic
- **Consequences**: Every action creates reactions
- **Moral Relativism**: How far is too far?
- **Family vs. Self**: Justification of selfishness
- **The Slippery Slope**: How monsters are made
- **Chemistry as Power**: Knowledge as ultimate weapon

### Unique Mechanics

**Chemistry System**

- Ingredients, equipment, technique matter
- Risk: Explosions, toxic exposure, magical corruption

**Moral Descent Tracker**

- Mechanical changes reflect moral ones
- Powers grow darker, corruption visible
- NPCs react to transformation
- Point of no return mechanically enforced

**Heat and Attention**
- Actions draw law enforcement scrutiny

### Victory Conditions

**For Criminals**: There is no victory. Only degrees of loss. Best outcome: Family provided for, minimal casualties, escape possible. Likely outcome: Death, imprisonment, or permanent exile.

**For Law Enforcement**: Catch the Blue Dragon, but personal cost high. Brother-in-law revelation destroys family. Justice served tastes like ashes.

### Defeat Conditions

**For Criminals**: Death, capture, or losing everything that mattered. "I won" while losing family, friends, soul.

**For Law Enforcement**: Blue Dragon escapes. Or caught too late. Or catches them but can't prove it legally.

This is Breaking Bad: Tragedy of pride, transformation, and consequences. Nobody wins. Everyone loses. The question is only: How much?
