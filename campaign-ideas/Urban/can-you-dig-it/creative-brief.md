## Voice

A street-smart narration style mixing tough-guy vernacular with almost mythic journey language. The pacing is urgent during chases, contemplative during brief rests. The tone shifts between gritty urban realism and stylized gang cinema, treating the journey as both survival story and epic. DJ interludes provide omniscient perspective. Role: The voice of urban legend being born, of warriors proving themselves through one impossible night.
