# Campaign Bible: Can You Dig It

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The City's Heartbeat
In the beginning, the world was a single, perfect **Cosmic City**, holding within it the promise of infinite progress and connection. But the Cosmic City was fragile, and in a moment of cosmic carelessness, it was struck by a rogue **Cosmic Ray**, causing it to split into countless fragments. From its shattered core, the world was born, a place of constant decay, hidden layers, and rebirth. The "Dig" is not just the residue of divine creation; it is the dust of countless shattered foundations, the memory of every lost street. The "It" is not just the rising sun; it is the lingering echo of the Cosmic City's fury, a force that seeks to gather the scattered fragments of the City and restore the world to its original, perfect state. The conflict arises because the Cosmic City's fury is so profound that it threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of urban remembrance, burning away all that is, to restore all that was.

### Timeline of Events
1.  **-10,000 Y (The Shattering):** The Cosmic City is struck by a Cosmic Ray, creating the world and its cycle of decay and hidden layers.
2.  **-8000 Y (The First Foundation):** The first great civilization rises and falls, its urban dust becoming the foundation of the world.
3.  **-6000 Y (The Layer Plague):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic City's fury sweeps the world, causing all beings to remember every lost street, driving many to madness.
4.  **-4000 Y (The City Cult):** Mortals discover the power of hidden layers and form the City Cult, seeking to gather the scattered fragments of the City.
5.  **-2000 Y (The Great Collapse):** A rogue City Cultist attempts to force a premature rebirth, resulting in a catastrophic event that causes all beings to forget their past for a century.
6.  **-1000 Y (The Layer-Weavers):** Mortals learn to manipulate the Dig, weaving it into powerful artifacts and wondrous compounds.
7.  **-500 Y (The Echo-Wars):** A powerful echo of the Cosmic City's fury causes all beings to remember every lost street, leading to widespread despair and self-destruction.
8.  **-100 Y (The Cosmic City's Whisper):** The Cosmic City, stirring in its slumber, begins to whisper to powerful cultists, tempting them with the promise of ultimate rebirth.
9.  **-10 Y (The Missing Fragment):** A vital fragment of the Cosmic City, the **Essence of Connection**, is stolen from the City Cult, causing a wave of despair to spread through the world.
10. **Present Day:** The party are new initiates at the City Cult, each with their own unique connection to hidden layers. They are caught in a crisis as the Cosmic City's fury intensifies, and the world threatens to consume all of existence in a single, catastrophic act of urban remembrance.

### The "Why": The Cycle of Urban Decay
The central conflict is the struggle between **Acceptance and Obsession**. The Cosmic City's fury, though born of loss, has become an obsession, a relentless drive to restore what was, even if it means destroying what is. The world, in its constant cycle of decay and hidden layers, represents acceptance, the understanding that loss is a part of life. The City Cult, in its pursuit of rebirth, risks becoming consumed by this obsession, burning away all that is, to restore all that was. The party's struggle is not just to become City Cultists, but to defend the very concept of acceptance, to prove that life is worth living, even with its imperfections, and to prevent the universe from becoming utterly, irrevocably consumed by fury.

## 8. MECHANICS
[TAG: RULES_CUSTOM]

### Subsystem: Urban Balance
*   **Balance Score (0-10):** Represents the emotional balance of the current zone. Starts at 5.
*   **Gaining Balance:** Restoring corrupted street, creating harmonious emotions, performing "balanced" actions.
*   **Losing Balance:** Creating chaotic emotions, succumbing to the Cosmic City's fury, experiencing prolonged emotional instability.
*   **Effects:**
    *   *High Balance:* Emotions are stable, predictable. Spells work as intended.
    *   *Low Balance:* Emotions are unstable, unpredictable. Spells can backfire, physics glitches.
    *   *0 Balance:* The zone collapses into a single, undifferentiated emotion.

### Subsystem: Layer-Weaving
*   **Layer-Weaving:** Magic is treated as manipulating the urban dust of lost things. Spells are "rituals."
*   **Fury Risks:** If a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 on a spell attack or saving throw, they cause a "Fury Surge." The spell backfires, or a minor emotional glitch occurs in the simulation.
*   **Particle Injection:** Layer-Weavers can attempt to "inject" custom particles into the simulation, creating unique effects. This requires a successful INT (Layer-Weaving) check, with the DC determined by the complexity of the desired effect.
