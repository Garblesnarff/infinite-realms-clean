# Punk Rock Rebellion
**Tagline:** *No gods, no masters, no rules—just three chords and the truth*

## Campaign Overview

Welcome to The Sprawl, the Punk Rock Rebellion dimension—a realm built from the ruins of every failed system, where anarchy isn't chaos but chosen freedom. This dimension exists as an endless urban wasteland of spray-painted concrete, DIY venues, squats, and barricades. The sky perpetually flickers between dawn and dusk, never fully light or dark, symbolizing the constant state of rebellion. Power comes not from centralized authority but from grassroots movements, individual choice, and collective direct action.

The Sprawl was founded 50 years ago by refugees from authoritarian musical dimensions (especially the Classical Symphony Kingdom). They rejected all hierarchy, destroyed all institutions, and built a society based on punk principles: DIY, direct action, anti-authoritarianism, and authentic expression. There is no government, no police, no rulers—only autonomous collectives managing their own territories through consensus. Resources are shared, decisions are made by those affected, and everyone has a voice.

But the dream has complications. Without any structure, the strong exploit the weak, gangs form, and violence becomes common. Various punk scenes war with each other over ideological differences. The Corporate Invasion has begun—suits from other dimensions trying to commodify and sell punk culture. Worse, some punks have become the very thing they fought against: authoritarian, violent, oppressive. Players arrive as dimensional refugees fleeing their own failed system, seeking the freedom The Sprawl promises. They must navigate competing factions, define what punk truly means, and decide if anarchy can actually work—or if some structure is necessary for freedom to exist.

## Core Themes

- **Authority vs. Anarchy:** Can society function without hierarchy?
- **Authenticity vs. Selling Out:** What happens when rebellion becomes commodity?
- **Unity Through Division:** Finding common ground among competing philosophies
- **Violence vs. Peace:** Is force necessary to protect freedom?
- **Individual vs. Collective:** Balancing personal freedom with community need
- **DIY Ethics:** Creating solutions instead of waiting for heroes

## Plot Twists

1. **The Sprawl is Parasitic:** Drains energy from other dimensions to exist
2. **Players Were Agents:** Sent to infiltrate, but go native (optional)
3. **Anarchy Requires Work:** Freedom isn't free—it's constant effort
4. **Corporate Commander is Right:** Maybe structure is necessary
5. **The First Punks Failed:** Original rebellion compromised from start
6. **Pop-Punks Save the Day:** Dismissed faction is most effective
7. **Violence Creates Tyranny:** Those who fight monsters become monsters
8. **Punk Becomes Mainstream:** Success means becoming what you fought
9. **No Perfect Solution:** Every ending has costs
10. **Rebellion is Eternal:** The fight never truly ends

## Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Victory:** Define what punk means and defend it, resist Corporation, maintain freedom

**Optimal:** Create sustainable anarchist society respecting all punk philosophies, repel Corporation without becoming authoritarian

**Defeat:** Corporation succeeds in commodifying/destroying The Sprawl, or punks become authoritarian themselves

This campaign asks: Can anarchy work? Is authority always oppression? When does rebellion become tyranny? It's punk rock philosophy through D&D, loud, angry, and deeply human.
