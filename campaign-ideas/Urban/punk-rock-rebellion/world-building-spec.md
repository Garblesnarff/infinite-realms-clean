## Location Details

### The Pit
Central territory. Massive crater from dimensional war. Now venue for shows. Surrounded by urban warfare architecture. Graffiti chronicles history. Sound system powered by scavenged generators. Holds 10,000+ for shows.

### The Squat District
Occupied apartment buildings. Each squat is autonomous collective. Meeting halls for assemblies. Library of anarchist theory. Most organized despite philosophy. Food co-ops and community kitchens.

### Green Anarchy Zone
Reclaimed by nature. Gardens everywhere. Buildings deliberately collapsed. Living structures from trees. Technology forbidden. Actually sustainable. Beautiful in wild way.

### Pop Alley
Colorful graffiti, melodic music. Less aggressive aesthetic. Dismissed by others but functional. Community-focused. Best organized childcare and healthcare.

### The First Venue
Sacred site where rebellion began. Tiny club, maybe holds 200. Walls covered in signatures of legends. Anyone can play here. Neutral ground. Historical museum to movement.

### Corporate Zone
Clean, sterile, expanding. Guards at borders. "Authentic Rebellion™" branded everything. Former punks working there, comfortable but hollow. Represents the sellout.

### Dead Mall
Abandoned consumer temple. Ironic headquarters. Food court is commons. Stores are squats. Center court is forum. Consumerism repurposed for community.

## Historical Causality

### The First Arrival (50 years ago)
First punks escaped Symphony Kingdom during purge. Found empty pocket dimension. Built society from nothing. Original pure anarchy. Violent but free.

### The Structure Debates (30 years ago)
First major split: some wanted basic organization. Others saw any structure as authority. Led to faction formation. Ended with compromise: autonomous zones, voluntary association.

### The First Sellout (10 years ago)
Corporation discovered The Sprawl. Began buying property. Some punks took deals. Community fractured. Trust damaged. Set stage for current conflict.

### Current Crisis
Corporation's real goal revealed. Full military assault planned. Existential threat forces unity or destruction. Players arrive at critical moment.

## Additional Lore

### DIY Culture
Everything handmade: instruments, clothes, food, weapons. Scavenging is skill and art. Sharing mandatory. Hoarding is betrayal. Community workshops teach skills. Pride in self-sufficiency.

### Consensus Decision Making
Decisions by affected people. Endless meetings. Frustrating but participatory. Hand signals for agreement/disagreement. Can be manipulated. Requires good faith.

### Punk Philosophy
Anti-authority, anti-consumption, anti-oppression, pro-freedom, pro-authenticity, pro-community. Everyone interprets differently. Leads to conflicts. Unity through diversity.

### The Mosh Pit as Metaphor
Looks violent but has rules. Respect others. Help those who fall. Controlled chaos. Trust in strangers. Community in motion. Microcosm of anarchist society.

### Selling Out vs. Survival
Constant tension. Is accepting help selling out? Is comfort always compromise? Where's the line? Different answers. No easy answers. Core campaign question.

### Violence and Non-Violence
Debate throughout. Is force justified for defense? Does fighting tyranny make you tyrant? Property destruction vs. personal violence? Pacifism vs. pragmatism? Players must decide.

This world-building shows how beautiful and difficult anarchy can be—the freedom and frustration, the community and conflict, the possibility and problems.
