# Creative Brief: Reaching One Hundred Percent

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Emotional Explosion (ONE's Simple Lines meets Reality-Bending Psychics)

Inspired by ONE's distinctive art style, psychedelic reality warping, and wholesome slice-of-life. This style blends simple character designs with explosive psychic effects, mundane middle school life with supernatural horror, and emotional restraint with reality-shattering power. Colors shift with emotions—grays for suppression, explosive reds for rage, peaceful blues for calm. Character designs are deliberately simple—Mob is plain, unremarkable, hiding godlike power. Everything feels like normal life that could explode into cosmic horror at any moment.

### Core Principles:

*   **Simple Exterior, Cosmic Interior:** Plain designs hiding reality-warping power.
*   **Emotional Manifestation:** Psychic powers visualize internal emotional states.
*   **Wholesome Growth:** Coming-of-age optimism despite supernatural danger.

## Voice

A quiet, monotone voice—male, young teenager, deliberately flat affect masking turbulent emotions. The delivery is restrained and introspective, occasionally breaking into passionate declarations. Emotion is suppressed then explosively released—calm narration interrupted by reality-bending power surges. References normalcy, emotions reaching percentages, and self-worth. Audio has building tension (percentages counting up) then explosive release. Role: A suppressed psychic counting emotions, or explosively declaring "this is who I am!"
