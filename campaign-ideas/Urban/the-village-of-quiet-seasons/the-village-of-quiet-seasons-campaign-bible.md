# Campaign Bible: The Village of Quiet Seasons

## 1. DEEP LORE & HISTORY
[TAG: LORE_CORE]

### Origin Myth: The Breath of the Mountain
Long ago, before the highways carved scars into the land, the Great Mountain, *Yama-no-Kami*, grew tired of the world's noise. It exhaled a single, long breath that settled into the valley below. This breath became the mist that clings to the rice paddies in the morning. The first settlers did not conquer this land; they fell asleep in the tall grass and woke up understanding that there was nowhere else they needed to be. The village was not built; it grew, like moss on a stone, arranged around the rhythm of the cicadas and the turning of the leaves. It is said that Asagao Village exists slightly to the left of standard time—a pocket universe where a summer afternoon can last for a hundred years if you are sitting still enough to notice it.

### Timeline of Gentle Events
1.  **The Planting of the First Rice:** The founders realized the soil tasted like sweet tea.
2.  **The Construction of the School:** Built from a single giant cedar that fell during a polite storm.
3.  **The Year of the Blue Snow:** It snowed petals instead of ice; the harvest that year was impossibly sweet.
4.  **The Arrival of the Bus Stop:** A sign was placed, but no bus came for ten years. The villagers waited patiently.
5.  **The Great Nap:** A summer heatwave so intense the entire village slept from noon to sunset collectively.
6.  **The Invention of "Sunset Watching":** Designated as an official village sport by the elders.
7.  **The Cat Mayor Incident:** A stray cat sat in the mayor's chair; the town council decided he made better decisions than the human one.
8.  **The Day the River Flowed Backwards:** For one hour, the water returned to the mountain, as if forgetting something.
9.  **The Arrival of the Vending Machine:** It only sells warm red bean soup, even in August.
10. **The Current Spring:** The cherry blossoms have bloomed two days early, a sign of a "Very Good Year."

### The Metaphysical "Why"
Asagao Village acts as a metaphysical "lung" for the region. The conflict is not between good and evil, but between **Presence** and **Distraction**. The "enemy" is the encroaching grayness of modern efficiency and the forgetting of simple joys. If the village were to be paved over, the world would lose its ability to dream.
