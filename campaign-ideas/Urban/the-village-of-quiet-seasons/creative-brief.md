# Creative Brief: The Village of Quiet Seasons

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gentle Pastoral Watercolor with Nostalgic Softness

Inspired by the tranquil, healing aesthetic of Non Non Biyori, with soft watercolor landscapes, endless countryside vistas, childlike wonder, and emphasis on seasonal beauty and quiet moments. This style aims to capture the tranquil, gentle, innocent, nostalgic, and contemplative tone of "The Village of Quiet Seasons."

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Endless Countryside:** Emphasize vast, open rural landscapes – rice fields stretching to horizon, endless sky, mountains in distance.
*   **Soft Nostalgia:** Use soft colors and gentle composition to evoke childhood memories and simpler times.
*   **Presence in Small Things:** Show beauty in tiny details – insects, flowers, clouds, light on water – that reward close attention.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tranquil, gentle, innocent, nostalgic, contemplative, peaceful, timeless, healing, pastoral, present.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of profound peace and timelessness. The atmosphere should feel like a childhood summer that lasted forever, or the peaceful exhaustion after playing outside all day.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Soft, gentle line work that doesn't demand attention. Lines can be loose and watercolor-like, emphasizing gentleness over precision. Forms are simple and comforting.
*   **Forms:** Rounded, unthreatening shapes. The countryside itself is the main character – endless fields, gentle hills, wide skies. Human figures are small in vast landscapes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A soft watercolor illustration of endless rice fields stretching to distant mountains. Gentle, loose line work emphasizing tranquility and scale. Small human figures for perspective."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Soft, gentle colors that change with seasons – light greens of rice fields, warm golds of harvest, deep blues of summer sky, soft whites of winter. Colors are never harsh or oversaturated.
*   **Texture:** Watercolor texture throughout with soft edges, bleeding colors, and gentle gradients. Everything feels soft and nostalgic like faded photographs.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a soft, gentle color palette of pale greens, warm golden sunlight, and light blue sky. Watercolor texture with soft edges and gentle gradients creating nostalgic, peaceful atmosphere."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Simple, innocent character designs emphasizing children's perspectives. Wide-eyed wonder, comfortable rural clothing, often shown small within vast landscapes. Adults are gentle presences.
*   **Expression:** Peaceful, content, curious, or in gentle motion. Never stressed or hurried. Children show innocent wonder at small discoveries.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A small group of children in simple rural clothes exploring a vast rice field, shown from distance emphasizing landscape. Soft watercolor style with gentle, innocent character designs. Expressions of wonder and contentment."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Emphasis on vast, open rural landscapes – endless fields, big skies, distant mountains. The countryside itself is the main visual element. Small human structures (school, store) nestled within nature.
*   **Atmosphere:** Timeless pastoral peace. Seasonal changes dramatically affect the landscape. Weather is gentle even when dramatic. Time feels slow and undefined.
*   **Details:** Rice paddies at different stages, seasonal flowers, insects, clouds in massive skies, distant mountains, country roads, small bridges, water channels.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast pastoral landscape with endless rice paddies reflecting sky, distant mountains on horizon, massive gentle sky with soft clouds. One-room schoolhouse tiny in the distance. Soft watercolor style emphasizing peace and scale."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused lighting that creates gentle atmosphere. Golden hour and gentle overcast light are common. Shadows are soft and never harsh. Light quality changes with seasons.
*   **Shadows:** Minimal, soft shadows that add depth without creating contrast. Shadows in hot summer vs. soft spring light vs. crisp winter clarity.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates atmosphere of timelessness and peace. Even harsh summer sun is rendered gently. The quality of light in different seasons becomes meaningful.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by soft golden afternoon sunlight creating gentle, diffused lighting across fields. Minimal soft shadows. Watercolor-style lighting emphasizing peaceful, timeless atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive compositions showing vast landscapes with small human elements. Sky takes up significant portions of frame. Emphasizes scale and peace. Close-ups show small details – insects, flowers, hands holding things.
*   **Techniques:** Wide landscape shots establishing tranquility and scale. Low angle shots emphasizing vast sky. Child's-eye-view perspectives finding wonder in small things. Seasonal comparison shots.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide composition with two-thirds sky filled with soft clouds, one-third endless rice fields below. Tiny figures of children walking a country path in the distance. Soft watercolor style emphasizing vastness, peace, and the smallness of human presence in nature's beauty."

## Voice

A very gentle, soft-spoken female voice with a slightly distant, dreamy quality, speaking slowly with long pauses as if remembering something precious. The tone is warm and nostalgic, finding profound meaning in simple moments. The accent is subtle and rural-influenced, pacing is extremely patient and unhurried, conveying the timeless rhythm of countryside life. The emotion blends gentle joy, wistful nostalgia, contentment, and a peaceful acceptance of life's gentle passage. Audio quality is soft and slightly distant, like a memory or a gentle breeze, with background sounds of countryside – cicadas, wind through rice fields, distant birds, children's laughter far away. Role: A narrator remembering an endless summer, or the voice of the countryside itself speaking to those who listen.
