**The Winchester Chronicles**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are monster hunters—bound by blood or found family—who travel America's backroads investigating supernatural threats. What begins as hunting vampires and ghosts escalates into a cosmic war between Heaven and Hell, with prophecies naming them as vessels for archangels in an apocalyptic battle. They must navigate family trauma, demonic possession, angelic manipulation, and impossible sacrifices while trying to save the world without becoming the weapons that destroy it.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the War in Heaven when Lucifer rebelled against God and was cast into Hell, creating the eternal conflict between angels and demons.
    *   Write the history of the Men of Letters—a secret society of scholar-hunters who preserved occult knowledge for centuries before being wiped out by demons.
    *   Describe Samuel Colt's legacy: how he built the Devil's Gate and forged the Colt revolver that can kill anything.
    *   Explain the 66 Seals binding Lucifer in the Cage, and why both Heaven and Hell want them broken to trigger the apocalypse.
    *   Detail the concept of True Vessels—specific bloodlines that can host archangels without burning out, and why these bloodlines have been cultivated across generations.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **Heaven (Angels)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Bring about the apocalypse so Michael can destroy Lucifer and prove divine superiority.
        *   **Hierarchy:** God (absent), Archangels (Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, Gabriel), Seraphim, Angels. Strict military structure.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Protect humanity from demonic threats and guide souls to paradise.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Manipulate events to force the prophesied battle between Michael and Lucifer, treating humans as expendable tools.
        *   **Assets:** Divine powers, instant travel, resurrection, mind-reading, garrison of warrior angels.
        *   **Relationships:** Officially protecting humanity, actually using them as weapons. Opposed to Hell but secretly collaborating to trigger apocalypse.
    *   **Hell (Demons)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Free Lucifer from the Cage and cleanse the Earth of humanity (God's "flawed creation").
        *   **Hierarchy:** Lucifer (imprisoned), Azazel (yellow-eyed demon general), Lilith (ancient demon), crossroads demons, lesser demons.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Corrupt souls, spread chaos, and drag humanity to damnation.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Break the 66 Seals to free Lucifer and begin the apocalypse.
        *   **Assets:** Possession, soul contracts, demonic powers, Hell itself as prison and army.
        *   **Relationships:** Eternal enemies of Heaven but secretly working toward the same goal (apocalypse). Manipulate hunters through deals and possession.
    *   **The Hunter Network** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Protect innocent people from supernatural threats.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Decentralized—individual hunters, small family groups, loose alliances. The Roadhouse serves as informal headquarters.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—hunters operate in secret, seen as crazy or criminals by normal society.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Many hunters are driven by revenge, trauma, or family obligation rather than pure altruism.
        *   **Assets:** Occult knowledge, improvised weapons, salt, iron, holy water, silver, lore books.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrustful of outsiders, loyal to proven allies. Hunted by demons who see them as threats. Ignored or manipulated by angels.
    *   **The Four Horsemen** (Minor - Apocalyptic)
        *   **Goals:** Bring about the end times according to Revelation.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Death (eldest and most powerful), War, Famine, Pestilence. Independent agents bound to apocalypse.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Manifest as natural disasters, plagues, starvation, and violence when summoned.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Death secretly resents being bound to the apocalypse cycle and can be bargained with.
        *   **Assets:** Each Horseman wields a ring that channels their cosmic power. Together, the rings can open Lucifer's Cage.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve neither Heaven nor Hell—they are fundamental forces of reality answering to no one.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.

*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party kills the yellow-eyed demon (Azazel) before he opens the Devil's Gate.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where Lilith takes his place and accelerates the seal-breaking plan. The timeline compresses—the apocalypse arrives sooner.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to kill Lilith, preventing Lucifer's release.
    *   **THEN:** Generate consequences where angels take matters into their own hands—they break the final seal themselves, proving Heaven wanted the apocalypse all along.
    *   **IF:** A party member dies and another makes a demon deal to resurrect them.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a ticking clock scenario where the saved character has 10 years before Hell Hounds collect their soul. This creates ongoing tension and potential sacrifice.
    *   **IF:** The party discovers Heaven's manipulation before Act III.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a crisis of faith where Castiel defects fully to the party's side, becoming hunted by his former garrison. The party loses angel support but gains a loyal ally.
    *   **IF:** The party refuses to be vessels and finds another way to stop the apocalypse.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an alternative ending where they use the Horsemen's rings to trap both Michael and Lucifer, but someone must sacrifice themselves to activate the Cage.
    *   **IF:** A party member says "yes" to Michael to fight Lucifer.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epic battle between archangels with the possessed PC fighting for control. Their willpower determines if they can expel Michael after defeating Lucifer.
    *   **IF:** The party successfully stops the apocalypse without the Cage.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where Heaven and Hell both turn against the party. They become hunted fugitives, but have proven free will can overcome destiny.
