# Creative Brief: The Winchester Chronicles

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Americana Gothic Horror (Supernatural meets True Detective)

Inspired by the shadowy backroads of America, abandoned warehouses, neon-lit diners, and the contrast between mundane roadside motels and cosmic horror. This style blends blue-collar realism with supernatural dread, capturing both the intimacy of family bonds and the weight of apocalyptic destiny. It aims to evoke classic muscle cars, salt-circle protection, and the thin line between salvation and damnation.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Americana Isolation:** Empty highways, small towns at night, truck stops, and places that feel forgotten by the modern world.
*   **Contrast Mundane and Horrific:** Everyday settings (motels, diners, churches) invaded by supernatural threats.
*   **Blue-Collar Hunters:** Characters dressed practically—flannel, jeans, leather jackets, weapons hidden in duffel bags.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, emotional, familial, road-worn, supernatural, apocalyptic, sacrificial, brotherly love, demon-hunting, angel politics, classic rock aesthetic.
*   **Feeling:** The loneliness of the road. The weight of destiny. The bond of family in the face of cosmic horror.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Character Design:** Rugged, practical clothing—leather jackets, flannel shirts, worn jeans, boots. Faces show exhaustion and determination.
*   **Environments:** Strong contrast between light and shadow. Diners with neon signs, dark forests, abandoned buildings.
*   **Creatures:** Monsters blend human and monstrous—vampires with fanged grins, ghosts with hollow eyes, demons with black eyes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in gritty American gothic style. Two hunters in leather jackets stand beside a black classic muscle car on an empty highway at dusk. One holds a sawed-off shotgun loaded with salt rounds, the other a silver knife. Shadows stretch long behind them."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Primary Palette:** Deep blues and blacks for night scenes, amber and orange from streetlights and fires, desaturated earth tones (browns, grays).
*   **Roadside America:** Neon reds and blues from motel signs, the warm yellow of diner interiors, the cold green of fluorescent gas station lights.
*   **Supernatural Elements:** Sulfurous yellows for demon eyes, pure white-blue for angel grace, sickly greens for ghostly apparitions, crimson for blood and magic circles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a desaturated color palette dominated by deep midnight blue and black, with warm amber light from a lonely motel sign. The hunters' faces are half-lit, showing exhaustion and grim determination. A chalk devil's trap glows faintly on the pavement."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Hunters:** Mid-20s to 40s, athletic builds from constant physical activity. Practical, layered clothing. Carry duffel bags with weapons. Faces show trauma and resolve.
*   **Angels:** Human vessels wearing business attire (suits, trench coats), but eyes can flash bright blue. Imposing, formal, inhuman body language.
*   **Demons:** Possess ordinary humans, but eyes turn fully black or sulfur-yellow. Smirking, confident expressions.
*   **Monsters:** Vampires with extended fangs and feral eyes, werewolves mid-transformation, ghosts as translucent figures frozen in death.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hunter in his late 20s with short dark hair, wearing a worn leather jacket over a flannel shirt and jeans. He has a tired, haunted expression but fierce eyes. He holds a flask of holy water in one hand and a journal filled with notes about monsters in the other. Standing in front of a black 1967 Chevy Impala."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **The Road:** Empty highways stretching to the horizon, classic American muscle cars, roadside diners with neon signs, cheap motels with flickering vacancy lights.
*   **Small Towns:** Churches, abandoned factories, graveyards at night, farmhouses isolated in cornfields.
*   **Supernatural Locations:** Devil's traps drawn in salt or paint, sulfur burn marks on floors, blood rituals, warehouses lit by candlelight.
*   **Cosmic Realms:** Heaven depicted as cold, sterile white corridors. Hell as endless corridors of torment, rusty cages, souls hanging on hooks.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide shot of an isolated roadside diner at night. The red neon sign reads 'OPEN 24 HRS' with one letter flickering. A black classic Impala is parked outside. Through the windows, two hunters sit in a booth, surrounded by papers and lore books. The surrounding landscape is empty highway and dark fields under a starless sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Night Scenes:** Heavy shadows with pools of warm artificial light (streetlights, headlights, motel signs). Strong contrast.
*   **Interiors:** Dim, atmospheric lighting. Flashlights cutting through darkness. Candlelight during rituals.
*   **Supernatural Effects:** Bright flashes during angel arrivals, sulfurous glows during demon appearances, cold blue-white light for ghost manifestations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by harsh contrast lighting—deep shadows broken by the warm amber glow of a single motel room lamp and the cold blue light filtering through the window from a neon sign. The hunter's face is half in shadow, half illuminated, emphasizing exhaustion and determination."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic framing. Wide shots of lonely roads and small figures against vast landscapes. Close-ups on weathered faces and emotional moments.
*   **Techniques:** Low angles to make monsters more menacing. Eye-level shots for intimate character moments. Dutch angles during supernatural encounters.
*   **Iconic Images:** The Impala on an empty road, hunters standing back-to-back against threats, salt circles glowing on the ground, angel wings casting shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic low-angle composition showing a hunter holding a sawed-off shotgun, standing in the center of a chalk devil's trap with lit candles at each point. Behind them, a demon with black eyes approaches but cannot cross the line. The scene is lit dramatically by candlelight, with deep shadows stretching across a warehouse floor."

## Voice

A mid-range American voice—weary but defiant, with the cadence of someone who's seen too much but keeps fighting. Think gravelly from years of hard living, with dry humor as a defense mechanism against trauma. The accent is General American with a slight blue-collar edge (Kansas, Nebraska). Pacing is conversational but can shift to urgent during hunts or emotional during family moments. The emotion ranges from sardonic wit (during downtime) to raw grief (after loss) to fierce determination (facing apocalypse). Audio quality has a slight analog warmth, like a cassette tape recording—nostalgic and worn. Role: A hunter recording a journal entry, giving a last message, or recounting a hunt to other hunters over beers.
