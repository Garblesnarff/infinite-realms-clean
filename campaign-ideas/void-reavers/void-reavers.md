# Void Reavers
**We Are Not Heroes. We're Legends.**

## Campaign Overview

Void Reavers follows a ragtag crew of misfits, criminals, and weirdos aboard the ship *Milano's Revenge*—half smuggling vessel, half mobile disaster. The party consists of outcasts: a disgraced pilot seeking redemption, a warrior from a destroyed world seeking vengeance, an assassin gone soft, a living weapon who doesn't understand metaphors, and a genetically modified raccoon with anger issues. They take on a simple job (stealing a mysterious artifact) that escalates into saving the galaxy from a fanatical zealot who wields an Infinity Stone-equivalent.

The campaign balances irreverent humor with genuine stakes, absurd situations with heartfelt character moments, and cosmic-level threats with street-level criminals. The party goes from nobodies running cons to unlikely heroes standing between civilization and annihilation—while still making terrible decisions, cracking inappropriate jokes, and having dance-offs with genocidal villains. It's about found family among rejects, redemption through friendship, and discovering that even screw-ups can be legendary.

## Core Themes

- **Found Family**: Rejects becoming closer than blood relatives
- **Redemption Through Friendship**: Broken people fixing each other
- **Humor in Darkness**: Laugh to keep from screaming
- **Legacy and Loss**: What we leave behind matters
- **Ordinary Heroes**: You don't need to be special to do good
- **Awesome Mix Tape**: Music as identity and emotional touchstone

## Session Breakdown (30 Sessions)

### Act I: A Bunch of Jackasses Standing in a Circle (Sessions 1-8)

**Session 1-2: The Heist**
Party brought together by shady broker to steal mysterious Orb from abandoned planet. Each has reasons: money, revenge, escaping worse fate. Heist goes sideways. Planet isn't abandoned—rival factions also seeking Orb. Chase, comedy of errors, narrow escape. Discover broker betrayed everyone.

**Session 3: Escape and Confrontation**
Fleeing with Orb to space station Knowhere (built inside giant severed space god's head). Ambushed by The Collector—ancient being who wants Orb for unknown reasons. Fight through station. Orb accidentally opens, reveals Power Gem—universe-destroying artifact. Realize they're in over their heads.

**Session 4-5: The Fanatic**
Ronan the Accuser—zealot serving powerful titan—wants Gem to destroy worlds that wronged him. Attacks Knowhere with fleet. Party barely escapes. One member's homeworld was destroyed by Ronan. Vengeance becomes personal. Rally point: Prison planet where they first met.

**Session 6-7: Prison Break**
Captured by Nova Corps (space police). Imprisoned. Forced to work together to escape. Team-building through adversity. Meet allies: criminal network, sympathetic guard. Breakout involves ridiculous improvisation and luck. Establish chemistry through chaos.

**Session 8: We Are Reavers**
Regrouping, party must choose: Run and hide forever, or stop Ronan (certain death). Debate. Each character's reason to fight. Emotional speeches. Decide to make suicidal stand. Name themselves "Void Reavers"—we're not heroes, we're legends. Bonding moment.

### Act II: Legendary Outlaws (Sessions 9-18)

**Session 9-10: Gathering Forces**
Need army to stop Ronan's fleet. Visit criminal contacts: Ravagers (space pirates), Sovereign (gold supremacists), Kree separatists. Negotiations involve cons, threats, and promises. Building coalition of outlaws and outcasts.

**Session 11-12: The Ravager Complication**
Party member was raised by Ravager crew but abandoned. Reunion with surrogate father Yondu is tense. He wants Orb for profit. Party must convince him it's bigger than money. Emotional father-child dynamic. Yondu eventually helps.

**Session 13-14: Infiltration**
Sneak aboard Ronan's ship to assassinate him before he attacks. Stealth mission. Everything goes wrong (as always). Fight through ship. Reach Ronan—Power Gem makes him invulnerable. Forced to flee. Now he knows they're coming.

**Session 15-16: Target: Xandar**
Ronan targets Xandar (capital world, billions of civilians). Nova Corps scramble defenses. Fleet battle imminent. Party coordinates with Corps, Ravagers, anyone who'll fight. Outnumbered. Someone suggests "awesome plan": distraction dance-off.

**Session 17-18: The Dance-Off**
Battle of Xandar. Space combat, ground assault, desperation. Ronan landing to use Power Gem. Party confronts him. In ridiculous moment, distraction through dance-off (absurd but works because Ronan is confused). Seize opportunity, destroy his weapon, seize Gem. Work together to channel Gem's power without dying. Ronan obliterated.

### Act III: Vol. 2 - Family Issues (Sessions 19-24)

**Session 19-20: The Sovereign Job**
Hired by Sovereign (gold-skinned supremacists) to protect batteries from monster. Complete job but steal batteries (they're jerks). Sovereign send remote-controlled fleet in pursuit. Running fight through asteroid field. Saved by mysterious figure: Ego the Living Planet.

**Session 21-22: Finding Father**
Ego claims to be party member's father (the starlord equivalent). Invites to his planet (which is him—he's a Celestial, ancient god). Paradise world, answers to questions, family connection. Too good to be true. Other party members suspicious.

**Session 23-24: The Terrible Truth**
Investigation reveals Ego's plan: He planted "seeds" on thousands of worlds. Using child's Celestial power to activate them, absorbing all life, expanding himself across galaxy. All Ego's other children died being tested. Current child only one who worked. Ego killed child's mother when she became liability. Betrayal and rage.

### Act IV: Save the Galaxy (Again) (Sessions 25-30)

**Session 25-26: Civil War**
Party splits: Those who want to flee vs. those who want to fight. Ego too powerful. Argument reveals insecurities and fears. Surrogate father figure intervenes, reminds them they're family. Reunited, plan to destroy Ego's brain (planet's core).

**Session 27-28: The Battle of Ego**
Fighting through Ego's defenses (living planet fights back). Ravagers and allies arrive. Planting bomb in core while holding off Ego's manifestations. Emotional confrontations with Ego's avatar. Themes of real fatherhood vs. biology.

**Session 29: The Sacrifice**
Bomb planted but someone must stay to detonate (otherwise Ego will defuse). Surrogate father stays. Tearful goodbye. "He may have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy." Detonation. Escape as planet explodes. Funeral. Found family proven stronger than blood.

**Session 30: Legendary Status**
Reformed and famous. Nova Corps grants pardon. Hired as freelance heroes. New ship, better gear, reputation. But still same jackasses. End with new mission offer: cosmic threat emerging. Ready to be legends again. Awesome music plays.
