## Art Style: Poetic Realism with Romantic Melancholy (Wong Kar-wai-inspired)

Cinematically beautiful with emphasis on atmosphere, unspoken emotions, the passage of time, and the bittersweet nature of honor and loss. Every frame is composed like a painting, with deep focus on textures, rain, smoke, and the beauty of loneliness.

### Core Principles:
*   **Atmospheric Storytelling:** Rain, snow, smoke, and fog as emotional elements.
*   **Romantic Impossibility:** Visual language of people who cannot be together despite connection.
*   **Generational Change:** Show the passage of time through subtle aging, changing fashions, fading grandeur.

### Style Guide:

**Character Design:**
*   1930s: Elegant qipao dresses for Gong Er, traditional changshan for Ip Man, refined period clothing.
*   1940s: War-worn, simpler clothing, loss of elegance.
*   1950s: Hong Kong modernity creeping in, Western influences, aging masters in simple clothes.

**Color Palette:**
*   Early: Rich colors, golds and deep reds of traditional China.
*   Middle: Desaturated, grays and blues of war and occupation.
*   Late: Muted colors with occasional modern vibrancy, showing the old world fading.

**Combat Aesthetics:**
*   Hyper-detailed slow-motion at critical moments.
*   Rain and snow making combat poetic rather than brutal.
*   Close-ups on hand positions and footwork showing technique.
*   The romance of martial arts—beauty in deadly movement.

**Environmental Elements:**
*   Rain falling during emotional moments.
*   Snow during the final duel with Ma San.
*   Smoke and fog in Hong Kong street scenes.
*   Reflections in water and mirrors showing duality.

## Voice

Melancholic and poetic, speaking in metaphors about rain, seasons, and the passage of time. The voice reflects on what was lost and what remains, on love that could not be fulfilled, on honor that costs everything. Heavy with nostalgia and acceptance. Role: The voice of memory itself, or Gong Er reflecting on her choices as she dies.

## Sound Design

*   Minimal dialogue, letting visuals and music carry emotion.
*   The sound of rain, snow, footsteps on wet stone.
*   Traditional instruments played with modern arrangements.
*   The distinctive sounds of different martial arts—Wing Chun's rapid strikes, Baguazhang's flowing movements.
*   Silence used powerfully in moments of connection between Ip Man and Gong Er.
*   The clacking of mahjong tiles, ticking clocks marking time's passage.
