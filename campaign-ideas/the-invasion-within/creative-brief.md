## Art Style: Body Horror Realism

Modern Japanese urban setting with graphic body horror—realistic human anatomy combined with impossible alien transformations. Clinical detail meets visceral wrongness.

### Core Principles:

*   **Anatomical Accuracy:** Realistic human bodies make transformations more horrifying.
*   **Biomechanical Horror:** Parasite limbs are organic but wrong—blades made of flesh, eyes where they shouldn't be.
*   **Urban Normalcy:** Everyday locations (schools, streets, apartments) make horror stand out.
*   **Transformation Sequences:** Show the horror of body parts reshaping—painful, grotesque, unstoppable.

**Visual Elements:** Human arm splitting apart into blade-tentacles. Eyes transforming into telescopic alien sensors. Normal street scene with hidden predator. Surgical cross-sections showing parasite anatomy.

**Color Palette:** Muted realistic colors. Accents of deep red (blood, violence), sickly greens (alien biology), cold sterile blues (clinical horror).

**Character Design:** Humans appear normal. Parasites in disguise look slightly too perfect. During transformation: flesh ripples, forms impossible shapes, clothing tears, bone-like blades emerge.

## Voice

Clinical, analytical, occasionally disturbed. Like a biologist documenting something impossible. Environmental sounds: flesh tearing, bones cracking, the wet sound of transformation, heartbeats accelerating, alien screeching that shouldn't come from human throats.
