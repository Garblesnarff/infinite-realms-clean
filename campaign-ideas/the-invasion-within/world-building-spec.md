### **World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Invasion Within**

**1. Core Concept:** Parasitic aliens infiltrate by consuming human brains. Party members are partial infections—symbiotic rather than replaced. Must hunt full parasites while hiding their own infections, questioning what defines humanity when you're part alien.

**2. Lore Primer:** Parasites arrived as spores, target brainstem, perfect mimicry of hosts, lifecycle requires human consumption, some develop consciousness beyond instinct, origin unknown (evolution? alien invasion? Earth's immune response to humanity?).

**3. Factions:**
*   **Symbiotic Hosts (Players):** Hybrid human-parasites seeking to protect humanity.
*   **Full Parasites:** Range from mindless predators to philosophical questioners.
*   **Human Society:** Unaware of invasion; would kill infected if discovered.
*   **Parasite Extremists:** Believe humanity must be culled.
*   **Human Extremists:** Hunt all infected; no mercy.

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Player Symbiotes (Migi, etc.), Reiko (philosopher parasite), Gotou (composite predator), Hirokawa (human collaborator), Uragami (human monster).
*   **Tier 2-3:** "Full Parasite," "Suspected Infected," "Human Victim," "Extremist Hunter."

**5. Locations:** Urban neighborhoods, schools, feeding grounds (isolated areas), parasite gathering sites, extremist hideouts, the infection origin site.

**6. Triggers:**
*   **IF symbiote starves:** Weakens; may try to take control.
*   **IF party exposed:** Hunted by both humans and parasites.
*   **IF party kills humanely:** Humanity tracker increases.
*   **IF party becomes predatory:** Humanity tracker decreases; symbiote relationship strengthens.
*   **IF encounter parasite seeking peace:** Coexistence path opens.
