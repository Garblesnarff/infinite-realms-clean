# Creative Brief: The Divergence Protocol

## Art Style: Modern Sci-Fi with Temporal Distortion

Contemporary Japanese urban setting with sci-fi laboratory elements. Visual representations of time fracturing, multiple timelines overlapping, and reality shifting.

### Core Principles:

*   **Mundane Baseline:** Normal modern world makes temporal anomalies stand out.
*   **Temporal Distortion:** Clocks showing wrong times, overlapping versions of same person, reality glitching.
*   **Laboratory Aesthetic:** Makeshift science equipment, monitors showing timelines, crude but functional devices.
*   **Psychological Horror:** Characters showing strain of loops—exhaustion, despair, madness.

**Visual Elements:** Time-message device (microwave-based or magical equivalent). Divergence meter showing numbers. Characters from different timelines overlapping. Visual "Reading Steiner" effect of remembering timeline changes.

**Color Palette:** Normal modern colors that shift/distort during timeline changes. Cold blues and greens for SERN dystopia. Warm golds for Steins Gate target. Glitch effects showing reality fracturing.

## Voice

Manic energy descending into exhausted desperation. Like someone explaining the same thing for the hundredth time. Environmental sounds: clocks ticking out of sync, temporal static, microwave hum, reality warping sounds, distant echoes of other timelines.
