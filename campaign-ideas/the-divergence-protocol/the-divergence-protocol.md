# The Divergence Protocol

*A Time Travel Thriller / Butterfly Effect campaign — Medium Campaign (10–13 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Divergence Protocol
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Travel Thriller / Sci-Fi Mystery / Butterfly Effect / Preventing Dystopia / Temporal Paradox
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **11–13**
**Tone (keywords):** Time travel, butterfly effect, preventing dystopia, sacrificing for the timeline, madness from repetition, sending messages to the past
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party discovers a magical device that can send memories and messages backward in time. They use it to prevent a friend's death, only to trigger a butterfly effect that leads to a dystopian future where millions die. Now trapped in a time loop, they must repeatedly go back—each attempt to fix the timeline creates new disasters. The campaign explores whether fate can be changed, the cost of saving one life versus millions, and the madness of remembering timelines no one else does.

## What "High" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Temporal Paradoxes:** Actions in the past change the present unpredictably. Solutions create new problems.
*   **Isolation:** Only the party remembers previous timelines—everyone else has different memories each loop.
*   **Madness from Repetition:** Experiencing the same weeks repeatedly, watching friends die again and again, causes trauma.
*   **No Combat Solution:** The enemy is causality itself. Cannot fight your way to victory.
*   **Sacrificial Choices:** Saving everyone may be impossible—who do you let die?
*   **Butterfly Effect:** Tiny changes cascade into massive consequences. Every action matters unpredictably.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–13 sessions)

*   **Act I — The First Message (Sessions 1–3):** Party discovers time-message device. A friend dies tragically. They send a message to past-self preventing the death. Success! But this triggers butterfly effect—the friend's survival leads to them being recruited by a sinister organization, ultimately causing a dystopian future. Party realizes they've doomed millions to save one.
*   **Act II — The Loops (Sessions 4–9):** Party begins time-looping, trying to save both the friend and prevent dystopia. Each attempt fails in new ways. They must track divergence numbers (how much the timeline has shifted), manage their sanity, and figure out the conspiracy—a shadow organization called SERN is trying to monopolize time travel.
*   **Act III — Steins Gate (Sessions 10–13):** The final loop. Party must orchestrate perfect sequence of events to reach the "true timeline" where everyone survives. Requires sacrifice, precision, and accepting that some pain is necessary. Multiple endings based on whether they find Steins Gate, give up, or break causality entirely.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Doomed Friend (Kurisu/Mayuri Adapted)** — *The Nexus Point*
    *   **Role:** Friend whose death or survival determines the timeline.
    *   **Personality:** Brilliant, kind, unaware they're the lynchpin of causality.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Their death is a "temporal attractor"—timeline wants them dead; saving them is fighting fate.

2.  **The Timekeeper (Okabe Adapted)** — *The Mad Scientist*
    *   **Role:** Party member or NPC; discoverer of time travel; retains memories across loops.
    *   **Personality:** Eccentric, gradually driven mad by repetition, refuses to give up.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Reading Steiner effect—he remembers all timelines, which is both power and curse.

3.  **SERN Agent** — *The Temporal Conspiracy*
    *   **Role:** Representative of organization seeking to monopolize time travel.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, ruthless, believes ends justify means.

4.  **The Veteran Time Traveler** — *The Broken*
    *   **Role:** Someone else who time-traveled; now insane from paradoxes.
    *   **Personality:** Fragmented, gives cryptic warnings, tragic cautionary tale.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Proof that time travel destroys the mind eventually.

5.  **The Constant** — *The Anchor*

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is **fate versus free will** and **individual versus collective good**. The party can save one life (the friend) or millions (preventing dystopia) but not both—causality seems to demand a sacrifice. Every attempt to cheat fate creates new disasters. The campaign questions: is fate real or just patterns we haven't broken yet? Is it worth saving one person you love if it dooms countless strangers? How many times can you relive trauma before it breaks you? And ultimately: can a perfect timeline exist, or must we accept imperfection and loss?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Time Loop Structure**
*   Campaign is divided into loops—party returns to same starting point with memories intact.
*   Each loop, world is different based on messages they sent.
*   Track changes through "divergence numbers."

### 2. **D-Mail (Messages to the Past)**
*   Party can send short messages to their past selves.
*   Changes create butterfly effects—DM determines consequences.
*   Limited uses per loop.

### 3. **Reading Steiner Effect**
*   Only the party remembers previous loops.
*   Everyone else has memories matching current timeline.
*   Creates isolation and opportunity.

### 4. **Divergence Tracker**
*   Number representing how far from original timeline.
*   Specific ranges lead to specific outcomes:
    *   0.000000-0.999999: Alpha timeline (dystopia).
    *   1.000000-1.999999: Beta timeline (war).
    *   1.048596: Steins Gate (perfect timeline).

### 5. **Madness & Trauma**
*   Track psychological damage from repetition.
*   Watching friends die repeatedly, isolation, temporal confusion.
*   High madness causes mechanical penalties and roleplay challenges.

### 6. **Butterfly Effect System**
*   Small changes cascade unpredictably.
*   DM tracks consequences of every time message.
*   Players must think carefully about changes.

### 7. **Multiple Endings**
*   **Steins Gate:** Achieve perfect timeline; everyone lives; requires perfect execution.
*   **Alpha/Beta:** Accept one of the flawed timelines; some die but majority saved.
*   **Abandon:** Stop trying; accept the original timeline and its tragedies.
*   **Paradox:** Break causality completely; unknown consequences.
*   **Madness:** Fail; party loses themselves to temporal insanity.
