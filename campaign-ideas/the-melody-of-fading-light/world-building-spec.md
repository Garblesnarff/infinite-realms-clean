    *   Write the legend of the Three Great Bards who could move mountains with music, and how modern musicians strive to reach that level.
    *   Describe the cultural significance of the Grand Competition and how winning it establishes a bard's career and legacy.
    *   Explain the magical illness called "Fading Resonance" that slowly drains a person's life force, and why it has no known cure.

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** Kousei completes a successful performance where he expresses genuine emotion.
    *   **THEN:** His world gains more color. Describe specific elements transitioning from grayscale to color. His magical music becomes more powerful and beautiful. Kaori expresses pride and joy.
    *   **IF:** Kousei has a traumatic flashback triggered by performances or criticism.
    *   **THEN:** The world temporarily reverts to grayscale. He may freeze during performances. Requires emotional support from Kaori or friends to recover.
    *   **IF:** Kaori's condition visibly worsens (track on hidden countdown).
    *   **THEN:** She appears more fragile, tires easily, may collapse. Other characters notice. Healers become more urgent. Kousei experiences fear and denial.
    *   **IF:** Kousei confronts his feelings about his mother's abuse and death.
    *   **THEN:** Major breakthrough in his healing. Can perform in the Grand Concert Hall without freezing. His relationship with Kaori deepens as he becomes more emotionally available.
    *   **IF:** The final performance occurs while Kaori is in the hospital, unable to attend physically.
    *   **THEN:** As Kousei plays the piece he composed for her, her spirit appears on stage with him, glowing and ethereal. They perform a duet that is both impossible and perfect. The audience sees something magical. Kaori's body dies peacefully during this moment, her spirit fading as the final note rings out.
    *   **IF:** Players discover Kaori's letter after her death.
    *   **THEN:** The letter reveals "the lie in April"—she claimed to like Watari but actually loved Kousei from the start. She had seen him perform as children and her musical style was developed to reach him. She chose to spend her final months giving him the gift of healing. The letter ends with encouragement to keep playing.
