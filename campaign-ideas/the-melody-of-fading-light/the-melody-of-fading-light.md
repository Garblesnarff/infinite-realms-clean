### Core Premise
Kousei is a young human bard who was once a prodigy with magical music, able to weave spells with perfect precision. But after the traumatic death of his abusive mother—herself a famous bard—he lost his ability to hear his own music, rendering his magic gray and lifeless. He lives in a colorless world, going through the motions. Then he meets Kaori, a vibrant elven violinist-bard whose chaotic, emotional approach to music is the opposite of his rigid training. She explodes into his monochrome life with color, teaching him to play from the heart rather than in fear. As he rediscovers his passion for music, he falls deeply in love with her—only to discover she is dying from an incurable magical illness. The campaign becomes a race against time to create one perfect performance together before her light fades.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Meeting in Monochrome (Sessions 1-3)**
- Kousei exists in a gray, joyless routine, playing music mechanically for coin, unable to hear his own performances due to psychosomatic trauma. During a performance, he meets Kaori, a free-spirited violinist whose reckless, emotional music breaks through his numbness. She drags him back into the world of performance, initially claiming she wants him to accompany her childhood friend Watari (who she says she likes), but really targeting Kousei himself.

**Act 2: Colors Return (Sessions 4-8)**
- Through a series of performances—competitions, festivals, and street performances—Kousei slowly regains his ability to hear music and cast spells again. Kaori pushes him to abandon his mother's rigid style and find his own voice. Other characters from his past return: his childhood friends Tsubaki (who secretly loves him) and Watari (the popular fighter), and his rivals in music. Each performance is a battle against his trauma and a step toward healing. His feelings for Kaori deepen.

**Act 3: The Final Performance (Sessions 9-12)**
- Kaori collapses during a performance, revealing her terminal illness. She's been sick since before they met, and her reckless approach to life was because she knew her time was limited. Kousei must perform in the Grand Competition—the same one where his mother pushed him to perfection—but this time, he must play for Kaori. Even as she lies in a hospital bed, her condition worsening, he pours his heart into his music. The campaign culminates in a performance where Kousei plays while Kaori's spirit appears beside him, joining in one last duet before she fades. Her death is certain, but the beauty they created together remains eternal.

### Key Locations

- **The Rooftop Practice Room**: Where Kousei and Kaori rehearse. Has perfect acoustics and overlooks the city.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to overcome trauma and embrace life fully, knowing that love and beauty are temporary. It's about finding your own voice after being silenced by fear, and learning that imperfect moments shared with others are more valuable than perfect solitude.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Color Perception System**: Describe the world in grayscale when Kousei is emotionally shut down. As he heals through sessions, introduce colors incrementally—first in Kaori, then in music, then in the environment. By the final sessions, the world is vibrant.
- **Musical Performance Challenges**: Performances are skill challenges combining Performance, Arcana (for magical music), and emotional roleplay. Success creates beautiful magical effects. Partial success is technically perfect but emotionless. Failure triggers traumatic memories.
- **Kaori's Fading Condition**: Track Kaori's health on a hidden countdown. She has moments of vitality but each major exertion (performances, outings) advances the condition. Players may notice she's more tired, paler, weaker with each session.
- **Spell-Music Integration**: Musical performances can cast powerful bard spells. The quality of the performance (technical + emotional) determines the spell's effect. Kousei's magic returns gradually as his emotional range expands.
- **Memory Sequences**: Periodically trigger flashbacks to Kousei's childhood, showing his mother's abuse and the circumstances of her death. These provide context and obstacles to overcome.
