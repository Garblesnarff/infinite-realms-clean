# Hip Hop Street Empire - Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic:** Urban realism meets magical realism. Graffiti comes alive, words visibly manifest, streets pulse with rhythm. Think Spike Lee's visual language meets Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse's comic book energy, grounded in authentic street culture.

**Visual Influences:**
- Hip hop photography (Gordon Parks, Jamel Shabazz, Martha Cooper)
- Graffiti and street art
- Music video aesthetics (Hype Williams, Spike Jonze)
- Spider-Verse visual style
- Urban architecture of NYC, Atlanta, LA
