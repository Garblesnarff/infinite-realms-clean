---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Faceless Stalker
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Psychological Horror / Mystery / Cosmic Horror / Forest Terror
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **2** → Finish **8–10**
**Tone (keywords):** stalking, faceless, memory loss, proxies, forest horror, paranoia, children
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Children are disappearing from the forest town of Oakmere, and witnesses report sightings of an impossibly tall, suited figure with no face lurking among the trees. The entity, known locally as the Thin Man, stalks those who observe it, corrupting their minds and turning them into blank-eyed proxies. The players must investigate the disappearances, resist the entity's maddening influence, and discover the truth: the Thin Man is an ancient psychic predator that feeds on fear and memory, and simply looking at it marks you as prey.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-15 sessions)

A descent into psychological horror and mind-altering terror.

*   **Act I — The Marked Ones (Sessions 1–4):** The players arrive to investigate missing children. They encounter the Thin Man briefly in the forest and become "marked"—now subject to its stalking. They experience memory gaps, find disturbing drawings, and discover that victims exhibit the "operator symbol" before vanishing.
*   **Act II — The Proxies (Sessions 5–9):** The players discover that some disappearances are caused by "proxies"—people corrupted by prolonged exposure to the Thin Man who now serve it. They must identify and stop proxies while managing their own deteriorating mental states and the entity's constant presence.
*   **Act III — Into the Hollow (Sessions 10–15):** The party discovers the Thin Man's lair: a dimensional pocket called the Hollow where the missing children are kept in suspended animation, feeding the entity with their fear. To destroy it and free the children, they must enter the Hollow and confront the Thin Man in its own reality.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Thin Man (The Operator)** — *The Faceless Stalker*
    *   **Role:** An extradimensional entity that stalks and terrorizes victims who observe it. Impossibly tall (8-12 feet), wearing a black suit, completely faceless.
    *   **Personality:** Alien and unknowable. It never speaks but radiates overwhelming psychological pressure. Its movements are wrong—too smooth, too fast, defying physics.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Thin Man is sustained by fear and memories it steals from victims. Without victims to feed on, it begins to fade from reality.

2.  **Sarah Winters** — *The Mother*
    *   **Role:** A parent whose daughter Emily disappeared six months ago. She's still searching desperately.
    *   **Personality:** Exhausted, determined, and on the edge of breaking. She sees the players as her last hope.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She has become a proxy, unknowingly working for the Thin Man. Her memories of her daughter are being stolen, and soon she won't remember Emily at all.

3.  **Detective Marcus Reed** — *The Skeptic*
    *   **Role:** The local detective investigating the disappearances through conventional means.
    *   **Personality:** Practical, skeptical of supernatural explanations, increasingly frustrated by lack of evidence.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He saw the Thin Man years ago and dismissed it as stress. Now it's returned, and he's been marked again. His memory is deteriorating rapidly.

4.  **Timothy Chase** — *The Survivor*
    *   **Role:** A teenager who was taken by the Thin Man and returned six months later. He claims not to remember anything.
    *   **Personality:** Quiet, withdrawn, and unsettling. He draws the operator symbol compulsively.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is a proxy, tasked with identifying new victims. However, a part of his original personality is fighting the control, creating an internal war.

## Key Locations

1.  **Oakmere:** A small forest town surrounded by dense woods, now gripped by fear over the missing children.
2.  **The Deep Forest:** Miles of thick woodland where the Thin Man is most often sighted. Reality becomes unstable here.
3.  **The Abandoned Sawmill:** A proxy gathering site where victims are prepared before being taken to the Hollow.
4.  **The Hollow:** A pocket dimension accessed through specific forest locations—a nightmare realm of endless trees, fog, and suspended children.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of memory, identity, and the terror of being hunted by something incomprehensible. The central conflict is the players' struggle to save the children while resisting the Thin Man's corrupting influence. Every encounter with the entity erodes their memories and sanity. Can they solve the mystery before they forget why they came?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Marked Condition**
*   Once a character sees the Thin Man directly, they are "marked." The entity now stalks them.
*   Marked characters periodically see the Thin Man in the distance (DM decides when). Each sighting triggers a **Wisdom saving throw**.
*   Failure means the character loses a memory (minor at first, becoming more significant with repeated failures) and accumulates **Stalker Points**.

### 2. **Stalker Points and Mental Degradation**
*   Stalker Points represent the entity's growing influence. They are gained from:
    *   Failed saves when seeing the Thin Man
    *   Spending time in corrupted areas (the Deep Forest, the Hollow)
    *   Witnessing the operator symbol or proxy attacks
*   Effects by threshold:
    *   **3 Points:** Memory gaps, disadvantage on Intelligence checks
    *   **5 Points:** The Thin Man appears in dreams, minor hallucinations
    *   **7 Points:** Significant memory loss, the entity can now touch the character (causing terror)
    *   **10 Points:** The character becomes a proxy—an NPC under the DM's control

### 3. **Memory Loss Mechanics**
*   When a character loses a memory, the DM works with the player to determine what is forgotten.
*   Lost memories can be recovered if the Thin Man is defeated, but some may be permanently gone.
*   Characters may forget why they're investigating, who hired them, or even who their companions are.

### 4. **The Operator Symbol**
*   The symbol (a circle with an X through it) appears throughout the campaign as a warning.
*   Proxies mark locations with it. Victims draw it compulsively.
*   Studying the symbol can provide clues but also increases Stalker Points.
