# Creative Brief: The Faceless Stalker

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Creepypasta Realism

Inspired by found-footage horror, internet creepypasta aesthetics, and liminal space photography. This style captures the uncanny feeling of familiar places made wrong, the terror of being watched, and the reality-breaking presence of the Thin Man.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize the Uncanny:** Normal scenes with something subtly wrong. The familiar made unfamiliar.
*   **Use Negative Space:** The Thin Man is often partially hidden, glimpsed at the edge of perception, or suggested through absence.
*   **Focus on Psychological Horror:** Show the effect on victims rather than explicit violence. Distress, confusion, blank expressions.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Stalking, faceless, memory loss, proxies, forest horror, paranoia, children, uncanny, liminal, watching.
*   **Feeling:** Being watched from the trees. The atmosphere should be one of constant unease, with familiar locations feeling wrong and threatening. Reality is unreliable.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Photorealistic with occasional distortions and glitches when the Thin Man is present. Clean lines for normal elements, disturbing wrongness for the entity.
*   **Forms:** Normal forest town architecture, dense woodland, and the Thin Man—an impossibly tall, slender figure in a black suit with a completely blank, featureless face.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic digital image of a modern forest town street. Everything appears normal except for an impossibly tall, slender figure in a black suit standing between two buildings in the background. The figure has no facial features—completely blank. The style is realistic but with an underlying sense of wrongness."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, desaturated colors for normal scenes. When the Thin Man is present, colors may shift toward cooler tones or become oversaturated. Black for the entity itself.
*   **Atmosphere:** Overcast, dim, as if the sun never quite breaks through the clouds.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of grays, dark greens, and browns. The scene has a slightly desaturated, almost old photograph quality. The Thin Man is pure black, creating a stark silhouette against the dull background."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Normal, modern civilians—parents, children, investigators in contemporary clothing.
*   **The Thin Man:** 8-12 feet tall, impossibly slender and long-limbed, wearing a black business suit. Completely faceless—a smooth, blank surface where a face should be. Sometimes depicted with tentacle-like appendages emerging from its back. Movements are unnaturally smooth and disturbing.
*   **Proxies:** Normal-looking people with blank, emotionless expressions and dead eyes. They may compulsively draw the operator symbol.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Thin Man standing at the edge of a forest. It is impossibly tall, at least 10 feet, with an emaciated, unnaturally thin body dressed in a black suit. Its head is featureless—no eyes, nose, mouth, just smooth, pale skin. Its arms are too long, hanging past where knees would be. Dark, tentacle-like appendages emerge subtly from behind its back. The figure radiates wrongness and terror."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Modern suburban/small-town settings and dense forests. Playgrounds, schools, homes, and woodland trails. Locations feel liminal—empty parking lots, fog-shrouded paths, abandoned buildings.
*   **Atmosphere:** Quiet, empty, as if everyone has left. Even when people are present, there's a sense of isolation.
*   **Details:** The operator symbol appearing on walls, trees, notebooks. Children's drawings showing the Thin Man. Fog and mist obscuring distances.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A scene of a children's playground at dusk. The swings and slides are empty. Fog drifts across the ground. In the background, barely visible among the trees at the forest edge, is the tall silhouette of the Thin Man, watching. The playground appears normal but feels deeply wrong and unsafe."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Overcast daylight that creates few shadows but feels dim. Nighttime scenes use artificial light sources (street lamps, flashlights) that seem insufficient.
*   **Shadows:** The Thin Man casts impossibly long or wrong-angled shadows, if any. Its presence sometimes dims nearby light sources.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates a sense of unreality and makes the entity stand out as fundamentally wrong.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the dim, overcast light of an approaching storm. The Thin Man stands in an area that should be well-lit but appears darker, as if it absorbs light. Its shadow is too long and points in the wrong direction."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** The Thin Man is often placed in the background or at the edges of the frame. Use of foreground elements (trees, buildings) to partially obscure it.
*   **Techniques:** Frame the entity so it's barely noticeable at first glance. Use depth of field to blur it slightly while keeping foreground sharp, creating unease. Show victims' reactions rather than the entity itself.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A first-person perspective looking out a window at the forest. The foreground shows the window frame and interior of a room in focus. In the background, among the trees and slightly out of focus, stands the Thin Man, watching. The composition creates the feeling of being observed."

## Voice

A distorted, static-filled voice that occasionally cuts in and out, as if from a corrupted recording. The underlying voice is neutral and emotionless, speaking in fragmented sentences. The pacing is irregular with unsettling pauses. The emotion is absent—a complete lack of humanity. Audio quality is poor with digital artifacts and white noise. Role: A proxy speaking under the Thin Man's control, their original personality almost completely erased.
