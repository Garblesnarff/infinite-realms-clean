# Shadows of the Precursors
**In the Void Between Stars, Ancient Evil Stirs**

## Campaign Overview

Shadows of the Precursors follows an elite team aboard the SSV *Normandy*, a state-of-the-art frigate serving the Galactic Citadel—a multi-species governing body maintaining peace after centuries of conflict. The party consists of the galaxy's finest: soldiers, scientists, and specialists recruited for a mission to investigate colonies going dark on the frontier. What begins as a mystery becomes a race to prevent galactic extinction.

The party discovers the Harvesters—immense sentient machines that emerge from dark space every 50,000 years to purge organic civilization. The cycle has repeated for millions of years, and the Harvesters are returning. Armed with warnings from the Precursors (extinct race that left ruins and technology), the party must unite fractious species, gather ancient weapons, and prepare for a war against beings that view organic life as temporary infestation to be cleared periodically.

This is a campaign about unity through diversity, impossible odds overcome through cooperation, and the fight against cosmic horror armed with determination and hope. It asks whether civilizations can break cycles of destruction, whether differences can be overcome by shared survival, and whether friendship and loyalty matter when facing oblivion.

## Core Themes

- **Unity Through Diversity**: Different species overcoming prejudices to survive
- **Ancient Mysteries**: Precursor technology and warnings from the past
- **Cosmic Horror**: Facing incomprehensible evil beyond understanding
- **Choice and Consequence**: Decisions ripple across the galaxy
- **Loyalty and Sacrifice**: Building crew bonds tested in fire
- **Cycles and Legacy**: What mark do we leave for those who follow?

## Session Breakdown (40 Sessions)

### Act I: First Contact (Sessions 1-10)

**Session 1-2: Eden Prime**
Party investigates human colony Eden Prime gone dark. Find colony destroyed, bodies impaled on spikes. Encounter Husks—cybernetic zombies, former colonists. Desperate firefight. Discover massive spacecraft crashed here. Inside: Precursor beacon.

**Session 3-4: The Vision**
Touching beacon imprints vision into party member's mind: civilizations being harvested by massive machines (the Harvesters). 50,000-year cycle. Warning from extinct Precursors. Party reports to Citadel Council, who dismiss it as hallucination.

**Session 5-6: The Rogue Spectre**
Saren Arterius, elite Spectre agent, led the attack on Eden Prime. He's gone rogue, working with robotic Geth. Party promoted to Spectre status to hunt him. Freedom to operate outside law, but also politically complicated.

**Session 7-8: Recruiting the Crew**
Gathering team from across galaxy: Krogan warrior, Asari scientist, Turian tactician, Quarian engineer, etc. Personality conflicts. Party must build cohesion. Early missions establish dynamics and trust.

**Session 9-10: Feros Investigation**
Following Saren to colony Feros. Find colonists under mental control by ancient Precursor plant (Thorian). Saren extracted data, left chaos. Moral choice: Kill Thorian to free colonists (but kills those permanently bonded) or leave them enslaved.

### Act II: Gathering the Pieces (Sessions 11-20)

**Session 11-12: Noveria Corporate World**
Tracking Saren to ice planet research facility. Corporation breeding Rachni (insectoid thought extinct). Saren wants Rachni queen. Conspiracy among corporate executives. Choice: Kill queen (ensure extinction) or release her (she promises peace but risky).

**Session 13-14: Virmire**
Saren's base on ocean world. Discover his ally: Sovereign, a Harvester vanguard. Sovereign is sentient Reaper ship, influencing Saren through indoctrination. Assault on base, massive battle. Tragic choice: Save crewmember A or B, one must die planting nuke.

**Session 15-16: The Revelation**
Captured data reveals truth: Harvesters are "Reapers"—living ships, each thousands of years old. They sleep in dark space between galaxies, return to harvest advanced organic civilizations, create new Reapers from genetic material. Cycle has repeated for millions of years. The Citadel itself is a trap—a relay to bring them in.

**Session 17-18: Politics and Paranoia**
Citadel Council still won't believe. Too frightening, no proof Sovereign is Reaper. Humanity vs. other species political tensions. Council fears human alarmism, considers grounding *Normandy*. Party must navigate diplomacy while clock ticks.

**Session 19-20: Ilos**
Following Precursor clues to Ilos—lost world where last survivors tried to break the cycle. Find facility with stasis pods, lone VI (virtual intelligence) maintained for 50,000 years. Learn Precursors called themselves "Protheans," created the Citadel relay network—which Reapers corrupted into trap.

### Act III: The Reaper War Begins (Sessions 21-30)

**Session 21-22: The Conduit**
Saren found "Conduit"—secret relay from Ilos directly to Citadel. Plans to open Citadel relay, letting Reaper fleet in from dark space. Race through Conduit, vehicular combat, desperate pursuit. Emerge in Citadel just as Sovereign attacks.

**Session 23-24: Battle of the Citadel**
Massive fleet battle. Council species fleets engage Sovereign. Ground combat in Citadel's towers. Showdown with Saren (indoctrinated puppet). Philosophical debate and combat. Saren's moment of clarity before Sovereign overrides him. Epic boss fight.

**Session 25-26: Sovereign Falls**
After Saren defeated, Sovereign takes direct control of his corpse. Final confrontation. Simultaneous space and ground combat. Choice: Save Council (risk human fleet) or let them die (ensure Reaper destroyed, humanity leads). Sovereign destroyed. Celebration. But it was just one.

**Session 27-28: Two Years Later**
Time jump. Party disbanded, *Normandy* destroyed by mysterious attackers. Party member killed (comes back). Recruited by Cerberus—pro-human black ops. Investigate human colonies disappearing—entire populations vanishing. Reluctant alliance with morally gray organization.

**Session 29-30: The Collectors**
Discover Collectors (mysterious insectoid aliens) abducting humans. They work through Omega-4 relay (suicide mission, no one returns). Build new team, upgrade ship, prepare for assault through relay. Crew loyalty missions establish bonds.

### Act IV: Endgame (Sessions 31-40)

**Session 31-32: Suicide Mission Prep**
Gathering resources, allies, upgrading ship. Every choice matters—ship upgrades prevent deaths, loyalty missions ensure survival. Optional missions to help crew members resolve personal issues. Builds emotional investment.

**Session 33-35: Through the Omega-4 Relay**
Jump through relay into Collector space. Running gauntlet of defenses. If ship underupgraded, crew members die protecting ship. Desperate infiltration of Collector base—massive hive structure.

**Session 36-37: The Human Reaper**
Collectors building new Reaper from harvested human genetic material. Grotesque horror—massive human-shaped Reaper larva in construction. Must destroy before completion. Moral choice: Destroy base (prevent Reaper use) or preserve tech for Cerberus (power but unethical).

**Session 38: Arrival**
Evidence of imminent Reaper arrival from dark space. Precursor artifacts pointing to superweapon: "Crucible"—device built by multiple cycles. Each cycle added to blueprints before dying. If activated, could destroy all Reapers. Hope exists.

**Session 39-40: The Gathering Storm**
United Galactic Council (if saved) or human-led coalition (if not) begins preparing. Building Crucible, recruiting allies, fortifying defenses. Final scenes establish stakes: Reapers are coming, millions of ships, trillions will die unless stopped. Party's choices throughout campaign determine survival chances. Ends on precipice of full-scale war, setting up sequel campaign.
