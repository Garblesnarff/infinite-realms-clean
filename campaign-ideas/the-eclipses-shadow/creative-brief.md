# Creative Brief: The Eclipse's Shadow

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Medieval Fantasy with Horror Elements

Inspired by Berserk's brutal aesthetic, this style combines medieval European settings with extreme violence, demonic imagery, and themes of human struggle against overwhelming darkness. The world is grounded in realistic medieval warfare but corrupted by supernatural horror.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Medieval Realism:** Authentic armor, weapons, castles, and battlefields of the 14th-15th centuries.
*   **Extreme Violence:** Battle scars, blood, dismemberment shown unflinchingly but not gratuitously.
*   **Demonic Corruption:** Horrific transformations—human bodies twisted into monstrous forms, baroque demon designs.
*   **The Brand:** Burn-like mark on the neck/hand that bleeds during demonic presence.
*   **Scale and Despair:** Tiny humans against massive demons; emphasizing hopelessness and struggle.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dark fantasy, medieval warfare, betrayal, demons, cursed brands, vengeance, fate vs free will, Band of the Falcon, Eclipse sacrifice.
*   **Feeling:** A world of steel and struggle where humans fight and die in mud and blood, punctuated by moments of otherworldly horror when demons appear. Glory turns to nightmare. The aesthetic is brutal realism meeting nightmare fuel.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Humans:** Realistic proportions, detailed armor and clothing, battle-scarred, exhausted. Warriors built for function, not fantasy beauty.
*   **Demons/Apostles:** Grotesque combinations of human and animal features. Baroque, excessive detail—too many eyes, mouths, limbs. Bodies that violate natural proportions.
*   **The God Hand:** Elegant but wrong—humanoid forms with disturbing details (exposed brains, featureless faces, impossible anatomy).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval battlefield at dusk. Knights in battered plate armor fight with longswords and halberds. Mud, blood, and corpses cover the ground. In the background, a crimson eclipse darkens the sky. Realistic, gritty art style with detailed armor and weapons."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Dominant:** Dark grays, browns, and blacks of medieval life. Steel and iron tones.
*   **Accents:** Deep red of blood, white of bone, the sickly crimson of the Eclipse, black shadows of demons.
*   **The Eclipse:** Deep red sun with black corona—unnatural, terrifying.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Color palette of dark grays, browns, and steel tones with heavy use of deep red blood and black shadows. A warrior with a massive sword (Dragonslayer) faces a demon—the warrior in dark, realistic armor; the demon in writhing black forms with red accents. The Eclipse hangs overhead: a crimson sun with black corona."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Band of the Falcon:** Medieval mercenaries in practical armor—mix of chainmail, plate pieces, leather. White cloaks with falcon insignia. Battle-worn, not pristine.
*   **Branded Survivors:** Same but scarred, haunted expressions, burn-like Brand visible on neck or hand.
*   **Griffith (pre-Eclipse):** Beautiful, almost ethereal—white armor, long white hair, charismatic presence.
*   **Femto (post-Eclipse):** Black armor with hawk-like helmet, bat wings, utterly inhuman presence. Beautiful but terrifying.
*   **Apostles:** Each unique—combinations of human and animal. Examples: snake-human hybrid with dozens of arms, spider-centaur with human torso, slug-beast with human face.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medieval mercenary warrior: dark, functional armor with chainmail and leather, white cloak with falcon insignia, large two-handed sword. Battle scars on face, haunted eyes. On their neck, a burn-like brand in the shape of abstract symbols. Behind them, a massive demon with tentacles and human-like face looms. Gritty, detailed art."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Battlefields:** Muddy, corpse-strewn medieval warfare. Realistic depictions of castles under siege.
*   **The Eclipse Dimension:** Nightmare landscape—endless flesh, massive demonic faces, distorted perspectives, rivers of blood, no sky just the crimson Eclipse.
*   **Medieval Towns:** Authentic medieval European architecture—timber frames, stone buildings, narrow streets. Can be pristine or demon-ravaged.
*   **Godo's Forge:** Cave mine with massive forge, demon bones and materials scattered, weapons in progress.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Eclipse sacrifice: a nightmare dimension with ground made of writhing flesh, massive demonic faces emerging from darkness, small human figures being devoured by tentacled horrors. Above, the crimson Eclipse fills the sky. The scene is chaos—demons everywhere, humans fighting desperately. Extremely dark, horror aesthetic."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Heavy shadows, dramatic chiaroscuro. Light comes from fires, the Eclipse, or is absent entirely.
*   **Combat Lighting:** Harsh highlights on steel blades, deep shadows emphasizing violence.
*   **Demonic Scenes:** Unnatural lighting—shadows fall wrong, light sources that shouldn't exist, the Eclipse's red glow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A warrior in heavy armor stands in darkness, lit only by the glow of their massive sword which is on fire. Heavy shadows obscure most of the scene. In the background, demon eyes glow red. The lighting is stark, emphasizing the isolation and danger."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Scale:** Often show massive demons looming over tiny humans. Emphasize disparity in power.
*   **Violence:** Don't shy from showing impact—swords cutting through armor, blood spray, struggle.
*   **Despair vs Defiance:** Characters should look exhausted, wounded, but still fighting. Defiance in the face of hopelessness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "Low-angle shot of a lone warrior with massive sword facing a demon the size of a building. The demon is a grotesque fusion of human and insect with dozens of limbs. The warrior is tiny in comparison but stands defiant, sword raised. Stormy sky, Eclipse visible. Emphasize scale difference and the warrior's hopeless courage."

## Voice

A battle-scarred, weary male voice—gravelly from screaming orders on battlefields and breathing smoke. Tone is grim, fatalistic, but with underlying rage that never dies. Speaks like a veteran mercenary who has seen too much: brief, blunt, occasionally philosophical. Emotions range from cold detachment (when describing horror) to burning fury (when speaking of betrayal). Environmental sounds include: clashing steel, screams of battle, demon roars that sound wrong, the Brand sizzling when demons approach, heartbeats during moments of terror. Underlying everything is the question: "In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control, even over his own will."
