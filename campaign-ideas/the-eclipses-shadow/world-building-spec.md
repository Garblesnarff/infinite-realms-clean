### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Eclipse's Shadow**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The party are elite mercenaries in the Band of the Falcon, led by the charismatic Griffith who dreams of his own kingdom. At the height of their success, Griffith sacrifices the entire Band to demon lords called the God Hand during a solar eclipse, transforming into the demon Femto. The party survives bearing the Brand of Sacrifice—a cursed mark attracting demons every night. Now they must survive in a medieval world where darkness brings monsters, seek vengeance against their former leader who became a demon god, and struggle against the philosophical question: is fate predetermined, or can mortals defy the causality controlled by the God Hand? The campaign explores betrayal, trauma, vengeance, and whether free will exists in a universe where demon gods claim to control destiny itself.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Chronicle the Age of Gods: ancient times when astral and material worlds were one, and entities of immense power (proto-God Hand) walked the earth.
    *   Detail the Schism: the splitting of worlds into the material realm (where humans live) and the astral realm (where spirits and demons exist). Certain convergences (eclipses) allow crossing between worlds.
    *   Explain Behelits: crimson egg-shaped artifacts with sleeping faces. When owner reaches their destined moment of ultimate despair, the Behelit activates during an eclipse, allowing them to sacrifice what they love most to become an Apostle (human-demon hybrid).
    *   Describe the God Hand: five transcendent demons who rule the astral plane. Each was once human who sacrificed everything during a solar eclipse. They orchestrate causality itself—manipulating events across centuries toward outcomes they desire.
    *   Chronicle the Band of the Falcon's rise: formed by Griffith, they became legendary mercenaries, turning the tide of wars. Griffith dreamed of his own kingdom and seemed destined for greatness.
    *   Detail Griffith's fall: political machinations led to his capture and torture for one year. Rescued broken and unable to lead, he activated his Behelit in despair, triggering the Eclipse.
    *   Explain the Eclipse Sacrifice: the entire Band was transported to a nightmare dimension where the God Hand appeared. Griffith sacrificed his comrades to become Femto, the fifth God Hand member. Most died; survivors bear the Brand of Sacrifice.
    *   Describe the Brand: a curse mark that attracts demons from the astral plane, especially at night. Branded are hunted eternally. The Brand bleeds when demons approach.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Branded Survivors (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Survive nightly demon attacks; seek vengeance against Griffith/Femto; find way to remove or endure the Brand; protect each other.
        *   **Hierarchy:** No formal structure—bound by trauma and the Brand. May follow strongest/wisest member.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Demon hunters, mercenaries for hire (must hide the Brand).
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each has personal reasons—some want pure revenge, some want to understand causality, some seek redemption for past failures, some just want to survive.
        *   **Assets:** Combat skills from Band of the Falcon training, eventual access to demon-slaying weapons, Skull Knight's occasional aid, knowledge of astral world.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by all demons and Apostles; distrusted by humans who discover the Brand; allied with Godo and rare resistance cells.
    *   **The God Hand** (Major - Cosmic)
        *   **Goals:** Maintain control over causality; guide history toward convergence of astral and material worlds; create new Apostles; find worthy candidates to join the God Hand.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Five members (Void is leader, then Slan, Ubik, Conrad, Femto). Each transcendent, nearly omnipotent within their domains.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—most humans are unaware they exist.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They claim to be executors of causality/fate itself, but their true motivations are inscrutable. They may be following an even higher entity's plan, or they may be lying about causality and simply enjoy power.
        *   **Assets:** Reality manipulation during eclipses, control over Apostles, ability to see and influence "the flow of causality," immortality, incomprehensible power.
        *   **Relationships:** Command all Apostles; manipulate human events from shadows; opposed by the Skull Knight and Branded survivors; worshipped by cults ignorant of their true nature.
    *   **The Apostles** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Serve the God Hand, feed on humans, pursue personal twisted desires.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Individual monsters in human disguise. Some rule territories; others wander. All answer to the God Hand when summoned.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Many pose as nobles, warlords, or leaders. Use human positions for access to prey.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each activated a Behelit and sacrificed what they loved most to gain power. Now cursed to monstrous forms and demonic appetites.
        *   **Assets:** Superhuman strength and regeneration, monstrous transformation, human guise, territories they control.
        *   **Relationships:** Serve God Hand; hunt the Branded (smell them via Brand); prey on humans; compete with each other for territory and favor.
    *   **The Kingdoms of Midland & Neighboring Realms** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** Typical medieval politics—territorial expansion, dynastic succession, religious authority.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Feudal—kings, nobles, knights, clergy, commoners.
        *   **Public Agenda:** War, governance, maintaining order.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Completely unaware of the astral world and demonic manipulation. Some nobles ARE Apostles in disguise.
        *   **Assets:** Armies, castles, resources of medieval society.
        *   **Relationships:** Constantly at war with each other; Band of the Falcon once served Midland; now oblivious to the real threat (demons) in their midst.
    *   **The Skull Knight & Ancient Resistance** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** Oppose the God Hand; rescue Branded when possible; seek to disrupt causality.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Skull Knight acts alone but occasionally allies with others.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None—operates in shadows.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Skull Knight was Branded centuries ago, possibly a former emperor or king. Has fought the God Hand for eons. May be seeking specific outcome or simply refuses to surrender to fate.
        *   **Assets:** Immense combat skill, enchanted armor and sword that can cut space itself, knowledge of astral realm, immortality through curse.
        *   **Relationships:** Opposes God Hand and Apostles; aids Branded survivors; cryptic toward the party—helps but never fully explains.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The Eclipse sacrifice occurs (Session 5-7).
    *   **THEN:** The campaign fundamentally changes: the Band is destroyed, party members gain the Brand, Griffith becomes Femto, demons now spawn nightly near the party. Generate: Brand mechanics activate, nighttime becomes dangerous, NPCs are dead or traumatized, Griffith is now enemy instead of ally, Skull Knight becomes recurring NPC, access to Godo and demon-hunting arc begins.
    *   **IF:** A party member's Brand bleeds (demons within 100 feet).
    *   **THEN:** Generate combat encounter with demons appropriate to location and time. At night, more frequent and dangerous.
    *   **IF:** A party member accumulates excessive trauma (failed trauma saves, witnessed atrocities).
    *   **THEN:** They suffer PTSD effects: flashbacks during combat, difficulty trusting allies, nightmares preventing long rest benefits, or snapping into berserk rage. Generate specific trauma responses based on what they witnessed.
    *   **IF:** The party acquires the Berserker Armor.
    *   **THEN:** Wearer gains immense combat power but enters berserk state where they attack anyone nearby, ignore injury, and suffer massive damage when armor is removed. Generate: mechanics for berserk state, gradual physical degradation from use, mental instability increasing.
    *   **IF:** The party encounters a Behelit.
    *   **THEN:** The Behelit calls to whoever is most desperate. Generate: temptation scenes, NPC offers to trade for it, the moment of ultimate despair when it might activate, consequences if someone uses it (transformation into Apostle, becomes NPC enemy).
    *   **IF:** The party kills an Apostle.
    *   **THEN:** Gain materials for demon-slaying weapons, reputation as demon hunters spreads (attracting both allies and more powerful Apostles), God Hand may take notice. Generate: increased difficulty encounters, cultists hunting the party, information on other Apostles.
    *   **IF:** The party confronts Griffith/Femto before the final sessions.
    *   **THEN:** They are vastly outmatched—he is a God Hand member. Generate: overwhelming combat where escape is the goal, Femto's dialogue mocking their resistance to fate, possible Skull Knight intervention, trauma from facing their betrayer.
    *   **IF:** The party learns the truth about causality (that the God Hand may not actually control fate, or that they do and resistance is futile).
    *   **THEN:** Generate philosophical crisis: do their actions matter? NPCs take different stances—some give up, some fight harder. Party must choose their path forward based on this knowledge.
    *   **IF:** Final confrontation with Griffith/Femto.
    *   **THEN:** Multiple ending paths based on party choices, power level, and philosophical stance:
        *   **Revenge Ending:** Defeat Femto at cost of party's lives—dying but defying fate.
        *   **Pyrrhic Victory:** Wound Femto, disrupt his plans, but he escapes. War continues.
        *   **Liberation:** Discover mythical way to break the Brand and causality (ancient magic, divine intervention, Skull Knight's secret knowledge).
        *   **Damnation:** Party members use Behelits to become Apostles—gain power but lose humanity, become NPCs serving Femto.
