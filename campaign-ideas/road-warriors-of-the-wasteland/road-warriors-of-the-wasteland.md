## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of vehicular survival, explosive combat, and finding hope in wasteland.

*   **Act I — Wasteland Initiation (Sessions 1-7):** The party survives as independent Road Warriors, taking gigs escorting convoys and raiding for supplies. They earn reputations through vehicular combat against war boy cultists and raider gangs. When their vehicles are captured by the Citadel, they're given a choice: die or join the War Rig crew protecting a mysterious cargo across the Wasteland. They accept and discover the cargo is human—refugees seeking the mythical Green Place.
*   **Act II — The Fury Road (Sessions 8-14):** The War Rig convoy faces constant attacks from Immortan Joe's forces who want the refugees returned. The party battles across different Wasteland territories—the dust storms, the canyon passages, the bullet farms. They uncover that the Green Place was real but has died, and now they must find a new destination. Alliances form with other survivors including reformed war boys questioning their death cult.
*   **Act III — Return & Redemption (Sessions 15-20):** With no Green Place to reach, the party makes a desperate decision: return to the Citadel and overthrow Immortan Joe, turning it into the haven they sought. The final convoy battle is a running war across the Wasteland with all factions converging. They must defeat Joe's forces, protect the refugees, and prove that cooperation can rebuild civilization from chrome and dust.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of survival vs. humanity, resource scarcity driving brutality, redemption from death cults, and whether civilization can rebuild or just repeats cycles. It asks: What separates survival from tyranny? Can those raised to seek death find meaning in life? Is hope possible in wasteland? The central conflict pits party's desire to save refugees against Wasteland's brutal logic that compassion is weakness.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Convoy Protection**
*   Central objective: keep War Rig intact and moving
*   Party operates escort vehicles defending main transport
*   If War Rig is destroyed, mission fails—creates real stakes
*   Tactical positioning: flanking, rear guard, scouting ahead
*   Success measured by War Rig condition, not personal survival

### 2. **Vehicular Combat System**
*   Ramming, side-swipes, boarding actions, shooting while driving
*   Vehicles have hit locations: tires, engine, fuel tank, armor

*   Damage forces adaptation—replace destroyed parts with new finds
*   Most valuable resources are functional vehicles, not gold

### 6. **Environmental Hazards**
*   Dust storms: visibility near zero, electrical interference, vehicle damage
*   Toxic zones: prolonged exposure causes condition damage
*   Canyon ambushes: high ground advantage, limited maneuver room
*   Minefields: old world weapons waiting to destroy unwary
*   Heat exhaustion: Wasteland sun affects characters and vehicles

### 7. **Faction Reputation**
*   Actions affect standing with various Wasteland groups
*   War boys respect chrome and glorious combat
*   Refugees value protection and compassion
*   Warlords respond to strength and resource control
*   Reputation determines allies, enemies, and neutral parties' responses
