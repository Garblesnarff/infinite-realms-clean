## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A downward spiral through time manipulation toward an inevitable sacrifice.

*   **Act I — The Rabbit Speaks (Sessions 1-7):** The party experiences a shared vision of Frank the Rabbit warning about the world's end. When a strange jet engine crashes into one member's home—with no airplane it came from—they begin experiencing temporal distortions and water-like portals appearing in the air. A mysterious book called "The Philosophy of Time Travel" provides cryptic guidance about Tangent Universes, Living Receivers, and Manipulated Dead. Strange events escalate: visions intensify, time loops begin, and the party realizes reality is literally coming apart.
*   **Act II — The Manipulated (Sessions 8-13):** The party learns about their roles: one is the Living Receiver chosen to guide the Artifact, others are Manipulated Living meant to help, and some may be Manipulated Dead—those who die in the Tangent Universe gaining power to influence events. They must manipulate people and circumstances to create a path for the Artifact's return while battling against those trying to prevent the timeline's collapse. Time travel becomes more frequent, past and future blur, and they witness their own deaths in various timelines.
*   **Act III — The Living Receiver's Choice (Sessions 14-20):** With days remaining, the party must orchestrate impossibly complex events leading to the moment when the portal opens. The Living Receiver learns they must die to guide the Artifact back, collapsing the Tangent Universe and restoring the Prime timeline—where none of these events happened. Everyone will forget except through dreams and déjà vu. The party faces their final choice: let reality collapse and destroy both universes, or sacrifice one of their own to save a world that won't remember them.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of predestination vs. free will, the burden of foreknowledge, teenage alienation and apocalyptic anxiety, and the nature of sacrifice. It asks: If you knew the future, could you change it? Would you sacrifice yourself to save people who won't remember you? Is choice real if only one path saves the universe? The central conflict pits the party's desire to survive against the cosmic necessity of the Living Receiver's death, with time itself as both enemy and puzzle.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Temporal Vision**
*   Characters see water-like tubes extending from people showing their future paths
*   These visions predict where people will go in the next hours
*   Can manipulate events to change the paths
*   Overuse causes severe headaches and temporal disorientation
*   Visions become clearer as the countdown approaches zero

### 2. **The Countdown Clock**
*   Campaign has a literal countdown: 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds
*   Each session represents specific days of the countdown
*   Reality destabilizes progressively as time runs out
*   Environmental effects based on time remaining
*   Final sessions occur in real-time at critical moments

### 3. **Time Loop Memory**
*   When loops occur, party rolls to determine how much they remember
*   Can spend "Déjà Vu points" to recall specific details from previous loops
*   Each loop, they can make different choices
*   Some NPCs also remember across loops, becoming allies or obstacles
*   Perfect loop memory would drive mortals insane

### 4. **Manipulated Living/Dead**
*   NPCs are categorized as Manipulated Living (unconsciously helping) or Manipulated Dead (ghost guides)
*   Party can identify and influence both types differently
*   Dead characters gain special abilities to affect reality
*   Living characters can be nudged toward specific actions
*   Resistance increases if pushed too hard against their nature

### 5. **The Philosophy of Time Travel**
*   The book serves as both quest guide and rules document
*   Reveals mechanics of Tangent Universes, Ensurance Traps, Artifacts
*   Provides prophetic passages that become clear only when events happen
*   Can be studied for advantage on temporal challenges
*   Some passages are in code requiring specific keys to understand

### 6. **Reality Corruption**
*   As countdown decreases, reality glitches become more severe
*   Black holes in sky, objects phasing between existence, time stutters
*   NPCs experience shared nightmares and anxiety
*   Physical laws become inconsistent
*   Final days are apocalyptic—weather chaos, widespread temporal distortions

### 7. **The Living Receiver's Powers**
*   One PC is designated the Living Receiver with special abilities
*   Superhuman strength/resilience when motivated by purpose
*   Reality manipulation on small scales (moving objects, influencing thoughts)
*   Time navigation—can replay specific moments
*   Powers grow as death approaches
*   Ultimately can manipulate the Artifact itself
