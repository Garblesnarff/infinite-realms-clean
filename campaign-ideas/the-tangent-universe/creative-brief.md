## Art Style: Suburban Gothic with Temporal Horror (Donnie Darko-inspired)

Inspired by the unsettling aesthetic of *Donnie Darko*—blending late-1980s suburban America with cosmic horror, prophetic visions, and time manipulation. This style captures the contrast between mundane teenage life and reality-breaking temporal distortions, with the iconic disturbing rabbit figure as a recurring motif.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Suburban Unease:** Normal American suburbs invaded by impossible events, darkness under normalcy
*   **Temporal Distortions:** Water-like portals, reality glitches, time trails, fractured chronology
*   **The Rabbit:** Frank's monstrous costume as disturbing centerpiece—grotesque but magnetic
*   **Late 80s Aesthetic:** Period-appropriate clothing, technology, and cultural references

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Temporal horror, suburban gothic, teenage existentialism, prophetic visions, inevitable sacrifice, 1988 nostalgia
*   **Feeling:** The creeping dread of knowing too much. Suburban normalcy cracking to reveal cosmic terror beneath. The isolation of seeing truth others can't perceive.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Suburban Normalcy:** Muted earth tones, faded greens and browns, autumn colors
*   **Night Scenes:** Deep blues and purples, orange streetlights, oppressive darkness
*   **Temporal Effects:** Liquid silver water-portals, electric blue time distortions
*   **Frank Appearances:** Metallic rabbit mask catching light, darkness surrounding
*   **Reality Corruption:** Sickly yellows, reality-break static, black hole voids in sky
*   **Prompt Example:** "...color palette dominated by muted autumn tones—faded oranges, browns, and yellows of dead leaves. Suburban street at dusk with orange sodium streetlights creating pools of sickly yellow light. Deep purple-blue twilight sky. A shimmering liquid silver portal appears in the air, distorting the normal colors around it. The overall feel is nostalgia corrupted by cosmic wrongness."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Donnie Type:** Teenager in 1980s casual—zip-up hoodie, t-shirt, jeans, disheveled dark hair
*   **Frank:** Horrifying rabbit costume—grotesque elongated face, giant dead eyes, twisted smile, tuxedo
*   **Suburban Teens:** Period-appropriate fashion, flannel, vintage sportswear, big hair
*   **Adults:** Oblivious to the horror, dressed in professional 1980s attire
*   **Manipulated Dead:** Ghostly versions of their living selves, eyes reflecting knowledge beyond death
*   **Prompt Example:** "A teenage figure standing in darkness, lit by harsh moonlight. Wearing a gray zip-up hoodie over a t-shirt, jeans, disheveled dark hair. Expression of disturbed realization, eyes wide. Before them stands a figure in a nightmarish rabbit costume—giant rabbit head with metallic sheen, hollow dead eyes, elongated snout with twisted smile showing teeth. The rabbit wears a tuxedo. Background is void-like darkness with hints of suburban house."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Suburban Homes:** 1980s American houses, brick and siding, front lawns, Halloween decorations
*   **The High School:** Typical American school—lockers, classrooms, gymnasium, fluorescent lighting
*   **Grandma Death's House:** Creepy decaying Victorian, overgrown yard, sense of abandonment
*   **Golf Course:** Manicured greens at night, fog rolling over fairways, sprinklers
*   **Storm Drains:** Underground concrete tunnels, water flowing, echoing darkness
*   **Prompt Example:** "Exterior of a 1980s suburban house at night. Brick facade, two-car garage, front lawn with scattered fallen leaves. One bedroom has a gaping hole where a jet engine crashed through—debris and destruction visible. Orange streetlight illuminates the scene. A few neighbors gather on the sidewalk staring. Police tape cordons the area. The impossible nature of the damage is evident—perfect circular hole with no plane wreckage."

**5. Temporal Horror Elements:**
*   **Water Portals:** Liquid silver tubes extending from people showing their future paths
*   **Time Trails:** Visual echo effects showing multiple temporal positions
*   **Reality Glitches:** Objects phasing in/out of existence, double-exposures, static overlays
*   **Black Holes:** Swirling voids appearing in the sky as reality collapses
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hallway in a high school with fluorescent lighting. From each person walking, a shimmering liquid silver tube extends forward through space, showing the path they will take in the next minutes. The tubes have water-like ripples and reflect light. Some intersect, some diverge. The main character stands still, staring at these impossible visions. Slight double-exposure effect suggests reality instability."

**6. The Artifact:**
*   **The Jet Engine:** Massive turbine engine, impossible to miss, no origin plane
*   **Destruction Pattern:** Perfectly circular hole through house, debris contradicting physics
*   **Temporal Signature:** Engine has subtle glow/shimmer suggesting it's not quite real
*   **Recovery Scenes:** Officials investigating something that shouldn't exist
*   **Prompt Example:** "A massive commercial jet engine sitting in the ruins of a bedroom. The engine is intact, metallic, covered in warning labels and serial numbers. It rests on the crushed remains of a bed. The ceiling has a perfect circular hole showing the night sky above. The walls are blasted outward. Debris scattered everywhere. The impossible nature is clear—this engine appeared from nowhere, weighing tons, with no aircraft. Subtle shimmer suggests temporal distortion."

**7. Vision Sequences:**
*   **Frank's Appearances:** Dark void backgrounds, spotlight effect, cinematic framing
*   **Prophecies:** Countdown numbers appearing, cryptic symbols, time mathematics
*   **Future Glimpses:** Overlapping scenes from different timelines, death premonitions
*   **Book Pages:** Passages from "The Philosophy of Time Travel" appearing as visions
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vision sequence showing Frank the rabbit appearing in darkness. The grotesque rabbit mask fills the frame, metallic surface catching impossible light from no source. One hand reaches forward, pointing. In the background, faint numbers glow: '28:06:42:12'. The rabbit's mouth moves but the voice seems to come from everywhere. Deep shadows, high contrast, slightly blurred as if seen through disturbed water."

**8. Late 1980s Period Details:**
*   **Technology:** Boxy TVs, VHS tapes, rotary phones, analog clocks
*   **Fashion:** Specific to 1988—particular styles of jeans, shoes, haircuts
*   **Cultural:** Halloween decorations, movie posters from the era, Dukakis campaign signs
*   **School:** Chalk boards, overhead projectors, old textbooks, period-appropriate supplies
*   **Prompt Example:** "Interior of a 1988 teenager's bedroom. Posters on walls (specific to late 80s), boxy television with VCR underneath, cassette tapes scattered around. Analog clock radio on nightstand showing 12:00 flashing. Homework on desk with pencil and paper—no computer. Fashion magazines showing late 80s styles. The mundane normalcy makes the temporal horror more jarring."

**9. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Night Dominance:** Most scenes occur in darkness or twilight
*   **Sodium Streetlights:** Orange-yellow pools of light creating long shadows
*   **Moonlight:** Cold blue-white light creating stark contrasts
*   **Temporal Glow:** Silvery luminescence from portals and distortions
*   **Reality Breaks:** Lighting that doesn't follow physics, impossible shadows
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by cold moonlight filtering through windows creating stark shadows. Orange streetlight glow from outside adds sickly yellow tones. A shimmering temporal portal provides silvery-blue illumination that shouldn't exist, creating impossible shadows that go in wrong directions. High contrast between light and dark. The lighting feels wrong even though each source is realistic—together they create uncanny effect."

## Voice

A disconnected, prophetic narration style like someone observing events from outside time. The pacing is deliberate, dreamlike, with pauses that feel loaded with meaning. The tone shifts between teenage cynicism and cosmic dread, treating mundane observations and apocalyptic prophecy with the same matter-of-fact delivery. There's an undercurrent of inevitability, of already knowing how this ends. Slightly echoey, as if spoken across time. Numbers and countdown values are spoken with particular emphasis. Role: The voice of someone who's seen the future and knows they won't survive it.
