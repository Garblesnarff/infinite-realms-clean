# Empire of Endless Courses
## "Build Your Legacy, One Dish at a Time"

### Campaign Overview

The party inherits or wins a small, failing restaurant in the bustling merchant district of Culinary Haven, the world's premier food city. What starts as a simple business venture becomes an epic journey to build a restaurant empire that spans continents. The campaign blends business management with political intrigue as the party discovers that the most powerful people in this world aren't nobles or wizards - they're the Restaurant Emperors, chefs whose culinary empires control economies, influence politics, and shape culture.

As the party's restaurant grows from struggling tavern to prestigious establishment to multi-location empire, they'll face rival restaurateurs who use sabotage, hostile takeovers, and culinary espionage. The mysterious Guild of Golden Plates controls restaurant licensing, and earning their approval requires navigating complex politics, creating signature dishes, managing staff, and maintaining quality while expanding. The ultimate goal: Earn three Golden Plates, the highest rating, and a seat on the Guild Council where true power resides.

But success breeds enemies. The current Golden Plate holders will stop at nothing to maintain their monopoly. The party must balance running their businesses with defending against corporate warfare, all while never forgetting that ultimately, the food must be excellent. In this campaign, every dish served is a step toward empire, and every satisfied customer is a victory in a war fought with flavors instead of swords.
