# The Forgotten Shelf
## "In the dust and darkness, we still remember what it means to be loved."

### Campaign Overview

The attic of the Harrington family home has become a graveyard of forgotten memories. Toys from three generations gather dust on weathered shelves, slowly accepting their fate as discarded relics. But when young Emma Harrington discovers her grandmother's journal mentioning a "magical toy" hidden somewhere in the attic, the dormant playthings suddenly find themselves in a race against time. The journal's discovery has awakened something ancient—a wind-up music box ballerina named Melodia who claims to know the secret of becoming "unforgettable," a state where toys can never be abandoned or replaced.

However, not all toys believe in Melodia's promise. Factions have formed among the forgotten: the Preservationists who accept their obsolescence with dignity, the Revivalists who desperately seek to be played with again, and the Ascended who follow Melodia's mysterious path to transcendence. As Emma begins her search, accidentally bringing toys to life through her grandmother's silver key, the players must navigate the politics of abandonment, the terror of being replaced by newer models, and the existential horror of watching their paint fade and joints stiffen with each passing season.

The campaign explores what happens when nostalgia becomes power, when memories are the only currency that matters, and when toys must choose between acceptance and rebellion against their inevitable obsolescence. The attic itself is changing, reshaping based on whose memories hold strongest, and soon the players realize that Melodia's promise of becoming "unforgettable" comes at a price none of them expected to pay.

### Core Themes

- **Generational Divide**: Old toys vs. slightly less old toys vs. recent discards
- **The Terror of Dust**: Physical decay as a constant threat
- **Dignity in Abandonment**: Accepting fate vs. raging against it

- Description: Maze of stacked moving boxes, creates canyons and tunnels for toy-sized beings
- Features: Box labels tell sad stories ("Emma's Baby Clothes," "Dad's Old Trophies," "Divorce Papers")

**The Yard Sale Zone** (Final Level)
- Description: Front lawn transformed into marketplace of obsolescence; toys sold for quarters
- Timing: Only accessible during final sessions; represents point of no return
- Mechanics: Real-time pressure—if not "saved" by Emma's memory, toys are sold to strangers
- Horror: Watching identity dissolve as new owners project different stories onto them

### Unique Mechanics

**The Stillness** (Core Rule)
- When observed by humans (or pets), toys must freeze completely
- Wisdom saving throw to freeze fast enough; failure means being noticed
- Being noticed means being examined, possibly discarded if deemed "creepy"
- Some toys can partially move (slight shifts) while observed—master level skill

**Memory Resonance**
- Toys gain power when near objects from their "era" of play
- Stronger when Emma or family members reminisce nearby
- Can spend Memory Points for special abilities: repair damage, move faster, influence human perception
- Memory fades over time; less-remembered toys are weaker, translucent

**Dust Degradation**
- Constitution checks each long rest to avoid dust damage
- Accumulation of dust makes movement harder, eventually causes paralysis
- Cleaning is dangerous (requires human help or risky self-cleaning)
- Degraded toys visible as faded, colorless, losing definition

**Scale Physics**
- Stairs are mountain climbs; furniture is cliff faces
- String, thread, paperclips are climbing equipment
- Falling more than 3 feet can break toys (lethal damage)
- Human schedule dictates when movement is safe (night, school hours, work hours)

**The Bond Meter**
- Tracks Emma's memory/love for each toy
- Rises through triggered nostalgia (finding old photos, stories, etc.)
- Falls when contradicted (Emma says "I don't remember this toy")
- At zero, toy begins to fade, becomes unreal
- At maximum, toy becomes unforgettable (campaign goal)

**Repair and Damage**
- Toys have specific weak points: joints, paint, stuffing, plastic seams
- Damage is permanent unless specifically repaired
- Missing pieces reduce maximum HP
- "Broken" status means limited actions until fixed
- Workshop tools can heal but require dangerous journey

**Pet Awareness**
- Cats and dogs can sense toy movement always
- Chairman Meow actively hunts; Duke protects but is old/slow
- Pet encounters use stealth vs. perception checks
- Being caught by cat is near-certain destruction

### Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: The Key's Curse**
- The silver key doesn't grant life—it traps ghosts of children's imaginations in toys
- Emma is unknowingly imprisoning spirits by searching for the magical toy
- Melodia knows this; wants to trap Emma's grandmother's spirit permanently

**Twist 2: Emma's Choice**
- Emma must choose ONE toy to keep; all others go to yard sale
- Players must decide: compete or cooperate to ensure the "right" choice
- The Mirror shows Emma's true favorite—it might not be any player character

**Twist 3: The Broken Toys' Revenge**
- Led by Sergeant Brick, broken toys plan to destroy Mirror so ALL toys are forgotten equally
- "If we can't be remembered, no one should be"
- Players must stop them or join their nihilistic crusade

**Twist 4: Mother's Plan**
- Emma's mother was also a Harrington child; she remembers the toys
- She's not cleaning the attic to be cruel—she's protecting Emma from the same obsession with the past that trapped her
- Must convince her that some memories are worth keeping

**Twist 5: Grandfather's Legacy**
- The "magical toy" is the friends we made along the way (no, seriously)
- Grandfather built toys to teach lessons about impermanence and love
- The real magic is accepting that being temporary doesn't mean being meaningless

**Complication 1: The New Toys**
- Emma's current favorites send spies to attic to ensure old toys don't return
- They're terrified of being replaced by nostalgic "classics"
- Create three-way conflict: old toys vs. new toys vs. Melodia

**Complication 2: The Yard Sale Countdown**
- Real-time pressure: sessions represent actual days
- Random events: early bargain hunters, weather delays, Emma's resistance
- Each session, some NPC toys are sold/lost forever

**Complication 3: The Collector**
- A toy collector arrives at yard sale, knows some toys are valuable
- Being "valuable" means museum/collection—preserved but never played with again
- Is this salvation or another form of death?

### Victory Conditions

- Escape the house, find community of "wild toys" living independently
- Abandon Emma before she can abandon them
- Find new purpose beyond being playthings

**Pyrrhic Victory: The Broken Mirror**
- Destroy the Mirror, preventing Melodia's plan
- But this also destroys the Key's magic—all toys return to ordinary objects
- Last moments of consciousness spent ensuring Emma isn't harmed by magic
- Noble end, but still an end

### Defeat Conditions

**Tragic Defeat: Melodia's Triumph**
- Melodia completes ritual, becomes sole unforgettable toy
- All other toys are erased from Emma's memory entirely
- Players fade to nothing, aware they're disappearing
- Emma only remembers the dancing ballerina, forgets her grandmother's true message

- Slow fade as attic visits become annual, then never
- Final scene: dust-covered players watch Emma's wedding/moving out through attic window

**Horror Defeat: The Collector's Curse**
- Players are identified as valuable, sealed in plastic cases
- Preserved forever but never touched, never played with
- Conscious but motionless, watching world through plastic for eternity
- Immortal but dead—exactly what they feared

### Campaign Notes

This campaign works best with players who embrace melancholy and existential themes. The horror isn't jump scares but the slow realization that obsolescence is inevitable. Success means accepting impermanence with grace while fighting for dignity and meaning.

The toy perspective should be emphasized mechanically—scale makes everything dangerous, human movement is earthquakes, and time moves differently (one month is a lifetime for a toy).

Melodia should be sympathetic even as antagonist. She's not evil—she's terrified, just like everyone else. Her methods are extreme, but her fear of being forgotten is universal.

The campaign can be lighthearted (toy antics, silly encounters) or deeply tragic (watching identity dissolve, facing meaninglessness). Tone should match player preference, but underlying themes remain constant.

Consider using actual toys as miniatures/props to enhance immersion. Have players describe their toy bodies in detail—material, size, condition, any damage or wear.

Final sessions should feel like a goodbye—to characters, to childhood, to simpler times. Win or lose, something precious is ending. That's the point.
