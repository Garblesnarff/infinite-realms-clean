# The Forgotten Shelf - World Building Specification

## The Laws of Toy Reality

### The Prime Law: The Stillness
When observed by a being with "The Sight" (humans, some animals), toys MUST freeze. This isn't a choice—it's a fundamental law of toy existence, as inviolable as gravity. Breaking The Stillness means ceasing to be a toy and becoming something else (usually resulting in immediate death/return to object state).

**Mechanics of The Stillness:**
- Detection radius: Toys can sense when eyes are upon them (20ft for humans, 40ft for pets)
- Freeze time: Must achieve stillness within 1 second (Wisdom save DC 15)
- Partial observation: If seen only peripherally, toys can make micro-movements
- Photography/Video: Still counts as observation (cameras have "sight")
- Mirrors: Complicated—reflection isn't direct sight, allows limited movement
- Sleeping humans: No sight, safe to move
- Blind humans: No sight requirement, but sound becomes critical

**Consequences of Breaking The Stillness:**
1. First violation: Human notices, picks up toy, examines (terrifying experience)
2. Second violation: Human becomes unsettled, may discard toy as "creepy"
3. Third violation: Toy's magic breaks—becomes ordinary object permanently
4. Intentional violation: Instant return to object state (some toys choose this to end suffering)

### The Second Law: The Bond
Toys exist in a quantum state between object and being, sustained by human belief/love/memory. The stronger the emotional connection, the more "real" the toy becomes.

**Bond Strength Tiers:**
- **Unforgettable** (Legendary): Toy is completely real, can never be forgotten, may even survive owner's death
- **Beloved** (Strong): Toy is vivid, colorful, capable of complex thought and emotion
- **Remembered** (Moderate): Toy is faded but functional, personality intact
- **Vague** (Weak): Toy is translucent, struggling to maintain identity
- **Forgotten** (None): Toy is fading out of existence, becoming object

**Bond Sources:**
- Original owner's memories (strongest)
- Secondary owner memories (moderate)
- Witnessed play (weak)
- Photographs featuring toy (sustained connection)
- Stories told about toy (narrative power)
- Physical touch/interaction (immediate boost)

**Bond Degradation:**
- Each year without interaction: -1 Bond level
- Active rejection ("I don't remember this"): -2 Bond levels
- Replacement by similar toy: -3 Bond levels
- Owner's death without heir: Slow fade over weeks

### The Third Law: Scale
Toys experience reality at their physical scale. A 6-inch action figure perceives the world as if they are 6 inches tall. This isn't metaphorical—physics, time, and space literally operate differently at toy scale.

**Scale Effects:**
- Fall damage: 3 feet = potentially lethal
- Speed: Human walking = earthquake footsteps, car passing = hurricane
- Temperature: Small mass means rapid heat loss/gain
- Time perception: Debates exist whether toys experience time differently (some claim one human year = several toy years)
- Strength ratio: Toys are weaker than scale suggests (made of light materials)

**Scale Advantages:**
- Can hide in tiny spaces
- Light weight allows creative climbing
- Small size makes dust storms, water drops, etc. into explorable terrain
- Human detritus becomes resources (thread = rope, paperclips = grappling hooks)

**Scale Disadvantages:**
- Every household object is potential hazard
- Gaps in floorboards are crevasses
- Insects are significant threats
- Weather affects them more severely
- Can't affect human-scale objects easily

### The Fourth Law: Material Truth
Toys are made of their materials. A plastic toy is plastic, with all limitations. A cloth toy is cloth. Magic doesn't change this—it animates what exists.

**Material Properties:**

**Plastic Toys**
- Durable but brittle (can shatter if dropped)
- Joints are weak points (stress fractures)
- Sunlight causes fading and brittleness
- Chemical damage from cleaners
- Can't heal naturally—require repair

**Cloth/Plush Toys**
- Soft, flexible, good at absorbing impacts
- Vulnerable to tears and rips
- Stuffing loss = HP loss
- Water damage causes mildew, stiffness
- Can be resewn/healed with thread

**Porcelain/Ceramic Toys**
- Beautiful but extremely fragile
- Cracks spread over time
- Shattering often means death
- Elegant movement but constant fear
- Repairs visible, add character but reduce integrity

**Wood Toys**
- Solid, durable, heavy for size
- Vulnerable to rot, termites, water warping
- Can be sanded/repaired
- Grain and knots create personality
- Oldest material—claims to be "original" toys

**Metal Toys**
- Strong but heavy (movement costs more energy)
- Rust is disease (spreads, debilitating)
- Joints seize without maintenance
- Conductive (lightning, static electricity risks)
- Magnetic toys have special properties/vulnerabilities

**Hybrid Toys**
- Most toys are mixed materials (action figure = plastic + cloth + rubber)
- Each material has its vulnerabilities
- Repairs often use wrong materials (creates tension/identity issues)

### The Fifth Law: Purpose Memory
Every toy remembers what it was made for. This purpose is core to identity, but can be source of despair when purpose can no longer be fulfilled.

**Purpose Types:**
- **Comfort** (teddy bears, dolls): Meant to be held, provide emotional support
- **Action** (soldiers, superheroes): Meant for adventure play, battle scenarios
- **Education** (alphabet blocks, puzzles): Meant to teach
- **Collection** (fine dolls, display items): Meant to be admired, never played with
- **Generic** (McDonald's toys, party favors): No clear purpose, seeking identity

**Purpose Conflict:**
When purpose can't be fulfilled, toys experience existential crisis. Comfort toys with no one to comfort, action toys with no battles to fight, educational toys with no students—all face void of meaning.

**Purpose Evolution:**
Some toys find new purposes (soldier becomes protector instead of warrior, doll becomes leader instead of dress-up object). This is character growth in toy terms.

## The Geography of the Harrington House

### First Floor
**The Living Room**
- Square footage: 400 sq ft (from toy perspective: massive open plain)
- Terrain: Hardwood floor (smooth, dangerous for falls), area rugs (soft landing, cover)
- Hazards: Vacuum cleaner route (death zone), TV (hypnotic effect), couch gaps (can trap toys)
- Resources: Power outlets (energy source for electric toys), dropped items
- Travel time: 10 minutes for quick toy, 30 minutes for damaged/slow

**The Kitchen**
- Square footage: 250 sq ft
- Terrain: Tile floor (even more dangerous for falls, very hard), appliances like mountains
- Hazards: Water (sink, dishwasher leaks), heat (stove), sticky substances
- Deadly zones: Garbage disposal, under refrigerator (dust, heat, vibration)
- Resources: Food (though toys don't eat, some can use for craft/repair), aluminum foil, plastic bags

**The Hallway**
- Main artery connecting rooms
- Narrow from human perspective, vast from toy perspective
- High traffic area—dangerous during daytime
- Photo gallery wall (important for memories—pictures showing toys with young Emma/grandmother)

### Second Floor
**Emma's Room**
- Square footage: 200 sq ft (child's bedroom)
- Terrain: Carpeted (soft, hides movement, but slower travel)
- Zones: Bed (mountain with cloth canyons), Desk (high ground, strategic), Closet (dark territory)
- Population: 30-40 current toys (PC rivals/enemies)
- The Mirror: Mounted on dresser, 4 feet off ground (major quest objective)
- Security: Emma's presence during evening, New Toys patrol during day

**Parents' Bedroom**
- Forbidden zone (adults will immediately discard found toys)
- Contains Mother's childhood items (she was a Harrington child too)
- Possible ally items from her generation
- Dangerous due to adult schedules (unpredictable presence)

**Bathroom**
- Water hazards everywhere
- Humidity damages cloth and wood toys
- Drain = oblivion (toys lost to plumbing never return)
- Medicine cabinet has useful repair supplies (glue, cotton balls, tape)

### Third Floor (Attic)
**The Forgotten Shelf** (Starting Area)
- Highest point in attic, 8 feet off floor
- 6-foot-long wooden shelf, 12 inches deep
- Population: 15-20 oldest toys (1950s-1980s)
- Access: Climbing stacked boxes, rope made from string
- Lighting: Single window, direct sunlight 2-4 PM only
- Hazards: Weak wood (could collapse), bird nests outside window

**The Cardboard Valleys**
- Central attic area, 20+ moving boxes stacked
- Creates 3D maze, multiple levels
- Box contents: Holiday decorations, old clothes, paperwork, forgotten junk
- Unstable—boxes shift when humans search attic
- Home to insects (silverfish, spiders—giant from toy perspective)

**The Christmas Grotto** (Melodia's Territory)
- Northeast corner, tangled mass of decorations
- Artificial tree branches create forest canopy
- String lights (non-working) create web-like structure
- Melodia's shrine at center: photos, offerings from follower toys
- The Silver Ornament: Portal to Mirror Realm (magic fast-travel point)

**The Eaves** (Dangerous Frontier)
- Sloped ceiling areas, cramped, full of insulation
- Extreme temperatures (hot in summer, cold in winter)
- Nesting animals (squirrels, birds, bats)
- Lost toys who went feral, damaged beyond recognition
- Rumors of "The First Toy"—oldest toy in house, possibly ancient

### Basement Level
**The Workshop**
- Square footage: 600 sq ft (massive for toys)
- Emma's grandfather's woodworking space (he's deceased)
- Resources: Tools (can repair toys), paint, glue, wood scraps
- Hazards: Tool edges (lethal), sawdust dunes, chemical smells
- Spirit presence?: Tools sometimes move on their own, helpful presence
- Contains blueprints/notes about "toy magic" (grandfather knew)

**The Laundry Room**
- Washing machine = whirlpool of doom
- Dryer = fire dungeon (heat, tumbling)
- Lost & Found: Toys sometimes found in laundry (rescue opportunities)
- Lint = usable resource (soft, insulating)

**Storage Closet**
- Cleaning supplies (chemical hazards)
- Extra boxes and bags (escape route resources)
- Suitcases (could hide in for transport out of house)

### Exterior Territories
**The Yard**
- Grass = jungle (blades taller than small toys)
- Garden = wilderness with giant plants
- Sandbox = desert (if toy buried, very hard to escape)
- Shed = frontier outpost (outdoor toys live here, different culture)

**The Yard Sale Zone** (Late Campaign)
- Front lawn transformed into marketplace
- Blankets laid out = display areas
- Price tags = death sentences
- Strangers = alien invaders taking toys to unknown fates

## Factions and Politics

### The Preservationists
**Leader:** Captain Striker (1960s G.I. Joe-type)
**Philosophy:** Dignity in acceptance; graceful obsolescence
**Membership:** Older toys, primarily action figures and practical toys
**Goals:**
- Maintain order and calm among forgotten toys
- Prevent undignified scrambling for human attention
- Preserve memories of "proper" toy behavior
- Ensure younger toys understand "the way things are"

**Beliefs:**
- Being discarded is natural, even honorable
- Toys served their purpose by bringing childhood joy
- Attempting to return to play is selfish and pathetic
- The dignified toy accepts fate without complaint
- Better to fade quietly than rage desperately

**Methods:**
- Philosophical counseling
- Enforcing social norms (shame-based)
- Blocking access to escape routes
- Sabotaging Revivalist plans "for their own good"

**Internal Conflict:**
- Many secretly desperate to be remembered
- Rigid code prevents admitting fear/sadness
- Younger members questioning if acceptance equals giving up

### The Revivalists
**Leader:** The Duchess (Porcelain Doll)
**Philosophy:** Fight obsolescence; return to relevance at any cost
**Membership:** Toys replaced by similar models, competitive personalities
**Goals:**
- Return to Emma's room and active play
- Make themselves visible and desirable to Emma
- Eliminate competition (other toys trying same thing)
- Prove they're "still good enough"

**Beliefs:**
- Obsolescence is not inevitable with enough effort
- Newer toys aren't actually better
- Human nostalgia can be triggered and exploited
- Being forgotten is failure, being remembered is victory
- Toys have right to fight for survival

**Methods:**
- Strategic visibility (calculated "accidents" where Emma finds them)
- Sabotaging new toys (making them less appealing)
- Self-improvement (cleaning, repairing, staying shiny)
- Forming alliances with influential toys

**Internal Conflict:**
- Desperation leads to increasingly unethical behavior
- In-fighting over who "deserves" to return most
- Fear that even success won't bring lasting happiness

### The Ascended (Melodia's Cult)
**Leader:** Melodia (Music Box Ballerina)
**Philosophy:** Transcend toyhood; become truly unforgettable
**Membership:** Toys seeking meaning beyond human validation
**Goals:**
- Complete the Unforgettable Ritual
- Find and use the Mirror of True Love
- Achieve permanent existence independent of human memory
- Elevate one toy (Melodia) to eternal beloved status

**Beliefs:**
- Current toy existence is liminal, incomplete
- Being "real" (like Velveteen Rabbit) is achievable
- Human love can be concentrated and captured
- One perfect toy can hold all memory/love
- Sacrifice of many for transcendence of one is acceptable

**Methods:**
- Mystical rituals in Christmas Grotto
- Collecting memory tokens (photos, notes about toys)
- Studying the silver key and mirror
- Recruiting through promises of meaning
- Eliminating obstacles (including other toys)

**Internal Conflict:**
- Most members don't know Melodia's full plan
- Some joined seeking community, not cultish transcendence
- Growing realization that ritual requires sacrifice

### The Broken (Nihilist Faction)
**Leader:** Sergeant Brick (LEGO Minifigure)
**Philosophy:** If we can't be whole, no one should be
**Membership:** Damaged toys beyond easy repair
**Goals:**
- Destroy the Mirror (prevent any toy from ascending)
- Tear down faction hierarchies
- Force all toys to accept broken reality
- Find meaning in shared suffering

**Beliefs:**
- The system (human love = existence) is fundamentally broken
- Wholeness is illusion; all toys eventually break
- Pretending to be okay perpetuates false hope
- Honest despair is better than false optimism
- If everyone is broken, no one is

**Methods:**
- Sabotaging repair efforts
- Destroying hope through harsh truths
- Planning to shatter Mirror before anyone can use it
- Building solidarity through shared trauma

**Internal Conflict:**
- Some members just want pain acknowledged, not eternal
- Sergeant Brick's nihilism is actually inverted hope (if no one can win, no one loses)
- Youngest members uncertain if destruction is answer

### The Neutrals
**Key Figure:** Patches (Teddy Bear)
**Philosophy:** All perspectives have truth; seek balance
**Membership:** Older toys who've seen cycles repeat
**Goals:**
- Mediate between factions
- Preserve actual toy history (oral tradition)
- Protect younger toys from faction manipulation
- Find third path beyond acceptance/resistance/transcendence

**Beliefs:**
- Every toy's journey is individual
- No single philosophy fits all toys
- Being forgotten is sad but not evil
- Being remembered is beautiful but not everything
- The journey matters more than destination

**Methods:**
- Storytelling and wisdom sharing
- Emotional support without agenda
- Physical protection of vulnerable toys
- Seeking compromise solutions

## Magic System: Memory and Belief

### The Silver Key
**Origin:** Emma's grandmother's key, found in journal
**Function:** Activates latent toy consciousness when nearby
**Range:** 30-foot radius
**Limitations:**
- Only works when Emma possesses it
- Doesn't work on toys never loved (factory-new, never played with)
- Unstable—sometimes activates unexpectedly, sometimes fails
- Gets weaker as Emma's childhood fades

**How It Works:**
The key is conduit for belief. Emma's search for "magical toy" generates enough belief energy to manifest toy consciousness. The act of looking for magic creates magic.

### Memory Points (Campaign Resource)
Toys can collect and spend Memory Points for special abilities.

**Gaining Memory Points:**
- Being in presence of photo showing you: 1 MP per hour
- Hearing story about you: 2 MP
- Being touched/held by original owner: 5 MP
- Being played with: 10 MP (rare, campaign-defining event)
- Triggering nostalgia in human: 3 MP

**Spending Memory Points:**
- Instant repair (1 HP): 2 MP
- Enhanced movement (double speed for scene): 1 MP
- Influence human perception (make them notice you "accidentally"): 3 MP
- Memory vision (see past event involving you): 2 MP
- Material transcendence (briefly ignore material limits): 5 MP
- The Stillness bypass (move slightly while observed): 10 MP

### The Mirror of True Love
**Description:** Antique standing mirror in Emma's room
**Magic Property:** Reflects not appearance, but "truth of heart"
**Toy Effect:** Shows which toy Emma truly loves most

**Mirror Mechanics:**
- Can only be read during specific times (golden hour sunlight)
- Reflection changes based on Emma's current emotional state
- Shows not current favorite, but deepest childhood love
- Can be ritually altered (Melodia's plan)

**Ritual of Unforgetting:**
Melodia's secret plan to capture Emma's love permanently:
1. Gather tokens of all competing toys
2. Position Mirror during golden hour
3. Sing the Unbinding Song (her music box melody)
4. Mirror absorbs all toy-memories except Melodia's
5. Emma remembers only Melodia, forgets all others
6. Melodia becomes real, other toys cease to exist

### Toy Magic Abilities

## Secrets and Revelations

### The Grandfather's Legacy
Emma's grandfather was toymaker who discovered children's love could animate toys. He embedded this knowledge in journal, hoping future Harrington child would learn to see magic. He didn't predict it would cause conflict among toys.

### Emma's Mother's Story
She was Harrington child too. She played with many attic toys. She's cleaning attic because she knows toys "come alive" and believes letting go is healthier than clinging to animated past. She's trying to protect Emma from her own childhood where she loved toys too much.

### The First Toy Theory
Oldest toys whisper about "The First Toy"—original Harrington toy from 1890s. Supposedly achieved true immortality but went mad from loneliness (all humans they loved died). Now haunts the eaves, warns toys not to seek unforgettable status.

### Melodia's Broken Heart
She was grandmother's favorite, treasured for 60 years. But when grandmother died, family immediately packed Melodia away (music box broken, seemed worthless). She experienced 60 years of perfect love, then instant abandonment. This broke something fundamental. Her quest isn't evil—it's trauma.

### The Truth About Being Real
"Real" isn't about human love at all—it's about self-perception. Velveteen Rabbit became real when HE believed he was real, not when Boy loved him. Toys are already real; they just don't know it. The entire quest is magnificent distraction from accepting this truth.

### Chairman Meow's Nature
The cat is sustained by hunting magical toys—literally eating their consciousness extends his life. He's ancient because he's been doing this for decades. He's not evil by nature; he's just surviving the only way he knows. But that doesn't make him less deadly.

### The Silver Key's Origin
It's not actually magical. Emma's grandmother left it as symbol—"the key to magic is belief." Emma believing it's magical makes it magical. If Emma stops believing, all toys revert. Faith is the actual power source.

### The Mirror's Truth
It doesn't show Emma's favorite toy. It shows Emma's own reflection—her truest self. If toys look in Mirror, they don't see Emma's love, they see themselves as they truly are (stripped of pretense and denial). This is Melodia's actual plan—force all toys to see themselves honestly, which will break most of them, leaving her strongest.

## Campaign Themes (Deep Dive)

### Obsolescence
Not just about being replaced, but about confronting mortality in slow motion. Watching yourself become irrelevant, outdated, forgotten while still conscious. The horror of being alive but purposeless.

### Identity Without Function
When you were made for specific purpose (comfort, battle, education) and can no longer fulfill it, who are you? Are you still yourself? Can you reinvent, or is core identity fixed?

### Nostalgia as Weapon and Shield
Memories can sustain (give toys life) but also trap (prevent moving forward). Campaign explores whether living in past is sometimes necessary survival strategy, sometimes toxic avoidance.

### Dignity vs. Survival
Is it more noble to accept fate gracefully or fight desperately? Neither answer is fully right. Campaign should make players genuinely unsure which path is better.

### The Terror of Being Seen
Toys exist in liminal space—alive but must pretend to be dead. Being truly seen (humans knowing they're alive) means death. Metaphor for imposter syndrome, marginalized existence, code-switching.

### Collective vs. Individual Good
Should one toy be saved if it means others suffer? Melodia's plan saves one by sacrificing all. Is this ever justified? What about saving a few by letting most go?

### Love as Power and Prison
Human love gives toys life, but also defines and constrains them. Can toys exist without human validation? Should they? What does healthy vs. codependent relationship with memory look like?

## Victory Path Variations

### Path 1: Redemption
- Convince Melodia her plan is wrong
- Find way to make multiple toys unforgettable
- Emma learns to remember meaningfully rather than hoarding
- Some toys still sold, but it's okay because properly grieved
- Closure, bittersweet but healthy

### Path 2: Revolution
- Reject human validation entirely
- Escape house, find toy community in wider world
- Self-determination over being playthings
- Lose magic (no more human belief) but gain freedom
- Start new existence on own terms

### Path 3: Sacrifice
- One player becomes unforgettable, saves others through their position
- Remains with Emma, subtle guides her to value other toys
- Prevents wholesale purge
- Most PCs still sold but one ensures their sacrifice meant something

### Path 4: Acceptance
- All players choose graceful obsolescence
- Help Emma have healthy relationship with letting go
- Final session is beautiful goodbye
- Toys fade knowing they fulfilled purpose
- Peaceful ending about life's natural cycles

### Path 5: Tragedy Embraced
- Join with Broken faction
- Destroy Mirror, key, all hope of transcendence
- If no one can win, at least it's fair
- Dark ending about systems so broken, destruction is only answer
- Nihilistic but strangely liberating

## Physical Props Recommendation

For maximum immersion, consider using:
- Actual vintage toys as character miniatures
- Dollhouse furniture for scale reference
- Printed photos of "Emma's family"
- Small music box playing during Melodia scenes
- Silver key prop
- Hand mirror for The Mirror
- Dice and ruler painted to be "in scale" with toy perspective

## Final Notes

This campaign requires mature players willing to engage with themes of mortality, obsolescence, and impermanence. It's not a power fantasy—it's an exploration of meaning in the face of inevitable decline.

The best sessions will be quiet character moments, not combat. The horror comes from existential dread, not monsters. The triumph comes from finding peace or purpose, not victory.

DMs should emphasize the beauty in decay, the dignity in endings, and the courage required to face obsolescence with grace—whether by accepting it or fighting it.

Every toy's journey is metaphor for aging, irrelevance, and mortality. Play with heart.
