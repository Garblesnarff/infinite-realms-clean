But Rapture has fallen into chaos: its citizens are ADAM-addicted "Splicers," genetically mutated and insane. A man named Atlas guides them via radio with the phrase "Would you kindly..." while they're hunted by Big Daddies protecting Little Sisters who harvest genetic material from corpses. As they uncover Rapture's secrets, they discover they're mind-controlled sleeper agents, and everything they've done was programmed. They must break their conditioning and choose their own path.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 18-24 sessions)

A descent through a failed utopia, discovering free will was an illusion all along.

*   **Act I — Welcome to Rapture (Sessions 1-8):** The party crashes and finds Rapture, guided by Atlas who needs help rescuing his family. They navigate through ruined Art Deco districts fighting Splicers and avoiding Big Daddies—massive diving-suit guardians of Little Sisters. They discover Plasmids—genetic modifications granting powers like fire, electricity, and telekinesis. Atlas uses the phrase "Would you kindly" to politely ask them to do tasks. They learn Andrew Ryan built Rapture on objectivist principles: "No gods or kings, only man." But ADAM—a genetic substance harvested from sea slugs—created the Splicer plague as people addicted to genetic power went insane. The party fights through Ryan's forces to reach his office.
*   **Act II — The Revelation (Sessions 9-16):** Confronting Andrew Ryan, they expect a boss fight. Instead, he reveals the truth: "Would you kindly" is their trigger phrase—they're a sleeper agent created by Fontaine (pretending to be Atlas) to destroy Ryan. Everything they've done was programmed. Ryan proves it by commanding them: "Would you kindly kill me" and they're compelled to beat him to death. It's horrifying. They were never in control. The twist recontextualizes the entire campaign. Fontaine reveals himself and orders them to continue serving. But they can resist now—the programming is breaking. They must decide whether to save or harvest the Little Sisters (innocent girls turned into ADAM collectors).
*   **Act III — Breaking Free (Sessions 17-24):** The party fights to break Fontaine's control with help from Dr. Tenenbaum, who created the Little Sisters. If they saved the Sisters, the girls help them. If they harvested them for power, they're alone. They assault Fontaine's headquarters, Point Prometheus, fighting through his army of Splicers and Big Daddies. The final battle is against Fontaine himself, massively overdosed on ADAM and transformed into a monster. After his defeat, the Little Sisters swarm him if saved, or the party absorbs his ADAM if harvested. Epilogue: Escape Rapture (if good) or rule it as the new tyrant (if evil). Either way, they've proven free will exists—by choosing their own ending.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of free will vs. control, objectivism's failure, the price of unchecked freedom, and whether choice exists if you're programmed. It asks: Can a slave become a man through choice? Does absolute freedom lead to chaos? Are you responsible for actions done under mind control? The central conflict pits the party's desire for agency against the revelation that they never had it—until they break free.
