# Creative Brief: Gearless

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Cyberpunk Boxing with Class Divide (Megalobox-inspired)

Inspired by the dystopian boxing aesthetics of *Megalobox* with emphasis on technological enhancement contrasted with raw humanity, class struggle, and the beauty of the underdog challenging the system. This style captures mechanical exoskeletons, grimy slums, corporate glamour, and the brutality of flesh versus steel.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Technology vs Humanity:** Mechanical Gear exoskeletons contrasted with bare human fists
*   **Class Divide:** Slum poverty vs corporate wealth, grimy streets vs gleaming arenas
*   **Brutal Realism:** Injury, sweat, blood, the physical cost of fighting enhanced opponents
*   **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** Neon lights, industrial decay, high-tech in a low-life world

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty cyberpunk, rising from slums, gearless vs geared, class struggle, raw humanity
*   **Feeling:** The brutality of flesh facing steel mixed with defiant pride. Dystopian poverty contrasted with corporate excess. The cost of fighting without enhancement to make a statement.

**2. Color Palette:**
*   **Slum Environment:** Rust browns, dirty grays, dim yellows, industrial decay
*   **Corporate Arena:** Bright neons, clean whites, chrome steel, LED displays
*   **Joe's Colors:** Red boxing trunks, bare arms showing tattoos and scars, brown skin tones
*   **Gear Effects:** Metallic silver/gray exoskeletons, glowing blue power indicators, hydraulic systems
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a grimy underground boxing ring lit by harsh fluorescent lights. Gearless Joe in simple red trunks and tape-wrapped fists faces an opponent in a bulky silver exoskeleton Gear with glowing blue power lines. The contrast is stark—bare human muscle versus mechanical enhancement. The ring canvas is stained. Shadowy figures bet in the background. Industrial warehouse setting with rust and decay. The atmosphere is desperate and brutal."

**3. Character Design:**
*   **Gearless Joe:** Athletic but lean build, extensive scars and tattoos, wrapped fists, simple red trunks
*   **Geared Fighters:** Mechanical exoskeletons covering arms and torso, glowing indicators, varying tech levels
*   **Class Indicators:** Joe's team wears worn clothes, opponents have corporate sponsors visible
*   **Prompt Example:** "Gearless Joe stands in fighting stance. Athletic muscular build showing years of fighting, skin marked with scars from previous matches. Arms wrapped in worn boxing tape. Simple red boxing trunks. No shoes. Facial expression is determined and defiant. Behind him, his opponent has a full mechanical Gear exoskeleton—silver metal plating covering arms and torso, glowing blue hydraulic lines, corporate sponsor logos. The size difference is intimidating."

**4. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Slum City:** Industrial decay, neon signs in foreign languages, crowded streets, poverty
*   **Underground Arena:** Illegal fighting pit, betting crowds, harsh lighting, dangerous atmosphere
*   **Sanctioned Ring:** Proper boxing ring but minimal production, working-class venue
*   **Megalonia Stadium:** Massive corporate arena, LED screens, luxury boxes, championship prestige
*   **Prompt Example:** "The Megalonia championship arena—a massive modern stadium with a regulation boxing ring at center. Enormous LED screens surround the venue displaying sponsors and fight stats. Luxury corporate boxes overlook the ring. Professional broadcast cameras positioned strategically. The lighting is dramatic and polished. Thousands of spectators fill the seats. The atmosphere radiates wealth and prestige, starkly different from where Joe began."

**5. Boxing Action:**
*   **Gear vs Gearless:** Mechanical enhanced punches versus human fists, size and power disparity
*   **Impact Effects:** Hydraulic power behind Gear punches, Joe's counters targeting joints
*   **Damage Visualization:** Bruising, cuts, swelling on Joe's unprotected body versus dented Gear
*   **Prompt Example:** "Joe delivers a powerful counter punch to his opponent's jaw, fist connecting with the Gear-protected head. His bare knuckles impact the metal helmet—risky but necessary. Sweat and blood spray from the impact. The opponent's Gear-enhanced body barely moves but the head snaps back. Joe's arm shows bruising from hitting metal all fight. His face is battered. The opponent's Gear has dents and damage. Both fighters show the toll of brutal combat."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Harsh Underground:** Fluorescent and bare bulb lighting creating hard shadows
*   **Neon Atmosphere:** Colored neon lights reflecting off wet streets and metal
*   **Arena Dramatics:** Spotlights on the ring, dramatic shadows, broadcast lighting
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single overhead spotlight in the underground ring. Joe is positioned in the light, his scarred torso and taped fists clearly visible. Harsh shadows emphasize his muscular definition and battle damage. His opponent's Gear catches the light, metal plating gleaming. The exoskeleton's blue power indicators glow in the shadows. The crowd surrounds them in darkness. The lighting creates a claustrophobic, desperate atmosphere."

## Voice

A voice that starts silent and nameless but builds to defiant declaration. The pacing is deliberate like a boxer's measured approach, then explosive in moments of commitment. The tone shifts between quiet determination, gritty survival instinct, and proud statements of human worth. There's an underlying theme of choosing your own name and identity, proving that unenhanced humanity has value. Includes moments of physical pain but unbreakable spirit. Role: The voice of the underclass refusing to stay down, fighting without armor or apology.
