# Creative Brief: Defying Destiny

## Art Style: Colorful Fantasy (Whimsical with Dark Undertones)

Inspired by Wicked's vibrant Oz aesthetic—emerald cities, fantastical creatures, colorful magic, but with underlying darkness and political oppression.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Vibrant and symbolic—Emerald City's greens, Shiz Academy's blues and golds, Elphaba's green skin and black witch attire, Glinda's pink and white perfection, the Wizard's false golden grandeur. Talking animals in natural colors. Magic is colorful sparkles and light.

**Character Design:** Fantasy fashion—Shiz students in academic robes with magical flair, Elphaba's iconic black witch outfit (pointed hat, long coat) but worn as resistance not evil, Glinda's elaborate pink gowns and crown, the Wizard in carnival ringmaster attire, animals dressed as professors and citizens. Everything is theatrical and larger than life.

**Environments:** Shiz Academy with fantastic architecture and magical classrooms, the gleaming Art Deco Emerald City hiding oppression, the Wizard's throne room of smoke and mirrors, animal prison's sterile horror, the Western castle as gothic refuge. Oz is beautiful but that beauty masks injustice.

**Action:** Elphaba learning to fly/levitate with magic, students practicing colorful spells, animals being silenced in horrific procedures, dramatic face-offs between former friends, the Wizard's mechanical "magic" revealed, defiant stands against authority.

## Voice

A voice of fierce determination and vulnerability—young, idealistic, capable of both righteous anger and tender friendship. Shifts between academic intellectualism, teenage emotional intensity, and powerful defiance. Can be Elphaba's passionate speeches about injustice, Glinda's performative popularity that hides doubt, or the Wizard's carnival barker charm. The voice of someone told they're wrong for being themselves, choosing to be themselves anyway.

## Music Style

Soaring contemporary musical theater with pop influences—think Wicked's score. "Defying Gravity" as the ultimate power anthem building to impossible heights with belt notes and orchestral swell. "Popular" as bouncy comedy. "For Good" as bittersweet friendship elegy with piano and two voices in harmony. "No Good Deed" as rock-influenced rage and despair. Mix of intimate character moments and huge production numbers. Music that makes you want to fly and fight.
