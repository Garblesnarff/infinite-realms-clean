### **World-Building Specification Brief: Defying Destiny**

**1. Core Concept:**
Outcasts at magic school discover the Wizard of Oz is a fraud oppressing talking animals through propaganda, and must choose between conforming for power or resisting tyranny knowing they'll be branded as villains—learning that "wickedness" is often courage.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Oz's history—once animals and humans lived equally, now animals are systematically silenced
*   Explain how the Wizard arrived from another world and seized power
*   Describe the Grimmerie—ancient book of powerful spells only Elphaba can read naturally
*   Write about Shiz Academy's role training sorcerers for the regime
*   Detail the propaganda system—how the Wizard controls the narrative
*   Explain color symbolism in Oz—green as other/wrong, pink as perfect/accepted
*   Describe what "melting" really means and the mythology around witches

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Wizard's Regime** (Major) - Government, propaganda machine, Gale Force secret police
*   **Shiz Academy** (Major) - Magic school that feeds regime with talented sorcerers
*   **The Animal Resistance** (Minor) - Underground network of talking animals fighting for rights
*   **Munchkinland** (Minor) - Rural area suffering under regime's policies
*   **The Flying Monkeys** (Minor) - Enslaved by magic, forced to serve whoever controls them
*   **The Popular Crowd** (Minor) - Students who benefit from and support the system

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Elphaba the Green, Galinda/Glinda the Good, The Wonderful Wizard, Fiyero the Prince, Doctor Dillamond, Madame Morrible
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Shiz Student," "Gale Force Agent," "Speaking Animal," "Oppressed Munchkin," "Emerald City Citizen," "Flying Monkey," "Ozian Noble"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Shiz Academy** - Prestigious magic school where injustice is first discovered
*   **The Emerald City** - Gleaming capital built on propaganda and lies
*   **The Wizard's Chamber** - Behind the curtain, mundane technology not magic
*   **The Animal Prison** - Where speaking animals are "treated" and silenced
*   **Kiamo Ko (Western Castle)** - Remote fortress, resistance's final refuge

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party exposes the Wizard THEN regime brands them as terrorists and "wicked"
*   IF party rescues animals THEN gain allies but become most wanted
*   IF Glinda chooses popularity over resistance THEN becomes "Good Witch" serving regime
*   IF Elphaba fully embraces her power THEN can fly but is forever outcast
*   IF party reads the Grimmerie THEN gain powerful magic but attract Morrible's attention
*   IF friendship between Elphaba and Glinda fractures THEN both are changed "for good"—permanently
