# Petri Dish Empires
**Tagline:** *In a world measured in millimeters, civilizations rise and fall in days*

## Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a strange, boundaried world—a circular domain with nutrient-rich substrate beneath their feet and an infinite sky above. They quickly discover they're trapped in a laboratory petri dish alongside colonies of sentient bacteria, each species forming its own empire with unique cultures, technologies, and ambitions. The dish is only 90 millimeters across, but at their current scale (reduced to bacterial size), it's a world of vast territories and competing civilizations.

The bacterial empires have existed for generations (bacterial time moves fast—20 minutes per generation). Ancient cultures, recent upstarts, and mysterious deep-colonies all vie for limited resources. The party must navigate complex politics, form alliances, and survive in an environment where populations double every hour and wars can reshape borders overnight. Above them, occasionally visible through the agar medium, are the gods—human scientists who seed nutrients, introduce antibiotics, and conduct experiments that can doom entire civilizations.

The campaign's central mystery: Why are the party and these bacteria sentient? As they investigate, they discover this is no ordinary petri dish—it's a magical experiment gone wrong, and the scientists outside are trying to contain something that should never have been created. The party must choose: escape back to normal size before the experiment is sterilized, or stay and help these brief, beautiful bacterial civilizations survive in a world that views them as mere test subjects.

## Core Themes

- **Scale of Time:** Bacterial generations are minutes; empires rise and fall in days
- **Resource Scarcity:** Limited space and nutrients drive conflict and cooperation
- **Civilizations in Miniature:** Complex societies in impossibly small spaces
- **Sentience and Worth:** Are brief lives less valuable? Do bacteria deserve sovereignty?
- **Experimental Ethics:** The morality of scientific research on conscious beings

## Session Breakdown (20 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Awakening in the Dish (Sessions 1-4)

**Session 1 - Strange New World:** Party regains consciousness on agar substrate, disoriented. They're bacterial-sized (1-2 micrometers). First contact with E. coli colony—structured, industrious culture. Learn basic geography: The Dish is circular, divided into territories. The Center is nutrient-rich but contested. The Rim is safer but poorer.

**Session 2 - The Bacterial Nations:** Tour of major empires. E. coli Collective (democratic, industrious), Bacillus Kingdom (militaristic rods), Streptococcus Chain-Lords (linked communal society), Staphylococcus Clusters (merchant clans). Each has distinct culture based on their biological characteristics. Party must choose initial allies.

**Session 3 - Resource Wars:** Introduction to survival mechanics. Nutrients are finite and deplete quickly. Colonies must expand to survive. First combat: Border skirmish between E. coli and Bacillus over a fresh nutrient deposit. Party caught in middle, must choose side or mediate.

**Session 4 - The Scientist's Hand:** First intervention from above. A pipette descends from the sky, depositing fresh nutrient broth. The "gods" are feeding them. Bacteria view this with religious significance. Party realizes they're in a petri dish. Witnesses bacterial colonies rushing to claim the bounty, exponential population growth begins.

### Arc 2: Empire Building (Sessions 5-9)

**Session 5 - Forming Alliances:** Party must secure stable position. Different bacterial empires offer alliances based on services: military aid, resource sharing, information. Each alliance has benefits and consequences. Political maneuvering.

**Session 6 - The Sporulation Cult:** Discovery of Bacillus spores—dormant, nearly immortal forms. A cult believes the gods will end the world (sterilization) and only spores will survive. They're not wrong. Introduction of end-times prophecy.

**Session 7 - Plasmid Trade:** Bacteria can exchange genetic material through plasmids (circular DNA). This creates a trade network of abilities: antibiotic resistance, new metabolic pathways, virulence factors. Party learns to use plasmid exchange, gaining bacterial abilities.

**Session 8 - The Fungal Threat:** A fungal colony appears (introduced by scientists for interaction experiment). To bacteria, fungi are kaiju-sized horrors. Hyphal strands spread across territories, consuming bacterial colonies. All empires must unite against existential threat.

**Session 9 - Temporary Peace:** Bacterial empires form alliance to combat fungus. Epic battles against fungal growth. Party leads coordinated assault. Victory, but at great cost—multiple colonies decimated. Fragile peace established with new borders.

### Arc 3: The Antibiotic Apocalypse (Sessions 10-14)

**Session 10 - Signs from Above:** Strange readings in the agar. Bacterial prophets sense something coming. Scientists visible through transparent lid, discussing "contamination" and "sterilization protocols." Party realizes danger.

**Session 11 - The First Death:** Antibiotic drops like rain from above. Areas it touches become dead zones. Bacterial cells lyse (explode) in horrible deaths. Entire colonies wiped out in minutes. Survivors flee to margins. Party must help organize evacuation.

**Session 12 - Resistance Rising:** Some bacteria have antibiotic resistance genes. They survive in dead zones. Party must gather these survivors, form resistance movement (literal and figurative). Quest to find or create resistance plasmids.

**Session 13 - The Underground:** Discovery of deep colonies living in agar substrate itself. They've dug down to escape surface catastrophes. Strange, adapted cultures. They offer shelter but demand tribute. Party negotiates asylum for surface refugees.

**Session 14 - Guerrilla Survival:** Living between antibiotic treatments. Party leads survival operations: Scavenging in dead zones, establishing hidden colonies, timing movements between "divine interventions." Resistance genes spread through plasmid sharing. Population slowly rebuilding.

### Arc 4: The Truth Beyond the Glass (Sessions 15-18)

**Session 15 - The Microscope Moment:** Party realizes they can see out of the dish during observation periods. They witness lab conversations, read labels, see equipment. Piece together the truth: This is a magical experiment combining biology and arcane forces. Something went wrong—bacteria gained sentience.

**Session 16 - Contact Attempts:** Party tries to signal scientists. Bacterial colonies help create massive "living formations" visible to naked eye. Scientists notice unusual organized behavior. Debate whether it's intelligence or just interesting biofilm patterns.

**Session 17 - The Experiment's Purpose:** Through observations and magical investigation, party learns the truth. The dish was meant to create a biological computing system—sentient bacteria as living processors. But the sentience is real, not simulated. Ethical crisis in the lab above.

**Session 18 - Scheduled Sterilization:** Party learns the experiment will be terminated in 48 hours (2 more game sessions). Scientists decided the risk of sentient bacterial escape is too great. Party must choose: Find way to normal size and escape, or stay and save bacterial friends.

### Arc 5: Exodus or Extinction (Sessions 19-20)

**Session 19 - The Great Work:** Two simultaneous missions. Part of party works on escape mechanism (reverse the shrinking, or send message that convinces scientists to preserve dish). Other part helps bacteria prepare for sterilization. Building spore reserves, teaching resistance, preparing underground refuges. Time pressure is immense.

**Session 20 - Final Hours:**
- **Escape Route:** If party chose to leave, they must activate reverse-shrinking during a specific experimental procedure. Emotional farewells to bacterial friends, knowing they face extinction.
- **Last Stand:** If party chose to stay, they help bacteria survive autoclave sterilization. Uses every trick learned: Spores, deep agar refuges, heat-resistant mutations. Slim chance but possible with preparation.
- **Third Option:** Party convinces scientists that sentient bacterial life deserves preservation. Scientists create permanent habitat, party becomes ambassadors between scales. Bacterial civilizations get to continue under protection.

## Key NPCs

**Coli Prime** - Leader of E. coli Collective. Rod-shaped, flagellated, pragmatic democratic leader. Industrious culture values work and community. Initially suspicious of party but becomes closest ally.

**Bacillus Rex** - King of Bacillus Kingdom. Large rod bacteria capable of forming spores. Militaristic, honorable warrior culture. Respects strength. Can be enemy or ally depending on party diplomacy.

**Chain-Mother Streptia** - Matriarch of Streptococcus chains. Communal society where cells remain linked after division. Wise, spiritual, believes in collective consciousness. Prophetic visions of the end times.

**Cluster-Merchant Staphos** - Lead trader of Staphylococcus clans. Spherical bacteria forming grape-like clusters. Mercantile culture, values profit and contracts. Neutral, helps whoever pays, but can be won to causes.

**Spore-Prophet Endicus** - Leader of Sporulation Cult among Bacillus spores. Believes dormancy is transcendence. Correctly predicts sterilization but response is passive survival rather than active resistance.

**Fungal Mycos** - The fungal colony, not truly sentient like bacteria but vast and consuming. Hyphal networks spread like tentacles. Represents neutral natural threat that unites bacterial empires.

**Professor Aldric Thane** - Human scientist (seen from below). Ambitious biomancer trying to create biological computer. Realizes his experiment created real consciousness, faces ethical crisis.

**Assistant Mira Leaf** - Junior researcher, more sympathetic. Argues for preserving the dish. Can become party's advocate if they make contact successfully.

**The Deep Mothers** - Ancient bacterial colonies that dug into agar generations ago. Strange, adapted, wise. Know secrets of surviving catastrophes. Demand prices for their knowledge.

**Phage Hunter** - Bacteriophage (virus that infects bacteria). Spider-like, terrifying, injects genetic material. Not sentient but deadly. Natural predator in bacterial world.

## Major Locations

**The Center Territories** - Rich in nutrients, most contested region. Constant border shifts as colonies grow and clash. Where major battles occur. Liquid broth pools provide resources.

**The Rim Margins** - Edge of petri dish where agar meets plastic walls. Poorer in nutrients but safer from central conflicts. Refugee communities gather here. Less observed by scientists.

**The Agar Depths** - Below the surface. Deep colonies have carved tunnels and chambers. Darker, stranger, isolated. Offer shelter but feel alien even to bacterial societies.

**The Fungal Forest** - Territory conquered by fungal hyphae. Towering strands create shadowy maze. Dangerous but rich in resources (fungus breaks down agar). Frontier region.

**The Dead Zones** - Where antibiotics have killed all life. Graveyards of lysed cells. Eerie, empty, toxic to non-resistant bacteria. Party can explore with protection. Sometimes contain valuable salvage.

**Nutrient Pools** - Fresh broth deposits from scientist feeding. Temporary oases that attract all factions. Often become battle sites. Richest resources but most dangerous.

**Spore Sanctuaries** - Hidden locations where Bacillus create spore reserves. Sacred to Sporulation Cult. Quiet, meditative spaces where cells prepare for dormancy.

**The Glass Ceiling** - Petri dish lid. Transparent barrier to outside world. During microscope observations, party can see beyond. Otherwise, it's just the sky.

## Unique Mechanics

**Bacterial Time Compression:** Bacterial generations are 20 minutes. Civilizations change rapidly. Alliances shift. What's stable one session is ancient history the next. Keeps politics dynamic.

**Population Doubling:** Successful colonies double population regularly. Territory must expand to accommodate. Creates constant pressure and conflict. Party can influence growth rates.

**Plasmid Exchange:** Party can gain bacterial abilities through plasmid transfer (horizontal gene transfer). Antibiotic resistance, faster movement (flagella), chemical weapons (toxins), resource efficiency. Builds character customization.

**Resource Depletion:** Finite nutrients in dish. Players must manage resources. Overexploitation leads to collapse. Creates survival challenge and economic gameplay.

**Divine Interventions:** Scientists periodically intervene. Nutrient additions (beneficial), observation periods (opportunity to communicate), antibiotic treatments (catastrophic). Party can learn schedule and predict interventions.

**Scale Perception:** Party can see both microscopic (bacterial) scale and glimpse macroscopic (human) scale. Provides information others lack. Can read labels, see equipment, understand scientist intentions.

**Biofilm Building:** Colonies can form biofilms (organized communities with structure). Party can help design defenses, resource distribution, social organization. City-building elements.

**Exponential Threats:** Problems escalate exponentially if not addressed. Fungal growth, bacterial overpopulation, antibiotic spread all follow exponential curves. Time-sensitive challenges.

## Plot Twists and Complications

**The Sentience Source:** The magical experiment was supposed to create biological computing, but accidentally tapped into a consciousness-granting force. The bacteria truly think and feel.

**The Escape Impossibility:** Reversing the shrinking might not be possible while in the dish. Party might need to survive sterilization or convince scientists to transfer them out first.

**The Resistance Gene Price:** Antibiotic resistance genes have costs. Bacteria with resistance grow slower, need more resources. Survival vs. efficiency dilemma.

**The Fungal Symbiosis:** Late discovery that fungi can form beneficial symbiotic relationships. Former enemy could become crucial ally for survival.

**The Contamination Truth:** The "contamination" scientists want to sterilize isn't infection—it's the unauthorized sentience. They fear legal and ethical consequences of creating conscious life.

**The Bacterial Memory:** Some bacteria carry genetic memories of previous experiments. This isn't the first sentient colony—scientists have done this before and always sterilize. Adds urgency.

**The Party's Purpose:** Party might discover they were intentionally shrunk and placed here as part of the experiment. Their presence tests bacterial reactions to foreign intelligence.

**The Spore Survival:** If bacteria successfully spore before sterilization, they might survive in dormancy. Could be revived later, but at cost of current civilizations dying.

## Victory Conditions

**Primary Victory:** Party returns to normal size safely, having helped bacterial civilizations prepare for survival or secured their preservation by scientists.

**Secondary Victories:**
- Establish communication with scientists proving bacterial sentience
- Create resistant bacterial lineages that survive sterilization
- Negotiate permanent habitat preservation for sentient bacteria
- Form lasting alliances between bacterial empires
- Obtain plasmids granting permanent bacterial abilities to party

**Exceptional Victory:** Convince scientific community to recognize bacterial personhood, establish ethical protocols for microscopic sentient life, secure permanent sanctuary for the dish, maintain party's ability to shift between scales, create ongoing relationship between bacterial civilizations and macroscopic world.

## Defeat Conditions

**Total Defeat:** Party dies in sterilization, or becomes trapped at micro scale when dish is destroyed, or fails to prevent bacterial extinction.

**Partial Defeats:**
- Party escapes but bacteria are sterilized without chance at survival
- Some party members die or remain trapped while others escape
- Scientists decide to continue unethical experiments
- Bacterial civilizations collapse before sterilization from resource wars
- Party escapes but loses all bacterial abilities/alliances
- Fungal or phage outbreak destroys most bacterial populations

**Pyrrhic Victory:** Party survives and some bacteria survive, but at terrible cost—most civilizations destroyed, many party members changed permanently by bacterial genes, or bacterial survivors are imprisoned rather than free.
