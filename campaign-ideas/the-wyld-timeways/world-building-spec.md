# The Wyld Timeways - World-Building Spec

## The Time Booth Mechanics

### How It Works
- Say destination and time period
- Shout "Excellent!" and rock on gesture
- Booth travels instantly (with light show)
- Always lands in plot-relevant moment
- Interior is dimensionally transcendent (fits anyone)

### Rules (Flexible)
- Can travel anywhere in time
- Multiple booths can exist via time duplicates
- Breaking it is temporary inconvenience
- Running into self is fine (just confusing)
- Paradoxes resolve themselves through rule of cool

### Limitations (Not Really)
- "Can only take three people" (fits ten somehow)
- "Needs to recharge" (when plot requires)
- "Historical interference prohibited" (ignored constantly)
- "Don't create paradoxes" (whoops)
