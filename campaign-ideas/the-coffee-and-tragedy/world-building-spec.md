# World-Building Specification Brief: The Coffee and Tragedy

**Core Concept:** One party member becomes half-ghoul—human mind needing human flesh to survive. They hide at Anteiku coffee shop with peaceful ghouls while CCG investigators hunt all ghouls as monsters. Radical ghoul organization Aogiri Tree rejects coexistence. Through torture and tragedy, the half-ghoul transforms into Centipede, accepting their nature. The campaign is identity horror—predator and prey, humanity and monstrosity, whether understanding can exist when survival requires killing.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Ghouls—humanoid species requiring human flesh, hunted by society, born not made (except rare half-ghouls).
*   CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul)—government organization hunting ghouls with quinque weapons made from dead ghouls.
*   Anteiku philosophy—peaceful coexistence, ethical feeding on suicide victims, family of outcasts.
*   Aogiri Tree—radical ghoul terrorists believing strength and dominance are survival, rejecting peace.

**Factions:**
*   **Anteiku:** Peaceful ghoul collective running coffee shop, advocate coexistence, eventually destroyed.
*   **CCG:** Government hunters, see ghouls as monsters, use quinque weapons, systematic extermination.
*   **Aogiri Tree:** Radical ghoul organization, terrorist tactics, believe might makes right.
*   **The Party:** Mixed humans and ghouls learning whether understanding is possible.

**Locations:**
*   **Anteiku Coffee Shop:** Ward 20 sanctuary, warm and welcoming, hub for peaceful ghouls.
*   **Tokyo Wards:** Different districts with varying human/ghoul populations and danger levels.
*   **CCG Headquarters:** Research facilities, prisons, investigator training, ghoul body parts as weapons.
*   **Aogiri Tree Base:** Abandoned buildings, torture chambers, where Kaneki becomes Centipede.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the half-ghoul doesn't feed, THEN they lose control and attack allies.
*   IF they're discovered by CCG, THEN they're hunted relentlessly as one-eyed ghoul.
*   IF Anteiku is exposed, THEN CCG raids and destroys it, killing or scattering the family.
*   IF the half-ghoul rejects ghoul nature entirely, THEN they starve or go insane.
