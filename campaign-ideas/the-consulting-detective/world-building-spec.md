### Causality Chains and Conspiracy Web

#### The Core Conspiracy (Whitmore's Plan)

**Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Before Campaign Start)**

- Build Network of loyal operatives
- Create false identities and cover businesses
- Accumulate resources and leverage

**Phase 2: Destabilization (Sessions 1-10)**

- Steal documents proving corruption
- Eliminate witnesses to prevent investigation
- Create chaos to cover larger operations

**Phase 3: Exposure (Sessions 11-20)**

- Trigger conflicts between criminal factions
- Undermine public confidence in government
- Position Network as alternative power structure

**Phase 4: Revolution (Sessions 21+)**

- Purge remaining corruption violently
- Establish new social order

#### Connection Web

**The Old Conspiracy (that Whitmore discovered):**
- 30 years ago: Seven Families made pact with devil/demon
- Exchanged souls of Undercity poor for wealth and power
- Created system that perpetuates inequality
- Periodic "cullings" disguised as accidents/disease
- Whitmore discovered this and vowed to stop it

**The Hidden History:**
- Cassandra Whitmore was originally a reformer
- Lost family members to the conspiracy
- Turned to extreme methods when legal means failed
- Brother Cornelius knows but is too afraid to act
- Mycroft Ravencroft suspects but serves "stability" over justice

**The Moral Complexity:**
- Whitmore's targets genuinely deserve punishment
- Her methods are ruthless but effective
- The system IS corrupt beyond reform
- But revolution will cause innocent casualties
- Party must choose: Law or Justice? Order or Change?
