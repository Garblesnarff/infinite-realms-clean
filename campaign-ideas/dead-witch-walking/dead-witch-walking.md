**Campaign Type / Genre:** Urban Fantasy / Bounty Hunter / Witch Action
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions

**Tone (keywords):** witch bounty hunter, Cincinnati, Inderland species, ley lines, demon deals, pixie partners
**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
In Cincinnati where Inderland species (witches, vampires, werewolves, and fae) revealed themselves to humanity after a tomato-based plague killed much of the human population, the party works as bounty hunters capturing supernatural criminals. Led by a witch who draws power from ley lines crisscrossing the city, accompanied by a living vampire roommate and a wisecracking pixie partner, they navigate Inderland politics while running from their former employer I.S. (Inderland Security). As they discover the witch's use of forbidden demon magic marks them as dangerous, they must survive vampire undead masters, demon bargains, elven conspiracies, and the revelation that they may be one of the few who can perform ancient Wild Magic. In Cincinnati's Hollows, ley lines grant power, demons make deals, and being a day-walking witch with demon marks makes you everyone's target.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of establishing independence, demon entanglements, and embracing Wild Magic.

*   **Act I — Breaking Free (Sessions 1-6):** The party quits I.S. (Inderland Security), the corrupt bounty hunter agency, to start their own operation. They're immediately targeted by their former employer who wants them dead for knowing too much. They establish their base in an old church sitting on a powerful ley line node, gain pixie and vampire allies, and take bounties on Inderland criminals. They discover the witch party member has rare abilities: can kinesthetically sense ley lines, cast witch and ley line magic together, and resist vampire mental domination. They're introduced to demon summoning when desperate situations require dangerous solutions.
*   **Act II — Demon Marks (Sessions 7-13):** The party becomes entangled with demons when the witch makes deals for power and information. Each demon mark (smudge on their soul) gives abilities but costs humanity and attracts attention. They navigate complex relationships: Ivy (living vampire struggling to remain undead), Jenks (pixie warrior partner), Kisten (living vampire love interest), and Trent Kalamack (elven businessman with mysterious agenda). They face undead master vampires who can turn living vampires with a bite, discover elven genetic conspiracies, and learn about Wild Magic—ancient witch ability thought extinct. The demon Algaliarept takes interest in claiming the witch's soul.
*   **Act III — Wild Witch Rising (Sessions 13-20):** The party discovers the witch is one of few with genetic ability to survive Wild Magic—spontaneous, powerful magic without need for circles or prep. Demons seek to enslave them, elves want to kill them (Wild Magic destroyed elven civilization historically), and vampires want to control them. They face demon plots to break free of the ever-after (demon prison dimension), elven assassins sent to eliminate Wild Magic bloodlines, and vampire politics involving master vampires fighting for dominance. The final confrontation involves preventing demons from breaking free, surviving elven genocide attempts, and accepting their Wild Magic heritage. Some endings involve becoming demon-marked pariahs, others broker new peace between species, others embrace Wild Magic fully and reshape Cincinnati's power structure.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of accepting dangerous power, species trying to coexist, found family versus blood heritage, and whether making deals with demons is ever justified. It asks: How much darkness can you embrace before losing yourself? Can ancient enemies find peace? Is genetic heritage destiny? The central conflict pits the party's desire to live freely against forces seeking to control, kill, or enslave them due to their rare abilities and demon marks.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Ley Line Magic**
*   Cincinnati sits on powerful ley line network
*   Witches can draw energy from lines for power
*   Kinesthetic sensing allows finding and using lines
*   Overuse burns and risks addiction

### 2. **Demon Marks**
*   Each demon deal leaves a smudge on soul
*   Marks grant abilities but cost humanity
*   Too many marks allows demon to claim soul
*   Visible to those who can see auras

### 3. **Wild Magic**
*   Ancient witch ability, spontaneous and powerful
*   No circles or prep time required
*   Destroyed elven civilization historically
*   Extremely rare genetic trait

### 4. **Vampire Bite Dynamics**
*   Living vampires struggle with bloodlust
*   Undead master's bite can turn living to undead
*   Sharing blood creates bond and vulnerability
*   Master vampires can mentally dominate

### 5. **Pixie Warriors**
*   Tiny but deadly, lightning-fast attacks
*   Family-oriented, large broods
*   Hibernate in winter, vulnerable then
*   Excellent scouts and information gatherers

### 6. **Smut and Soul Damage**
*   Black magic and demon deals create smut (spiritual corruption)
*   Accumulated smut darkens aura
*   Can be transferred to others through curses
*   Too much smut attracts demons

### 7. **The Ever-After**
*   Demon prison dimension, twisted reality
*   Time flows differently
*   Demons desperate to escape
*   Can be accessed through summoning

### 8. **Species Politics**
*   Inderland species revealed after plague
*   Humans still majority but weakened
*   Complex politics: vampires organized, Weres pack-based, witches secretive
*   I.S. governs Inderlanders, FIB (human police) resents them
