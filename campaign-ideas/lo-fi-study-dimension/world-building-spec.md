# Lo-Fi Study Dimension - World-Building Specification

## Detailed Faction Information

### The Curators (Seven Leaders)
Ancient scholars who founded/maintain the Library. Each embodies different knowledge form. Generally benevolent but flawed through inaction. Have known about capacity problem for decades but hoped it would solve itself. Now crisis forces action.

**The Curator of History** - Wants to preserve everything, can't accept loss
**The Curator of Science** - Seeks empirical solution, trusts only data
**The Curator of Art** - Believes creativity transcends knowledge storage
**The Curator of Philosophy** - Questions whether problem needs solving
**The Curator of Mathematics** - Calculates all outcomes, paralyzed by options
**The Curator of Mysticism** - Feels the right answer intuitively
**The Curator of the Unknown** - Holds secret wisdom, waits for right moment

### The Scholar Community (~100,000 residents)
Beings from across dimensions who came seeking knowledge. Range from dedicated researchers to casual learners. Generally peaceful, collaborative. When crisis revealed, split into factions:

**Preservationists (30%):** Keep everything at any cost
**Deletionists (20%):** Willing to sacrifice for stability
**Exodists (25%):** Better to leave than force choice
**Acceptors (15%):** Embrace impermanence
**Innovators (10%):** Find creative transformation

### The Forgotten
Echoes of previously deleted knowledge. ~10,000 entities. Not ghosts—conceptual beings. Remember having substance but currently have none. Some are bitter, some are accepting. Key to understanding what deletion truly costs.

### The Librarians
~1,000 beings like Lofi who maintain daily operations. Know more than Curators about practical problems. Generally support Living Library solution. Not decision-makers but influence through labor.

## Extended NPC Rosters

**Fellow Scholars (Sample):**
- **Sage the Owl-Person:** History specialist, elderly, kind
- **Nova the Star-Being:** Astronomy researcher, optimistic
- **Quill the Ink Elemental:** Writing expert, expressive
- **Cipher the Encoded:** Mathematics prodigy, awkward
- **Dream the Mystic:** Intuitive learner, sees connections
- **Void the Questioner:** Philosophy major, asks hard questions

**Librarians:**
- **Lofi:** Main NPC ally, cat-person, gentle guide
- **Page:** Organized, efficient, mouse-person

**The Forgotten:**
- **Echo:** First deletion victim, spokesperson
- **Whisper:** Barely exists, fading
- **Resonance:** Fighting to stay real
- **Absence:** Has accepted non-being

## Location Details

### The Main Reading Room
Impossibly large central space. Cathedral-like architecture but cozy. Thousands of study desks, each personalized. Central fireplace larger than houses. Windows showing eternal autumn rain. Ceiling so high it fades into soft clouds.

### The Seven Domains

**History Domain:** Ancient scrolls, chronicle halls, time-worn books
**Science Domain:** Clean, organized, experimental equipment
**Art Domain:** Gallery-like, beautiful and inspiring
**Philosophy Domain:** Meditation spaces, contemplation gardens
**Mathematics Domain:** Geometric perfection, equation walls
**Mysticism Domain:** Incense-filled, intuitive layout
**Unknown Domain:** Shifts and changes, impossible to map fully

### The Archive of Lost Things
Basement level. Hollow book covers float in darkness. Silent. Sad. Beautiful in haunting way. The Forgotten congregate here. Touching deleted books shows flashes of what was lost.

### The Tea Garden
Outdoor space (somehow) with gentle rain. Plants grow year-round. Serves unlimited tea and coffee. Place for informal discussion. Many solutions found here through casual conversation.

### The Restricted Section
Dangerous knowledge kept separate. Not evil—just hazardous without preparation. Contains books about dimensional collapse, reality warping, etc. Ironically, holds information needed to solve current crisis.

### The Cozy Corners
Scattered throughout: window seats with cushions, armchair nooks, blanket forts, alcoves with perfect reading light. Personalized by occupants. Everyone has favorite spot.

## Historical Causality

### Foundation (10,000 Years Ago)
Seven scholars from dying dimension created Library as refuge for knowledge. Built infinite capacity (they thought). Welcomed all learners. Created paradise for contemplation.

### The First Millennium
Library grew steadily. Knowledge accumulated. No problems. Golden age of learning. Curators established routines and systems. Community flourished.

### The First Forgetting (9,000 Years Ago)
Library reached first capacity limit. Curators discovered infinity has practical limits. Performed Great Deletion secretly. Erased ~20% of holdings. No one noticed (deleted knowledge includes memory of itself).

### Second Through Ninth Forgettings
Every thousand years, repeat. Each time Curators hoped it was last. Each time deleted more. Eventually The Forgotten emerged—echoes that escaped deletion. Currently at tenth cycle.

### The Current Crisis
Deletions getting larger. Last one removed 40%. Next would need 60%+. Curators can't hide anymore. Community discovered truth. Rebellion/discussion ensued. Players arrive during crisis point.

## Additional Lore

### Knowledge Magic System
Learning grants literal abilities. Study history: understand patterns, see past. Study science: manipulate reality through natural laws. Study art: create beauty that affects emotions. Study philosophy: argue reality into different form. Study math: calculate probable futures. Study mysticism: access intuitive truths.

**Mastery Levels:**
- Novice: Basic understanding
- Adept: Practical application
- Expert: Creative use
- Master: Teaching others
- Sage: Contributing new knowledge

### The Flow State
Deep focus creates altered consciousness. Time passes differently. Hours feel like minutes. In Flow, learning accelerates. Magical state achieved through perfect combination of challenge and skill. Enhanced by comfort, tea, good music, and rain sounds.

### The Comfort Mechanic
Physical comfort directly affects mental performance. Cozy clothing, warm drinks, perfect temperature, good lighting, comfortable seating—all mechanically beneficial. Not just flavor: comfort is power in this dimension.

### Collaboration Mechanics
Learning together multiplies understanding. Study groups more effective than solo. Teaching others reinforces knowledge. Community discussions generate insights no individual could reach. Mechanically: bonuses for collaborative research.

### The Forgetting Decay
Knowledge fades if unused. Must review to retain. Everything slowly returns to unknown if not actively maintained. Natural process, not malicious. Creates pressure to use knowledge not just accumulate it.

### Library Consciousness
Dimension itself is slowly becoming sentient. Accumulated knowledge creating emergent consciousness. Doesn't speak but makes preferences known. Wants to live. Fears both deletion and exodus. Most receptive to Living Library transformation (would complete its awakening).

### Philosophy of Knowledge

**Central Questions:**
- Is knowledge intrinsically valuable or only valuable when used?
- Should everything be remembered or is forgetting healthy?
- Who decides what's worth keeping?
- Is perfect preservation worth complete stagnation?
- Can wisdom exist without imperfection?

**No Clear Answers:**
Campaign doesn't preach. Each solution has merit. Players choose based on values, not objectively correct answer. Living Library is mechanically optimal but philosophically just one valid option.

### The Truth About Lo-Fi Beats
Source of music never explained. Players can investigate: leads to Unknown Curator's domain. Discovered there's no source—music is Library's heartbeat. If music stops, Library dies. All solutions maintain music (just in different forms). Music is constant, knowledge is variable. Sound is more fundamental than content.

### The Relationship to Other Dimensions
Library exists between all musical dimensions. Knowledge from every realm stored here. Jazz Noir's detective techniques, Heavy Metal Hell's battle magic, EDM Rave's energy theories, etc. All accessible, all valued equally. Library's collapse would affect all dimensions (losing their backup knowledge). Stakes are multiversal but quietly so.

### Post-Campaign Possibilities

**If Deletion:** Smaller but stable, could become exclusive scholarly order
**If Living Library:** Dynamic knowledge ecosystem, constant discovery and rediscovery
**If Exodus:** Wandering scholars spreading knowledge across dimensions

All endings allow continued play. This dimension's story never truly ends—studying continues in whatever form.

This world-building creates dimension where learning is adventure, contemplation is action, and choosing how knowledge survives is the ultimate quest. Gentle but meaningful, cozy but important.
