# Creative Brief: By Order of the Blades

## Art Style: Industrial Gothic Britain (Peaky Blinders meets Gangs of New York)

Inspired by industrial revolution decay, post-WWI trauma, and British class warfare. Colors are muted—grays, browns, dark blues, with occasional blood red. Character designs emphasize working-class fashion—flat caps with razorblades, long coats, waistcoats, pocket watches. Lighting is perpetually overcast or gaslit. Environments show soot-stained factories, cobblestone streets, smoke-filled pubs. Style emphasizes grit, violence, and upward mobility through blood.

### Core Principles:

*   **Industrial Decay:** Factories, smokestacks, poverty, soot-covered everything.
*   **Sharp Dressing:** Even gangsters dress impeccably—respect through appearance.
*   **Brutal Violence:** Razor blades, close-quarters combat, blood on cobblestones.

## Voice

A voice with Birmingham accent—working-class British, sharp and commanding. The cadence is clipped, every word a command or threat. Emotion is restrained until violence erupts. References war, family, and loyalty with fierce pride. Audio has slight echo, as if speaking in industrial warehouses or pubs. Role: A gang leader issuing orders, threatening rivals, or making a political speech dripping with menace.
