# World-Building Specification Brief: By Order of the Blades

**Core Concept:** Players are a working-class gang of WWI veterans in 1920s Birmingham, running illegal operations while rising to political power. They steal military weapons, fight rival gangs (Italian mafia, Jewish gangs, Irish revolutionaries), and navigate police persecution and political intrigue. The campaign explores post-war trauma, class warfare, and ambition.

**Lore Prompts:**
*   Post-WWI Britain—veterans returning to poverty, unemployment, and PTSD.
*   The rise of illegal betting operations, opium trade, and protection rackets.
*   Irish independence movement (IRA) and their weapon smuggling.
*   British fascist movement and communist revolutionaries vying for power.

**Factions:**
*   **The Shelby Family Gang:** Working-class veterans, razor blades in caps, expanding criminal empire.
*   **Italian Mafia (Changretta family):** Expansion into Birmingham, vendetta-driven.
*   **The IRA:** Irish revolutionaries needing weapons, willing to kill for them.
*   **Inspector Campbell's Police:** Ruthless law enforcement using any means to destroy gangs.

**Locations:**
*   **The Garrison Pub:** Gang headquarters, working-class pub.
*   **Small Heath:** Industrial Birmingham neighborhood, gang territory.
*   **Birmingham Factories:** Soot-covered industrial sites, meeting places.
*   **London:** Expansion territory with established underworld.

**Causality Triggers:**
*   IF the party refuses IRA demands, THEN Irish revolutionaries bomb their businesses and families.
*   IF the party betrays the Italians, THEN vendetta erupts, targeting everyone.
*   IF the party enters Parliament, THEN criminal rivals see them as weak, politicians see them as threats.
