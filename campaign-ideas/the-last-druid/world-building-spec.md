### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

**The Last Druid**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** A 2,000-year-old druid has hidden in modern Tempe, Arizona for years, running a bookshop with their telepathic Irish wolfhound. When ancient enemies discover them, they must face Celtic gods seeking revenge, Norse gods preparing Ragnarok, and divine politics spanning pantheons. Magic tattoos channel Gaia's power, shapeshifting is possible, and immortality means watching everyone you love die. Being the last druid makes you invaluable or doomed.

    *   Describe the Tuatha Dé Danann—Irish gods who retreated to Tír na nÓg but still influence mortal world.
    *   Explain how gods from different pantheons coexist—territory, treaties, conflicts.

*   **IF:** Oberon dies → **THEN:** Druid can resurrect but the trauma affects both, bond might change.
