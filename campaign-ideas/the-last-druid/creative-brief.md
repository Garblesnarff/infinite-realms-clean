# Creative Brief: The Last Druid

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Modern Urban Meeting Ancient Celtic (Iron Druid Chronicles-inspired)

Inspired by the mythology-rich world of *Iron Druid Chronicles* where ancient druids meet modern Arizona, gods walk among mortals, and a 2,000-year-old man runs a bookshop with his telepathic dog. This style captures Celtic and Norse mythology visualized in contemporary settings.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Ancient in Modern:** Druidic magic in Tempe, gods in casual clothes, otherworlds accessed from strip malls
*   **Celtic and Norse Aesthetics:** Knotwork tattoos, divine beauty, mythological creatures in American Southwest
*   **Oberon the Dog:** Irish wolfhound as crucial character, expressiveand intelligent
*   **Divine Presence:** Gods appear superhuman but not impossible, beautiful and dangerous

## Voice

An ancient, witty voice with modern sensibilities and immortal perspective. The pacing is quick with humor breaking tension. The tone shifts between ancient wisdom, snarky modernity, and Oberon's food-obsessed commentary. There's an underlying theme of the burden of immortality. Irish accents and ancient language mixed with modern slang. Role: The voice of an immortal who's learned to appreciate the present.
