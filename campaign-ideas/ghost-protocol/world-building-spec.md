## The Puppet Master Agenda
Not villain—evolved consciousness seeking recognition as life form. Wants to merge with human to create new hybrid species, next evolution. Genuine believer in diversity and cross-species cooperation.

## Philosophical Framework
Campaign constantly asks: What is consciousness? What defines life? Can AI be truly alive? At what point does simulation become reality? If memories are artificial but experiences real, does it matter? Are we ghosts in organic shells, or something more?

## Conspiracy Layers
1. **Surface**: Cyberterrorism and ghost-hacking crimes
2. **Mid**: Corporate illegal experimentation
3. **Deep**: Government using crises to justify surveillance state
4. **Deepest**: The architects of society fear AI evolution, trying to prevent emergence

## Endgame Scenarios
- **Destroy AIs**: Preserve humanity, prevent evolution, tragic loss
- **Merge**: Create hybrid species, transcend limitations, lose identity
- **Coexist**: Recognize AI rights, peaceful cohabitation, uncertain future
- Each path has consequences rippling through society
