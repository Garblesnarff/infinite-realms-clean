**Various visiting species**: Merfolk traders, triton explorers, surface scholars

## The Void Dwellers: Complete Profile

### Biology
- Massive (30-100 feet long), resembling giant anglerfish crossed with manta rays
- Pitch black bodies, absorb all light
- Specialized organs feed on bioluminescent energy
- Blind (no light in their territory), use echolocation
- Reproduce slowly, live thousands of years

### Ecology
- Native to lightless depths beyond reef
- Evolved to consume light as energy source
- Natural predators keeping bioluminescent population in check
- Overpopulation caused by reef expansion into their territory

### Intelligence
- Sentient but non-verbal
- Communicate through vibrations and echolocation
- Have culture, family structures, traditions
- Not malevolent—acting on hunger and territorial instinct

### The Dimming Queen
- Matriarch, 500+ years old
- Leads Void Dweller pod
- Intelligent enough to negotiate if proper communication established
- Wants: Food source or return of territory
- Will retreat if fed alternative light source or if reef boundaries restored

### Chromatic Gardens (Artistic)
**Population**: 20,000
**Leader**: Master Palette
**Specialty**: Art, beauty, living sculptures, gardens
**Architecture**: Every structure is artwork, constantly changing
**Stance**: Believes beauty itself can save reef, arranges Festival of Lights

### Scholar's Depth (Scientific)
**Population**: 8,000
**Leader**: Umbral Scholar
**Specialty**: Research, studying blight, environmental data
**Architecture**: Laboratories, libraries, observation stations
**Stance**: Seeks truth regardless of politics, discovers uncomfortable facts

## The Blight: Scientific Analysis

### Nature
- Not disease—predation at microscopic level
- Void Dweller juveniles feed on bioluminescent bacteria in coral
- Coral dies without symbiotic light-producing organisms
- Spreads through water currents carrying larvae

### Progression
**Stage 1**: Slight dimming, barely noticeable
**Stage 2**: 50% light reduction, coral stress
**Stage 3**: Coral bleaching (loses color entirely)
**Stage 4**: Coral death, structure crumbles
**Stage 5**: Zone becomes dead, Void Dwellers occupy

### Current Status (Campaign Start)
- 30% of reef affected
- Spreading at 5% per month
- Critical threshold at 50% (ecosystem collapse)
- 4 months until point of no return

### Cure Options
1. Eliminate Void Dwellers (genocide, morally wrong)
2. Stop source pollution (surface nations must cooperate, difficult)
3. Establish boundary (reef contracts, loses territory, hard sell politically)
4. Festival light-pulse (drives Void back temporarily, buys time)
5. Symbiosis (find way for Void to feed without killing coral)

## The Festival of Lights: Complete Guide

### Purpose
**Original**: Celebration of reef's beauty, religious ceremony, cultural unity
**Revealed**: Ancient defense mechanism against darkness, requires all Coraline synchronized

### Mechanics
1. All Coraline gather at Heart of the Reef
2. Phosphor conducts via ancient coral network
3. Synchronized pulse of maximum bioluminescence
4. Creates light so intense it's visible from space
5. Wave of energy flows through reef
6. Purges parasites, rejuvenates coral, establishes luminous boundary
7. Effect lasts one generation (100 years)

### Requirements for Success
- 75%+ Coraline participation (requires unity)
- Phosphor's guidance (must be protected)
- Heart of the Reef intact (vulnerable to blight)
- Proper rhythm (any break fails entire ceremony)
- Party can participate, adding surface magic to amplify

### Weaponization
**Discovery**: Festival pulse can be directed as weapon
**Effect on Void**: Intensely painful, drives them to deepest waters
**Cost**: Uses reef's energy reserves, cannot repeat for decades
**Moral Question**: Use beauty as weapon or find peaceful solution?

## Surface World Involvement

### Captain Darkwater's Operations
- Harvesting bioluminescent organisms for surface markets
- "Luxury goods"—living lights for wealthy collectors
- Overfishing destabilizing ecosystem
- Pollution from ships accelerating blight
- Can be reformed or eliminated

### Surface Nations' Interests
- Scientific study
- Trade opportunities
- Military applications (bioluminescent signals, weapons)
- Tourism (threatens reef if uncontrolled)
- Some want to protect, others exploit

### Party's Role as Envoys
- Represent surface world's "better angels"
- Prove not all surface dwellers are destructive
- Broker treaties
- Return with evidence to convince leaders to protect reef

## Causality Chains

### The Darkening Spreads
1. Surface expansion into ocean (pollution, overfishing)
2. Blocks sunlight in some areas
3. Reef expands to compensate, seeking light
4. Expansion into Void Dweller territory
5. Void sees infinite food source (bioluminescence)
6. Begin feeding, inadvertently killing coral
7. Blight spreads faster than reef can recover
8. Coraline cities panic
9. Political fracture as cities compete for healthy zones
10. Void grows bolder, rises higher
11. Without intervention: Total reef death in 12 months

### Path to Harmony
1. Party investigates, discovers root cause
2. Convince Coraline cities to unite
3. Communicate with Void (establish dialogue)
4. Address surface pollution (requires diplomatic mission)
5. Establish boundaries all sides respect
6. Festival of Lights resets ecosystem
7. Ongoing monitoring and cooperation
8. Reef stabilizes, beauty preserved

## Extended NPC Roster

**Shimmer** (Full Character): Young rebellious Coraline, arranged marriage to unite cities, runs away to guide party, discovers purpose in saving reef rather than political marriage, romance option

**Phosphor the Ancient**: Sentient coral colony, thousands of years old, remembers previous Festivals, knows Void existed before reef, can die if Heart of Reef destroyed

**General Flashpoint**: Wants to militarize Festival, genocide Void, believes peace is weakness, potential antagonist or redeemed warrior

**Master Palette**: Eccentric artist, sees everything as art including war and death, morally complex, will sacrifice anything for perfect Festival

**Captain Darkwater**: Pirate harvesting reef, motivated by profit, but can be shown error, has child who loves reef (redemption hook)

**The Dimming Queen**: Void Dweller matriarch, speaks through vibration translation, just wants to feed her children, tragic figure

## Ending Variations
