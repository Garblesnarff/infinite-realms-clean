# The Planar Gathering
*"Five colors weave reality. Five philosophies clash eternally. Draw your seven cards and reshape existence."*

## Campaign Overview

The Multiverse consists of infinite Planes—separate realities accessible only to Planeswalkers, beings who have "sparked" and gained the ability to traverse worlds. Each Plane embodies different aspects of the Five Colors of Magic: White (order, morality, community), Blue (knowledge, control, perfection), Black (ambition, power, individualism), Red (freedom, emotion, chaos), and Green (nature, growth, tradition). Most beings are bound to their home Plane, but Planeswalkers walk freely between worlds, gathering spells and creatures from across the Multiverse to do battle.

The campaign begins when the party undergoes their Planeswalker Spark ignition—a traumatic event that awakens their ability to planeswalk. They discover they've been conscripted into The Great Gathering, an eternal tournament where Planeswalkers duel using summoned creatures and spells. But something is wrong: Planes are collapsing into each other, color combinations that should be enemies are merging, and colorless entities from the Blind Eternities (the void between Planes) are invading.

The party learns that someone is attempting to merge all Planes into one mono-colored reality, destroying the balance of Five that maintains existence. They must travel across diverse Planes (Dominaria, Ravnica, Zendikar, Innistrad, etc.), master all Five Colors of magic, build their own spell decks, and ultimately confront the force trying to collapse the Multiverse into singularity. The final battle will be fought not with swords but with summoned creatures, sorceries, instants, and the manipulation of Mana itself.

## Core Themes

- **Color Philosophy**: Five different worldviews in eternal conflict and cooperation
- **Deck Building**: Constructing identity through chosen spells and creatures
- **Mana Management**: Resource strategy and color balance
- **Summoning and Control**: Commanding creatures and bending reality
- **Planeswalker Power**: The god-like ability to walk between worlds
- **Combination Philosophies**: Allied colors vs. enemy colors, mono vs. multi-color

## Campaign Sessions (40 Sessions)

### Arc 1: Spark Ignition (Sessions 1-10)
Party experiences traumatic events that ignite their Planeswalker Sparks. First accidental planeswalks to random Planes. Learning basic color magic—choose starting color philosophy. Introduction to summoning creatures and casting spells. First Planeswalker duel.

### Arc 2: The Five-Color Journey (Sessions 11-24)
Party intentionally travels to Planes dominated by each color. White Plane (order society), Blue Plane (knowledge arcology), Black Plane (necrocracy), Red Plane (chaos wastes), Green Plane (primal forest). Must master each color's philosophy and magic. Build personal spell decks.

### Arc 3: The Collision (Sessions 25-34)
Planes begin collapsing into each other. White and Black merge (life and death combined). Red and Blue clash (chaos vs. control). Green consumes all. The party discovers the Colorless Invasion—Eldrazi-like entities from the Blind Eternities consuming reality.

### Arc 4: The Prismatic War (Sessions 35-40)
Final arc. Must assemble allies from all Five Colors. Build ultimate five-color deck. Face the force trying to create mono-colored singularity. Climactic Planeswalker duel where the Multiverse itself is the battlefield. Ending depends on which color philosophy wins—or if the party achieves true five-color balance.

## Key NPCs

### The Primarch (Mono-White Tyrant)
Ancient Planeswalker who believes only White should exist—pure order, no chaos. Attempting to purge all other colors. Commands armies of angels and soldiers. Philosophy: "Peace through total control."

### Chronarch (Mono-Blue Mastermind)
Seeks to transform Multiverse into pure knowledge—all things become data, no physical existence. Controls time and reality. Philosophy: "Omniscience is the only moral state."

### The Lich-Walker (Mono-Black Necromancer)
Wants all Planes to become one infinite graveyard where they rule eternally. Commands zombie hordes and demons. Philosophy: "Power justifies everything."

### Pyroclast (Mono-Red Anarchist)
Desires total chaos—all structure burned away, pure freedom through destruction. Commands elementals and goblins. Philosophy: "Only in fire are we free."

### The World-Tree (Mono-Green Ancient)
Believes all Planes should merge into one infinite forest, technology and civilization erased. Commands beasts and nature spirits. Philosophy: "Return to natural law."

### The Five-Color Arbiter (Prismatic Judge)
Neutral Planeswalker attempting to maintain balance. Neither mono-colored tyrant nor colorless void worshiper. Potential mentor or final boss depending on party choices.

### The Eldrazi Fragments
Colorless entities from the Blind Eternities. Don't belong to any philosophy—pure consumption and distortion. Corrupt all magic they touch. Ultimate threat that might unite the colors.

### Ravnica's Guild Leaders
If party visits Ravnica—ten guilds representing all ten two-color combinations. Each offers unique multi-color philosophies (Azorius: white-blue law, Gruul: red-green nature-chaos, etc.).

### The Planeswalker Conclave
Gathering of neutral Planeswalkers who oversee The Great Gathering tournament. Potential allies or secret conspirators in the Plane collapse.

### The Spark-Thief
A being that can steal Planeswalker Sparks, depowering walkers. Hunts the party to harvest their newly ignited Sparks. Revealed to be working for one of the mono-colored tyrants.

## Major Locations

### The Blind Eternities
The void between Planes. Chaotic, colorless, destroys non-Planeswalkers instantly. Travel method—brief exposure while planeswalking. Source of the Eldrazi invasion.

### Dominaria (The Nexus Plane)
Central Plane of the Multiverse. Contains fragments of all five colors balanced. Diverse biomes representing each philosophy. Party's potential home base.

### Ravnica (The City Plane)
Entire Plane is one massive city governed by ten two-color guilds. Perfect place to learn multi-color magic combinations.

### Zendikar (The Adventure Plane)
Wild, dangerous world of lethal landscapes and ancient ruins. Strong Green and Red. Eldrazi invasion site.

### Innistrad (The Gothic Horror Plane)
Monsters, vampires, werewolves, and mad scientists. Strong Black and Blue. Teaches the darker colors.

### New Phyrexia (The Compleat Plane)
Entirely corrupted by Phyrexian oil—all five colors twisted into horrific unity. Shows what happens when colors merge wrong.

### Theros (The Myth Plane)
Gods and heroes inspired by Greek mythology. Strong White and Blue. Teaches devotion and enchantment magic.

### Kaladesh (The Invention Plane)
Hyper-technological world powered by Aether. Strong Blue and Red. Teaches artifact magic and innovation.

### The Meditation Realm
A constructed Plane where Planeswalkers gather to duel in controlled environments. The Great Gathering tournament occurs here.

### The Prismatic Core
Hidden center of the Multiverse where all five colors merge in perfect balance. Contains the secret of ultimate magic.

## Unique Mechanics

### Mana System
Five colors of magic powered by Land cards (Plains=White, Island=Blue, Swamp=Black, Mountain=Red, Forest=Green). Party collects Lands to generate Mana. Must balance Mana base to cast diverse spells.

### Deck Building
Party constructs personal spell decks (60 cards minimum). Choose creatures, instants, sorceries, enchantments, artifacts, and Planeswalkers to include. Deck reflects philosophy and strategy.

### Summoning
Creatures are summoned from across the Multiverse to fight for you. They have power/toughness stats. Combat uses MTG rules—attackers vs. blockers.

### Spell Casting
Instants and Sorceries manipulate reality—destroy creatures, draw cards, buff allies, counter spells. Mana cost and color requirement must be met.

### Color Identity
Party members can be mono-color (specialist) or multi-color (versatile). Mono-color gets stronger color-specific abilities. Multi-color gets flexibility.

### Combat Stack
When spells are cast, they go on "the stack." Opponents can respond with instant-speed spells. Last-in-first-out resolution. Creates tactical depth.

### Life Total
Each character has 20 life. Reaching 0 life means defeat. Can be restored through healing spells or life-drain from enemies.

### Card Draw
Knowledge is power. Drawing cards gives options. Many spells allow card draw. Running out of cards in deck means "milled out" defeat.

### Graveyard
Defeated creatures and spent spells go to graveyard. Some magic reanimates or recurs from graveyard. Black excels at this.

### Exile Zone
Some effects exile cards—removed from game entirely, harder to recover. White and Blue use exile as permanent removal.

## Plot Twists

### Twist 1: The Five Tyrants Are One Being
The five mono-colored Planeswalkers trying to purge other colors are actually fragments of one shattered Planeswalker—the original Five-Color master who broke apart.

### Twist 2: The Spark is Parasitic
Planeswalker Sparks are actually symbiotic entities from the Blind Eternities. Igniting your Spark means bonding with a colorless parasite.

### Twist 3: The Party is a Constructed Deck
The party members aren't random—they were carefully chosen by a higher Planeswalker as a "deck" to win some cosmic game.

### Twist 4: Colors Are Prisons
The Five Colors limit magic. True power comes from going colorless—embracing the Blind Eternities and becoming like the Eldrazi.

### Twist 5: The Multiverse is Someone's Deck
All Planes and Planeswalkers exist inside a game being played by incomprehensible meta-entities. The campaign is one match in an eternal tournament.

## Victory Conditions

### Five-Color Unity
Unite all five mono-colored tyrants, restore the original Planeswalker, achieve perfect prismatic balance. Harmonious ending where all colors coexist.

### Mono-Color Victory
Help one mono-colored faction win, purge all other colors. Reality becomes uniform in philosophy. (Five different endings depending on color choice.)

### Colorless Transcendence
Embrace the Eldrazi, abandon color identity, merge with the Blind Eternities. Become entities beyond philosophy.

### Destroy the Multiverse
Shatter all Planes, end the eternal conflict, return everything to pre-creation void. Nihilistic ending.

### Become the Arbiter
Take the Five-Color Arbiter's place, maintain balance yourself, become the referee of the eternal color war.

## Defeat Conditions

### Spark Theft
If Sparks are stolen, party loses Planeswalker powers, trapped on one Plane forever.

### Life Total Zero
Defeated in a crucial Planeswalker duel, life reaches zero, soul destroyed.

### Deck Milled
If all cards drawn from deck and library is empty, consciousness dissolves into the Blind Eternities.

### Color Purged
If a mono-colored tyrant wins before party can stop them, the party's colors are erased from reality along with all their philosophy.

### Eldrazi Consumption
If colorless invasion succeeds, all Planes and Planeswalkers are consumed by entities beyond color.
