### **World-Building Specification Brief: Beyond the Wall**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Content:** Crossing the Wall from the mundane world into Faerie to retrieve a fallen star, the party discovers she's a living celestial being hunted by witches seeking immortality and princes seeking thrones, forcing them to protect her while navigating fairy tale logic and learning that true love means sacrifice.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the Wall's origins—who built it, why it separates worlds, and what happens to those who cross
    *   Explain the nature of stars in this world—are they all celestial beings, or is Yvaine unique?
    *   Describe the witches' history and how they sustained themselves through centuries
    *   Write about the kingdom's succession crisis and the dying king's test for his sons
    *   Detail how Faerie differs from the mortal realm—time, magic, logic, consequences
    *   Explain the sky pirates' culture and how they harvest lightning for profit

**5. Location Blueprints**

*   **The Wall Gap** - Single guarded opening where the two worlds meet
*   **Faerie Wilderness** - Magical forests and landscapes with impossible beauty and danger
*   **The Sky Routes** - Aerial pathways where lightning-harvesting ships sail
*   **The Witches' Castle** - Decaying grandeur filled with mirrors, vanity, and dark magic
*   **The Magical Market** - Bazaar where anything can be bought, sold, or traded
*   Each location represents different fairy tale archetypes and crossing-worlds themes

**6. Causality Chains**
*   IF the witches catch the star THEN they consume her heart and gain immortality
*   IF a prince claims the star THEN he becomes king but the star dies
*   IF the star becomes fully mortal THEN she's vulnerable to death but can stay with the party
*   IF the star returns to the heavens THEN she's safe but separated from mortal love
*   IF the party crosses back through the Wall THEN Faerie's magic fades from them
*   IF they help Captain Shakespeare THEN sky pirates become powerful allies
*   IF they make Faerie bargains without care THEN they're bound by magical contracts
*   IF true love is demonstrated through sacrifice THEN the star can choose her fate—remain or return
