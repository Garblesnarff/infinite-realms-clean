## Art Style: Storybook Fantasy with Dark Undertones

Inspired by Into the Woods' blend of classic fairy tale imagery with psychological complexity—beautiful forest that grows darker, storybook characters facing real consequences.

### Visual Style:
**Color Palette:** Initially vibrant fairy tale colors—Cinderella's gold and blue, Red's crimson, Jack's green, the Woods' deep forest greens. Act II darkens everything—muted colors, shadows lengthening, blood reds, ash grays. The giant's shadow falls over everything. Magic has cost.

**Character Design:** Classic fairy tale looks but realistic—Cinderella in beautiful gown that's impractical, Red in her iconic hood but with wolf trauma in her eyes, the Baker in simple work clothes showing his practicality, the Witch aging rapidly when she loses powers, the Princes in absurdly perfect prince costumes revealing their shallowness. Everyone looks like they stepped from a storybook but acts like real people.

**Environments:** The Woods as classic dark fairy tale forest—twisted trees, mysterious paths, always twilight. The Baker's shop cozy and normal. Cinderella's palace as storybook perfection. The giant visible from anywhere—enormous, destructive, unavoidable. Everything starts as storybook illustration, becomes darker and more realistic as consequences manifest.

**Action:** Cinderella fleeing at midnight losing her shoe, Jack climbing the beanstalk, Red facing the wolf, the Witch transforming, the giant's foot crushing buildings, characters stealing and lying for their wishes, community fractured then coming together, the weight of consequences in every face.

## Voice

A voice of a storyteller who knows these tales intimately but is revealing the darker truth beneath the surface—sophisticated, capable of whimsy and horror, childlike wonder and adult disillusionment. Can be the narrator commenting on the action, or characters speaking in fairy tale language while dealing with real problems. Equal parts Grimm darkness and Disney magic. The voice of someone who's lived through "happily ever after" and found it complicated.

## Music Style

Sondheim's intricate musical theater complexity—think Into the Woods' score. "Into the Woods" as adventurous opening building through repetition. "Agony" as comic princes' duet full of melodrama. "Giants in the Sky" as wonder tinged with danger. "Your Fault" as rapid-fire blame and guilt. "No One Is Alone" as emotional devastation and hope intertwined. Complex harmonies, internal rhymes, lyrics that reveal character psychology. Music that sounds like fairy tales but explores adult themes—loss, betrayal, responsibility, community.
