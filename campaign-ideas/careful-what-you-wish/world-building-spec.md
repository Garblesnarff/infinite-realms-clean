### **World-Building Specification Brief: Careful What You Wish**

**1. Core Concept:**
Fairy tale characters pursue their wishes through the magical Woods using morally questionable means, achieve "happily ever after," then face devastating consequences when a giant attacks seeking revenge and community fractures under blame.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail the Woods' nature—magical realm where fairy tales happen, where wishes come true with cost
*   Explain the Witch's curse on the Baker's family—punishment for his father's theft
*   Describe the fairy tale world's rules—third chances, true love, curses and counter-curses
*   Write about the giants' realm above the clouds—Jack murdered the giant for gold
*   Detail the Princes' kingdom—superficial perfection hiding emptiness
*   Explain how wishes work—you get what you ask for, not what you need
*   Describe the concept of "happily ever after" and its inevitable dissolution

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Wish-Seekers** (Major) - Party, Baker, Cinderella, Jack, Red—pursuing personal desires
*   **The Witch's Pawns** (Minor) - Those cursed or manipulated by the Witch's magic
*   **The Royal Court** (Minor) - Princes and palace, representing superficial success
*   **The Woods Creatures** (Minor) - Wolf, birds, magical beings enforcing fairy tale logic
*   **The Traumatized** (Minor) - Red, Rapunzel, others damaged by fairy tale violence
*   **The Community** (Major) - Those who must face giant together despite betrayals

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** The Witch, The Baker and His Wife, Cinderella, Jack, Little Red Riding Hood, The Two Princes
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "The Wolf," "Rapunzel," "Jack's Mother," "The Stepmother," "The Narrator," "Mysterious Man," "Cinderella's Prince," "Granny," "The Steward"

**5. Locations:**
*   **The Woods** - Magical forest where fairy tales and wishes happen, grows darker
*   **The Baker's Shop** - Normal world, starting point, represents ordinary life
*   **The Giant's Realm** - Above the clouds, source of the widow's revenge
*   **Cinderella's Palace** - Fairy tale perfection that proves hollow
*   **The Witch's Garden** - Source of curses, where Rapunzel was imprisoned

**6. Causality:**
*   IF party steals to achieve wishes THEN victims suffer and seek revenge
*   IF party gets what they wished for THEN discover wishes aren't what they expected
*   IF Jack kills the giant THEN widow descends seeking revenge on the kingdom
*   IF community fractures under blame THEN giant destroys everything
*   IF party accepts responsibility and works together THEN can survive giant
*   IF characters sacrifice selfishness for community THEN bittersweet survival and growth
