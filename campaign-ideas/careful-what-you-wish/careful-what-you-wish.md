**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party enters the Woods to seek their wishes—fertility, riches, true love, adventure—and encounters all the classic fairy tale characters on similar quests.

What happens after "happily ever after" when your selfish choices have destroyed the community and awakened an unstoppable giant?

## What "Medium" Difficulty Means Here

*   **Moral Consequences:** Selfish acts to achieve wishes create cascading problems. Must face what you've done.
*   **Fairy Tale Logic:** Magic follows strange rules. Wishes twist. Curses have loopholes. Rhymes matter.
*   **Interconnected Stories:** Party's actions affect other fairy tale characters in unexpected ways.
*   **The Giant Problem:** Second act introduces a threat that can't be wished away—only community action works.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

*   **Act I — Into the Woods (Sessions 1–6):** Party enters the Woods seeking wishes. Meet fairy tale characters—Cinderella fleeing the ball, Jack selling his cow, Red Riding Hood visiting grandmother, princes hunting. Through morally questionable choices, everyone achieves their wishes.
*   **Act II — Consequences (Sessions 7–10):** Happily ever after falls apart. Wishes weren't what characters expected. Marriages are unhappy. Wealth is hollow. The Baker's wife betrays her husband. A giant's widow descends seeking revenge for her husband's murder—party's actions called Jack's attention to the giant.
*   **Act III — The Giant Crisis (Sessions 11–14):** Giant destroys everything. Blame and scapegoating. Community fractures. Must work together despite betrayals to survive.
*   **Act IV — No One Is Alone (Session 15):** Choosing to move forward together, accepting consequences, rebuilding community. Bittersweet resolution.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Witch** — *The Cursed Manipulator*
    *   Cursed the Baker's family, offers to lift it for a price. Seemingly villain but motivated by her own curse. Loses powers when she gets what she wants.

2.  **The Baker and His Wife** — *The Desperate Couple*
    *   Childless, will do anything for a child. Lie, steal, betray. Their desperation makes them sympathetic villains.

3.  **Cinderella** — *The Uncertain Princess*
    *   Married the prince but questions if she made the right choice. Palace life is stifling. Her prince is unfaithful.

4.  **Jack** — *The Simple Giant-Slayer*
    *   Killed a giant for riches. Doesn't understand consequences. The giant's widow wants revenge.

5.  **Little Red Riding Hood** — *The Traumatized Child*
    *   Eaten by the wolf and cut out alive. Forever changed. Rage beneath the red hood.

6.  **The Two Princes** — *The Unfaithful Charmings*
    *   Charming and vain. Chase every beautiful woman. Marriage is boring; the hunt is exciting. Represent superficiality of wishes.

## Central Conflict

Individual wishes versus community good, getting what you want versus wanting what you get, actions versus consequences. Everyone pursued their desires selfishly, and it worked—until it didn't. The giant represents the consequences of selfish ambition that can't be wished away. The question: after betrayal and loss, can community rebuild? Is taking responsibility for your actions worth more than achieving your wishes?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Wish Fulfillment**
*   Track party's wishes. When granted, immediate benefit but also create complications that emerge in Act II.

### 2. **Fairy Tale Logic**
*   Magic follows story rules—third time's the charm, true love's kiss, seven-league boots. Clever uses of fairy tale tropes solve problems.

### 3. **Consequences Manifest**
*   Every morally questionable act (stealing, lying, abandoning someone) creates an entry in consequences list. These come due in Act II.

### 4. **The Giant**
*   Unstoppable threat that can't be defeated by single heroes. Requires community cooperation, sacrifice, and accepting responsibility.

### 5. **Character Deaths**
*   Unlike many campaigns, major NPCs die in Act II-III. Must deal with loss and continue without them.

### 6. **Children's Wisdom**
*   Young NPCs (Red, Jack) have insight adults lack. Listening to them provides benefits.
