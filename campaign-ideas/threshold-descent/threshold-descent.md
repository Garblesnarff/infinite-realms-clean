# Threshold Descent
**"In the space between spaces, sanity is a luxury you can't afford."**

## Campaign Overview

The party awakens in a seemingly endless maze of yellowed wallpaper, buzzing fluorescent lights, and damp carpet that squelches underfoot. The air smells of mold and something indefinably wrong. There are no windows, no people, and no obvious way out. They have "noclipped" out of reality into the Backrooms—an infinite network of liminal spaces, abandoned offices, and impossible architectures that exist in the cracks of existence.

What starts as a desperate search for an exit becomes a journey through increasingly surreal and hostile levels of unreality. Level 0, the endless office space, is merely the threshold. Deeper levels contain stranger phenomena: pools of almond-scented water that attract faceless entities, dark colonies ruled by tyrannical survivors, mechanical labyrinths that shift and change, and eventually spaces so divorced from baseline reality that human consciousness begins to fray.

The party discovers they're not alone. Scattered groups of survivors—some lost for days, others for decades subjectively—have formed fragile communities in "safe zones." A mysterious organization called M.E.G. (Major Explorer Group) maps the impossible space and trades information for supplies. But trust is scarce, resources scarcer, and something is hunting through the levels. The Smilers watch from dark corners with luminous grins. The Hounds move through walls. And in the deepest levels, things worse than monsters await: the realization that the Backrooms may be alive, aware, and hungry.

## Core Themes

- **Liminality and Isolation**: Spaces designed for transition, now eternal prisons
- **Collective Survival Horror**: Resource scarcity forcing cooperation and hard choices
- **The Gradual Loss of Self**: Extended isolation eroding identity and sanity
- **Exploration vs. Safety**: Risk/reward of venturing deeper for escape
- **Found Communities**: Forming new families among the lost
- **Cosmic Indifference**: The Backrooms don't hate you; they're not designed for you at all

## Unique Mechanics

**Sanity System**
- Track mental stability on scale of 0-100
- Decreases from isolation, entity encounters, disturbing revelations
- Low sanity causes hallucinations, poor decisions, mechanical penalties
- Restored by finding communities, rest in safe zones, achieving goals
- Permanent loss if reduced to 0: character joins The Lost (NPC status)

**Noclip Syndrome**
- The longer in Backrooms, the less "real" baseline reality feels
- Mechanical effect: bonuses to navigate Backrooms, penalties to remember home
- Late-stage: can noclip between levels intentionally
- Terminal stage: become part of Backrooms, lose player control

**Resource Scarcity**
- Food and water extremely rare
- Almond water common but mildly addictive (increasing necessity)
- Equipment degrades, no way to fully repair
- Sleeping requires finding "safe" spaces (risky)
- Social encounters often revolve around resource negotiation

**Level Navigation**
- Each level has specific entry/exit conditions
- Some exits random, others require puzzles or knowledge
- Can accidentally noclip to dangerous levels
- M.E.G. maps provide advantage but are incomplete
- Wrong turns can lead to lethal levels

**Entity Encounter Tables**
- Different entities per level, some can travel between
- Awareness mechanics: most entities detect by sound/movement
- Avoidance often better than combat
- Some entities can be negotiated with (Smilers, Skin-Stealers)
- Boss entities require specific strategies

**Reality-Bending Items**
- Rare artifacts that break Backrooms' rules
- The Crimson Key: opens doors that don't exist
- Liquid Silence: makes you undetectable to entities for 1 hour
- Memory Ink: Write memories to prevent forgetting
- The Threshold Compass: points toward nearest exit (sometimes)

## Plot Twists and Complications

**Twist 1: Home Wasn't Real**

- They didn't enter Backrooms; they descended deeper
- True reality (if it exists) is unknown
- Existential crisis: what is real?

**Twist 2: The Lost Were Right**
- The Lost aren't mad; they've transcended
- They see Backrooms as evolution, not prison
- Escaping would be regression

**Twist 3: One Party Member is an Entity**
- Reveal that one PC is actually a Skin-Stealer or Smiler
- Has false memories of baseline reality
- May not even know they're not human

**Twist 4: The Backrooms Are Dying**
- The space is degrading, collapsing inward
- Eventually, all levels will compress to nothing
- Escape is urgent, but so is saving trapped souls
- Moral dilemma: save yourself or save everyone

**Twist 5: M.E.G. Is Preventing Escape**
- Organization discovered the exit years ago
- Suppressing information to maintain their power structure
- Without crisis, their authority collapses
- Party must decide: expose them or use their resources

**Twist 6: The Architect Is You**
- Time loop revelation: party member becomes Architect, creates Backrooms
- Their future self is responsible for their past suffering
- Breaking loop requires self-sacrifice or accepting destiny
- Cosmic horror: you are the monster
