# Threshold Descent: Creative Brief

## Art Style and Visual Tone

**Overall Aesthetic: Liminal Horror**

Threshold Descent embodies the unsettling aesthetic of transitional spaces—places designed for brief passage now frozen in eternal occupation. The visual identity draws from the internet phenomenon of "liminal spaces": empty offices, abandoned malls, hotel corridors at 3 AM. Everything feels familiar but wrong, mundane but menacing.

### Primary Visual Principles
- **Mono-yellow Dominance**: Level 0's signature yellowed wallpaper and carpet defines the base aesthetic
- **Fluorescent Uncanniness**: Harsh, buzzing lights creating pools of too-bright illumination and deep shadows
- **Architectural Repetition**: Endless identical rooms creating disorientation
- **Subtle Wrong-ness**: Details that don't quite make sense (doors to nowhere, windows showing same room)
- **Oppressive Emptiness**: Designed for people but devoid of life

### Color Palettes

**Level 0: "The Lobby That Never Ends"**
- **Mono-yellow** (#E4D96F): Walls, carpet, lighting—everything slightly jaundiced
- **Sickly Green** (#9ACD32): Fluorescent light tubes, water stains
- **Brown-Gray** (#8B7D6B): Carpet stains, dirt, decay
- **White Glare** (#FFFACD): Overexposed light reflections
- **Shadow Black** (#1C1C1C): Corners where light doesn't reach

**Level 1: "Industrial Decay"**
- **Concrete Gray** (#808080): Walls, floors, oppressive uniformity
- **Rust Orange** (#CD5C5C): Oxidizing pipes, water leaks
- **Chemical Green** (#00FF00): Almond water pools, biohazard lighting
- **Oil Black** (#0A0A0A): Shadows, the Hounds emerge from this
- **Hazard Yellow** (#FFFF00): Warning labels, caution tape

**Level 37: "The Poolrooms"**
- **Tile White** (#F5F5F5): Clean, clinical, disturbing in its perfection
- **Pool Blue** (#4682B4): Clear water that shouldn't exist here
- **Grout Gray** (#696969): Between tiles, the only imperfection
- **Reflection Silver** (#C0C0C0): Water surface, mirrors, disorienting
- **Depth Black** (#000033): Deep pool bottoms, unknowable

**Level 6: "Lights Out"**
- **Absolute Black** (#000000): No light, complete darkness
- **Phantom Gray** (#0D0D0D): Suggestion of shapes, maybe hallucinations
- **Touch Texture** (Visual representation through sound waves or distortion effects)

### Lighting Design Philosophy

**Level 0: Fluorescent Oppression**
- Constant buzzing hum, 60Hz flicker barely perceptible
- Too bright in some areas, creating harsh shadows elsewhere
- Occasional tube failures creating dangerous dark zones
- Light quality: cold, sterile, headache-inducing

**Deeper Levels: Progressive Darkness**
- Each level has less reliable lighting
- Level 1: Industrial work lights, many broken
- Level 5: Emergency lighting only
- Level 6: Complete darkness
- Omega: Impossible lighting (comes from nowhere, illuminates nothing)

**Entity Lighting**
- Smilers: Bioluminescent eyes/mouth in darkness
- Hounds: Reality distortion around them creates visual static
- Skin-Stealers: Appear in peripheral vision, gone when looked at directly

## Music and Sound Design

### Musical Themes

**Main Theme: "The Buzz"**
- Instrumentation: Processed field recordings of fluorescent lights, HVAC systems, electrical hum
- Layered with: Ambient drone, distant footsteps, the sound of empty spaces
- Feel: Oppressive, lonely, slowly maddening
- Reference: William Basinski's "Disintegration Loops" meets Halo's ambient tracks

**Descent Motif: "Going Deeper"**
- Each level has variation of same musical phrase, progressively deteriorating
- Level 0: Almost melodic electronic tones
- Level 5: Heavily distorted, barely recognizable
- Level Omega: Complete deconstruction into pure noise
- Represents: Loss of reality coherence as you descend

**The Lost Theme: "Forgotten Names"**
- Instrumentation: Reversed vocals, degraded recordings of familiar songs
- Feel: Melancholic, accepting, almost peaceful in its resignation
- Represents: Surrendering to the Backrooms, loss of identity

**Community Theme: "The Campfire"**
- Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar, harmonica, human voices
- Only non-electronic music in soundtrack
- Feel: Warm, hopeful, fragile
- Represents: Humanity persisting in inhuman space

### Ambient Soundscapes

**Level 0 Soundscape**
- Constant fluorescent buzz (can drive players actually crazy)
- HVAC white noise
- Own footsteps on damp carpet
- Occasional distant sounds (running water, slamming door, scream) that might be hallucinations
- The Hum: Low-frequency drone barely at hearing threshold

**Level 1 Soundscape**
- Dripping water echoing in concrete
- Pipe clanging and hissing
- Distant industrial machinery (that's never found)
- Scraping sounds in walls (the Hounds)
- Own breathing amplified in enclosed spaces

**Level 37 Soundscape**
- Water gently lapping at tile edges
- Perfect acoustics creating eerie clarity
- Own heartbeat becomes audible
- Splashing from empty pools
- High-pitched ringing (sanity drain audio cue)

**Entity Sound Design**
- **Smilers**: High-pitched giggling, static interference, teeth clicking
- **Hounds**: Reality tearing sounds, bass rumble, wet breathing
- **Skin-Stealers**: Footsteps that match yours, familiar voices calling, leather stretching
- **The Beast**: Subsonic roar felt more than heard, heavy footfalls that shake ground

### Dynamic Audio System

**Threat Proximity**
- Safe: Pure ambient, almost meditative
- Caution: Subtle musical elements introduce tension
- Danger: Sharp sounds, audio glitches, heartbeat percussion
- Entity Present: Music cuts out, hyper-realistic sound only

**Sanity Audio Cues**
- High Sanity: Clear, accurate audio
- Medium Sanity: Occasional audio glitches, phantom sounds
- Low Sanity: Reversed audio, voices in white noise, musical hallucinations
- Critical Sanity: Complete audio unreliability, can't trust what you hear
