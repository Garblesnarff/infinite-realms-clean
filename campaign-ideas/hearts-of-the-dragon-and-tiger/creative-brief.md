# Creative Brief: Hearts of the Dragon and Tiger

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Warm Romantic Comedy (Slice-of-Life Anime-inspired)

Inspired by the heartwarming and comedic visual style of romantic comedy anime like Toradora, this style captures the intimate, character-focused moments alongside the comedic exaggeration of emotions. The art balances realistic settings with expressive character reactions and the warm glow of romantic moments.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Expression and Emotion:** Characters should have highly expressive faces and body language, from comically exaggerated anger to tender vulnerability.
*   **Warm and Inviting Settings:** Even mundane locations should feel warm and lived-in, creating intimacy.
*   **Contrast of Reputation vs. Reality:** Visual cues should show the gap between how characters appear and who they truly are.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Heartwarming, comedic, bittersweet, intimate, slice-of-life, emotional, tender, genuine, awkward, domestic.
*   **Feeling:** A cozy, emotionally rich atmosphere where small moments matter immensely. The mood shifts between laugh-out-loud comedy and tender, vulnerable romance.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, defined lines for characters with occasional soft edges for romantic moments. Backgrounds are detailed but not overwhelming.
*   **Forms:** Characters are designed to show personality at a glance - Taiga is small but fierce, Ryuji looks intimidating but has kind eyes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A detailed anime-style illustration of a small halfling barbarian girl with long hair and fierce amber eyes, wearing school robes, standing defiantly with crossed arms. Despite her small size, her presence is commanding."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Warm, inviting colors dominate. Golden afternoon light, soft pinks and oranges for romantic scenes, cool blues for melancholy moments.
*   **Luminosity:** Natural lighting that emphasizes time of day and emotional tone - bright for comedy, soft for romance, cool for sadness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...bathed in warm, golden afternoon sunlight streaming through academy windows, creating a nostalgic and intimate atmosphere. The color palette features warm oranges, soft pinks, and gentle amber tones."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters should be instantly recognizable by silhouette and reflect their personality.
*   **Taiga "The Palmtop Tiger":** Small halfling with long chestnut hair, fierce amber eyes, carries herself with false confidence masking insecurity.
*   **Ryuji "The Dragon's Eyes":** Half-orc with sharp, intimidating eyes but a gentle demeanor. Dresses neatly despite his appearance.
*   **Supporting Cast:** Each designed to reflect their role - Kitamura is warm and approachable, Minorin is energetic and bright, Ami is beautiful but calculating.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A half-orc male teenager with sharp, intense eyes that make him look intimidating, but wearing a clean, well-maintained academy uniform and an apron, carefully arranging food. His expression is gentle and focused, contrasting with his fierce appearance."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Realistic but warm magical academy settings. Classrooms, hallways, the dining hall, apartments, and seasonal outdoor scenes.
*   **Atmosphere:** Should feel lived-in and authentic. Small details matter - a messy apartment showing loneliness, a well-kept tavern showing care.
*   **Details:** Seasonal changes are important - cherry blossoms in spring, beaches in summer, festivals in fall, snow in winter.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cozy but luxurious apartment interior, surprisingly messy and empty-feeling despite expensive furniture. Takeout containers on a low table, a single futon, large windows showing city lights. The scene conveys wealth but profound loneliness."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Natural, character-focused lighting that emphasizes emotion. Warm lighting for happy moments, dramatic lighting for confrontations, soft lighting for tender scenes.
*   **Shadows:** Gentle shadows that add depth without being harsh. Emotional scenes may use dramatic lighting contrasts.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting tells the emotional story - warm when characters are close, cold when they're distant.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by soft, warm indoor lighting and the cool blue glow of twilight through windows, creating a gentle contrast that emphasizes the intimate, bittersweet mood of the scene."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Character-focused compositions that emphasize relationships and emotions. Use distance and proximity to show emotional states.
*   **Techniques:** Close-ups for emotional moments, medium shots for interactions, wide shots to show isolation or togetherness. Use seasonal imagery symbolically.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A medium shot of two adventurers walking side by side through falling snow, close enough that their shoulders almost touch but not quite. The composition emphasizes their growing closeness while showing they haven't fully bridged the gap yet."

## Voice

**Taiga (The Palmtop Tiger):** A young, fierce female voice with a sharp edge that occasionally breaks into vulnerability. Defensive and aggressive when hiding feelings, soft and uncertain when being genuine. Prone to outbursts followed by embarrassed backtracking. Think: small but trying to sound big, fierce loyalty masked as annoyance.

**Ryuji (The Dragon's Eyes):** A young male voice that's surprisingly gentle and domestic despite his appearance. Patient, kind, with a practical streak. Gets flustered when dealing with emotional situations. Think: the responsible one, nurturing beneath a rough exterior.

**Narrator Voice:** Warm, knowing, and slightly playful. The tone of someone recounting a treasured memory. Gentle humor when describing comedic moments, tender during emotional scenes. Studio-quality, with the warm ambience of a story being told by firelight.
