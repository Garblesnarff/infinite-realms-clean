### Core Premise
In the magical academy city of Palmtop Heights, two unlikely adventurers form an alliance. Taiga "The Palmtop Tiger" is a fierce halfling barbarian with a fearsome reputation but a secret crush on the noble paladin Kitamura. Ryuji "The Dragon's Eyes" is a half-orc ranger mistaken for a delinquent due to his intimidating appearance, but he secretly adores the kind cleric Minorin. Despite their differences and initial conflict, they strike a deal: help each other win the hearts of their respective crushes. But as they work together, facing social challenges, misunderstandings, and their own insecurities, they begin to realize that the person they've been looking for might have been right beside them all along.

### Story Arc

- The campaign begins with both characters attempting to approach their crushes independently and failing spectacularly. After a heated confrontation in the academy dining hall, they discover each other's secrets and form their pact. They begin planning elaborate schemes to help each other, from organizing social gatherings to creating "accidental" encounters.

**Act 2: Growing Closer (Sessions 4-7)**
- As they execute their plans, things don't go as expected. The characters face various social challenges: a prestigious academy tournament, a winter festival, a summer beach quest, and the arrival of a beautiful transfer student (Ami) who sees through their facades. Through these events, they grow closer, learning about each other's pasts, insecurities, and true selves. They begin to question their original crushes.

**Act 3: The Heart's Choice (Sessions 8-10)**
- A major crisis forces both characters to confront their true feelings. Kitamura reveals he's leaving to pursue his own path with someone else.

Forces others to confront reality. **Flaw/Secret**: Her beauty has made her distrustful of everyone; she acts mean to protect herself.

### Key Locations

- **Palmtop Heights Academy**: A magical academy where young adventurers train. Has multiple districts for different classes and activities.
- **The Dragon's Eye Tavern**: Ryuji's home, run by his mother. A warm, welcoming place despite its rough exterior.
- **The Tiger's Den**: Taiga's luxurious but empty apartment. Reflects her wealth but also her loneliness.
- **The Festival Grounds**: Where major social events occur throughout the year.
- **The Snowy Bridge**: Where the final confession takes place during a dramatic snowstorm.

### Central Conflict
The struggle between who we think we should love and who we actually love. It's about overcoming social expectations, personal insecurities, and the fear of vulnerability to find genuine connection.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Affection Tracker**: Each major NPC has a hidden affection score toward each PC. Player actions during social encounters affect these scores. However, the DM should note that affection for Kitamura/Minorin caps at "Close Friend" while affection for each other can grow to "True Love."
- **Social Combat System**: Major social encounters (festivals, tournaments, confrontations) use a special resolution system where players make Persuasion, Insight, Performance, or Deception checks, but the outcomes affect relationships rather than dealing damage.
- **Tsundere Moments**: When Taiga tries to hide her true feelings, players can call for a "Tsundere Moment" - she must make a Deception check contested by observers' Insight. Failure results in her true feelings becoming obvious in a comedic way.
- **Domestic Life Mini-Games**: Cooking, cleaning, and other domestic tasks become skill challenges that build intimacy and trust between characters.
