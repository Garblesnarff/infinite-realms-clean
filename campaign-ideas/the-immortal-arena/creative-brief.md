## Environmental Storytelling

### Olympia Details
- Crystal cells beneath Colosseum showing previous "victors"
- Gods gambling openly with mortal souls as currency
- Servants are all half-dead mortals forced to serve
- Cracks in marble from divine civil wars

### Death Mark Progression
- First death: Small scar
- Multiple deaths: Spreading corruption, visible decay
- Near Hollowed: Eyes becoming empty, movements puppet-like
- Hollowed: Obvious undead appearance, no personality

### Patron Relationships
- Compatible gods' champions naturally ally
- Enemy gods' champions suffer penalties near each other
- Romantic gods send boons to attractive champions
- War gods ignore champions who avoid combat

### Arena Evolution
- Earlier realms pristine, later ones corrupted
- Gods' boredom makes arenas more lethal
- Corpses from previous tournaments still visible
- Each realm shows signs of divine manipulation

## Costume and Prop Design

### Champion Armor
- Reflects their culture and patron god
- Divine blessing visible as glowing elements
- Deteriorates with each death, must be divine-repaired
- Trophy items taken from defeated opponents

### Divine Boons
- Weapons glow with godly power
- Healing ambrosia in golden flasks
- Artifacts from mythology (Aegis shield, winged sandals, helm of invisibility)
- Temporary transformations (wings, divine strength, elemental powers)

### The Hollowed
- Armor fused to decaying flesh
- Multiple death wounds never healed
- Empty eye sockets or glowing void eyes
- Move in unnatural jerky motions

### Titan Design
- Impossibly large (50+ feet)
- Ancient, predating Olympian gods
- Chained with divine metal, scarred from eternal punishment
- Prometheus: Eagle-ravaged chest, defiant despite torture

### Death Marks
- Visible supernatural scars
- Glow faintly during resurrection moments
- Others can count your deaths by marks
- Some become badges of honor, others shame

This creative direction should evoke both the glory of mythological heroism and the horror of being entertainment for uncaring gods, culminating in the possibility of divine revolution.
