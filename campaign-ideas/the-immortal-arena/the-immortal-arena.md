# The Immortal Arena
**Tagline:** *Die with honor, rise in glory*

## Campaign Overview

In the celestial city of Olympia, the gods themselves host the Immortal Arena—a legendary battle royale where champions from across the mortal realm compete for divine favor, eternal glory, and the ultimate prize: ascension to godhood. Every century, one hundred warriors are chosen by the pantheon to fight in an ever-changing battleground that spans multiple planes of existence. These are not criminals or conscripts, but the greatest fighters, strategists, and heroes of their generation, each sponsored by a deity who grants them divine boons and watches their every move from the heavens.

The players are champions selected by the gods, blessed with supernatural abilities and driven by personal quests for glory, redemption, or divine ascension. Unlike mortal battle royales, death here is not always final—fallen warriors may be resurrected by their patron gods to fight again, but at a terrible cost to their humanity and sanity. The arena shifts between mythological landscapes, from the Elysian Fields to the depths of Tartarus, each with unique challenges and opportunities.

As the tournament progresses, players discover that the gods have their own games within games, using champions as pieces in celestial politics. The true victory may not be becoming a god yourself, but exposing the divine corruption and freeing mortals from their eternal entertainment.

## Core Themes

- **Glory vs. Honor:** Winning at any cost versus dying with dignity
- **Divine Manipulation:** Gods as capricious, using mortals as entertainment
- **Mortality and Resurrection:** The cost of dying repeatedly
- **Legacy and Legend:** Fighting to be remembered versus fighting to survive
- **Hubris and Humility:** The danger of believing in your own divinity
- **Free Will vs. Fate:** Can mortals escape the destiny gods have written?

## Unique Mechanics

**Divine Sponsorship System**
- Each player has a patron god who grants boons
- Players earn favor through combat style, entertainment value, and alignment with god's domain
- High favor = more frequent and powerful boons
- Low favor = god might abandon you or even sabotage
- Gods have relationships: enemies, allies, lovers
- Players' actions affect their gods' standing in pantheon

**Death and Resurrection**
- First death: resurrected by patron god, gain one Death Mark
- Each death: -1 to all ability scores (cumulative)
- After 5 deaths: risk of becoming Hollowed (lose agency)
- Death Marks visible to other champions
- Multiple deaths = physically scarred and mentally damaged
- Can be healed by rare divine artifacts
- After realm 3: death becomes permanent

**Divine Boons**
- Gift drops from patron gods during combat
- Types: weapons, healing, information, buffs, temporary powers
- Delivered by messenger (cherub, raven, elemental)
- Can be intercepted by other champions
- More spectacular combat = better boons
- Gods can send boons to non-sponsored champions if entertained

**Glory Points**
- Currency of the arena
- Earned through kills, impressive feats, style, drama
- Spent to request specific boons from patron
- Can be wagered in champion vs. champion duels
- Other champions can steal glory from corpses
- Displayed publicly via glowing aura around champion

**Favor Challenges**
- Gods issue challenges to all champions or specific ones
- "First to kill with fire magic wins artifact"
- "Champion who reaches mountain peak gains boon"
- Creates forced confrontations
- Refusing challenges loses favor
- Completing rival god's challenge might attract new sponsor

**Realm Hazards**
- Each realm has environmental dangers
- Gods control hazards and trigger them for entertainment
- Champions can learn to predict and use hazards
- Some artifacts grant resistance to specific realms
- Surviving hazards without combat still earns glory

**Alliance Politics**
- Formal alliances blessed by compatible gods
- Shared glory pool and combined boons
- But only one can win in the end
- Gods pressure champions to betray allies for entertainment
- Some gods forbid their champions from allying
