## Additional Lore and World History

### The Titanomachy (First Divine War)

- Zeus escaped, freed siblings
- Decade-long war between Titans and Olympians
- Olympians won with help of Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires
- Titans imprisoned in Tartarus
- Zeus became king of gods

**Relevance:**
- Titans still bitter, want revenge
- Prophecy patterns: Zeus now fears his own overthrow
- Same methods: he imprisons threats just like Kronos
- History repeating
- Champions might break the cycle

### Previous Tournaments

**The First Tournament (1,000 years ago):**
- Only 24 champions
- All died, no victor
- Zeus instituted rule changes
- Now 100 champions to ensure dramatic arcs

**Notable Past Victors:**
- Achilles (demigod, "ascended")
- Heracles (became minor god, different path)
- Theseus (escaped, hunted by gods, eventually caught)
- Jason (went mad, imprisoned)
- Atalanta (female victor, Artemis champion, imprisoned)

**Pattern:**
- Tournament every 100 years
- Usually one victor
- Never truly ascend
- Gods collect power from deaths

### Mortal World Impact

**Cults and Worship:**
- Different cultures worship different pantheons
- Tournament draws champions from all
- Winners become legends in their homelands

- Some mortals oppose gods, secret atheist movements
- Others worship fanatically

**Divine Intervention in Mortal Affairs:**

### The Prophecy (Complete Version)

**Full Text (hidden from most):**
"When gods feast on mortal suffering,
And death becomes their wine,
A champion bearing death's own marks
Shall break the throne divine.

Neither god nor mortal pure,
Tested in infernal flame,
Shall free the ancient ones in chains
And end the eternal game.

But beware the liberator's fate:
To free all, become the key,
Sacrifice the self divine
So all others may be free."

**Interpretations:**
- Zeus believes it means assassination
- Athena thinks it means reform
- Prometheus believes it means Titan liberation
- Might mean champion becomes new god
- Or sacrifices own ascension to end tournament
- Or literally dies to save everyone
- Players' choices determine true meaning

### Post-Tournament Futures

- Mortals remain entertainment
- Divine corruption worsens
- Eventually leads to apocalypse

**If Rebels Win:**

- Tournament abolished
- Mortals given more autonomy
- But divine power still exists
- Risk of new tyranny

**If Titans Win:**

- Others destructive
- Chaos in short term

**If Mortals Win:**
- Champions kill/imprison all gods
- Age of Mortals begins
- Magic fades from world
- Free but mundane
- Or mortals become new gods
- Cycle begins again

**The True Ending:**
- Break the cycle entirely
- Covenant between mortals and gods
- Mutual respect and cooperation
- Divine power used responsibly
- No tournament, no imprisonment
- Difficult but possible
- Requires sacrifice from both sides

This world provides layers of complexity where champions are pieces in games within games, but player agency can change the rules themselves.
