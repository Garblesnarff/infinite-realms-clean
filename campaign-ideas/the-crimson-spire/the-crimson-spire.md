---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Crimson Spire
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Siege / Vertical Combat / Martial Arts
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 5–7 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **7** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** relentless, escalating, martial-excellence, brutal, claustrophobic, visceral
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party, elite city guard members, raids a 30-story tower controlled by the crime lord Tama and his army of gang members. What should be a simple arrest becomes a nightmare when Tama seals the building and offers a reward to anyone who kills the party. Now trapped, they must fight their way up floor by floor through increasingly skilled opponents, with no backup and dwindling resources. Each level brings deadlier enemies and narrower spaces, culminating in facing Tama's top three enforcers and the crime lord himself at the peak.

*   **Escalating Difficulty:** Each floor's enemies are tougher than the last, culminating in legendary martial artists.
*   **Enclosed Spaces:** Combat happens in tight hallways, stairwells, and cramped apartments, limiting tactics.
