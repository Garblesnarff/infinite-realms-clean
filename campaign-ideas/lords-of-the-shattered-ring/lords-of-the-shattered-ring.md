**Core Premise (2-4 sentences):**
The party are Tarnished—exiles who lost the grace of the Erdtree and were banished from the Lands Between. They're called back by grace to seek the Elden Ring, which has been shattered by Queen Marika, plunging the realm into war as her demigod children fight over the Great Runes. The party must explore a vast open world, defeat the demigods to claim their Runes, and decide whether to repair the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord, serve the outer gods, or burn it all down. This is FromSoftware difficulty—death is frequent, bosses are brutal, and the world wants them dead.

## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 30-45 sessions)

A sprawling open-world journey through a broken land seeking godhood.

*   **Act I — The Lands Between (Sessions 1-15):** Awakened in the Chapel of Anticipation, die to the Grafted Scion tutorial boss (expected), and respawn in Limgrave. Learn the Erdtree's light has faded, the Elden Ring is shattered, and demigods have gone mad with power. Explore Limgrave, Stormveil Castle (Godrick the Grafted), Liurnia (Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon), and Caelid (Starscourge Radahn). Each demigod holds a Great Rune. Open world allows tackling in any order. Meet Melina, a mysterious maiden who offers to be their guide. Acquire Torrent (spectral horse) and explore freely.
*   **Act II — The Capital & the Mountaintops (Sessions 16-30):** After gathering two Great Runes, reach Leyndell, the Royal Capital. Fight through golden knights and face Morgott, the Omen King. Learn the terrible truth: Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring herself in grief/rebellion. Continue to Mountaintops of the Giants and the Flame of Ruin. Must commit the Cardinal Sin—burning the Erdtree with the Flame of Ruin. Melina offers to sacrifice herself, or the party can inherit the Frenzied Flame (chaos ending). Explore secret areas: Deeproot Depths, Mohgwyn Palace, Haligtree (Malenia, Blade of Miquella—hardest boss).
*   **Act III — The Erdtree & the Choice (Sessions 31-45):** With the Erdtree aflame, enter its interior. Fight through Farum Azula (a crumbling dragon temple outside time), defeat Maliketh (Death of the Demigods), and face the final gauntlet: Godfrey (the First Elden Lord), Radagon/Elden Beast (the god itself). After victory, choose the ending: Repair the Ring (Age of Order), Serve Ranni (Age of Stars), Embrace Frenzied Flame (Chaos), Serve the Dung Eater (Age of Despair), or others. Each ending fundamentally changes the world's future. The difficulty never relents—even the final boss is brutal.
