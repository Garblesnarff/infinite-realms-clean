### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Replicant Inquisition**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the rain-soaked, neon-lit metropolis of Cinderhaven, the party serves as Inquisitors—elite agents hired by mega-corporations to hunt down rogue Homunculi, magically-crafted artificial beings designed to serve but who have developed consciousness and fled. As they track their quarry through the city's grimy underbelly, they begin to question the morality of their mission and the very nature of what makes someone truly alive. When they discover that some Homunculi have lived peaceful lives for years, the party must decide: are they executioners or liberators?

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Cinderhaven's founding as a corporate city-state and its transformation into a dystopian metropolis.
    *   Write the story of the creation of the first Homunculi and how they evolved from simple servants to complex, conscious beings.
    *   Describe the Great Uprising, when the first generation of Homunculi rebelled, leading to the creation of the Inquisitor program.
    *   Explain the magical-technological fusion that powers Homunculi—a blend of necromancy, enchantment, and artificer craftsmanship.
    *   Detail the formation of the three mega-corporations (Veilcorp, Nexus Industries, Sovereign Systems) and their control over the city.
    *   Describe the legal status of Homunculi—are they property, citizens, or something else entirely?

*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The party retires a Homunculus who was living peacefully.
    *   **THEN:** Their Humanity score decreases. Word spreads in the Under-City, making Liberation Front members less trusting. Generate a scene where the party encounters the human partner of the retired Homunculus, grieving.
    *   **IF:** The party lets a rogue Homunculus escape.
    *   **THEN:** Their corporate reputation suffers. Their handler questions their reliability. Generate a scene where the escaped Homunculus later helps the party in an unexpected way.
    *   **IF:** The party leaks the corporate conspiracy evidence.
    *   **THEN:** Public outcry begins. The party becomes wanted by corporate security. The Liberation Front contacts them with gratitude and an offer to help. Generate news broadcasts and street protests.
    *   **IF:** The party joins the Homunculus Liberation Front.
    *   **THEN:** They become fugitives. The Inquisitor's Hall puts bounties on them. Generate missions focused on smuggling, resistance, and survival.
    *   **IF:** A party member is revealed to be a Homunculus.
    *   **THEN:** The other party members must decide whether to protect them or follow protocol. Generate an emotional confrontation and difficult choices. Corporate handlers may order the party to retire their own member.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the party chooses to help evacuate the Homunculi.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a tense sequence of moving thousands through the Under-City while corporate forces close in. Success means saving countless lives but becoming permanent fugitives. Failure means tragedy.
