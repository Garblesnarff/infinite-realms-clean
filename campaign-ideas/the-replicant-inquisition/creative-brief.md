# Creative Brief: The Replicant Inquisition

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Cyberpunk Noir (Blade Runner-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic aesthetic of *Blade Runner*, this style blends neo-noir detective fiction with dystopian cyberpunk elements. It aims to capture the rain-soaked, neon-lit, morally ambiguous world of Cinderhaven, where the line between human and artificial, justice and murder, is dangerously blurred.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Atmosphere and Mood:** Focus on rain, neon reflections, darkness punctuated by harsh light, and a pervasive sense of urban decay and moral ambiguity.
*   **Detail the Urban Environment:** Highlight towering megastructures, cramped street-level markets, holographic advertisements, and the contrast between corporate luxury and street-level squalor.
*   **Character Isolation:** Show characters as alone in crowds, isolated by rain and shadow, carrying the weight of difficult choices.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, cyberpunk, rain-soaked, neon-lit, dystopian, melancholic, existential, detective, morally ambiguous, corporate.
*   **Feeling:** A city that never stops but never progresses. Constant rain washing away sins that can never be cleansed. The beauty of neon lights reflecting in puddles, contrasted with the ugliness of what those lights illuminate. A sense of being watched, of secrets, of questioning what's real.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Sharp, defined forms for architecture and technology. Softer, more impressionistic treatment of rain, light, and shadow. Strong use of silhouettes.
*   **Textures:** Wet surfaces reflecting light, grimy concrete, sleek corporate metals, flickering holograms, worn leather coats.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of Blade Runner. Sharp architectural lines of a megastructure fade into rain and shadow. A lone figure in silhouette stands under a flickering neon sign."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by darkness with strategic use of neon colors—electric blues, hot pinks, toxic greens, and burning oranges. These neon colors reflect in wet surfaces, creating pools of color in the black.
*   **Accent Colors:** The warm amber of old incandescent lights, the cold white of corporate spaces, the red of danger or violence.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Light comes from neon signs, car headlights, holographic displays, and the rare glimpse of daylight through smog.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a predominantly dark scene illuminated by the electric blue and hot pink neon of advertisements reflecting in rain-slicked streets, with pools of warm amber light from street-level noodle shops."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic proportions with a strong emphasis on costume and silhouette. Humans and Homunculi should be visually indistinguishable—the difference is in their eyes, their subtle mannerisms.
*   **Inquisitors:** Long coats (often leather or treated fabric), worn but functional clothing, holstered weapons, detective tools. They look like they've seen too much.
*   **Homunculi:** Identical to humans in most cases. Occasionally show subtle tells—too-perfect skin, slightly unnatural movement, or eyes that reflect light strangely.
*   **Expression:** Characters often look tired, conflicted, wary. Rain on faces, steam from breath in cold air.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A weary Inquisitor in a long brown coat, rain dripping from the brim of their hat, standing in a neon-lit alley. Their face is half in shadow, expression conflicted and tired."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Massive vertical cities with towering arcologies disappearing into smog. Street level is cramped, crowded, wet, and alive with markets and activity. Upper levels are sleek, sterile, corporate.
*   **Atmosphere:** Always raining or just finished raining. Smog and steam obscure distances. Holographic advertisements everywhere, selling dreams to people who can't afford them.
*   **Details:** Flying vehicles in the distance, crowded noodle shops, trash-filled alleys, massive video screens, industrial ventilation systems pumping steam.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A rain-soaked street in Cinderhaven at night. Towering buildings disappear into fog above. Neon signs in multiple languages advertise pleasures and services. People with umbrellas crowd the narrow street."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High contrast noir lighting. Deep shadows with sharp pools of colored light. Light reflects off wet surfaces, creating secondary light sources.
*   **Shadows:** Long, dramatic shadows. Characters often half-lit, suggesting moral ambiguity and hidden truths.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting creates mood, suggests isolation, emphasizes the beauty in decay, and makes the familiar seem alien.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a flickering neon sign casting electric blue light across half the scene while the other half remains in deep shadow. Rain creates streaks of light falling through the darkness."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic framing inspired by film noir. Use of dutch angles for unease, low angles looking up at imposing structures, high angles making characters seem small and vulnerable.
*   **Techniques:** Frame characters through rain, neon signs, architectural elements. Use reflections in puddles and windows. Show the scale of the city dwarfing individuals.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A low-angle shot looking up at an Inquisitor standing in the rain, towering corporate buildings behind them disappearing into smog. The composition emphasizes their isolation and the overwhelming scale of the city."

## Voice

A gravelly, world-weary male voice, middle-aged, with the cynical tone of a film noir detective who's seen too much. The accent is neutral American with a hint of urban roughness—think 1940s detective movies transplanted to a dystopian future. Pacing is deliberate and slow, with meaningful pauses that carry weight. The emotion is melancholic resignation mixed with barely suppressed moral conflict—someone doing a job they're no longer sure is right. Audio quality is pristine but with a subtle layer of ambient city noise: distant rain, far-off traffic, the hum of neon signs. Role: An Inquisitor giving a case briefing or recording their private thoughts at the end of a long, morally exhausting day.
