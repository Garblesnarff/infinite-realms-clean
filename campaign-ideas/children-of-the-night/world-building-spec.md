### **World-Building Specification Brief: Children of the Night**

**1. Core Concept:**
The party, led by Van Helsing, hunts Count Dracula from Victorian London back to his Transylvanian castle, racing against time as the vampire turns the hunt against them.

**2. Lore & History:**
*   Detail Dracula's origins—Vlad the Impaler's transformation, centuries of existence
*   Explain vampire lore—weaknesses, powers, rules they must follow
*   Describe how vampirism works—the bite, the turning, the corruption
*   Write about Van Helsing's previous encounters with the supernatural
*   Detail Victorian society's reaction to supernatural threats they officially don't believe in

**3. Factions:**
*   **The Hunters** (Major) - Party plus Van Helsing, Harkers, other allies
*   **Dracula and His Spawn** (Major) - The vampire lord and his created vampires
*   **Victorian Society** (Minor) - Unaware of supernatural threat, potential victims
*   **The Church** (Minor) - Provides holy weapons and sanctuaries
*   **Renfield's Cult** (Minor) - Worshippers of Dracula

**4. NPCs:**
*   **Tier 1:** Count Dracula, Van Helsing, Mina and Jonathan Harker, Renfield, The Three Brides
*   **Tier 2 & 3:** "Vampire Spawn," "Charmed Victim," "Asylum Doctor," "Transylvanian Villager," "Wolf Under Dracula's Control"

**5. Locations:**
*   **Victorian London** - Civilized facade hiding gothic horror
*   **Carfax Abbey** - Dracula's ruined London lair
*   **The Asylum** - Where Renfield prophesies
*   **Transylvanian Wilderness** - Hostile journey
*   **Castle Dracula** - Gothic stronghold of ancient evil

**6. Causality:**
*   IF Dracula turns a party member THEN desperate race to cure them before full transformation
*   IF party destroys all Dracula's London lairs THEN forced to flee to Transylvania weakened
*   IF party delays too long THEN Dracula creates more vampires, spreads plague
*   IF party fails to reach castle before sunset THEN final battle at maximum difficulty
