### Core Premise
The players died and must undertake the perilous four-year journey through Mictlan's nine levels to reach their final rest. Each level presents unique deadly challenges: crossing rivers that cut like obsidian, escaping wind-demons that flay flesh, navigating mountains that crash together, surviving beast-haunted wilds, and more. They're guided by their psychopomp spirit dog (Xoloitzcuintli) but hunted by lords of death who test their worthiness. Along the way, they discover they carry something the death lords want - either artifacts, knowledge, or their very souls might hold power to shift the balance between life and death. They must survive all nine levels while deciding whether to complete the journey as intended or rebel against the cosmic order itself.

### Major NPCs

- **Mictlantecuhtli and Mictecacihuatl**: Lord and Lady of Death. **Role**: Ultimate Authority / Judges / Terrifying Gods. **Personality**: Skeletal, crowned with owl feathers and eyes, neither cruel nor kind - simply death itself. **Flaw/Secret**: They maintain balance but hunger for more; souls bring them power; they might be manipulated by correct offerings or challenged by brave heroes.

- **The Xolo Guide**: Spirit dog assigned to guide the dead. **Role**: Companion / Guide / Protector. **Personality**: Loyal, brave, knows the paths, but bound by cosmic law to follow rules. Each head (some Xolo have multiple) offers different advice. **Flaw/Secret**: Loves their human charge but will abandon them if they're unworthy; this heartbreak repeated countless times has made the Xolo both compassionate and resigned.

- **The Nine Trial Masters**: Demonic guardians of each level. **Role**: Obstacles / Tests / Agents of Death Lords. **Personality**: Vary by level - some bestial, some cunning, all implacable. **Flaw/Secret**: Each was once a soul who failed their trial and was enslaved to administer it; they might be freed or convinced to help.

- **Quetzalcoatl's Messenger**: Hidden agent of the Feathered Serpent. **Role**: Secret Ally / Quest Giver / Revolutionary. **Personality**: Idealistic, believes death's system can be improved, offers prohibited help. **Flaw/Secret**: Quetzalcoatl once stole bones from Mictlan to create humanity; the death lords have never forgiven this; helping humans threatens cosmic balance but might be morally right.

### Key Locations

- **First Level - Apanoayan (River Crossing)**: The widest river, crossed with help of the Xolo. Those without dogs drown eternally. Dark water, far shore barely visible. First test of faith and companionship.

- **Second Level - Tepectli Monamictlan (Crushing Mountains)**: Mountains that crash together, opening briefly. Timing and courage required. Bones of failed souls everywhere. Test of precision and nerve.

- **Third Level - Iztepetl (Obsidian Mountain)**: Mountain of razor-sharp obsidian glass. Must climb despite being flayed. The Xolo's paws bleed. Test of endurance and tolerance for pain.

- **Fourth Level - Itzehecayan (Place of Obsidian Wind)**: Freezing winds sharp as knives cut flesh from bones. Must find shelter and endure. Test of survival and resourcefulness.

- **Fifth Level - Paniecatacoyan (Place of Crossed Flags)**: Deceptive paths marked by false flags. Getting lost means wandering forever. Test of wisdom and perception.

- **Sixth Level - Timiminaloayan (Place of Arrows)**: Demons shoot arrows constantly. Must dodge or defend while progressing. Test of agility and combat.

- **Seventh Level - Teocoyocualloa (Place Where Wild Beasts Eat Hearts)**: Jaguars, eagles, and other sacred animals hunt souls. Must appease or defeat them. Test of respect for nature and strength.

- **Eighth Level - Izmictlan Apochcalolca (Place of Fog)**: Thick fog that causes loss of self. Souls forget who they were. Must remember identity through trial. Test of memory and self-knowledge.

- **Ninth Level - Chiconahuapan (Nine Waters)**: Final river before reaching Mictlantecuhtli's throne. After crossing, the journey ends - either in eternal rest or oblivion. The ultimate release.

### Central Conflict
The players must survive nine increasingly deadly trials while maintaining their humanity, identity, and purpose. They discover the death lords want something they carry, creating tension between completing the journey versus protecting what they hold. The central question: should they accept death's natural progression through the trials, or rebel against a system that might be unjust? The campaign explores themes of endurance, the meaning of worthy death, whether cosmic order can be questioned, and the price of defying death itself.

### Unique Mechanics

- **The Four-Year Journey**: Track time - the journey takes four years (compressed to campaign time). Spirits age and change. Creates dramatic pacing and shows transformation over time.

- **The Xolo Bond**: The spirit dog companion has its own health, loyalty, and abilities. Players must care for the Xolo. If it dies or abandons them, navigation becomes much harder. Emotional and mechanical bond.

- **Trial Scars**: Each level leaves permanent scars (mechanical and visual). By the end, characters are marked by their journey. This creates progression through damage rather than power.

- **Obsidian Blade Currency**: Obsidian pieces are the only tools and currency in Mictlan. Must be carefully managed. Weapons break, resources are scarce. Creates desperate resource management.

- **Fogbound Identity**: In certain levels, players forget aspects of themselves. Must piece together identity through roleplaying and memory tests. Creates psychological horror and character exploration.

- **Sacred Bundle**: Players carry a sacred bundle (artifact, knowledge, or spiritual cargo). The death lords want it. Protecting it adds complication to trials. What they carry determines campaign's ultimate direction.

### Victory/Defeat Conditions

**Total Victory**: Survive all nine trials, reach Mictlantecuhtli's throne, complete the journey with honor, and achieve proper rest. Alternatively, successfully rebel and change the system, earning a place between worlds or returning to life.

**Partial Victory**: Reach the ninth level but with heavy losses (party members permanently dead, Xolo lost, identity fragmented). Rest is achieved but at terrible cost.

**Heroic Sacrifice**: Players give up their journey to free others, protect the living world, or reform Mictlan's cruelty. They become legendary spirits who help future souls, finding purpose in eternal service.

**Defeat**: Fail a trial and become trapped in that level, either dying permanently or becoming enslaved as trial guardians for future souls. Alternatively, lose identity entirely in the fog, existing but not as themselves.
