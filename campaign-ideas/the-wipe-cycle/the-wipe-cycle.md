# The Wipe Cycle

*A Post-Apocalyptic PvP Survival campaign — Medium Campaign (12-15 sessions) — Very High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Wipe Cycle
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Post-Apocalyptic / PvP Survival / Base Building / Trust No One / Resource Wars
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 12-15 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **10**
**Tone (keywords):** brutal, paranoid, competitive, ruthless, post-apocalyptic, zero-to-hero
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party awakens naked on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island with nothing but a rock and a torch. This is the Wipe Cycle, a harsh world where resources are scarce, and other survivor groups will kill on sight to take what you have. To survive, the party must gather materials, craft weapons and armor, build a fortified base, and navigate the treacherous politics of warring factions—all while knowing that other players (rival groups) are doing the same. The island resets every lunar cycle (the "Wipe"), erasing all progress and forcing everyone to start over. The only way to escape the cycle is to find and activate the ancient Bunker Key before the next Wipe, a goal that will pit the party against every other faction on the island.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12-15 sessions)

A brutal race from nothing to dominance, culminating in a final conflict for the Bunker Key.

*   **Act I — Naked and Afraid (Levels 1–4):** The party starts with nothing. They must quickly gather stone, wood, and cloth to craft primitive tools and clothing. Every moment is dangerous: hostile wildlife, environmental hazards, and most of all, other survivor groups who will kill them for their resources. They establish a small, hidden base and begin hoarding supplies. They learn the harsh lesson: trust no one. They encounter their first rival faction and must decide whether to trade, ally, or attack.
*   **Act II — The Arms Race (Levels 5–8):** With better gear (metal tools, firearms), the party expands their base and begins raiding others for resources. They must defend against counter-raids, as rival factions target them. They discover clues about the Bunker Key, a legendary artifact that can end the Wipe Cycle. They form uneasy alliances or brutal rivalries with other factions (the Iron Fangs, the Red Skulls, the Rust Merchants). They begin to understand the island's layout and locate high-value resource zones (monuments, radtowns).
*   **Act III — The Final Wipe (Levels 9–10):** The party learns the Bunker Key is hidden in pieces across the island's most dangerous locations (the Launch Site, the Military Tunnels, the Power Plant). They must race against rival factions to gather all the pieces before the next Wipe. This leads to massive PvP battles, base sieges, and desperate alliances. In the final session, the party either activates the Bunker, escaping the island, or they fail and are caught in the Wipe, resetting to nothing (a tragic ending).

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — "The Beach"
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Rock Bottom Start
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party awakens on a rocky beach with nothing but a rock, a torch, and crude cloth wraps. They are level 1, starving, and vulnerable.
    *   They must quickly gather stone, wood, and hemp fibers to craft a stone hatchet and pickaxe. Punching trees and rocks deals damage.
    *   They encounter hostile wildlife (boars, wolves) and must fight or flee with primitive weapons.
    *   As night falls, the temperature drops. Without proper clothing or a fire, they take cold damage.
**Escalation:** The party spots another survivor group in the distance. Do they hide, approach peacefully, or ambush them for their resources?

### Sessions 2-4 — "Building the Base"
*   **Focus:** Base Construction / Resource Hoarding / First Conflict
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party gathers enough resources to build a small, hidden base (wood walls, a door with a lock, storage boxes).
    *   They must constantly gather food, water, and materials while avoiding more advanced players.
    *   They encounter the Iron Fangs, a powerful faction that demands tribute (resources) in exchange for not raiding the party's base.
    *   The party must decide: pay the tribute, refuse and risk a raid, or attempt to ally with a rival faction to counter the Iron Fangs.
**Escalation:** The Iron Fangs raid a nearby solo player's base, slaughtering them and taking everything. The party witnesses this brutality.

### Sessions 5-6 — "The First Raid"
*   **Focus:** Offense/Defense / PvP Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party either launches a raid on a weaker faction's base (to gain resources) or defends their own base from an attack.
    *   Raiding involves using explosives, lockpicks, or brute force to break through walls and doors.
    *   If defending, the party must use traps, fortifications, and coordinated tactics to repel attackers.
    *   The outcome determines the party's standing: success makes them a target, failure leaves them vulnerable.
**Escalation:** A powerful faction (the Red Skulls) takes notice of the party's success and marks them for elimination.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Ironclad — The Warlord** — *Leader of the Iron Fangs*
    *   **Role:** The dominant faction leader, a ruthless tactician who controls the island's best resource zones.
    *   **Personality:** Brutal, pragmatic, and utterly merciless. He respects strength and despises weakness. He will make deals but only if they benefit him.

2.  **Ash — The Merchant** — *Leader of the Rust Merchants*
    *   **Role:** A neutral trader who sells rare items and information in exchange for resources.
    *   **Personality:** Slippery, sarcastic, and always looking for an angle. She plays all factions against each other to maximize profit.

3.  **The Red Skull Berserker** — *Champion of the Red Skulls*
    *   **Role:** A terrifying solo raider who serves the Red Skulls, known for wiping entire bases alone.
    *   **Personality:** Silent, brutal, and seemingly unstoppable. They wear the skulls of their victims and are feared across the island.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about survival in a world where everyone is an enemy. It captures the brutal PvP loop of *Rust*: gather, build, raid, defend, and dominate. The central conflict is the party's struggle to climb from absolute nothing to a position of power, all while navigating the treacherous politics of warring factions and the constant threat of being wiped out (both by other players and the Wipe Cycle). Trust is a rare commodity, and betrayal is always a heartbeat away.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Wipe Cycle**
*   Every 12-15 in-game days, the island undergoes a Wipe. All player-built structures, hoarded resources, and non-equipped gear are destroyed.
*   Characters retain their levels and knowledge but must start over with nothing.
*   This creates urgency: the party must find the Bunker Key before the next Wipe or lose everything.

### 2. **Crafting Under Pressure**
*   Resources are scarce and heavily contested. Every gathering trip risks PvP combat.
*   Key crafted items: Stone tools (basic survival), Metal tools (better efficiency), Firearms (combat advantage), Explosives (raiding), Armor (protection).
*   Crafting requires workbenches, which must be built and protected in the base.

### 3. **Base Building & Raiding**
*   Bases are the party's lifeline. They store resources, provide shelter, and offer respawn points (sleeping bags).
*   Bases can be raided by other factions using explosives, lockpicks, or brute force.
*   Defenses include: traps (bear traps, landmines), fortified walls (stone, metal), and strategic placement (hidden locations, high ground).

### 4. **PvP Faction Dynamics**
*   The island is home to multiple NPC factions (Iron Fangs, Red Skulls, Rust Merchants) with shifting alliances and rivalries.
*   The party can ally with factions (gaining resources and support), betray them (stealing resources, raiding), or remain neutral (risky, as everyone is a potential enemy).
*   Faction reputation affects how NPCs react: allies may trade or help in raids, enemies will attack on sight.

### 5. **Scarcity & Desperation**
*   Food, water, and ammunition are always in short supply. The party must constantly scavenge.
*   Dying means respawning at the base (if a sleeping bag is placed) but losing all equipped gear. Corpses can be looted by enemies.
*   This creates high-stakes tension: every fight could mean losing hours of progress.
