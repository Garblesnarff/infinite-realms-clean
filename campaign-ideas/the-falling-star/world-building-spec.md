**Project Deflection**: Engineers and transmutation wizards attempting to change asteroid's course through massive magical ritual

**Project Destroyer**: Military led by General Aegis, plan to blow up asteroid with magical bombs (risky)

**The Space Fleet**: Artificers and pilots creating vessels for space travel, led by Captain Navigator

**Lunar Survivors**: Ancient civilization remnants living on moon, know Colossus history, led by King Cosmos

## NPCs

Dr. Celeste Stargazer (discoverer, brilliant), General Aegis (military commander), Prophet Starlight (cult leader, corrupted), Artificer Orbit (inventor of space tech), Captain Navigator (astronaut guide), King Cosmos (lunar ruler), The Starborn Colossus (cosmic titan prisoner)

## Locations

**Celestial Observatory**: Where asteroid discovered, mission control

**Orbital Platform**: Edge of atmosphere, launch site for space missions

**The Moon**: Ancient ruins, lunar base, gravity 1/6th normal, beautiful and alien

**The Asteroid**: 50-mile crystal prison, interior caverns, titan at core

**Space**: Void between worlds, cosmic entities, debris fields, physics-defying

**Impact Bunkers**: Underground shelters if all fails

## Countdown & Escalation

**Day 100**: Discovery, initial panic
**Day 80**: Solutions proposed, resources gathered
**Day 60**: Space missions begin
**Day 40**: Reached asteroid, discovered Colossus
**Day 20**: Final preparations, social collapse
**Day 10**: Launch final mission
**Day 1-0**: Confrontation and resolution

## The Starborn Colossus

Ancient cosmic entity that consumes planetary matter for sustenance. Imprisoned eons ago, launched to space. Prison failing, steering home for revenge. Incomprehensibly powerful, alien intelligence, can be negotiated with but difficult. Not evil, just hungry and angry.

## Solutions

**Destroy**: Massive magical bomb detonates asteroid (might free Colossus anyway)
**Deflect**: Change course via ritual (complex, requires sacrifices)
**Repair Prison**: Fix crystal containment (someone must stay as jailer)
**Negotiate**: Convince Colossus to leave (hard diplomacy, alien mind)
**Evacuate**: Save some people (can't save everyone, tragic choice)

## Endings

Success variants: Asteroid destroyed/deflected, prison repaired, Colossus negotiates away
Failure variants: Impact destroys world, Colossus freed and feeding, scattered survivors
